 Lettuce for the prosecution: Chicago attorney Charles Biggam was outraged when 
he read that defense attorney Leslie Abramson was soliciting funds from the 
public for the murder retrial of onetime Beverly Hills resident Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggam asserted that the defense of Erik and Lyle Menendez in the first trial 
for the shotgun killings of their parents was of the "butcher-is-a-victim" 
variety . . . "preposterous sophistry" that "could only be accepted as sensible 
by judges and jurors in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney even went so far as to speculate that Angelenos may be addled by 
exposure to the sun, commenting, "The absence of spring, fall and winter must 
truly exact a dear price." 
</P>
<P>
 Not content to offer words alone, Biggam sent the office of Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti a check for $50, terming it "my contribution to the Menendez 
Prosecution Fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the financially strapped district attorney's 
office, said: "We're keeping the money."

 As an artistic disaster, its magnitude was 9.5: KTLA (Channel 5) is pitching 
tonight's rerun of "Earthquake" (1974) by saying, "We all felt it (the Jan. 17

 Actually, this L.A. doomsday film is an unintentional laugh riot, with its 
phony scenery and soap opera-ish plot, which includes Ava Gardner playing the 
daughter of Lorne Greene. She was actually all of seven years younger than 
Greene.

<P>
 The movie ends with a quote from Lloyd Nolan's character, who surveys what's 
left of the City of Angels and observes: "This used to be a helluva town."

 L.A. milestones: One hundred and twelve years ago Wednesday, The Times ran an 
article entitled "Police Pickings," which reported: "There were four nymphs du

with violating a city ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Our thanks to historian Ralph Shaffer for sending us that story, as well as a 
subsequent clipping revealing that the women "were fined $20 apiece for 
carrying on their business." 
</P>

 Some things never seem to change. Of course, such nymphs have long since moved 
their business away from Los Angeles Street to more prosperous areas, such as 
the paves du Hollywood.

SCOTT HARRIS: GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER, 42% OF THE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the homicide detectives arrived, Tom MacDowell's friends offered a 
lukewarm greeting. It's been a year since Tom's murder, after all, and still 
there is no arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Gil Sotelo, Bruce Cohen and a dozen other old pals staged this 
unusual press conference one recent evening in North Hollywood, not far from 
the hedge where Tom's BMW rolled to a stop. Tom was found inside, dead from a 
gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives theorize that MacDowell, a budding filmmaker who tended bar at 
a comedy club, was killed by a robber who wanted his car. The friends don't buy 
it. They suspect that Tom was murdered because he was an honest man who got 
mixed up with some of Hollywood's shadier characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police want to make it out to be a carjacking," Sotelo said. "For some 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 "A carjacking," Cohen muttered, "is easier to sweep under the rug." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand their frustration. It's also easy to believe Los 
Angeles police Detectives Oscar Carballo and Jim Rahm, who say they have 
dutifully pursued every lead, to no avail. Tom MacDowell's murder may be the 
stuff of a whodunit or just more proof that Los Angeles is the carjacking 
capital of the world. But this much is no mystery: Getting away with murder is 
a lot easier than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 You could look it up. Thirty years ago, according to the FBI, police in the 
nation's cities solved more than 90% of murders. The "clearance rate" has 
fallen steadily since. In 1992, it was down to 65% nationwide and 58.2% for the 
LAPD. How soon before a killer's chances of getting away becomes an even bet? 
</P>
<P>
 These sad statistics should be remembered every time you hear someone say that 
the public has exaggerated the crime problem. A recent ABC News special titled 
"Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?" highlighted Justice Department data 
showing that during the last 20 years, the overall crime rate has dropped about 
25% and that violent crime is down about 2%. In a similar spirit, the Los 
Angeles Times Magazine on April 10 featured "Crime and Embellishment," in which 
writer Katharine Dunn noted: "The number of murder victims . . . is a very tiny 
percentage of our huge population, less than 0.001% of the total population per 
year. Fewer than suicides. Far fewer than those killed in motor vehicle 
accidents." This is Dunn, not Donne. Ask not for whom the bell tolls -- it's 
just part of that unlucky 0.001%. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in Los Angeles, national statistics offer little comfort. In Los 
Angeles County, guns kill more people than traffic accidents. Concern over 
crime isn't a reaction to the tragedy of Polly Klaas or TV shows like "COPS." 
It's a reaction to your own brush with crime or the robbery that occurred down 
the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who soft-pedals the crime problem would be wise to look up The Times' 
1990 series "Justice in Distress" by David Freed, which showed the impact on 
L.A. courts and police -- how burglaries go uninvestigated, how the courts have 
become plea-bargain mills, and how some crimes that are felonies elsewhere are 
handled as misdemeanors here. Alas, the public sighed and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of fingerprint computers and DNA analysis, why are more killers 
getting away with it? Once, detectives were fairly safe in assuming that a 
victim knew his killer, narrowing the field of suspects. Today, the perpetrator 
is very likely to be a stranger. Another reason is that law enforcement is 
spread so thin. The LAPD of today is only a fraction larger than it was in the 
early '70s, but we're averaging twice as many homicides, more the 1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now is there a response, in ways smart and dumb. Mayor Richard Riordan's 
efforts to finance more police are long overdue. "Three strikes" legislation, 
meanwhile, will back-load billions into prisons and prison guards that could 
more wisely be invested in education, juvenile crime programs, police and 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Tom's friends may be cynical, but Detectives Carballo and Rahm were 
grateful for the press conference last week at the corner of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard and Hesby Avenue. One of their biggest problems, Carballo says, is 
that people don't want to get involved. Tom's friends, however, have increased 
the reward money from $30,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends are suspicious because they found some tape recordings Tom had 
secretly made of his business dealings. Carballo and Rahm say they checked it 
out. Now the detectives find themselves waiting for a tip -- the phone call 
that might solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need every little bit of help we can get," said Carballo. ". . . I know 
people think we get callous. But I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing bothers a detective more than an unsolved case," his partner added. 
"They eat at you after a while."

NEW WORLDS FOR OUR DAUGHTERS; MILLIONS OF GIRLS ARE GOING TO WORK WITH PARENTS 
OR SPONSORS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today millions of American parents will leave for work with more than their 
lunch pails or briefcases; they will have their daughters in tow. It's the 
second annual "Take Our Daughters to Work Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Ms. Foundation, the daylong event is something between a 
field trip for girls 9 to 15 years old and a grand goodwill gesture by the 
sponsoring employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind Daughters Day is simple yet powerful. Psychologists have found 
that the self-esteem of girls, on a par with that of boys in elementary school, 
plummets as they enter teen age. As their confidence in their abilities 
suffers, so does their sense of career options. Daughters Day is a 
well-intended if self-conscious effort to teach by example, to show 
impressionable girls what women in the work force can do, to inspire them when 
they most need inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 1 million girls spent the day at the elbow of parents or 
sponsors gaining insight into the work life of commodity traders, police 
officers, bus drivers, telephone installers, lawyers and many other 
professionals and tradespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the experience was highly positive for the girls as well as 
for their mentors. This year's plans are more elaborate, involving triple the 
number of girls and tens of thousands of sponsoring corporations and 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But could Daughters Day become a victim of its own success? The once-faint 
rumblings from boys who understandably covet such lavish attention have grown. 
This occasion was meant to bolster girls at a vulnerable moment, with no slight 
to boys intended. Even so, the boys' demand could well evolve into a kind of 
"Take a Child to Work Day." If that happens, deserved focus on the special 
needs of pre-teen and teen-age girls would be lost, regrettably. All things 
considered, it might be better to schedule a separate special day at work for 
the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The worlds of work and family too long have been disconnected, and American 
children -- indeed, American families -- have been much the poorer as a result. 
Welcoming girls, and perhaps eventually boys, into the workplace can be as much 
an education for grown-ups as for the kids.

IMMIGRATION AID CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The editors of The Times seem horrified that Congress is considering 
proposals that will require people who sponsor immigrants to actually honor 
their commitments ("Stop Attacking Easy Targets," April 14). It is an idea that 
The Times considers "ridiculous" and "grossly unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Isn't the purpose of our immigration laws to prevent people 
from other countries coming here and becoming a financial burden? Isn't the 
sponsorship of a relative a contract that the American people have every right 
to expect will be honored? Isn't the fact that the Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) rolls have been quadrupled over the last decade by elderly parents whose 
immigrant children promised to care for them, "ridiculous" and "grossly unfair" 
to the American taxpayer? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of urging the California congressional delegation to seek more 
(borrowed) federal money to compensate the state for immigration-related costs, 
you ought to be asking why we continue to have an immigration policy that has 
become a financial burden at all levels of government. The question is not 
which level of government should be paying for welfare for immigrants, but 
rather why any level of government should pay for people who have sponsors and 
who promised that they would not become public charges. 
</P>
<P>
 California needs less immigration, not more federal welfare money.

<P>
 * The Clinton Administration's plans to fund its so-called welfare reform 
program (April 12) by cutting benefits to legal immigrants is like robbing the 
poor to take care of the poor. The Administration proposes to fund the program 
by prolonging the period of time before disabled and elderly immigrants can get 
help from the SSI program. SSI provides monthly benefits of up to $446 for 
indigent individuals and $669 for couples who are blind, disabled or elderly 
and ineligible for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not go where the money is? Why not get it from those who can spare it 
without suffering? I mean the Pentagon, which is loaded, and by restoring the 
1980 level of income taxes on the rich and the corporations. Our nation has 
lost an average of $88 billion a year since the drastic cuts in tax rates on 
the wealthy and the corporations during the Reagan years.

 * Re "The Welcome Mat Is Threadbare," Commentary, April 13: 
</P>
<P>
 Yeh Ling-Ling's astonishing opinion piece illustrates the level of ignorance 
and naked racism that propels anti-immigrant forces to push a few yuppie 
immigrants to rail broadly against immigrant Asians and Latinos. Yeh tries to 
create a rational case against immigrants, but succeeds only in laying bare an 
agenda rooted in scapegoating. Yeh should look to U.S.-based multinational 
corporations that export manufacturing jobs as the real culprits for national 
decline. High-tech immigrants bring with them their education, which doesn't 
cost the American taxpayer a dime. Also, many of them are temporary, and she 
doesn't recognize the fact that historically immigrants also reverse-immigrate, 
like the Italians who came over at the turn of the century to return to Italy 
decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular accounts, low-tech jobs are not in decline, but are 
booming. For the most part, "low-skilled" immigrants do not compete with "poor 
minority workers" (code for African Americans) because African American workers 
have fought too long and too hard to accept the awful working wages and 
conditions imposed on immigrants in certain industries. Employers leverage 
immigration status and language to justify paying their workers as low as 
possible. This is only possible when U.S. labor laws are not being enforced by 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 If we could take a moment to stop bashing immigrants and start re-examining 
the way our economy really works and the way corporations, anti-immigrant 
organizations, and domestic policy interact to create problems, we will go a 
long way from the phony conclusions and accusations against immigrants. Yeh 
should take the fight to the real enemies of our quality health care, our 
environment and our jobs, and leave honest working people alone.

 * Yeh's comments are the most sensible, practical and intelligent I have seen 
in a long time on the future of immigration in this country. It's about time 
someone isn't using "human rights" as a basis for our immigration policy. Let's 
begin to think about what is good for ourselves, for a change, and not what is 
good for everybody else that happens to want to come to the United States! It's 
a shame that the idiots that we call our Congress can't see this simple fact!

Guccione failed to make: Cobain had more passion for his art -- music he should 
have abandoned if he couldn't tolerate the fame that went with it -- than he 
felt for Courtney Love or his daughter.This is narcissism, an essential

STANDING UP FOR MIRANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous decision this week restating the rules for 
use of the so-called Miranda warning broke no new legal ground. Rather, the 
strong opinion is notable for the justices' repudiation of a poor decision 
handed down last year by the California Supreme Court and for their rebuke to 
the police officers and prosecutors in the case at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The California case centered on the murder of Robyn Jackson, 10, who 
disappeared from a Baldwin Park playground on Sept. 28, 1982; her body was 
discovered the next morning. Soon afterward, police officers went to the 
trailer of Robert Stansbury, an ice cream truck driver the girl was seen 
talking with before she vanished. Police considered him a possible witness, not 
a suspect, and asked him to go to the police station to answer questions. 
Stansbury agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1966, the Supreme Court has required that individuals taken into custody 
be issued a warning that includes notice they have the right to remain silent, 
that their words may be used against them and that they have the right to have 
an attorney present during questioning. Without such a warning, no evidence 
obtained in an interrogation may be used against an accused. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning, Stansbury said that on the night of the murder he had 
driven an automobile matching the description of the car from which a witness 
saw the child's body dumped. After he disclosed he had been convicted of rape, 
kidnaping and child molestation, the police read Stansbury his Miranda rights 
and charged him with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansbury then tried to suppress his statements. He eventually was convicted 
in the Baldwin Park case, and the jury determined that he should be executed. 
The trial court ruled that Stansbury was not "in custody" -- and thus not 
entitled to a Miranda warning -- until he mentioned his use of the car. The 
California Supreme Court agreed but, this week, the U.S. Supreme Court did not. 
The U.S. court emphatically and correctly reminds judges and law enforcement 
officials that custody depends on the objective circumstances of the 
interrogation, not the subjective views of those present. Even in the 
prosecution of heinous crimes, basic constitutional rights cannot be abridged.

THE ULTIMATE VERDICT RESTS WITH HISTORY; ONLY IN YEARS TO COME MAY THE FULL 
STORY OF RICHARD NIXON BE KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, by his own choice, the final honors and tributes that are due a 
former President were rendered to Richard Nixon in Yorba Linda, in suburban 
America, far away from the nation's capital, where the whole of his often 
tumultuous public life had been spent and where the scene of his greatest 
humiliation was played out. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his fall from office and grace two decades ago Nixon would speak often 
of his belief in the American dream and hold up his own success in his chosen 
vocation as proof that the dream was real. It was crowd-pleasing rhetoric, yes, 
but it was also a statement of proud conviction growing out of his own modest 
roots and the belief in the rewards of unremitting hard work that he had been 
taught from childhood. Whatever insecurities and deep hurts may have plagued 
his life and helped shape his character, Nixon in the end did win much and 
accomplish much. Whatever violence he did ultimately to his oath of office, 
there can be no doubt he came to that office determined to use its powers to 
seek a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary judgments on public figures seldom prove enduring. Our Presidents 
especially are subjected to constant analysis and re-evaluation. As the 
perspective of generations changes, as new archival evidence becomes available, 
as posthumous memoirs fill in missing details and elucidate obscure events, 
reputations often rise and sink and sometimes rise again. Nixon certainly will 
be one of those Presidents about whom a final consensus promises to be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 His life as a public man, from his successful campaign for the House in 1946 
through his aborted second term as President, was almost never free from 
contentiousness. In all that time few politically aware Americans could pretend 
to be neutral on Nixon. In millions, he inspired sincere admiration and 
respectful, sometimes even reverent approval and appreciation. In millions of 
others, he aroused an almost visceral loathing. When he was driven from office 
in 1974 by the threat of impeachment fewer than one American in four said they 
still thought well of the man who had been overwhelmingly reelected less than 
two years earlier. But events recede and memories fade. The decades in 
retirement -- the better part of a generation that has passed since Nixon left 
Washington in disgrace -- saw his reputation considerably restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Objective assessments about Nixon are inevitably made harder by the 
controversy that seemed always to accompany his ascent to power and then his 
fall. The character of the politician, with its many grievous flaws, 
unavoidably casts a long shadow over the record of his presidency, with its 
many admirable achievements. His Administration, as the Watergate scandal and 
the Oval Office tapes would reveal, may have contained a higher proportion of 
scoundrels than any since Warren G. Harding's. But that same Administration 
also enlisted a large number of gifted, patriotic, clear-thinking policy-makers 
and doers who were a credit to their country -- and to the man who asked them 
to serve under him. Rightly, much attention has been given to the Nixon 
Administration's global vision and its sure hand in the conduct of foreign 
relations. The domestic policies of that Administration, many of them far more 
progressive and beneficial than critics at the time were willing to 
acknowledge, deserve greater attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been able to finish his second term Nixon might well have left an 
enviable record of domestic and international accomplishment. Instead the 
record was left incomplete, cut short by his own act of political 
self-destruction. How that came about is generally known; why it happened in 
many respects remains a puzzle. No doubt many answers lie in the tens of 
thousands of pages of White House papers and the hundreds of hours of tapes 
that Nixon fought for 20 years to keep from public scrutiny. With the central 
figure in that enormous cache now laid to rest, it's time to open the records 
and let them shed what light they can on some of the most dramatic years of 
U.S. history.

'DEADBEAT' PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article about "deadbeat" dads (April 17) provides insight that 
sometimes there are also deadbeat moms. In California where there is no-fault 
divorce, each marriage partner has the right to end the marriage; however, 
there is no corresponding legal requirement of joint financial responsibility 
attached to this mutual privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wife of a non-custodial father, I am required by the state to share my 
income in support of his children at the expense of our children. Why can't she 
work as I do, and be somewhat financially responsible? 
</P>
<P>
 I feel robbed, our kids suffer, all kids suffer and the state sanctions this 
action by continuing to pay deadbeat moms to not work while collecting the 
difference from the people who play by the rules. This stinks!

 * In the article on deadbeat dads and welfare, 23-year-old David Misterka (the 
father of a 2-year-old) complains: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the woman's decision to keep the baby or have an abortion. Guys don't 
have any control." They sure as hell do! They can say "no," or is he claiming 
men are too weak for that? 
</P>
<P>
 David -- it's real simple: Keep it in your pants or get a vasectomy. Either 
way, you've got plenty of control. The question is, are you strong enough to 
use it?

PLATFORM; THE U.N.'S DEMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. MAHER HATHOUT, senior adviser to the Muslim Public Affairs Council, 
comments on the wider effects of the suffering of Gorazde. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The siege of Gorazde will leave a profound effect on Bosnia. While some will 
weep over this indecency, others will be angered, like the world's 1 billion 
Muslims, who will express their frustration in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations, as an organization that has any potential for 
representing, let alone implementing, the collective will of the family of 
nations, is no more. It is buried under the rubble of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations is a wasteful organization with an enormous budget that was 
disgracefully used by the U.S. government to punish Saddam Hussein, who is 
still alive while Iraqi children starve. The United Nations is now used as a 
shelter for the Serbs in the second major genocide of our century. 
</P>
<P>
 While we close the lid on the coffin of the United Nations, we should eulogize 
a few other victims: The U.S. role as a claimed leader of an alleged Free 
World, and the principles of law, order and human decency.  
</P>
<P>
 Let us be aware, then, that when we leave aggression unchecked, we ransom over 
new generations to victimization. We took a huge debt on our moral budget, and 
now we are in deficit.

PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME IN L.A.; FACE IT: EVERY ONE OF US IS AT RISK; DAVID 
FALCONER'S MURDER STRIPS THE ILLUSION FROM STATISTICS; THE WHOLE CITY IS 
BECOMING ONE LEVEL, BLOODY PLAYING FIELD.

 The hold-up murder of choirmaster David John Falconer last week outside a Los 
Feliz convenience store brings Los Angeles to a new level of consciousness in 
the current crisis of violent crime in this beleaguered city. Just as the 
Northridge earthquake affected everyone equally, regardless of color, 
occupation, income or address, these days, every one of us in Los Angeles is 
equally liable to being cut down by murderous strangers.  
</P>
<P>
 I know the riposte: Why, you ask, should the murder of one white man -- a 
choirmaster with a doctorate in music from USC, a beloved teacher, a gentle, 
caring soul -- be considered any worse than the gunning down each weekend of a 
dozen less-privileged Angelenos, the majority of them people of color?  
</P>
<P>
 Precisely! The murder of anyone, the brutal termination of a human life, is 
equally heinous. But have we not, in considering the statistics of who is 
murdered, and where, concealed the universal implications of this crime wave? 
We say: Most people killed in Los Angeles are people of color. In saying this, 
we delude ourselves that random murder is an ethnic affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In and behind such grasping at statistical illusions is an implied argument, 
perhaps even a desperate hope. If murder is a matter of ethnic identity, then 
in Los Angeles, the most de facto segregated city in the nation, being at risk 
is a matter of residence and choice: Avoid certain neighborhoods, certain kinds 
of people, and you significantly decrease your chances of being a murder 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistical comfort of living in one part of the city or another, or of 
merely being in one part of the city or another, has now, in the slaying of 
David Falconer, forced an acknowledgment of a reality about which Angelenos 
prefer not to talk: our universal vulnerability. Soon, very soon, it will not 
matter who you are, or what your color is, or where you live. The very fact 
that you are in Los Angeles will overwhelm all other statistical odds as the 
playing field, the killing ground, becomes increasingly level. Gangbanger or 
choirmaster, you will be equal before the terror. 
</P>
<P>
 It was debilitating for us to see crime as something happening in someone 
else's neighborhood. Now we face an equally debilitating notion in our 
impending acknowledgment of universal vulnerability. If crime in Los Angeles is 
one vast Lotto game with everyone given an equally empowered number, then we 
will begin to play the odds against each other. We will look across the table 
at dinner parties, we will look to the next desk at our office, we will glance 
out of the corner of our eye at the person sitting next to us in the movie 
theater, and we will ask: Who's next? You? Me? The guy across the room? Each 
Angeleno will regard the other's vulnerability as a way of lowering one's own 
statistical probabilities for being a murder victim. This will result in a 
social and psychological solipsism -- a defensive self-centeredness based on 
the most fundamental motivation of all, fear in the face of a threat to 
survival -- that will do great damage to the moral and civic fabric of Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with this new insight, Angelenos might be tempted to comfort themselves 
with another statistical delusion. The odds, they will argue, still rest mostly 
on ethnic identity and place. True, as far as statistics go. 
</P>
<P>
 But apart from the enclaves of the very rich, Los Angeles is a patchwork of 
neighborhoods where the borders between "safe" and "dangerous" are increasingly 
blurred, where old-timers and strangers pass one another on every street, in 
every convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 David Falconer lived in Silver Lake and was killed in Los Feliz. Los Feliz is 
one of the most civic-minded, preservationist-oriented districts in the city. 
Silver Lake, despite marginal aspects, is attractive enough to be the home of 
former City Councilman Mike Woo. Shall these neighborhoods now be ranked 
alongside South-Central in the category of danger? The answer, unfortunately, 
is yes. In an era of universal vulnerability, with highly mobile robber-killers 
plying their trade wherever they choose, no neighborhood is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is being middle-class any longer an adequate shield. Statistics tell us 
that death by violence is a matter of poverty -- another statistical illusion 
of safety. But Falconer was solidly middle-class, doing a middle-class thing: 
buying a snack on his way home from a productively middle-class day teaching 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it do to a city when being middle-class offers no protection? (We 
already know what it means to a city when being poor implies a high certainty 
of violent death.) And is not evidence gathering that the upper-middle classes 
are sharing the vulnerability of their middle-class brethren? Only the wealthy, 
surrounded by private security, can, temporarily, escape the odds. And how long 
will that last? 
</P>
<P>
 The children of St. James Episcopal School on Wilshire where Falconer taught 
are devastated. One 10-year-old told her mother that she cried until the tears 
no longer came. She was weeping for all of us. Better to weep as a prelude to 
action than to succumb to this crime epidemic. Better to weep, and perhaps even 
to grow angry, than to play the odds against each other.

SUBSIDIZE THE POOR, NOT THE WELL-OFF; MASS TRANSPORTATION: AN MTA BUDGET CRISIS 
THREATENS TO CUT BUS SERVICE URGENTLY NEEDED BY LOWER-INCOME URBAN USERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For all the talk about turning Los Angeles around, there is a real choice 
facing the region -- a choice that measures whose L.A. we are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority had a hearing last week on the question of 
cutting costs of bus lines. A thousand people turned up at the raucous event, 
most members of groups representing the disestablished. The MTA board also 
heard from a coalition of 14 Latino elected officials and from urban planners 
who think the choices being made are just bad planning. The options before the 
board were cutting back on bus service, eliminating some routes, raising the 
fares in general or raising some of the special fares such as those for 
seniors, the handicapped or students. 
</P>
<P>
 There are budget shortfalls. There is the recession, the loss of reserves, 
declining bus ridership (now down to about 400 million, with a base fare of 
$1.10, from a peak of 497 million when subsidized fares cost 50 cents in 1985) 
and increasing regulatory costs. There are also other realities about those who 
ride the buses in Los Angeles: The median income of Metrolink riders is $63,300 
a year; the median income of bus riders is between $10,000 and $15,000 a year. 
The current subsidy for Metrolink is $38 per ride; the current subsidy for the 
bus is $1.17 per ride. Metrolink riders have cars -- which we want taken off 
the road; bus riders, for the most part, don't have cars and have little to no 
alternatives in getting to work, to school or to church on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles planners have long been grappling with the problem of mass 
transportation. We are midway in the most expensive transit program in the 
country's history, creating rail linkages across our vast, sprawling region. 
But we are not even midway in recognizing the fact that our inner cities are 
also part of Los Angeles, that peace and prosperity will not come until we do 
something about the poverty and isolation of those areas, and that cutting bus 
service may be exactly the wrong direction to go. In fact, it may be that the 
flexibility of bus service may serve us much better throughout the region than 
a fixed rail system ever could. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA, which is arguing that it has no other way to make up for an 
expected $125-million shortfall of the $700 million it needs to maintain 
existing services (while sustaining a $620-million annual administration 
budget) cannot find another alternative, cannot distribute its security forces 
more equitably between the trains and the buses, cannot increase and upgrade 
the number of buses or redirect them to better serve the poorer areas of the 
city, it will risk adding strongly to the impression that the city no longer 
cares about its poor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA -- admittedly in bad straits -- cannot find another alternative, it 
will not be an idle bureaucratic decision, but one fraught with political 
ramifications. For all the attention paid to the enormous costs of the 
earthquake and fires and mudslides, for all of Mayor Riordan's efforts to 
restructure the city's finances by making it safe and business-friendly, there 
is a growing sense in the minority communities that this new Los Angeles will 
have nothing to do with them. It is time for the new Administration in City 
Hall to reach out to the population that probably didn't vote for Richard 
Riordan. He needs to be their mayor as well, or he will not have much of a city 
to govern, no matter how many police he gets out on the streets. He can create 
links to these communities, but so far, even his links to the minority business 
community are weak. He could demonstrate active leadership at the MTA as an 
advocate for the inner city. He has the clout. He has to demonstrate that he 
has the heart for it.

COLUMN RIGHT/ WILLIAM MELLOR: THERE IS NO 'RIGHT' TO WELFARE; LITIGATION IN NEW 
JERSEY BASED ON SUCH A PREMISE COULD END ANY PROSPECT FOR REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM MELLOR, William Mellor is president and general counsel for the 
Washington-based Institute for Justice, which has moved to join the litigation 
to defend New Jersey's welfare-reform program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should welfare be a constitutional right? A federal court in New Jersey will 
soon address this profoundly troubling question. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation by the National Organization for Women, the American Civil 
Liberties Union and the Legal Services Corp. seeks to establish that capping 
certain benefits for welfare recipients who become pregnant violates the right 
to procreate. Logically, and perhaps legally, such a precedent would make 
impossible any reduction in benefits to single mothers, by far the largest 
group receiving welfare. This would effectively end the prospects for serious 
welfare reform, including such measures as the Clinton Administration's "two 
years and out" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea that there is a constitutional right to welfare seems 
preposterous, given the overwhelming evidence that welfare programs kill 
individual initiative, break up families and breed dependency. Welfare's tragic 
legacy is propelling unprecedented bipartisan reform efforts in more and more 
states. The White House has promised to introduce a welfare-reform proposal. 
And the Maryland NAACP just released a report citing welfare as a "major 
contributing factor to the crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The NOW lawsuit arises from the Family Support Act, passed in 1988. That 
legislation, championed by Sen. Daniel PatrickMoynihan (D-N.Y.), recognized the 
urgent need to break the cycle of dependency and degradation fostered by the 
welfare system. It also wisely recognized that, given the complexity of the 
welfare issue, a quick and universal solution was impossible. To create the 
greatest likelihood of success, Congress permitted each state to set up a 
welfare-reform program designed for its population and its particular 
circumstances. Each program was to be monitored, and the successes could then 
be incorporated into programs throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from the outset, professional advocates who live off the welfare state 
opposed any meaningful reform. When the Family Support Act was being debated, 
Susan Rees, executive director of the Coalition of Human Needs, speaking for a 
large anti-welfare-reform coalition, stated, "What welfare advocates object to 
most is the undermining of this fundamental principle of national entitlement." 
The opposition failed to stop the legislation and has not been able politically 
to turn back the rising tide of state reform efforts. So when New Jersey passed 
the first reform program under this new law, welfare advocates went to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the state programs debated or passed thus far, New Jersey's 
reform effort attempts to strike a balance that encourages and facilitates 
transition into the work force while changing welfare incentives that foster 
family breakup, out-of-wedlock births and parental irresponsibility. These 
latter measures recognize that out-of-wedlock births have reached crisis levels 
among welfare mothers. Polls reflect strong support across racial lines for 
efforts to curb this alarming trend. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey's most controversial provision, aimed at decreasing out-of-wedlock 
births, established that mothers receiving Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children will no longer receive a $64-per-month increase for having another 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics charge that $64 -- less than $800 per year -- is too little to make a 
difference in behavior but enough to unfairly hurt the mother and child. This 
is exactly the kind of difficult public-policy question that state experiences, 
not courts, are designed to answer if allowed to proceed. Indeed, virtually 
every proposed state welfare-reform program contains a similar provision. 
</P>
<P>
 However, NOW and its co-plaintiffs argue that the denial of an increased 
welfare payment for a new child violates the woman's right to "make decisions 
about family composition, conception and childbirth without undue government 
intrusion." Although this would be a dramatic expansion of existing law, it 
would not be the first time a court created a new right that soon became the 
law of the land. The implications would be staggering. Victory by NOW would not 
merely enshrine the principle of national entitlement by creating a "right" to 
state-funded procreation; it would also render impossible even modest cuts in 
welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 This lawsuit confuses the cure with the disease. Failure to remedy the welfare 
dilemma will consign yet another generation to dependency. If courageous and 
creative reform programs like New Jersey's fall prey to ideologically driven 
litigation, it will paralyze our society's urgent effort to produce an antidote 
to welfare's poison.

COLUMN LEFT/ DEAN BAKER / ROBERT POLLIN / MARC SCHABERG: TAX STOCK TRADES TO 
END SPECULATION; THE REVENUE GENERATED COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF SOCIAL 
AND JOBS PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN BAKE; ROBERT POLLIN, ; MARC SCHABERG, Dean Baker is an economist at the 
Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Robert Pollin teaches economics and 
Marc Schaberg is a doctoral student in economics, both at UC Riverside. This 
article is excerpted from the May 9 issue of the Nation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News from the financial markets over the past few weeks makes it clear that 
Wall Street is terrified by the prospect of improved economic conditions for 
the majority of Americans. The front page of the March 31 Wall Street Journal 
conveyed it precisely: on the left side, a headline announcing "Job Market 
Picks Up;" on the right side, more sobering news, "The Bull Stumbles." 
</P>
<P>
 Indications that three years of recession and jobless recovery are finally 
ending sent the stock and bond markets into a frenzy of bearish trading. If job 
creation is sustained and wages start rising, the reasoning on Wall Street 
goes, inflation is sure to follow, and with it declining returns on bonds and a 
likely squeeze on corporate profits. Just such reasoning is what prompted 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to raise short-term interest rates 
three times in the past 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 How can the public exert control over the financial markets? Ultimately, this 
will require overhauling financial regulation and bringing the Federal Reserve 
under greater democratic control. But as an important first step, we offer a 
simple proposal that has received surprisingly wide political support: a small 
tax on the sale of every financial instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 A securities-trading tax of this kind would yield a substantial social benefit 
-- either by discouraging speculation or, failing that, creating a formidable 
new revenue source. At various times, this or similar measures have been 
endorsed by former House Speaker Jim Wright, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
and even former President Bush. The Clinton Administration's two most 
distinguished economists, Joseph Stiglitz of the Council of Economic Advisers 
and Lawrence Summers of the Treasury Department, have written persuasively in 
behalf of such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical features of a trading tax are straightforward. For stocks, the 
seller would be charged 0.5% of the sale price, the amount suggested by Wright 
when he began floating the idea is 1987. The tax would then be adjusted on a 
sliding scale for bonds of various maturities and options, futures and swap 
contracts, including those for commodities. A tax of this size would have 
virtually no impact on anyone who bought and held an asset for a period of 
time. But it would seriously reduce the profit prospects for short-term 
speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential benefits of this tax can be appreciated only in terms of the 
magnitude of the U.S. financial markets. For 1992, $3.1 trillion was traded in 
the stock market, $8.2 trillion in the corporate bond market and $44.4 trillion 
in the government securities market. Relative to this trading volume, new funds 
raised on these markets were minuscule. Considering just the stock market, $114 
in share trading took place for every dollar raised to finance new corporate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Such vast trading creates serious distortions on the productive side of the 
economy. For one, corporate managers are forced to hew to the short-term 
performance standards as defined by the financial markets or place their 
careers in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street also distorts the formation of economic policy. The priorities of 
the financial markets -- against low unemployment, wage gains and inflation -- 
are deeply entrenched among policy-makers. Bill Clinton fashioned a winning 
political campaign around the theme of "good jobs at good wages." But his 
economic spokespersons now offer a positive spin on the news that wages haven't 
risen during the recovery and aren't expected to over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax is certainly no panacea. But if it succeeds in significantly reducing 
speculation, it will promote financial stability and productive investment. 
Even if it fails to dampen speculation, revenues generated from the tax would 
be highlybeneficial. We estimate that, at the levels proposed, the tax would 
raise about $60 billion annually if trading did not decline after it was 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 If trading fell by 50%, the government would still raise $30 billion, 10 times 
the cost of extending Head Start to the entire eligible population. 
Alternatively, the $30 billion could fully finance the type of 
public-investment program that, as candidate Clinton maintained repeatedly in 
1992, also creates high-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the case for the tax is compelling, Wall Street will oppose it 
vehemently. The issue is clear: How long can we allow Wall Street to decide 
what's best for everyone else?

ORIOLES IN CONTROL AGAINST FINLEY, 13-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers thought he figured out the reason Chuck Finley was 
struggling, and it didn't take much to come to his conclusion.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Chuck gets behind, they sit on his fastball," he said. And when you're 
always 2-0 and 3-1 in the count, I don't care if you're Sandy Koufax, it's 
pretty hard to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so far, he's just had one bad inning that's hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Rodgers' theory proved partially right Wednesday night as the Baltimore 
Orioles scored four runs in the sixth en route to an 13-1 victory before 20,569 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The lopsided victory wasn't because Finley lacked control.  
</P>
<P>
 Making his 200th career start in a light misting rain, Finley struck out seven 
and walked only one. But he gave up three home runs, the most he has allowed in 
a year. The Yankees hit four homers against Finley last April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who doesn't understand what the count means to hitters, doesn't 
understand this game," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 On this evening, the Orioles either didn't get it or didn't care. Mike 
Devereaux hit a solo homer in the fourth on a 1-2 pitch. Rafael Palmiero hit 
one over the 386-foot sign in right-center in the sixth on 2-1 pitch. And Chris 
Hoiles' two-run shot two batters later came off Finley's first delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a pretty good ballgame going through five," Rodgers said. 
"How mistaken I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore got a club-record 11 extra-base hits. In Finley's previous three 
starts, the Angels lost by one run. This time, that wasn't likely after the 
sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty good about the way he was pitching," Rodgers said. "He was 
getting ahead of guys and had made 20 or 25 fewer pitches in the early innings 
than he had been. He was going along good and then . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Is Rodgers concerned? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to sit down and talk about some things, to look at some 
film," he said. "We need to talk about how he feels, go over the thought 
process involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was out of reach -- and nearly out of control -- in the seventh 
inning when reliever Scott Lewis gave up a single to Jeff Hammonds, a double to 
Palmiero and a three-run homer to Cal Ripken. Lewis was gone before he got an 
out, and before Rodgers had a chance to make a pitching change. Lewis hit 
Hoiles in the helmet with an 0-2 fastball and was ejected. Hoiles appeared 
unfazed and jumped to his feet, but both benches and bullpens emptied.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the turf was too soggy, but the usual rugby scrum/wrestling match never 
materialized and the Angels went quietly into the damp night, still clinging to 
a share of first place in the American League West with a 9-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles put together three consecutive doubles with two outs in the eighth 
inning and handed Ben McDonald a big advantage. They made it a 12-run lead in 
the ninth when Brady Anderson hit his third homer in two games -- on a 2-2 
delivery by Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, who became the first pitcher in the American League to earn his 
fifth victory, allowed the first runner he faced to score, and yielded four 
hits in the first three innings. But he settled down and gave up only two 
runners in the next three innings. He retired the side in order in the sixth 
and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who apparently was trying to follow Rodgers' advice, jumped ahead of 
each hitter in the first inning but still managed to prove he's his own worst 
enemy. He had leadoff hitter Anderson 0-2 before giving up a single to right. 
Anderson stole second and ended up on third when Finley's errant pickoff throw 
went into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who was the victim when Billy Hatcher stole home Friday night in 
Boston, was pitching from the stretch this time, but Ripken's bloop single put 
the Orioles ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels quickly evened the score in the first. Damion Easley led off with a 
double to left-center, advanced to third and then scored when Dwight Smith and 
Tim Salmon grounded to second. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their last outburst.

MORNING BRIEFING: A CORNER WITHOUT A CUT MAN IS A COSTLY WAY TO CUT CORNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Turner, Evander Holyfield's trainer, rejected having cut man Ace Marotta 
in Holyfield's corner for last Friday night's heavyweight championship fight 
against Michael Moorer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cut men are the biggest scam in boxing," Turner told Ron Borges of the Boston 
Globe. "These guys fly in and they eat like they're going to the electric chair 
and you know what? The fighter pays." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Holyfield suffered a deep cut over his left eye in the 
second round and, without an established cut man, bled much of the rest of the 
fight. Also, much of Turner's time between rounds was spent working on the cut 
instead of advising Holyfield, who lost a majority decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield's usual cut man's cut? $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: In 1962, the Raiders of the AFL and Rams of the NFL drafted the 
same player in the first round. Who was he?  
</P>
<P>
 Expensive visit: A fan came out of the stands during a Pittsburgh Pirate game, 
approached Andy Van Slyke in center field and said: "I just wanted to meet 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Van Slyke: "It probably would have cost you a lot less if you waited for 
autograph day." 
</P>
<P>
 Modesty: Bob McManaman of the Arizona Republic reported that Buddy Ryan, the 
new coach of Arizona Cardinals, was "downright cocky" long before the recent 
NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get the guys I want. I always do," Ryan told McManaman shortly after he 
was hired in February. "I don't know if I'm just lucky or if the rest of the 
people in the league are just stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice theory, but . . . From Glenn Dickey of the San Francisco Chronicle: "When 
Magic Johnson's appointment as a coach was announced, I wrote that it was 
simply a publicity stunt to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what? It worked. The empty seats at the Forum suddenly filled up, and 
season tickets took a big jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so according to Forum public relations director Bob Steiner, who said: 
"Magic's hiring had no impact on season ticket sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch: From Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune: "It's not only the players who do 
the taunting. This from referee Joey Crawford to New York's Greg Anthony after 
Anthony questioned a call recently:  
</P>
<P>
 "Learn how to shoot!"  
</P>
<P>
 Howling: Christian Laettner of the Minnesota Timberwolves criticized teammates 
after a loss to Portland on Friday night in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about my game. I'm more worried about getting some players 
around me," Laettner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Laettner will need plenty of help, considering the Timberwolves finished 
20-62. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1966, the Boston Celtics defeated the Lakers, 
95-93, in the seventh game of the NBA finals to win their eighth consecutive 
championship. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Quarterback Roman Gabriel.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PADRES LOSE LONGEST GAME OF THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Vina singled home the winning run in the 15th inning at New York to 
give the Mets a 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres Wednesday night in a 
4-hour 57-minute game, the longest in the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Mauser (1-1), the Padres' sixth pitcher, relieved to start the inning and 
gave up a leadoff single to Kevin McReynolds, who advanced on Bobby Bonilla's 
groundout. Pinch-hitter Luis Rivera fouled out and Vina hit a grounder that 
bounced off Phil Clark's glove at first for a hit as the winning run scored 
well past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would have been a tough play," Vina said. "I was just running hard 
if he didn't field it -- to beat a throw to the first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Linton (2-0) pitched three scoreless innings for the victory, which ended 
the Padres' four-game winning streak and the Mets' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Bell of the Padres, in his first game since Tuesday's arrest on a charge 
of soliciting a prostitute, went two for seven with a double.  
</P>
<P>
 "Great baseball game. That's all I can say," Met Manager Dallas Green said, 
looking as exhausted as his players. "We didn't play good situation baseball. 
We probably could have won it five different innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Padre starter Andy Ashby gave up two runs and five hits in eight innings with 
eight strikeouts and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Bobby Jones extended his scoreless streak to a career-high 18 
innings before faltering in the seventh. He gave up two runs and four hits in 
six-plus innings, walked seven -- three intentionally -- and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, San Francisco 1 -- Ken Hill scattered six hits for his first 
complete game in more than a year, leading the Expos against the Giants at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory capped another successful April for Hill. He is 4-1 this April, he 
was 2-0 in April 1992, and he went 4-0 in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who last went the distance in a 6-1 victory over the Giants last April 
24, gave up one unearned run in pitching his ninth career complete game. He 
struck out one and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander, who was slow to recover from a groin pull during the second 
half of last season, threw hard and low, getting 18 ground ball outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's back to the form of '92 when he was awesome," Expo Manager Felipe Alou 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Berry had three hits for the Expos, who have won seven of their last 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal got five hits, all singles, off Mark Portugal (2-2) in the second to 
take a 3-1 lead. Moises Alou got things started with a single, extending his 
batting streak to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal gave up five runs and nine hits over five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, Cincinnati 1 -- The Pirates expected Zane Smith to be their best 
pitcher, but for the time being he is also their best hitter. His two hits in 
this victory over the Reds at Pittsburgh raised his batting average to .500. He 
is six for 12. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mound, Smith kept the Reds off-balance with an assortment of sinkers 
and off-speed pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Garcia had a go-ahead, run-scoring double and Jay Bell homered off 
former Pirate John Smiley (2-2) to back Smith's four-hit pitching. The complete 
game was only the second since 1992 for Smith, who gave up one hit over the 
final six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (3-1) has won three in a row and already has matched his victory total 
since developing shoulder problems in July 1992. He was 3-8 last season and 
didn't pitch for the final six weeks to avoid reinjuring the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was a 16-game winner in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds, who entered the game with a major league-leading 13-5 record, lost 
for only the second time in nine games. They had also won 10 of their last 14 
against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 8, Chicago 5 -- Jeff Bagwell drove in the go-ahead run with a 
groundout in the seventh inning as the Astros rallied from five runs down for a 
victory over the Cubs at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston trailed, 5-0, after two innings before battling back to hand Chicago 
its 10th loss in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Caminiti hit a three-run homer and Andujar Cedeno added a solo shot for 
the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Reynolds picked up his first win since Sept. 27, 1992, with three 
scoreless innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Colorado 2 -- Gary Sheffield homered for the third consecutive game 
and Charlie Hough (2-0) pitched seven strong innings, leading the Marlins over 
the Rockies at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after relief ace Bryan Harvey was placed on the disabled list, the 
Marlins barely held on in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter John Vander Wal's triple made it 3-2 with one out, but Jeremy 
Hernandez retired pinch-hitter Eric Young on a pop and got Walt Weiss on a fly 
ball for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield hit his eighth homer of the season, and tied a team record for home 
runs in a month, with a two-run shot in the first inning.

 The league's owners unanimously approved a Vancouver franchise Wednesday, six 
months after admitting Toronto. Both teams will begin play in the 1995-96 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Toronto and Vancouver will give the NBA 29 teams. The

 One day after Evander Holyfield retired from boxing because of a cardiac 
condition, doctors discovered another problem with the former heavyweight 
champion's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 A test at an Atlanta hospital revealed a "tiny" hole in the boxer's heart, 
said a spokeswoman. She said the hole between the two chambers of the heart is 
not life threatening but will be monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something he was born with," said Holyfield's personal physician, 
Ronald Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, 31, announced his retirement after being diagnosed with a 
non-compliant left ventricle or "stiff heart," which prevents sufficient oxygen 
from being pumped to muscles and tissues.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; SABRES BEAT DEVILS IN FOURTH OVERTIME, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a hockey game with almost no end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Sabres and New Jersey Devils played through three regulation 
periods and three 20-minute overtime periods Wednesday night without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres won, 1-0, when Dave Hannan scored 5:43 into the fourth overtime. It 
was nearly 2 a.m. EDT in Buffalo when the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 On the winning play, Jason Dawe shot from the right circle. The puck was 
blocked by the skate of the Devils' Valeri Zelepukin and Hannan picked up the 
rebound and backhanded it over a sprawling Martin Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the Sabres' first in overtime this season, saved Buffalo from 
elimination and forced a deciding game Friday night at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo has never won a Game 7 in the 24-year history of the franchise, twice 
losing to Boston in its only tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek had stopped 66 shots through 120 minutes of 
hockey, while New Jersey's Brodeur had stopped 49. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was not close to the NHL record for longest overtime game. On March 
25, 1936, the Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Maroons played into six overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit won, 1-0, with Mud Bruneteau scoring at 16:30 of the sixth overtime. 
That game lasted 176 minutes 30 seconds, including 116:30 of overtime play. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Don Beaupre had 26 saves, improving to 4-0 in 
the playoff, as the Capitals beat the Penguins at Landover, Md., to win the 
first-round series in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington never trailed after taking a 3-0 lead in the opening 10 minutes. 
The seventh-seeded Capitals will next face the New York Rangers in the Eastern 
Conference semifinal, which begins Sunday at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals had twice previously blown 3-1 series leads in the playoffs, 
including two years ago against the Penguins. Second-seeded Pittsburgh hoped 
history would repeat itself after winning Game 5, but there would be no 
comeback this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaupre was spectacular throughout the series, but he received plenty of help 
from the Washington defense. Pittsburgh superstar Mario Lemieux had only four 
goals in the six games, and the Penguins' power play went one for six Wednesday 
night to finish two for 27 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive early exit for Pittsburgh, which was eliminated 
in the second round last season after winning two consecutive Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 The game could signify the end for Lemeieux, who missed 58 games this season 
with back trouble. He has been hinting at retirement, and said he will ponder 
his future in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, my health is not the best thing I've got going for me," he said. 
"I have to stop and take a look at that and think about my future. It's been 
difficult the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to battling back problems, Lemieux has been fighting Hodgkins 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 3, Montreal 2 -- Al Iafrate scored the game-winning goal at Montreal at 
7:21 of the third period to tie the series at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Iafrate's point shot was blocked, but the loose puck was lying in the crease. 
He beat John LeClair to it, moved to the right and fooled goaltender Patrick 
Roy with a low screened shot between the feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding game will be played Friday night at Boston Garden.

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FOUNTAIN VALLEY TUNES UP FOR TITLE SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Jason Liuzzi went along for the ride last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley baseball team won the Sunset League championship and 
Liuzzi was there for every minute -- clapping, cheering and doing all those 
things a guy on the bench is suppose to do. His on-the-field contribution was a 
grand total of 1 1/3 innings on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi, a senior left-hander, has played a more significant role this season. 
</P>
<P>
 His 5-0 victory over Servite on Wednesday in Anaheim moved the Barons closer 
to another championship. It at least got them closer to a showdown for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (19-2, 7-2), ranked No. 1 in Orange County, started the day tied 
for first with Huntington Beach. The two teams play Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still could finish third, but I think this made it a two-team race for the 
title," said Ron LaRuffa, the Barons' always cautious coach. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-team race is a remarkable thing, considering that two weeks ago six 
teams were within 1 1/2 games of each other. But pitching has made the Barons 
rise above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 And Liuzzi (4-0) is a big reason the pitching has been there. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up his third league victory Wednesday. He went five innings, 
allowing only two hits and striking out six. He also retired the last nine 
batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (11-8-1, 5-4) got a runner to second with one out in the second 
inning, but Liuzzi struck out the next two batters. It was the closest the 
Friars cane to getting a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad performance for a guy who figured to do a lot of sitting and 
clapping again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi started the year on the shelf, waiting for his chance. It came in the 
Coachella Valley Tournament during spring break.  
</P>
<P>
 He pitched five shutout innings against Coachella Valley. That performance 
earned him another chance, which he parlayed into a spot in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi has given up only two runs in a little more than 20 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kept pitching so well that we had to keep using him," LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also allowed Chris Ponchak to go the bullpen, where he has become a 
stopper. Ponchak went the final two innings Wednesday for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley needed the strong outing from its pitchers, as the Baron 
offense took most of the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Luke Fox hit the first pitch over the 356-sign in right field to give the 
Barons a 1-0 lead. They then spent much of the day flailing at Brian Greene's 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene (3-1) gave up only four hits. At one point, he retired 10 of 11 
batters. The one walk he gave up during that stretch was erased when Jeff 
Hoppie was thrown out attempting to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, we hit that first pitch out and I'm thinking it's going to be a 15-run 
day," LaRuffa said. "Then Greene starts mowing us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene made only one other mistake. In the seventh, he got a pitch up to Kevin 
Burford, who hit it over the 306-foot sign in center field. The only other runs 
off Greene were unearned. CHRIS FOSTER

WEATHER REMAINED COOL BUT NOTRE DAME'S IGOU GOT HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was chilly and overcast throughout Wednesday's Mission League showdown 
between Notre Dame and Alemany highs and Rich Igou, who pitched a complete game 
for the Knights, says the weather affected him.  
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander gave up five hits and four runs in the first inning, 
but only two hits and one run thereafter as host Notre Dame rallied to win, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an odd day to throw because it was real cold," said Igou, who improved 
to 7-2. He struck out six and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off slow, but I really didn't expect them to hit the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie Rehfeld smacked Igou's first pitch to center for a single and Jaime 
Tyson followed with a single to left. Monie Jensen's infield single loaded the 
bases.  
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup hitter, Jon Tucker, did just that, ripping an 0-and-2 pitch over 
the right-field fence, and Alemany had a 4-0 lead before a man was retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (14-4, 8-1 in league play) scored five times in the fourth to take 
the lead. Ed Romero's single drove in Justin Bunch, then Chris Crowley scored 
on a throwing error to cut the Alemany lead in half. Ryan Benner's RBI double 
was followed by Jabbar Craigwell's squeeze bunt that scored Romero. Joey 
Orlando singled home Benner for the last run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got some momentum and there they went," Alemany Coach Jim Ozella said. 
"I knew the ballgame wasn't over after the first inning. Igou is a veteran 
pitcher and he's pitched in big ballgames before." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch, who went two for three, led off the fifth with a home run to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Craigwell repeated in the sixth, blasting reliever Fred Perez's fastball to 
almost the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really battled back and that was very tough to do after that first 
inning," Notre Dame Coach Tom Dill said. "We were really frustrated but we were 
patient and it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (15-7, 6-3) scored its last run in the seventh inning when Tucker's 
sacrifice fly drove in Rehfeld. "I thought we swung the bats well all day," 
Ozella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out and we competed and I'm happy for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Dan Arguello (3-4) took the loss, giving up 11 hits and five earned 
runs in 5 2/3 innings.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; HODGES' HOME RUNS MOVE CYPRESS INTO FIRST PLACE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress took over first place in the Orange Empire Conference Wednesday when 
designated hitter Jason Hodges hit two home runs to give the Chargers a 4-3 
victory over visiting Riverside in a game rescheduled because of Tuesday's 
rainout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (28-10, 14-5 in league) now have a half-game lead over the Tigers 
(27-9, 14-6) with five games remaining.The Chargers will try to maintain their 
lead at Fullerton College when they meet the Hornets at 2:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress was aided by solid pitching from starter Josh Belovsky and reliever 
Andy Gonzales, who outdueled Riverside ace Jeff Barker (10-2). Barker struck 
out nine and walked one. Belovsky struck out seven and walked six before being 
replaced by Gonzales with one out in the seventh. Gonzales (2-2) struck out 
four and walked two to pick up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy Gonzales did an outstanding job," Charger Coach Scott Pickler said. "He 
came in and closed the door. Belovsky gave me all he had, which is all I can 
ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges' second homer, leading off the bottom of the seventh, gave the Chargers 
a 4-3 lead after the Tigers rallied for three runs in the top of the inning to 
tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress took a 2-0 first-inning lead on Josh Kliner's run-scoring double down 
the right-field line and Gonzales' fly to shortstop Brian Rios in short left, 
scoring Kliner. Hodges' first home run, over the left-field wall, gave the 
Chargers a 3-0 lead in the fourth. TOM BIRSCHBACH

 Rome Cancels Summer Opera: Financial difficulties have prompted the 
cancellation of Rome's summer opera season for the first time since the end of 
World War II. The Rome Opera House is struggling with a $33-million deficit; in 
February, its director stepped down amid investigations into the opera's 
finances. The season's cancellation follows the closure last month of the famed 
Baths of Caracalla, which had been home to summer open-air opera since 1938. 
Heritage Minister Alberto Ronchey said vibrations, heavy equipment and the 
170,000 tourists who flocked annually to the summer concerts were destroying 
the site, begun under Emperor Antonius Caracalla and opened in 217 AD.

 * Moriarty's 'Fair Lady' Flops: Only two weeks after controversial actor 
Michael Moriarty stepped in to replace Richard Chamberlain as Prof. Henry 
Higgins in the Broadway hit revival of "My Fair Lady," the producers have 
posted a notice that the show will close Sunday. The revival, seen here last 
summer at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, opened on Broadway to 
rave reviews in December. But business at the box office dropped dramatically 
when Moriarty took over the role after his much publicized departure from 
NBC-TV's "Law and Order." Chamberlain left "My Fair Lady" when his contract was 
up, reportedly because of differences with the producers. MOVIES

 'Oleanna' Film a Go: The Samuel Goldwyn Co. confirmed that Pulitzer 
Prize-winning writer David Mamet will indeed direct a film version of his 
controversial play "Oleanna," which is currently playing at West Hollywood's 
Tiffany Theatre. The play, which has received mixed reviews from critics, deals 
with an alleged incident of sexual harassment between a college professor and a 
female student. The lead roles will be played by longtime Mamet collaborators 
William H. Macy and Rebecca Pidgeon, who starred in the original New York 
production. Mamet won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for his play "Glengarry Glen 
Ross," which was also later made into a film, and he was nominated for a 1982 
Academy Award for his screenplay "The Verdict." "Oleanna" is planned for 
release late this year.

 * Director in Critical Care: Veteran director Richard Rush, whose credits 
include the Oscar-nominated movie "The Stunt Man" and "Freebie and the Bean," 
underwent open-heart surgery at UCLA Medical Center Tuesday after suffering a 
heart attack Monday night. A hospital spokeswoman confirmed that Rush was in 
the critical care unit where, as of Wednesday morning, his condition was 
"critical but stable." Last week, Rush was embroiled in a Directors Guild 
arbitration with Cinergi Productions over the final cut of the Bruce Willis 
movie "The Color of Night." A Cinergi spokesman said that to his knowledge no 
ruling had yet been made. POP/ROCK

 Nirvana Sales Slowing: The rush for Nirvana albums after the suicide of lead 
singer Kurt Cobain is slowing. After climbing to No. 11 on the national pop 
charts last week, the group's 1993 "In Utero" album drops to No. 15 on the 
Billboard magazine chart coming out Saturday -- as sales fell from 
approximately 69,000 copies to 54,000. The group's 1991 album, "Nevermind," 
also drops -- from No. 28 to No. 30. Hole's "Live Through This," the major 
label debut of the band led by Cobain's widow Courtney Love, also fell slightly 
-- from No. 55 to 61 in its second week of release. Pink Floyd's "The Division 
Bell" continues to hold No. 1 on the charts, selling an estimated 157,000 
copies last week. LEGAL FILE

 Slick, Rollins Go to Court: Rock star Grace Slick agreed to a plea bargain 
that reduced felony and misdemeanor charges against her to a single misdemeanor 
of brandishing a shotgun at police officers. Slick, the former lead singer of 
Jefferson Airplane, was charged in conjunction with a March 5 incident in which 
police showed up at her home near San Francisco after a neighbor complained 
that a drunken woman was firing a gun. The plea bargain reduced her potential 
jail time from three years in state prison to six to 12 months in county jail. 
She could avoid doing jail time if she is paroled to a six-month alcoholism 
treatment program. Sentencing is scheduled for June 6. . . . Also in court was 
actor Howard Rollins, who was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading 
guilty to driving under the influence of cocaine and driving with a suspended 
license. Rollins was also ordered to stay away for two years from the eastern 
Georgia communities where his former TV series, "In the Heat of the Night," is 
filmed. "The court feels you need a change of scenery," the judge told him. 
Rollins previously served 82 days in jail on a similar offense. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; 'FROSH' A REFRESHING LOOK AT A CLASSY FRESHMAN CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an era when we're constantly bombarded with messages of despair, Daniel 
Geller and Dayna Goldfine's "Frosh: Nine Months in a Freshman Dorm" offers real 
hope. The bright, reflective young people who are living in Stanford's Trancos 
dorm -- it is the 1990-91 academic year -- are caring, inquiring individuals 
who mature before our very eyes. This wonderfully refreshing film, full of 
humor and compassion, leaves us with the feeling that if there are sufficient 
numbers of such people, this country may just continue to survive, maybe 
thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 For most anyone who ever was a college freshman, the film has an irresistible 
nostalgic pull. Some things don't change, after all: the tug of bidding parents 
goodby; the adjustment to a new and challenging environment; the forging of 
friendships, some of which may last a lifetime; the bull sessions; the high 
jinks amid hard study; the struggle to maintain emotional equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman year is the best of times, the worst of times, but you can't help but 
feel how much better, how much richer an experience it is for these young 
people than it was for those of us who underwent it decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Trancos is not only co-ed -- 40 men, 40 women -- but strongly multiethnic, 
with many African Americans and Asian Americans (but, oddly, few Latinos). How 
good it is for young people from all over the country and from widely differing 
backgrounds to get to know one another; how good it is, in this era of paranoia 
between the sexes, for men and women to get to know one another by living in 
the same building and sharing the same facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironies abound. The highly intelligent and mature Brandi, an African American, 
admits she grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood so white that she 
didn't have any black friends. It's Brandi, however, who's supportive of 
Monique, a black woman from Oakland, born out of wedlock to a woman who is now 
addicted to crack. Monique is every bit as smart and competent as Brandi but 
lacks Brandi's confidence and feels so out of place she threatens to drop out.  
</P>
<P>
 Other students we get to know are Shayne, who finds her views increasingly in 
conflict with the rigid doctrines of her Catholic upbringing; Debbie, who is an 
outspoken feminist; Cheng, who discovers Stanford to be academically tougher 
than he expected; and Sam, who is as close to being average or ordinary as 
these young people get. Significantly, he's the most thrilled to be accepted by 
a fraternity, admitting frankly to his need to be liked. 
</P>
<P>
 We find ourselves hating to bid farewell to these young people and cannot help 
but wonder what has become of them, especially Monique. We'll eventually get 
our chance to find out, for the filmmakers are at work on a sequel, centering 
on the graduation of this class this year.

THEATRE REVIEW; 'THE SECRETARIES' A DEFT, MERCILESS SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Type a memo, file a report, fetch the coffee, slice up a lumberjack with a 
chainsaw. 
</P>
<P>
 All in a day's work for "The Secretaries," those Slim-Fast-slurping, typing 
pool terrorists at a Big Bone, Ore., sawmill who vent their dead-end 
frustrations with deadly determination in this very black comedy that plays 
like a cross between Jean Genet and "Tales From the Crypt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Five Lesbian Brothers, a New York-based gay activist troupe who 
collaboratively wrote and perform "The Secretaries," render their satirical 
portraits with a deft but merciless eye for the toll office drudgery exacts on 
the feminine psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 In robotic unison, the secretaries tap their keyboards and celebrate the 
virtues of employment, punctuating their chants with word-processing commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Kron, Babs Davy and Maureen Angelos play the veteran clericals so steeped 
in office routine they've even synced up their menstrual cycles -- the 
rapid-fire "tsk-tsk-tsk" of their malicious gossip is an inspired touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Reigning over the group both socially and professionally is the icy Miss 
Curtis (Peg Healy), a svelte power-monger with sinister designs on her newest 
employee, the very capable but innocent Patti (Dominique Dibbell). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kate Stafford hasn't pulled any punches in her staging, calibrated 
for maximum shock value. The visual assaults range from locker-room gross-out 
(Miss Curtis collecting soiled tampons for obscure "research") to the eerily 
horrific (an affectionate kiss suddenly turning into bloody reprisal). The 
Grand Guignol ending in particular seems to have slithered out of some cesspool 
of feminist revenge fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subjugation of women depicted here goes way past the usual cliches of 
male domination -- these women practice cruelty and humiliation even on one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brothers deliberately violate their own comic-book detachment often enough 
to keep us emotionally off balance -- especially when we witness the painful, 
guilt-racked transformation of the sympathetic Patti into a killer, or the 
victimization of the single male character they've gone out of their way to 
establish as sensitive and decent (Angelos in a dual role). 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting ambivalence isn't necessarily a bad thing -- men might actually 
learn something here about the discomfort women experience in the presence of 
slasher films and other misogynist elements in popular culture.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the intermittent intrusion of a moral foundation that's all too 
glibly repudiated the moment it becomes inconvenient. In the end, all we're 
left with is a gleeful cautionary reminder that women can be every bit as 
homicidal as men. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's an encouraging thought. 
</P>
<P>

CLUB REVIEW; 'LEGENDS' HEATS UP IN OJAI 
</P>

<P>
 Mineral springs, jazz and thou: the perfect date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wheeler Hot Springs in Ojai has been bubbling for 103 years, the 
"Legends of Jazz" series being offered in the venue's supper club has heated 
the place up considerably.Live jazz is featured Thursday through Sunday. 
Weeknight reservations are easier to come by, but the "Legends" series on 
Sunday evenings is worth calling ahead for. With a remarkable lineup of jazz 
greats, the semi-monthly program is the ultimate setting for a dream date 
because, like, Calgon, it takes you away.  
</P>
<P>
 A raised stage at one end of the quaint, rustic restaurant is the evening's 
focal point. April's guests included trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison and 
guitarist Herb Ellis playing with pianist Roger Kellaway. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of French doors behind the stage enable you to look out toward the 
mountain landscape, and because many of the artists are famous from an earlier 
era, the whole evening feels far more special than the usual supper club fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to be up at this place," noted Edison during a recent 
performance. "With me, at my age, it's wonderful to be anyplace." 
</P>
<P>
 * Wheeler Hot Springs, 16826 Maricopa Highway (Highway 33), advance 
reservations required . (800) 227-9292. Dinner and jazz on Sundays, $50 per 
person. HEIDI SIEGMUND

JAZZ REVIEW; MCCORKLE CHARMS, DISAPPOINTS AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susannah McCorkle, who opened on Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill, is a vocal 
charmer who seems to have a love affair with every song she sings. Whether the 
lyrics are as hip as Dave Frishberg or as old as Irving Berlin, she is seldom 
less than totally at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of her selections Tuesday were drawn from a generally admirable album, 
"From Bessie to Brazil," that shows the range of her repertoire. Occasionally, 
however, she trips up. Her set opened with a self-conscious song that has long 
outlived its usefulness, "The Lady Is a Tramp." 
</P>
<P>
 A few pieces were tributes to singers she has admired, but there were no 
impressions: The Billie Holiday standard "That Old Devil Called Love" became a 
vehicle for McCorkle's own graceful sound and style, as was "My Buddy," 
inspired by Chet Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her growling attempt at a Bessie Smith tune was a nice try, though hampered 
somewhat by Alan Farnham's less than blues-drenched piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many minutes were wasted on a pointless interlude of early Braziliana, 
supposedly a nod to Carmen Miranda. Far more appropriate to McCorkle's 
personality was Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Waters of March," complete with a touch 
of Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry verses of Frishberg's "Quality Time" and the feminist determination of 
"The Ballad of Pearly Sue" (written by, of all people, Gerry Mulligan) 
reflected her intelligent understanding of every lyrical line. 
</P>
<P>
 With Farnham in the backup group are Eric Von Essen on bass and Joe Labarber 
on drums. McCorkle will continue to turn on the charm through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Susannah McCorkle at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd. Hollywood, 
(213) 466-2210. McCorkle plays two sets each night, 9 and 11 p.m., through 
Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

MUSIC REVIEWS; DOUBLE EDGE PLAYS CONTEMPORARY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Piano duos can cover a lot of ground, as evidenced by Edmund Niemann and Nurit 
Tilles, the accomplished and forward-leaning pianists who comprise the New 
York-based piano duo Double Edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the duo's appearance at the L.A. County Museum of Art, the ground covered 
wasn't always safe or sublime. For all their finely tuned, almost telepathic 
collective efforts, the musical grist here wasn't consistently worthy of the 
players' gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began promisingly enough, with the West Coast premiere of "Blue" Gene 
Tyranny's obliquely wistful, aptly meandering ode to Route 66, "The 
De-Certified Highway of Dreams" -- now folksy, now urbane. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Tower's "Love and Celebration," lifted out of a ballet, seemed truncated, 
an intense finale taken out of context. Meredith Monk's 1981 piece "Ellis 
Island" is a frilly meditation on a minor chord that, retroactively, veers too 
close to New Age music for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three movements from Messiaen's "Visions de l'Amen" neatly captured that 
composer's turbulence, reverence and ornithological sensuality. The duo's 
version of "Tonk," by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, spun with fast and 
crisply articulated notes, if lacking those unnotateable traits of swing or 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Two world premieres checked in on the state of minimalism. One sang, the other 
sank. Kevin Volans' "Cicada" is a striking perceptual work that plays off of a 
gradual shifting of phrases, in which permutations refer to classic minimalism, 
minus the triadic colors and mechanistic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck with David Borden's bland "The Infinity Variations, Part Two," in 
which the pianists' efforts were mismatched with banal synthesized sounds on 
tape. Too-familiar minimalistic babble conjured visions of subdividing cells, 
assembly-line work and data-bits dancing in beguiling, meaningless circles. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went Monday, a mixture of the inspired with the tired, the fresh 
with the stale. Throughout, however, the players dispatched with edge and 
elegance. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; RICHARD BERNSTEIN PROVES WORTHY OF STATUS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Bernstein vaulted from the minor leagues to the big leagues Monday 
when he sang Figaro for the first time in the final Los Angeles Music Center 
Opera presentation of Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 His prior credits had included Colline in Puccini's "La Boheme," the Friar in 
"Don Carlo" and the even less prominent role of the Commissioner in that 
composer's "Madama Butterfly," both for the home opera team, which also has 
announced him as Orest in Strauss' "Elektra" next season. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed his career was advancing at a vertiginous rate, but Bernstein proved 
that the company's faith in him was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein possesses a big, dark bass-baritone, unclouded, finely focused and 
even through most of the range, although at the top it tended to turn chalky. 
There was more steel than velvet in the voice, which was not necessarily a 
disadvantage here. Sometimes the tone thinned out, but not alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 As did his predecessor, Bernstein sang the embellishments from the Barenreiter 
score in "Non piu andrai." And like his predecessor -- and in fact the rest of 
his previously reviewed colleagues -- Bernstein occasionally appeared 
discomfited by the erratic, sometimes even unsympathetic musical direction of 
Markus Stenz. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was nothing tentative about Bernstein's Figaro. He acted the role 
with impetuous enthusiasm and confident, robust manliness. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; BRENDEL CONTINUES HIS BEETHOVEN CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alfred Brendel has been playing the Beethoven sonatas in public for more than 
three decades. Yet, as he showed again at the fourth of his seven-concert 
series devoted to these works -- this one spanning 1993-96 -- intimate 
knowledge of the canon has not made his playing of it unduly weighted, or 
deadly serious or even mentally fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Austrian pianist's experiences with the 32 sonatas seem to have 
liberated him, in his current survey, to explore many possibilities -- many 
honest options -- in these scores. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was, Tuesday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, in five more 
sonatas -- the two of Opus 14; the "Pathetique," Opus 13; the B-flat of Opus 
22, and "Das Lebewohl," Opus 81a -- that a large and rapt audience gratefully 
received the 63-year-old pianist's living knowledge of works we consider 
familiar but that, in fact, Brendel is rediscovering constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratitude is the appropriate reaction: Throughout this generous evening, one 
heard the music first, in logical, clarified, projected and polished 
performances. Playing the piano beautifully, of course, is not secondary with 
Brendel -- he usually always does it -- but it is what we notice, after the 
musical experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, for some, there were surprises: the almost-amazing Haydnesque sweep 
and detailing of the irrepressible G-major Sonata, Opus 14, No. 2; the 
breathtaking, pristine seriousness of the opening of Opus 13; the caressive 
closing of the finale in Opus 22 -- indeed, the controlled but abundant 
affection Brendel lavished upon every part of this beloved B-flat sonata, often 
said to be the composer's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in the presence of a great pianist, one is reminded that virtue -- and 
virtuosity -- is many-faceted: Brendel's musical insights, superior intellect, 
emotional thrust and sensitive, nuanced playing reside together and reinforce 
each other. His achievement consists in their integration. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, his encore turned out to be the two-movement, G-major Sonata, 
Opus 49, No. 2, obviously balancing his Sunday night encore, the other, 
two-movement Sonata of Opus 49, the G-minor (No. 1). DANIEL CARIAGA

ART REVIEWS; YNEZ JOHNSTON'S MYTHICAL FLIGHTS OF FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ynez Johnston's fanciful prints and colorful paintings look like maps of 
fantastic lands. Her bronze and wood sculptures, made in collaboration with her 
husband, poet John Berry, resemble mythical beasts that might transport 
passengers to these strange locations. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tobey C. Moss Gallery, more than 70 etchings, aquatints, woodcuts and 
lithographs from 1948-84 take viewers on whirlwind tours that include imaginary 
visits to Altamira cave paintings, Mayan stone carvings, Chinese calligraphic 
scrolls, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Tibetan wall hangings, Peruvian textiles, 
Cherokee tepee designs, Aboriginal sand paintings and bark drawings, as well as 
the paintings of Paul Klee, Jean Miro and Jean Dubuffet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Tortue Gallery, more than 45 recent paintings, drawings and sculptures 
bolster the power of Johnston's detailed prints, providing bold jolts of bright 
color and three-dimensional solidity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only exotic territory her art actually visits is in Johnston's playful 
imagination. The pictographic symbols in the 73-year-old, L.A.-based artist's 
work are thoroughly filtered through her own sensibility. They tell us less 
about the cultures from which they originate and more about Johnston's unique 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Her whimsical, inventive art describes a highly personal yet readily 
accessible world in which plants, animals, humans, machines and deities are 
valued equally. Architecture and geography also belong to this fluid continuum. 
</P>
<P>
 Every element in Johnston's jam-packed images seems to be made of the same 
animate substance. Tiny creatures and giant beasts are no more vital than rocks 
or buildings, mountains or islands. Abstract lines, decorative patterns and 
rich textures are similarly driven by a restless energy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's often impossible to know what you see when you look at these 
hallucinatory images. You just have to sense things, ceding rational control to 
follow fleeting intuitions. Fortunately, Johnston endows every inch of her 
delightful pictures with the potential to contribute to any number of wildly 
open-ended narratives. 
</P>

Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 828-8878, through 
June 4. Closed Sundays and Mondays. When Opposites Attract: A struggle between 
beauty and ugliness percolates beneath the clotted surfaces of Roger Herman's 
16 moderately scaled paintings at Ace Gallery. Transitional in the best sense 
of the term, these predominantly abstract canvases preserve key elements of 
earlier works while groping around to discover an unanticipated pictorial 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman's new paintings maintain much of the manic visual energy that animated 
his all-over, jigsaw-puzzle compositions from four years ago. They also attest 
to his continued interest in paint's juicy fluidity, previously demonstrated by 
a series of gigantic -- sometimes overblown -- blue paintings exhibited two 
years ago at the L.A. County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most intriguing aspect of Herman's recent work is its flirtation with 
representation, a mode the L.A.-based artist has not approached since his huge 
woodcuts from the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 It is significant that flowers appear only in Herman's smallest new paintings, 
three pictures of poppies that look more like exuberant explosions of color 
than actual bouquets. Such decorative flourishes have, in the past, been 
thought of as the enemy of painting, too silly and frivolous to be taken 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group, Herman's new paintings try to fuse prettiness with vigor. Scaled 
back from his past series, they struggle and stutter to articulate repressed 
connections between beauty and aggression, making a mess of restrictive 
categories rather than accepting worn-out ideas.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INSURANCE BILL WOULD 
STREAMLINE QUAKE PAYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) introduced a bill Tuesday that would 
require insurance companies to make most checks for earthquake damage payable 
directly to homeowners, rather than to homeowners and their mortgage holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would permit homeowners to cash such checks without obtaining the 
endorsement of a lender or anyone else with a security interest in the damaged 
property "unless whoever had the security interest provided proof such coverage 
was required by the lending agreement," said Kip Wiley, a Hayden legislative 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders often insist that homeowners carry fire insurance, but not earthquake 
insurance. Since the Jan. 17 temblor, however, many homeowners who bought 
earthquake insurance on their own have been angered when they received claims 
checks naming their lenders as co-payees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Crystal, regional manager of Western Insurance Information Service, a Los 
Angeles group that represents about 125 residential lenders, said, "If it does 
indeed completely relieve the insurance companies from any potential lawsuit, 
then we don't have a real problem with it. However, I don't know that it does 
that."  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden decided to introduce the legislation after state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi dropped a plan earlier this month to take action on the co-payee 
issue.  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi backed off that plan last week when lenders promised to respond with 
a lawsuit. Garamendi said such a suit would only continue to hamper the 
rebuilding effort.

PRAISE THE LARD; GOOD NEWS ABOUT LARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HENSTELL, Henstell does nutritional analyses of recipes for The Times 
through his company, Nutricomm. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lard has gotten a bad rap. Nowadays the nutritionally conscious will recoil in 
horror from a dollop of lard as they would from sin itself and then blithely 
turn and add butter that, truth to tell, isn't a bit better and may even be a 
lot worse. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 The story starts with one simple and unfortunate fact. Americans generally get 
too many of their calories from fats -- fats of all varieties. At the start of 
this century -- supposedly the bad old days of nutrition -- Americans got about 
32% of their calories from fats. Today, in the supposed age of enlightenment, 
that figure is up to 37%! In 1990, Americans ate an average of 63 pounds of 
fats each -- up 10 pounds over 1970. Hence the single recommendation of just 
about every authority: Eat less fat. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the same as eliminating fat, not that anyone really could. Fats 
provide oils the body needs but doesn't make on its own. But you can -- and 
should -- try to reduce your intake of saturated fats because your body does 
make all of them that you need. (Saturated fatty oils generally come from 
animals. You can tell them because they are thick when chilled.) So eat less 
saturated fats and more unsaturated fats. But you've heard this before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lard is an animal fat associated with the pig and it's been around a long 
time, so it gets shoved into the "bad fat" group along with oils such as 
coconut and palm. It's not yellow and sweet like good butter, so it seems to 
come out first on everybody's fat hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reality, butter is higher in the bad saturated fats than lard. 
According to Dr. Jacob Exler of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service Human 
Nutritional Information Service, butter has about 50% saturated fat while lard 
has only 39%. Butter is twice as high in cholesterol. Lard is higher in 
calcium, a good mineral. And, he points out, the butter we generally mean when 
we reach for the spreader is salted, which means that butter is noticeably 
higher in sodium than lard. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter does have more Vitamin E and also is slightly lower in calories -- 
chiefly because the standard stick of butter is 60% moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same is also true of other rendered fats. Duck and goose fat are only 
marginally higher in cholesterol than lard (but still well under half as much 
as butter) and rendered chicken fat is even lower than lard. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, remember Rule No. 1: Eat less fat. But if you have your fat intake 
under control, when you yearn for the texture and taste that only lard can 
deliver, it's OK to indulge. In moderation.

PRAISE THE LARD; RESTORING A FAT'S SPATTERED REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZARELA MARTINEZ, Martinez was raised on a rancho in the state of Chihuahua, 
Mexico. She opened her restaurant Zarela in New York in 1987. Her cookbook Food 
From My Heart was published by MacMillan in 1992. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Mexican chef and restaurateur, I am always being asked, "Do you cook with 
lard?" 
</P>
<P>
 My answer is always, "Yes, yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 I love lard. I use it when I want its flavor, as in refried beans, or the 
lightness and fluffiness it brings to tamales, or the crispness it gives to 
pastries and fried antojitos , or the way it melds the flavors of the countless 
ingredients in some moles.  
</P>
<P>
 But when I first moved to New York, I was surprised to find that hardly anyone 
there cooked with lard. They said lard severely shortened your life span. (I 
thought about my great-aunts who died in their late 90s, and how the only 
cooking fat they'd ever used was lard.) 
</P>
<P>
 They told me it had a peculiar odor and a bad taste. When I tried the 
commercial lard available in New York, I understood what they meant. I'd grown 
up on home-rendered lard, made from pigs lovingly fed on the scraps of my 
mother's delicious cooking and on the corn and acorns from our ranch. 
Store-bought lard is nowhere as good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder people were avoiding lard. "People are so proud of not eating 
something they wouldn't eat anyway," Kurt Vonnegut told me one recent 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up on a cattle ranch in northern Mexico. There were no stores around 
for 50 miles, and we grew our own food. So when it was zucchini season, we ate 
zucchini almost every day, and when we killed a cow, we ate beef every day. But 
when we killed a pig, we could have an endless array of flavors.  
</P>
<P>
 Pig butchering was always a cause for celebration. All the ranch women would 
congregate in my mother's kitchen to gossip, laugh and turn every part of the 
pig into some delicacy. One of the legs was made into chorizo sausage; another 
would be cut into thin strips, coated with red chile paste and air-dried for 
carne adobado . Still another leg was given to the cowboys, and my father would 
make a ham with the remaining one. The skin and the feet would be pickled. Even 
the blood was used -- it went into an aromatic morcilla (blood sausage). 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fat, huge tubs were set out on the barbecue pit for rendering it 
into lard. As a byproduct, this produced scrumptious chicharrones (cracklings), 
with their crunchy bits of meat sticking to the fat. My sister Aida would eat 
the fat and throw away the meat -- I would eat the meat and throw away the fat. 
And we liked the rendered lard itself so much (especially the sediment, with 
its crunchy bits of crackling) that we would spread it on freshly made corn 
tortillas in place of butter.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The feast always ended with a joyful tamalada , a tamale-making party. We'd 
beat the cornmeal masa with the lard until it floated, spread it on corn husks 
and roll up the tamales with a filling of meat from the pig's head and the 
butt, cooked with lots of garlic, oregano and peppercorns, shredded and mixed 
with red chile salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 When I give cooking lessons, I defend lard. I tell my students that it is the 
most misunderstood of fats; according to the USDA it has less than half as much 
cholesterol as butter. On the other hand, it contains a large amount of oleic 
acid, which actually helps break down cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 (After one of those classes, the food writer Peggy Knickerbocker told me the 
Lard Trade Board should make me their spokes-model, the way the Avocado Trade 
Board hired Angie Dickinson a few years ago. I politely declined the 
suggestion, not because I had any serious quarrel with lard but because I did 
not want to be the butt of lard jokes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Considering lard's present disrepute, it's difficult to believe that up until 
the '20s, when commercial oils and shortenings started making an appearance, 
lard was the principal cooking fat in this country. Cooks trusted lard. When 
vegetable shortening came on the market, Crisco tried to look as much like lard 
as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pork and all its products have been used since the Neolithic Age, when man 
learned to grow crops and domesticate animals and settled down to live in 
villages, where there was a steady supply of food. The sheep and goats helped 
clear the land of weeds and wild grasses to make way for crops. Pigs could not 
digest grasses and weeds, but they could be fed on scraps from the table. They 
were a walking garbage disposal -- or let's say, recycling -- system. 
</P>
<P>
 Once salting and smoking were discovered as methods of preservation, pork 
became even more valuable. The lean, dry, stringy meat of goats and sheep is 
less suited to these methods than pork. Preserved, the pig guaranteed a supply 
of food for the lean winter months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fattening pigs became a central part of family life and started as soon as the 
piglets were weaned. In many places the butchering of pigs coincided with the 
time of harvest. It was a time of rejoicing, and pork and its fat soon became 
associated with holidays. Witness the Christmas ham or suckling pig of today, 
and the sweets made with lard (such as bizcochos ) or fried in it (the Italian 
sfince , the Latin American bunuelos ). 
</P>
<P>
 Montse Guillen, a Catalan chef, once told me that though she cooks with olive 
oil, she always adds a spoonful of lard for flavor. George Lang, the famed 
restaurateur and author of "The Cuisine of Hungary" (Atheneum: 1971), says: 
"When making dishes with paprika, the Hungarians use lard almost exclusively, 
because the burning point of lard allows the paprika to release a higher 
percentage of its color and flavors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pork is so important in China that the word for meat literally means pork. 
Until the extraction of oils from plant sources was perfected in this century, 
lard was used in Chinese cooking both for deep frying and stir-frying. Cookbook 
author Barbara Tropp writes that it is still used in shrimp pastes and dim sum 
pastry doughs.  
</P>
<P>
 Pork was important in Europe too, and not just in the Germanic and Slavic 
lands. Paula Wolfert quotes a chef in "The Cooking of Southwest France" (Harper 
& Row: 1983) as saying, "You must understand how important the pig is to us. It 
is the basis of our cuisine." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Spanish arrived, the indigenous people of Mexico used no fats at 
all; frying was completely unknown. But when the pig was introduced, lard began 
to appear in everything from refried beans and tamales to crisply fried tacos. 
Even stewed dishes often contain a step where ingredients are fried; lard 
beautifully melds the flavors and textures in moles and pipianes .  
</P>
<P>
 It is still a favorite Mexican cooking fat. However, most Mexican cooks are 
using safflower and other oils these days because they're cheaper.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in lard's fall from popularity, of course, was the discovery of 
the connection between cholesterol and animal fats such as lard, butter and 
beef tallow. But fats and oils, which differ mainly in that fats are solid at 
room temperature, have more in common chemically than people think. Both are 
made up of a glycerol molecule linked with three compounds belonging to the 
group known as the fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a fatty acid molecule is a chain of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms. 
The length of this hydrocarbon chain varies, but there is a maximum number of 
hydrogen atoms it can have. If a molecule has its full capacity of hydrogen, it 
is called saturated. If it has two fewer hydrogen atoms, it's mono-unsaturated, 
and if it has room for four or more hydrogen atoms it's polyunsaturated.  
</P>
<P>
 Though shortening and margarine are made from plant sources, they have to be 
hydrogenated to give them a solid consistency. Hydrogenated -- that is, 
saturated. They're still plant products, but the health benefits of mono- or 
polyunsaturation have suddenly diminished. The hydrogenation process also 
produces trans-fatty acids, which are considered to be as harmful as saturated 
fats in causing coronary heart disease.  
</P>
<P>
 And the hydrogenation process also lowers the smoke point (the temperature at 
which fats break down into gas). Smoking margarine or shortening doesn't just 
smell bad, it produces chemically active materials that remain in the liquid 
and may ruin the flavor of fried foods. And the scorching also produces the 
chemicals classed as free radicals, which have been associated with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While vegetable oils have a smoke point of 450 degrees, hydrogenated 
shortenings smoke at 370 degrees. Lard, however, has a smoke point of 400 
degrees. When it's flavor and crisp texture you want, lard makes an excellent 
fat for pan- or deep-frying. 
</P>
<P>
 Because lard has a grainy texture, its coarser and less homogeneous particles 
separate the gluten from each other in dough, producing wonderfully flaky 
crusts. In doughs made with the rolling-and-folding method, it isolates whole 
sheets of dough from each other. This is true of home-rendered lard, but less 
true of the homogenized varieties available in most grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lard has a place in the kitchen, not only because biochemically it is not as 
great a villain as it has been made out to be -- it's superior to other 
saturated fats and contains large amounts of beneficial fatty acids, namely 
oleic acid, which helps keep arteries unclogged -- but because in some dishes 
no other fat will do. Most of the dishes at my restaurant are not made with 
lard, but there are some I just won't make without it. 
</P>

 "En escabeche" means pickled in vinegar. "I don't know what makes this a crazy 
escabeche," says Martinez. "That's just what it's called." The cinnamon called 
for here, as in most Mexican recipes, is true or Ceylon cinnamon, which is 
paler and more delicate than what we call cinnamon in this country (American 
"cinnamon" is more correctly called cassia). Quintana Roo oregano comes from a 
tree, rather than a shrub, and has long leaves that turn black when they dry. 
Ordinary or Mexican oregano can be substituted for it.

 These Central American filled tortillas are known as pupusas in San Salvador. 
In Mexico, where they are called tlacoyos, they're shaped like a huarache 
(sandal), by which name they are also known. They're often sold on the street 
at stands called agachados ("hunched-over ones"), which have no seating, so the 
customers eat standing up, hunched over the counter. The fillings for tlacoyos 
vary, but beans are especially popular. When topped with salsa fresca, some 
sliced longaniza (a spicy sausage) and shredded queso fresco (fresh Mexican 
cheese), they make a great appetizer or even a light dinner. Most of the 
ingredients, including the queso fresco, masa harina and longaniza, are 
available in Latino grocery stores.  
</P>
<P>
 BEAN-STUFFED CORN TORTILLAS 
</P>
<P>
 (Tlacoyos) 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon lard 
</P>
<P>
 1 small onion, thickly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup pureed cooked black beans 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups masa harina 
</P>
<P>
 Warm water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound sauteed sliced longaniza or chorizo sausage, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh salsa, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Before beginning, prepare anti-stick liner for tortilla press by cutting open 
2 sides of 1 medium-size (6-inch-square) heavy plastic bag, such as zip-closing 
freezer storage bag, to make rectangle at least 12x6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat lard over medium-high heat in small, heavy pan until melted lard ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 Add onion and fry, stirring often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove and 
discard onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Add pureed black beans to lard, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, 
until mixture has reduced to smooth paste, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine masa harina and 1 cup warm water in medium-sized bowl. Using wooden 
spoon or hands, mix to form smooth, somewhat stiff dough. Add more water as 
needed. If using fresh masa, place in bowl and work with wet hands to check 
consistency. If it is crumbly, work in water by tablespoons until masa holds 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Dampen hands with cold water and shake off excess. Shape dough into 10 to 12 
equal balls, about size of ping pong balls. Dampen hands again as needed. Take 
1 ball, pat to form 3-inch circle and place 1 teaspoon bean puree in center. 
Fold sides of tortilla over bean puree and roll carefully back into ball shape. 
Repeat with remaining balls. Keep balls covered with damp towel while working 
to prevent drying out. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat until drop of water sizzles 
on contact. Using paper towel dampened with vegetable oil, quickly rub surface 
to grease.  
</P>
<P>
 Open tortilla press and place plastic liner in it with creased edge next to 
hinge. Place 1 ball dough in center of press between flaps of plastic, then 
lower top of press and press down lightly on handle to make tortilla 4 to 5 
inches wide and about 1/10 inch thick. Open press. Peel top flap of plastic 
off, lift out tortilla and peel away bottom flap, dampening hands again if 
needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Place tlacoyo on hot griddle and cook until lightly flecked with brown on 
under side, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn with spatula and cook 1 to 1 1/2 minutes 
on other side. Repeat with remaining balls. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, place warm tortillas on plates and top with cheese and sausage. 
Serve with salsa. Makes 10 to 12 tlacoyos, about 6 appetizer servings, 3 entree 
servings.

 These lard cookies come out crisp if they're rolled thin, puffy if they're 
rolled thick. If you have the decorative bizcocho cutters sold in Mexico and 
the Southwest, you can cut them into shapes of birds, flowers, suits of cards 
and other fanciful images. This is one case where Martinez prefers cassia to 
true cinnamon for a Mexican recipe, because cassia has a sharper flavor. Recipe 
from "Food From My Heart."

 If you don't have a tamale steamer, Martinez recommends propping a cake rack 
on sawed-off tin cans in a large stockpot or Dutch oven, or placing the tamales 
directly on the bottom of a large Dutch oven and leaning them tepee-style 
against a central prop such as a large ball of wadded aluminum foil (if the 
tamales are tightly wrapped, they will not leak when you add the 1 inch of 
boiling water needed for steaming). Remember that water evaporates faster in a 
wider pot. Banana leaves and piloncillo (conical loaves of brown sugar) are 
available in most Mexican markets. Recipe from "Food From My Heart."  
</P>
<P>
 OAXACAN PUMPKIN TAMALES 
</P>
<P>
 (Tamales Miahuatecos) 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound banana leaves, thawed if frozen  
</P>
<P>
 2 heaping cups masa harina 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2 1/2 cups warm chicken stock or water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound lard 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups pureed cooked or canned pumpkin or winter squash, drained if watery 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground Ceylon cinnamon or 1/2 teaspoon cassia cinnamon  
</P>
<P>
 3 ounces piloncillo, grated or crushed, or 1/2 cup firmly packed dark-brown 
sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Bean Filling 
</P>
<P>
 Unfold banana leaves, being careful not to split them unnecessarily. Wipe with 
clean damp cloth and pat dry. With kitchen scissors, trim leaves into 12 to 14 
rectangles, each about 14x11 inches. Save some of longer trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix masa harina in bowl or pot with enough warm stock to make soft but not 
sticky dough. Beat lard in separate large bowl on medium speed until very light 
and fluffy. Add masa harina mixture and pumpkin puree to lard little at time, 
beating on medium speed and scraping down as needed. Mixture should be as light 
as butter cream. Beat in cinnamon, piloncillo and salt to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 or 2 banana leaf rectangles flat on work space. Tear off some long, 
thin strips from reserved banana leaf trimmings. Place 2/3 to 1 cup masa 
mixture in center of leaf and with spatula or fingers spread into 
3x4x1/2-inch-thick oval. Place 1 heaping tablespoon Bean Filling in center of 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold right and left edges of banana leaf toward center to meet, overlapping 
little to cover filling, then fold top and bottom edges to center to make neat, 
flat package about 4x5 inches. Fasten by tying with thin strip of banana leaf. 
Repeat with remaining banana leaves, masa and filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Place tamales flat in steamer, seam-side-up, arranging in layers as necessary. 
Place some extra banana leaves on top to help tamales absorb steam. Steam, 
covered tightly, over boiling water 1 hour, replenishing with hot water as 
needed. Remove steamer basket and let tamales rest 10 minutes before serving. 
Makes 12 to 14 tamales. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 12 tamales contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 351 calories; 184 mg sodium; 20 mg cholesterol; 22 grams fat; 33 grams 
carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 1.13 grams fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean Filling 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons anise 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 dried Oaxacan pasilla or dried or canned chipotle chiles 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2 1/2 cups cooked or canned black beans, drained 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 6 garlic cloves, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lard 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Put water in small pan, add anise and boil until reduced by half. Strain and 
reserve infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 If using Oaxacan pasilla or dried chipotles, cover with boiling water and let 
soak until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and remove stems. Canned chipotles 
need no preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in batches, if necessary, puree beans with chiles, garlic and anise 
infusion in blender or food processor fitted with steel blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt lard in heavy skillet or wide, shallow saucepan over high heat. When very 
hot, add bean puree, watching for splatters. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, 
uncovered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until liquid is 
evaporated. Season to taste with salt. Cool to room temperature. Lard versus

PRAISE THE LARD; EVERYTHING BUT THE SQUEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 At one time I had a close relationship with lard. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when I was working my way through graduate school at the University 
of Iowa by waitressing at the Hawkeye Truck Stop in nearby Coralville. One 
Sunday, I got an invitation from one of the drive boys at the truck stop to 
visit some of his family, who lived way out in the country. Drive boys fuel the 
big trucks, wash windows and, if I recall correctly, thump those 18 tires with 
clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 This drive boy was actually a fully grown white-haired man named Donny, who 
had taken a fatherly liking to me. I don't remember the exact reason for this 
invitation -- I might have complained that I'd lived in Iowa for some time and 
had never been on a farm -- but I do remember the outcome of the visit: I came 
home with a piglet, a little male shoat I promptly named Joey. 
</P>
<P>
 We put Joey in the dog kennel for a few nights, while my boyfriend at the 
time, Alan, built him a true hog pen in the barn. Joey had red bristles with a 
white collar that formed a jaunty chevron behind his ears. He was an affable, 
sporty young pig and I made a pet of him. I was a city girl, and besides, 
befriending pigs was something of a family tradition. My mother had grown up on 
a farm in Delaware, and I grew up hearing about her pet pig, Wallis Warfield 
Windsor Blechman.  
</P>
<P>
 I had always wanted a pig of my own. I taught Joey how to sit and shake hands 
and roll over. He also liked to have his back scratched with a rake. I believe 
he would have done just about anything for a scrap of food. 
</P>
<P>
 We fed him pig chow and scraps I collected at the truck stop. He ate 
everything -- leftover crusts of hamburgers, hash browns, bits of egg and, yes, 
the remains of pork tenderloin sandwiches and bits of bacon. Joey wasn't 
particular. He was just hungry. He was a pig. He ate wilted lettuce clotted 
with Thousand Island dressing, potato parings, flapjacks and chicken-fried 
steaks. But mostly, he ate chop suey rolls.  
</P>
<P>
 Chop suey rolls were these enormous, dark, loathsome fritters that came each 
day with the doughnuts. They were crisp and greasy from deep-frying and thickly 
glazed with white icing, with swirls of cinnamon and candied fruit in them. Not 
even the burliest trucker could eat an entire chop suey roll, and few people 
were tempted to even eat a part of one, so at the end of the day, not only 
uneaten portions of chop suey rolls but entire rolls were left, and they went 
right into Joey's bucket. Joey ate so many chop suey rolls we began to worry 
that he'd end up tasting just like one. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I brought Joey into the house, where his cloven hoofs gained no purchase 
on the hardwood floor; he looked like a wobbly fat woman tottering and sliding 
in high heels. Occasionally, he'd escape from his pen, or pull up his stake 
when we'd tethered him outside. Although I had a lovely, burgeoning garden, he 
always ignored it and ran straight through the hedge into our neighbor's yard, 
where he ate tomatoes off the vine and rooted in the dirt, leaving in his wake 
a swath not unlike those made by a rototiller.  
</P>
<P>
 Once he ran into the street. Traffic stopped. People came out of their houses 
to watch me trying to round him up with a stick, and everyone started yelling 
and hog-calling until I was laughing too hard to do anything. In general, I was 
completely ineffectual as a swineherd, but at some point during each escapade, 
Joey would be overwhelmed by the big world and return voluntarily to his pen. 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough, he was big enough to eat. While I was visiting my parents in 
California, Alan drove him to the meat locker, where they butchered and dressed 
him. When I came home, Alan and I drove out to the meat locker to pick up the 
finished product. The only thing I remember about the locker is that the woman 
who worked there had only one hand -- lost the other to the saw.  
</P>
<P>
 We took home several boxes of tidy little packages, all nicely labeled. 
Sausage. Chops. Loin. Spare ribs. Bacon. Smoked Chops. Feet. My compunction 
about eating Joey was solved upon tasting him: I am happy to report that, 
although he was sweeter and more succulent than any pork I'd ever had, he did 
not, per se , taste like a chop suey roll.  
</P>
<P>
 With the meat came also three five-pound tubs of snow-white lard. Now, Joey 
had a lot more lard on him than that, but one of the ways to cut down on the 
butchering and processing fees was to sell the excess lard to the meat locker. 
I don't recall the figures -- this was years and years ago -- but I think 
selling Joey's lard cut our bill by a good third. 
</P>
<P>
 And 15 pounds of lard is still a lot of lard, especially when you don't know 
what to do with it. I approached it cautiously. I asked around. The older lady 
across the street said she, personally, was fond of lard sandwiches. Another 
neighbor told me that, when it came to pie crusts, lard was unsurpassed. So I 
made a pie crust, which came out flaky and great, although the flavor had a 
slightly meaty edge.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone else suggested I use a little butter as well to dull the meatiness. 
This seemed to work. Next, I tried a whole-wheat pie crust, which also came out 
flaky and great.  
</P>
<P>
 Flaky whole - wheat pie crust ? I was coming around on lard. I also discovered 
that meat browns beautifully in lard. And then I solved a long-standing 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 I had grown up in Southern California, next door to the Garcia family in 
Altadena. Alva Garcia, a terrific cook, made what would become for me the 
definitive rice and beans. She patiently demonstrated to me how to make her 
rice: She started by sauteing a bit of onion in lard, then added the rice and 
stirred it until it turned "rosy" or just began to brown.  
</P>
<P>
 But in all these years I had never managed to replicate the distinctive robust 
flavor and silkiness of Alva's rice. The reason was that I had doggedly been 
using butter instead of lard. I'd never dreamed that lard was the crucial 
element -- that is, until I had lard in my, well, larder. 
</P>
<P>
 Lard, it turned out, solved the mystery of the dreary rice. Lard also turned 
out to be the missing element in my attempts to re-create Alva's albondigas 
soup. Clearly she browned those albondigas in lard. 
</P>
<P>
 We ate all of Joey's meat, and a good portion of his lard. When we were down 
to a few pounds of ground sausage and the last pair of feet (I'd used the first 
pair in making a daube glace ), I found us another pig. She was a wild little 
black and white piglet I named Mrs. Bennett, after the matriarch in "Pride and 
Prejudice." I was more savvy with Mrs. Bennett. I did not teach her any tricks. 
And I already knew how to use her lard. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, I have used lard only when making tamales, rendering my own 
from the fat covering the pork butt. I trim the fat and cut the trimmings into 
small pieces, some of which have bits of meat attached. I put the trimmings in 
a heavy pan and render them slowly. Homemade lard, unless you strain it, has 
some of those good bottom-of-the-pan flavor flecks in it.  
</P>
<P>
 The by-product of this rendering process is chicharrones -- little chunks of 
quintessential crispness. Homemade chicharrones , which often have chewy bits 
of meat on them, bear only a distant relation to the store-bought variety. 
Lunch on tamale day is always chicharrones tacos made with mashed-up avocado, a 
squeeze of lime and good salsa. These tacos are awfully rich, but the 
combination of leathery tortillas, crunchy chicharrones and velvety avocados 
makes for a kind of textural epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to make tamales to render your own lard or make your own 
chicharrones , but you do need to find a place that sells trimmed pork fat. I 
recently approached the butcher at the Silverlake Mayfair. "Do you have any 
pork fat for making chicharrones ?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 He gazed at me coolly. "Oh, ma'am," he said, "you'll have to special-order 
that." My next stop was downtown, at the Grand Central Market, where the first 
butcher I saw promptly brought out a tray heaped high with excellent-looking 
pork fat, much of it with bits of meat still clinging. I bought two pounds for 
two bucks.  
</P>
<P>
 The following tacos are so rich and intense in their pleasures, it's rare that 
any person can eat more than two. The chicharrones -- and therefore the lard -- 
can be made an hour or so before a meal, so that you can use some of that 
homemade lard and make rice or refried beans to accompany the tacos. If you 
wish, you can warm chicharrones by sticking them briefly in a hot oven or very 
briefly under the broiler.  
</P>
<P>
 CHICHARRONES TACOS (AND HOMEMADE LARD)

</P>
<P>
 Cut pork fat into 1-inch squares. Place in skillet and cook slowly over 
medium-low heat. Continue cooking until fat is crisp. Pour off lard and reserve 
for other use. Drain chicharrones on paper towel. Salt to taste, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel and pit avocado, then mash with lime juice and salt to taste. Heat 
tortillas. Assemble tacos so that each has handful of chicharrones, dollop of 
avocado mash and salsa to taste. Makes 8 tacos.

 This Spanish rice is not, I'm afraid, the exact recipe taught to me years ago 
by my beloved neighbor. This version has, I think, more tomatoes and vegetables 
and is a bit juicier. It's a bright, colorful dish that nicely showcases lard's 
subtle virtues and is great, possibly even better, reheated the next day.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lard, preferably homemade 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, chopped

</P>
<P>
 Combine green and red peppers, tomatoes and chicken broth in bowl. Set aside. 
</P>

WESTSIDE WATCH: DILLS, 84, MINES OLD GOLD OF HUMOR IN PRIMARY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decked in white slacks, a sport coat and bow tie, state Sen. Ralph Dills 
(D-Gardena), whose district includes Venice, Westchester and Marina del Rey, 
plays a saxophone in a black-and-white billboard photo. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan: "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 84-year-old lawmaker's opening salvo in his June 7 primary 
campaign. It could be the toughest race in his Sacramento career, which dates 
to the 1930s. Two of his opponents, Torrance Councilman George Nakano and 
Venice attorney Mike Sidley, say he has been in Sacramento so long that he has 
lost touch with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of ducking the issue, we made it a positive," said Tim Mock, Dills' 
local campaign manager and coordinator. "We've had a very good response." 
</P>
<P>
 The same ad is featured in campaign mailers, which outlines Dills' record and 
includes quotes such as "I've played sax a lot longer than Bill Clinton's been 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad "is an opening line, a 'Hi, how are you?' " said Richard Ross, Dills' 
campaign consultant. "People smile. That's all it's intended to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For many voters, Dills is a brand-new candidate. Because of redistricting, his 
Gardena-area 30th District was carved up, forcing him to run in the newly 
formed 28th District, which also includes Torrance, Carson, Compton and 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad "is a preemptive strike," said Rick Rosenthal, Sidley's campaign 
manager. "But I'm really wondering if he plays better or worse than Bill 
Clinton."

 GLENN ANDERSON, WATCH WHAT YOU DO: Former President Richard Nixon may have 
resuscitated his reputation and emerged as an elder statesman before his death 
last week, but he never got his freeway back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, state lawmakers named Route 90, running from the San Diego Freeway 
west into Marina del Rey, in honor of their favorite son. The 2.5-mile Richard 
M. Nixon Freeway was to have been much longer, stretching from Marina del Rey 
to Yorba Linda, Nixon's birthplace. But the project never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 And by 1976, with Nixon in political exile and tarnished by Watergate, state 
lawmakers voted to take his name off the route and simply call it the Marina 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawmakers "quietly eased it out," said Caltrans spokeswoman Patricia 
Reid. According to news clippings from that period, local Chamber of Commerce 
officials requested the name change, and state lawmakers complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's name still is associated with the roadway, however, but far from the 
Westside. Locals in Yorba Linda still call a very short stretch of Route 90 
through town the Nixon Freeway. Even so, most maps refer to it by its official 
name: Imperial Highway.

 NESSIE SURFS MALIBU: Malibu environmental activist Mary Frampton has received 
hundreds of calls from marine enthusiasts in the three years since establishing 
the Dolphin Watch telephone hot line. But none like one this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I'm out here at Zuma (Beach) and I'm seeing something really strange," 
reported a caller named Bob. "It's got a long eel-like neck and bows its head 
up. It looks like . . . the Loch Ness Monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, dude! Like, it really could be Nessy. Last month, researchers in Britain 
debunked that famous picture of the whatever-it-is poking its serpentine neck 
out of a lake in Scotland. Turned out to be a 12-inch-high model made of 
plastic wood and a toy submarine purchased in a Woolworth's. So, we hereby 
christen the legend of the Loch Pacific Monster. Anyone got a number for the 
National Enquirer?

 The prize is a $330-per-month job with long hours, lots of dissatisfied 
clients, and no job security. Yet when election year rolls around in Beverly 
Hills, half a dozen candidates typically jump into the fray and spend with 
great gusto -- eager to secure a council seat in the city with international 
cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight candidates in the city's April 12 City Council elections had plunked 
down a total of $153,395 in campaign cash as of March 26 -- the latest date for 
which figures are available. That is lower than in some previous city 
elections.

<P>
 In the 1984 race, eight candidates spent $380,000; in 1986 six hopefuls spent 
$225,000. And in 1988, two council candidates alone parted with $195,492. 
</P>
<P>
 But the campaign spending in Beverly Hills this year still eclipsed that in 
other Westside races. In fact, it exceeded by more than $17,000 the amount 
spent by council candidates in all three of the other Westside cities with 
elections April 12 -- West Hollywood, Malibu and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills candidates acknowledge that campaign outlays in their city are 
steep. Businessman Les Bronte, who won a council seat this month in his first 
attempt, said his campaign costs could rise to $61,000 -- including $25,000 of 
his own money -- when all accounts are settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy to spend that kind of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Bronte said, challengers must spend heavily to get the same name 
recognition as incumbents, who go before the public every week during council 
study sessions and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Insecurity, he said, also causes local spending to soar: One candidate's 
supporters see another's bringing in large donations of $5,000 and feel they 
must keep pace. "You really want your candidate to win, but realize it takes 
dollars," he said. Competing against each other, he added, candidates tend to 
raise and spend what the community will bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The election) becomes an auction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city's League of Women Voters attempted to curb spending before 
that year's election by brokering a voluntary agreement among candidates to 
limit expenditures to $50,000. Only one of the nine candidates in 1992 exceeded 
the limit. The league raised its ceiling to $60,000 for this year's campaign. 
Final finance reports are not in, so it is uncertain if any of this year's 
council hopefuls topped the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 MeraLee Goldman, the top vote-getter in the Beverly Hills council election, 
said campaign outlays in her city are "outrageous." Goldman, who as of March 26 
had spent $36,575, said costs are high because serious candidates must send out 
mailers, place advertisements in the local papers the Friday before the 
election, and post flyers on doors the day before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Candidates) spend it because it's traditional," Goldman said. With four 
citywide mailings, lawn signs and other expenses, she said, "we did what we 
considered the minimum amount to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring cities, candidates are astonished by the campaign spending in 
Beverly Hills. Steve Martin, who won a seat on the West Hollywood council this 
month, said even the Beverly Hills League of Women Voters ceiling, $60,000, is 
"an absurd amount to spend." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin estimates his final campaign bill will come to $20,000 -- about $5,000 
less than he had wanted. His fund raising, he said, came up short in part 
because two council members -- Abbe Land and Paul Koretz -- are competing for 
contributions in the city to finance their runs for state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started (fund raising), people felt they had already been picked on," 
he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City's freshman Councilman Ed Wolkowitz said his city has some campaign 
spending traditions, but "we don't spend $60,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolkowitz, who expects his campaign bill to total $19,000, said poor economic 
conditions have dampened fund-raising prospects. Wolkowitz said the amount he 
spent was adequate to run an effective campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he acknowledged, "There's this mind-set that more is better, and the more 
you raise, the better your campaign is and your candidate is. There's ego 
gratification in raising money." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, Bronte described a different sort of gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the privilege of serving the community of Beverly Hills," he said. 
Then he added with a laugh: "It's for going to a lot of dinners and eating a 
lot of food I don't like." On the Costs of Campaigning 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's outrageous," said newly elected Beverly Hills Councilwoman 
MeraLee Goldman of campaign spending in the city. But "(candidates) spend it, 
because it's traditional," she said, adding that she hopes her final tally 
won't come near the $60,0000 voluntary ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Martin, West Hollywood's freshman councilman, called $60,000 "such an 
absurd amount to spend." He expects to spend $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City's freshman Councilman Ed Wolkowitz said his city has some campaign 
spending traditions too, but "we don't spend $60,000." He expects to spend 
about $19,000. Top Spenders

COUNCIL VOTES TO BUILD SHELTER FOR HOMELESS; ORDINANCE: SANTA MONICA'S APPROVAL 
OF 100-BED FACILITY COMPLIES WITH STATE COURT RULING. LAW BANNING AGGRESSIVE 
PANHANDLING ALSO IS ENACTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council once again tried to legislate away the city's 
homeless problems Tuesday night by voting for a new 100-person homeless shelter 
that will allow the city to legally remove people from the parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also enacted a law banning aggressive panhandling and removed 
loopholes from the park closure law that allowed people to remain in the parks 
while they were asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision on the location of the shelter will be made next week. 
However, the staff has recommended city-owned property at 505 Olympic Blvd., 
formerly a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary shelter, proposed by Councilman Paul Rosenstein, will cost 
$390,000 to set up and $365,000 a year to operate. It will be run by the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein proposed the shelter to comply with a recent state Court of Appeal 
ruling that people cannot be removed from public parks unless they are offered 
a place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shelter would bring the number of city-funded shelter beds to 150. 
There are also 276 privately funded shelter beds in the area. Recent counts 
found between 91 and 133 people sleeping in the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Asha Greenberg and Robert T. Holbrook, who brought about the 
round of legislation by demanding stricter policies, voted against the shelter 
because the council declined to pay for it from the social service budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spends $1.3 million yearly on homeless services, and Greenberg and 
Holbrook have been pushing to direct funding away from emergency services in 
favor of programs working on long-term solutions to homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said the plethora of emergency services makes Santa Monica a magnet 
for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Abdo defended the effectiveness of the social service agencies, 
saying they are held to high standards of accountability. "To think (the money) 
is being squandered or wasted is wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Santa Monica's homeless community and their advocates were out in 
force at the council meeting Tuesday night, pleading with the panel to take a 
humane stance, not a punitive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought for this country, why can't I live in it?" asked James Cole, a 
resident of Santa Monica for 26 years who was dispossessed when the city bought 
and closed the trailer park where he lived. "Why has my dignity been taken away 
from me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Ruiall, a panhandler, asked not to be stereotyped as aggressive. "Most 
of us are polite," he said. "You go to work . . . This is work for us until we 
get a permanent home." 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeless speakers complained of police harassment, citing an incident 
Sunday night in which, they alleged, a police officer stomped on food brought 
to them at City Hall. Officials said the allegations would be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers and some residents, however, said they were fed up with 
homeless problems and the council's record of dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has grappled for years with the problems but has had little 
success. Critics charge the council has been particularly attentive in election 
season; three seats are up in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Sedillos, who represents a public safety group, Save Our City, chided the 
council for conducting its "fourth annual masquerade as champions of public 
safety . . . The people of Santa Monica are really tired of being jerked 
around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers came armed with tales of lost tourism and convention business. 
Rich Casale, of Loew's Santa Monica Beach Hotel, read from a series of letters 
in which groups chose other area hotels over Santa Monica because of public 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nice hotel in an unacceptable location," stated one letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they voted for the new law banning aggressive panhandling, Holbrook and 
Greenberg said it didn't go far enough. Their proposal to outlaw panhandling at 
night and on the Third Street Promenade was squelched by City Atty. Marsha 
Jones Moutrie, who said such restrictions would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Moutrie said the legislation she drafted is no more strict than a state law 
already in place, except the city ordinance offers local police explicit 
guidelines.

COMMUNITY NEWS / SANTA MONICA: NEW PANEL TO STUDY AIRPORT SAFETY ISSUES; 
REGULATIONS: AFTER THIRD FATAL CRASH IN FIVE MONTHS, COMMISSION CREATES 
CITIZENS GROUP TO INVESTIGATE CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Airport Commission is creating a citizens committee to study 
safety issues following the third fatal crash in five months involving the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a fresh wave of concern among Westside residents, the 
five-member commission agreed to establish an ad hoc committee made up 
primarily of representatives from communities near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to limit this to Santa Monica because the airport touches more 
than one community," said John Ezell, commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The action follows a crash last week in which a pilot was killed. It was the 
third time since November that a small plane has crashed into a densely 
populated Westside neighborhood. The accidents resulted in five deaths, all 
aboard the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport, one of the busier single-runway facilities in the nation, had 
averaged a crash a year until recently, a safety record that airport officials 
have lauded. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials insist that the airport is safe, and no evidence has 
surfaced to suggest practices there contributed to the recent crashes. 
Preliminary findings by the National Transportation Safety Board have suggested 
that mechanical failure was to blame in all three crashes; final inquiry 
results are not expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the airport's many adversaries have latched onto the string of 
tragedies to renew their call for changes at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 At a commission hearing Monday night, residents reissued longstanding 
complaints about airport noise, low approaches, pilots who ignore a ban on 
night departures and a general indifference to neighbors' complaints by Federal 
Aviation Administration employees stationed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Commissioner Brian Ouzounian argued successfully to limit the ad hoc 
committee's focus to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue at hand is planes falling out of the sky and crashing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the neighborhoods to be represented on the panel are the Lincoln Place 
Apartments in Venice, Sunset Park and Pico in Santa Monica, and parts of West 
Los Angeles bordering the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport and city officials, as well as representatives of airport-based 
companies, also will serve on the panel; the FAA will advise the group. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the City Council postponed until next week a debate on 
whether to hire an outside safety consultant to evaluate the airport. JEFF

COMMUNITY NEWS / DOCKWEILER STATE BEACH: KIDS CLEAN BEACHES TO MARK EARTH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after the first Earth Day was born in a swell of national 
concern for the environment, many of the adults who lived through it now feel 
helpless to remedy the still smoggy skies, polluted waters and endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the 4,000 Los Angeles-area children who came out to clean Dockweiler 
State Beach and the Long Beach city beach last Friday, Earth Day. Not only do 
they believe there is a solution, they believe they are part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a hazy blue sky, 12-year-old Jindry Acosta of Sylmar knelt on the damp 
sand near the water's edge and poked at a piece of kelp with a gloved hand. 
"There's oil stuck on it," he said as he examined the blackened seaweed. 
"People have to stop doing it. A lot of animals are dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people could die too." 
</P>
<P>
 The children collected tons of litter and debris on the beaches as part of the 
Adopt-A-Beach program overseen by the Malibu Foundation for Environmental 
Education and the California Department of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses rolled into the Dockweiler parking lot from locations throughout the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The children hit the beach, armed with sea-green bags for recyclables and 
royal-blue ones for trash. They spread out across the sand in a sea of bright 
hats and colorful T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 They picked up cigarette butts, bits of plastic foam and surf-worn glass. They 
found needles, a baby bottle, plastic straws and even a piece of what was once 
a city sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they hoped the awareness spurred by the classroom lessons and 
the massive cleanup would spread from the children to families, friends and 
fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break on a bench with a group of friends, third-grader Gharieb 
Elsayed surveyed the beach in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks a little better," he said. "If we all work together we can probably 
do it. The beach is a fun place to go but it's not fun when there's too much 
trash." SUSAN BYRNES

COMMUNITY NEWS / HOLLYWOOD: QUAKE AID RELOCATES TO SERVICE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last disaster application center that opened after the Northridge quake 
closed last weekend and the operation was transferred to an earthquake service 
center in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The service center opened Monday at 6385 Hollywood Blvd. It will be open 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily except Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of the emergency following the Jan. 17 quake, state and federal 
disaster relief officials operated 21 disaster application centers. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS / BEVERLY HILLS: RESTAURANTS WEIGH BAN ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Beverly Hills took a cautious step this week toward what many believe will be 
inevitable: a ban on smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that our ordinance will be changed, and if you think it 
will stay the same, you're deceiving yourself," Beverly Hills Councilman Allan 
L. Alexander told several dozen restaurateurs, hotel operators and business 
people who turned out Tuesday to informally discuss a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills enacted such a ban in 1987, but it was snuffed out after four 
months under pressure from restaurant owners who said they were losing patrons 
to neighboring cities that did not have smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year the cities that surround Beverly Hills -- Los Angeles and West 
Hollywood -- adopted anti-smoking ordinances. Nearby Santa Monica also recently 
prohibited smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills has been taking a wait-and-see attitude, watching the legal 
challenges to Los Angeles' ban and legislative limits being discussed in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get calls in favor of a smoking ban every day, asking when we're going to 
adopt an ordinance. Politically, it's time to place it on the (City Council's) 
agenda and adopt it as legislation," said Beverly Hills City Manager Mark 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will be discussing how to draft anti-smoking regulations in May, 
after which more informal workshops will be held for local businesses to 
participate in developing the ordinance, Scott said. All five council members 
have expressed support for a ban, and many restaurateurs seemed resigned to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate-n-Al's owner Sandy Mendelson said he is convinced that business would 
pick up if the restaurant was smoke-free. He has thought of banning smoking on 
his own but would prefer the city bear the scorn of his employees, many of whom 
are heavy smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have empty tables in the smoking section. (Customers) don't want to sit 
near the smoking section, and our turnover is suffering. We're losing business 
to neighboring cities," Mendelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some restaurateurs said they would fight a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The operators of Beverly Hills' large hotels said they would oppose any ban 
that would include restaurants within the hotels. City law now requires 
eateries to set aside 60% of their seating for nonsmokers, but hotel 
restaurants are exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The general manager of Beverly Hills Hotel, Kerman Beriker, said he is 
concerned about international tourists, who often are heavy smokers and who 
comprise about 30% of the hotel's patrons. Officials from other hotels agreed, 
saying they worry that tourism from overseas will decline if visitors can't 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it be a business decision; let it be our decision. I should have the 
right to decide how to run my business," said John Indrieri, general manager of 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Fleischman, owner of Tatou, which is not a hotel restaurant, said: "We've 
experienced every sort of pestilence over the past couple years in Southern 
California. We need to keep tourists coming to this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' 123 restaurants posted $135 million in sales in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Restaurant Assn. has urged the passage of statewide smoking 
regulations in order to even the playing field for all restaurants. The 
association supports a bill backed by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) that would ban smoking in all workplaces, including restaurants 
and bars.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill was amended by a Senate committee last month, prohibiting cities from 
adopting stricter anti-smoking legislation, and could allow smoking in up to 
25% of the space in restaurants. Friedman has said he will drop the bill unless 
the amendments are removed.

 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 CULVER CITY: The City Council this week unanimously voted to reinstate funding 
for a Fourth of July fireworks show, after a lapse of two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual fireworks display was canceled after the 1992 Los Angeles riots led 
to an increased concern for public safety, city officials said. In 1993, the 
city did not have money in its budget for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Police Chief Ted Cooke reassured the council Monday safety at the 
event would be ensured. The Culver City Exchange Club, a public service group 
that has sponsored the fireworks show on the Culver City High School athletic 
field since 1950, offered to donate $8,500 toward the $27,000 cost of the 
fireworks and insurance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously agreed to locate a farmers market in a vacant 
downtown lot known as Block C. 
</P>
<P>
 The market will be held weekly on the lot owned by the city's redevelopment 
agency. It is located east of the Culver Hotel, north of Culver Studios.

COVER STORY; BEGGING BACKLASH; AFTER YEARS OF TOLERANCE, CITIES WITH 
'COMPASSION FATIGUE' HAVE BEGUN GETTING TOUGH ON PANHANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around lunchtime, Bob Colley takes up his perch near the main post office in 
Santa Monica. Clad in a soiled blue sweat shirt and gray dungarees, he sits on 
the front steps and murmurs the same question, over and over, to passersby: 
"Hey, excuse me . . . you got any change?" 
</P>
<P>
 Colley, a 49-year-old Oklahoma native who is homeless, says he's been 
panhandling since 1984, ever since he finished serving a sentence in California 
state prison for check forgery. No steady job has ever worked out, he says, and 
family members have not kept up with him. So he begs for the things he needs to 
buy -- namely "booze, cigarettes and food." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people frown at or ignore him. But sometimes he makes a relatively large 
sum. He says that one Christmas, panhandling in Westwood, he took in $224 in 
less than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had both pockets stuffed with big bills, 10s and 20s," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Colley and thousands of other Westside street people are on a collision 
course with increasingly irate city councils, businesses and even 
social-service organizations. Fed up with a rising number of complaints from 
residents and merchants, historically tolerant cities such as West Hollywood 
and Santa Monica have adopted or are considering get-tough measures designed to 
curtail or outlaw panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are beginning to wonder if, in the words of homelessness expert Madeleine 
Stoner, "compassion fatigue" has set-in among Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a homeless backlash nationwide," says Stoner, a professor of social 
work at USC who has written extensively about homelessness. "Communities that 
had lenient rules are now passing anti-encampment ordinances. What's 
interesting is that a lot of the backlash isn't coming from mean-spirited 
citizens or right-wing fundamentalists, but rather from people who have spent a 
long time dealing with homelessness. They're just frustrated by the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities that have taken a relatively hard line against the homeless 
have gotten even tougher. In 1993, 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills passed a law prohibiting "aggressive solicitation, drinking in 
public, (and) sitting or lying, or leaving personal property in the public 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration has focused largely on panhandling, which regularly brings 
homeless people into contact with other residents. Public protests have reached 
high tide in Santa Monica, where the combination of affluent residents and 
well-funded charities has made panhandlers gravitate to the Third Street 
Promenade and nearby areas. The city has tried various measures to alleviate 
panhandling, including a program that began last year in which passersby were 
urged to drop money into a sculpted dolphin rather than give it to beggars. The 
money is earmarked for homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with no visible relief yet, pressure is mounting on the City Council to 
consider far tougher proposals, some of which simply seek to get rid of 
panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just getting to the point where you can't stand it," says council member 
Robert T. Holbrook, who -- with colleague Asha Greenberg -- is leading a drive 
to regulate panhandling. "You can't walk a block (along the Promenade) without 
being panhandled four or five times." 
</P>
<P>
 What rankles Holbrook is so-called aggressive panhandling, in which a beggar 
uses threatening or harassing tactics to get what he or she wants. Such 
behavior, the councilman says, drives customers away from local businesses. 
Moreover, homeless people in general require a disproportionate amount of 
attention from police and paramedics, Holbrook says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he would like an outright ban on panhandling -- or, failing that, at 
least some enforceable restrictions on the times and places that begging is 
permitted. On Tuesday, a proposal by Holbrook and colleague Asha Greenberg for 
"time and place" restrictions failed after the city attorney said the measure 
would be unconstitutional. The council did pass a local law prohibiting 
agressive panhandling, however, and Greenberg said she would continue to press 
for tougher steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts argue that it will take more than get-tough proposals to deal 
effectively with panhandling. Although there are no reliable statistics on the 
number of panhandlers on the Westside, the Los Angeles Services Authority has 
estimated there are about 80,000 homeless people on streets in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panhandling and begging has had a resurgence over the last five years," says 
Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the Ocean Park Community Center, a 
network of emergency shelters in Santa Monica. "In the Reagan era, we cut a lot 
of our social safety net, and now we have to deal with the consequences of 
that. But you can't just outlaw panhandling and think you've solved the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who tries such an approach is likely to face a stiff legal challenge 
anyway. Marsha Moutrie, city attorney for Santa Monica, said that courts have 
generally held that panhandling is a protected form of speech under the 1st 
Amendment, although governments may carve out limited exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, courts have allowed cities to regulate where, when or how 
panhandling can take place, Moutrie says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police and merchants complain that panhandlers take unfair advantage of their 
free speech rights, demanding money in a threatening manner that sometimes 
borders on extortion. They also say that too many beggars use the money for 
criminal or self-destructive ends, rather than for basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Commander Keith Bushey of the Los Angeles Police Department says that under 
recent court decisions police have "lost the power to arrest" all but the most 
aggressive panhandlers. Those arrested are usually found to be involved in 
criminal activity, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual for us to take a panhandler into custody who has a decent 
sum in his pocket, $30 or $50," Bushey says. "In that case, (people who give 
money are) just paying for somebody's drug trade." 
</P>
<P>
 On any given day, dozens of panhandlers and homeless people can be seen on 
Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood pushing shopping carts brimming with empty 
bottles. Carlos Gonzalez, a private security guard who patrols a strip mall 
near Sunset and Poinsettia, confirms that panhandlers have adopted increasingly 
aggressive tactics, including waylaying drive-through customers at fast-food 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers don't like it," says Gonzalez, who often shoos away the same 10 
or so panhandlers every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet hiring a security guard is not enough for the merchants of West Hollywood, 
who in recent years have grown increasingly weary of panhandlers roaming Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who are really homeless and need help, and then there are 
panhandlers doing it as a scam," says Donny Cacy, franchise owner of a 7-Eleven 
in West Hollywood. "Those are the kind of people we need to get rid of, people 
who don't want to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Cacy, along with other merchants and community leaders, helped 
develop "Give the Right Thing," a program designed to discourage panhandling 
through the distribution of cards listing city services for the homeless. 
Moreover, the West Hollywood City Council last year passed an ordinance banning 
"coercive or intimidating" panhandling. A similar statute is on the books in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some homeless people, panhandling is a way of survival," says Dan Fisher, 
program director of the West Hollywood Homeless Organization, a nonprofit 
relief agency partly financed through city funds. "Unfortunately, for a large 
percentage of (homeless) people, it's just a tax-free form of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher discourages people from giving money to panhandlers, who he says often 
engage in "defeating" behavior such as drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue may yet spread to other communities. Mark Lorimer, assistant city 
manager of Malibu, says there are "hot pockets" of panhandling in his city. 
"It's an issue we've been trying to keep a handle on with basic (police) 
enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandlers say that police enforcement has often been excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 The police will "take me down to the station for being drunk in public, even 
when I'm not," said Robert Price Alexander, a 35-year-old homeless man who grew 
up in Australia and now lives on the streets of Santa Monica. "Even when I'm 
stone-cold sober." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some say panhandling makes people uncomfortable because it calls attention to 
society's failings, moral and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been enough done" to end homelessness, Stoner, the USC 
professor, says. "All we've done so far is try to offer emergency help. Now 
we're beginning to have to address longer-term solutions." Stoner says she 
sometimes gives money to panhandlers herself, but it's "a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to get rid of panhandling, you have to address the circumstances 
that are forcing people out into the streets, (like) unemployment and 
recession," says Marguerite Waller, a UC-Riverside English professor who lives 
in Santa Monica and has spoken out on behalf of homeless people at City Council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are desperate," Waller says. Panhandling "isn't a scam. Real 
criminals have homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Such distinctions carry little weight with leaders such as Holbrook, the Santa 
Monica councilman. He intends to push vigorously for a city law banning 
panhandling, even if it means an eventual showdown in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a City Council that has the guts to try and see if this can pass the 
Constitutional test," Holbrook says. "We have to have the courage to do what we 
think is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back on the streets, Alexander joins Bob Colley on the steps of the 
Santa Monica post office. Alexander, who has walked with a teak cane since 
being hit by a car about five years ago, offers to recite an original poem for 
a dollar. After finishing the recitation, he reports that he makes $10 on a 
typical day, "$20 if I'm lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 He is asked what he and his homeless friends will do if a law is passed 
against panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 He considers the question for a moment and then responds: "We'll keep doing 
it. Of course."

REGIONAL REPORT / EXPOSITION PARK; NEW MUSEUM DIRECTOR SAYS RAISING MONEY IS A 
PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dinosaur exhibits and a saber-toothed cat logo once drew the most attention at 
Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum. But recent turmoil among the staff 
and the appointment of a new executive director have become the focus of recent 
public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, museum officials announced that James Lawrence Powell will replace 
Craig C. Black as head of the 80-year-old institution, effective July 1. 
Powell, executive director of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, will 
inherit a museum plagued by internal turmoil and a budget that has been 
whittled from about $14 million to $9 million by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Volpert, chairman of the museum's foundation, said Powell's 
appointment reflected the need to improve morale at the museum as well as 
increase financial support for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpert said Powell's expertise as a fund-raiser and his academic credentials 
would help attract money and enhance the museum's reputation. "He's a very 
experienced person. Just look at his resume," Volpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from his home in Philadelphia, Powell agreed that 
fund raising must be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that one of the reasons the board hired me is because of my 
fund-raising skills, and I enjoy doing it and have a good track record," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a geologist, currently serves on the National Science Board. Before 
coming to the Franklin Institute in 1991, he was president of Reed College in 
Portland, Ore. He served as president of Franklin and Marshall College in 
Lancaster, Pa., from 1983 until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell helped raise almost $9 million in less than two years and helped 
reorganize management of the Franklin Institute's staff, said Franklin 
Institute executive director Joseph Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment marks the end of an 11-month search to replace Black, whose 
12-year tenure as museum's executive director recently came under fire and led 
the County Board of Supervisors to order an audit of the Exposition Park museum 
last year. The report prepared by the county auditor-controller's office found 
museum managers had violated Civil Service rules during a recent round of 
layoffs and failed to maintain an adequate inventory of the museum's 
collection.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report found that Black used county employees to remodel his 
Hancock Park home and said the county had not been fully reimbursed by the 
museum foundation for the work. He was cleared of any serious wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Black announced his retirement a few days before the report was issued. He 
declined to comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A private firm searched nationwide for a replacement. Powell was selected from 
four finalists. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

TELEVISION: PUBLIC ACCESS IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your article that focused on the quasi-commercial use of public 
access (Westside, April 21), in reference particularly to the subject of people 
developing shows that they hope will be picked up for sale to a larger 
audience, I think there is a point that was missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the self-styled producers of public access programming are dedicated 
to what they consider their art form. As in any art form, there are artists of 
varying levels of talent, experience, notoriety and accomplishment. 
Unfortunately, television as a performing art is perceived by many as only 
having value if it makes a buck. In a world where television is big business, 
there is an extremely small outlet to any sizable audience. Public access 
channels give everyone an opportunity to have their point of view or artistic 
vision viewed by an audience without having to pull in a large enough viewer 
share to maintain a slot on commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a filmmaker and frequent public access producer who finds it an excellent 
way to distribute my artistic vision for the medium. I am a filmmaker with many 
network credits, but I do not want to wait around for somebody I don't even 
know to decide to put the show I want to produce on the air. I created it 
because I want it to be seen. Would I like to get paid for it? You bet! Until I 
do, the audience gets to see something they would not otherwise have a chance 
to see. I have had calls after every one of my shows from viewers telling me 
that they enjoyed my show more than anything else they've seen on television, 
commercial or otherwise. That's what makes it worthwhile to me. 
</P>
<P>
 If people like Art Fein and Victoria Looseleaf were only out to make big bucks 
on commercial television, they would have given up after a few shows. Vincent 
van Gogh sold only one painting in his life. If he had given up painting 
because nobody wanted to buy his work, the world would be less one master 
painter and all of his phenomenal art. While many public access shows do 
reflect a lack of technical expertise and the expensive production value of 
professional shows, these individuals have, nonetheless, made themselves into 
real television producers, delivering programs they hope will entertain or 
enlighten an audience. Public access gives every individual a broadcast voice. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the insinuation that the producers who make "audition tapes" are less 
than ethical because they would like their shows to be picked up for a paying 
audience: Who wouldn't like to be paid for their work? It would be akin to 
faulting street musicians for wanting to get a recording contract or begrudging 
artists whose paintings are hanging in restaurants hoping a gallery or museum 
director will notice them and want to put them on a more prestigious wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, in reference to the "pipe dream" of someone from a network 
channel surfing by and finding the next big hit show, some of my work not on 
the show was licensed by MTV after a producer there caught one of my public 
access shows. Ironically, the film that caught his eye was nixed for broadcast 
on MTV (as it has been by other networks) because of its controversial nature. 
In other words, he never would have seen it if it hadn't been for public 
access. Ha! I can do something he can't do!

DEVELOPMENT: VENICE BOARDWALK DEBATE RAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since The Times considers it fitting to allow ad hominem comment in the debate 
on the refurbishment of the Venice Boardwalk, I trust I will be given leave to 
reply in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Abcarian (in his letter of April 21, 1994) is the one who ignores the 
truth. Hundreds of Venice residents did indeed spend four years of hard work in 
workshops and hearings to develop the draft Venice Urban Waterfront Restoration 
Plan and its sequel, the Venice Boardwalk Historic Refurbishment Plan, authored 
by the leading Venice civic organizations. Those who participated in scores of 
workshops -- all open to the public -- note that Mr. Abcarian did not deign to 
participate, but now wants to stop the process and dictate how the boardwalk 
area will be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Abcarian is correct in quoting me as saying that I do not consider him and 
a band of outsiders led by Santa Monica resident Jerry Rubin to be serious 
opposition. It's hard to take seriously a few individuals who are four years 
late in the process, use intimidation and vitriolic personal attack as tactics, 
and who have never cared to extend any courtesy to those residents who in good 
faith put in their time to develop plans to solve the many chronic problems 
facing the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of putting in the hours of study and meetings we did, Mr. Abcarian 
advances a plan that Jerry Rubin claims to be his, but which largely comes from 
our document with a few changes in numbers and conclusions. However, while ours 
is a master plan for the boardwalk built along a historical theme, his is a 
hodgepodge that would maintain unsafe restrooms, dangerous curves on the bike 
path, inadequate lighting and a toxic surface for the boardwalk that threatens 
the Santa Monica Bay with more petroleum runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, The Times proved my contention that outsiders are behind much of the 
noise about boardwalk refurbishment plans by publication of the letter that 
followed Mr. Abcarian's. It was a factually flawed discourse written by Mr. 
Alexander of Hawthorne repeating much of the same hysterical misinformation we 
have heard before. It does, though, raise an interesting question for Mr. 
Abcarian -- where in Venice does one find the little burg of Hawthorne? Is it 
near Oakwood or the Oxford Triangle? Maybe it's so far out on the Venice 
Peninsula that I never noticed it.

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: INTELLIGENCE IS IN THE MIND OF THE BEHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How intelligent are you? 
</P>
<P>
 I'll bet you would answer with at least some reference to your IQ, grade-point 
average, college degrees or standardized test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a growing movement among educators to rethink the concept of 
intelligence as something more diverse than scholarly or "book" knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted primarily by Howard Gardner, a professor of education at Harvard 
University, the theory of "multiple intelligences" holds that reading, writing 
and arithmetic aren't the only kinds of intelligence we should recognize, 
foster and celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gardner and his proponents say that seven kinds of intelligence 
exist, that they're all equally valid and useful, and that most people are 
strong in at least a couple and could probably improve in all. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a plethora of research on the theory of multiple intelligences, and 
much of it is tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 I've boiled down my reading, however, to provide a simple outline of Gardner's 
intelligence categories. See where you or your child fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, only a few of Gardner's categories of intelligence are 
traditionally measured in standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those is, of course, linguistic intelligence. People who excel in this 
area can smoothly manipulate words. They can speak and write clearly and 
persuasively, and with a sophisticated vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they generally read avidly and write as a second career or 
hobby. They often enjoy word games such as crossword puzzles, word search, 
tongue twisters and puns -- and you'll want them on your team for Scrabble, 
Taboo or other word games. 
</P>
<P>
 Students with strong linguistic intelligence succeed in English and history 
courses, maybe not in math or science. Later, they often enter careers such as 
journalism, law, acting or public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Logical-mathematical intelligence is also widely tested and familiar. It's the 
numbers game: being able to reason, sequence and spot patterns with numbers. 
Such people can think in wordless yet clear images, compute numbers quickly and 
like to have as many things measured and categorized as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously they do well in math and science courses, and are ripe for careers 
in science, engineering, computer programming and medicine. Carl Sagan, Madame 
Curie and probably everyone in the NASA control room are examples of 
logical-mathematical intelligence to the "nth" degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Spatial intelligence is also recognized and tested to some extent in many 
students' lives. It denotes the ability to perceive and rearrange the 
visual-spatial world. People in this group are good at noticing and remembering 
visual details, drawing or sketching accurately and thinking of new ways to 
arrange objects visually or spatially. 
</P>
<P>
 They're often good at puzzles and other visual games (and can probably spot 
those trendy hidden, three-dimensional pictures that I never can). They 
typically have vivid dreams, a keen sense of direction in even unfamiliar 
places and prefer reading materials that are densely illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Frank Lloyd Wright, film director Steven Spielberg and (my idol) 
clothing designer Donna Karan are masters of spatial intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical education and sports aren't often taken seriously as types of 
intelligence, but Gardner implies that they should be. This category of 
bodily-kinesthetic intelligence includes those who have unusually good physical 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 They are adept at body movements and handling objects, generally take part in 
a sport or activity regularly, use plenty of hand gestures when speaking, can't 
sit still for long and enjoy crafts or building things. Athletes and 
craftspeople fit this type. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical intelligence is fairly easy to define. It almost goes without saying 
that people with this intelligence can perceive and appreciate subtleties in 
music and to some degree produce melodies and rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a "good ear" that easily discerns off-key notes. They can sing in 
tune and keep time, might play an instrument, and may prove able dance 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Gene Krupa, opera diva Leontyne Price, pop singer k. d. lang, and 
choreographer George Balanchine are examples of such intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpersonal intelligence, in at least a small dose, is needed by everyone 
who does not live isolated: It is the ability to relate successfully with other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters of this type of intelligence are able to perceive and respond to 
people's personalities, can organize and motivate people easily, are often 
sought for advice by peers, are good judges of character and are often found in 
leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a "people person" feels comfortable in a crowd and prefers group sports 
or activities to more solitary pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense, then, that people with strong interpersonal intelligence do 
well in such careers as teaching, politics and personnel management. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's a category of intelligence that I believe is actually basic 
to all the others: intrapersonal intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 It means, quite simply, knowing oneself -- being aware of emotions, strengths, 
weaknesses, behavior patterns, goals and other character components. People who 
excel in this area probably spend time reflecting, meditating or exploring 
other means of soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 They record hallmark events and thoughts in journals, maintain clear goals, 
consider criticism calmly and occasionally take a hard look at their positive 
and negative attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 People in this category are often strong-willed, are unafraid of spending time 
alone, have strong opinions that may not be mainstream and are often 
self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophers, social scientists and many writers generally possess and work to 
lead others to the kind of deep self-awareness that Gardner calls intrapersonal 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 In my next column, I'll discuss how school curricula can more thoroughly 
polish multiple intelligences, and how even mature adults can still improve in 
any of the categories.

OUT AND ABOUT / CAT & FIDDLE: FOR HOLLYWOOD, A PUB OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some things you won't usually find at the Cat & Fiddle. A trendy Los 
Angeles attitude, for instance. And it's not dark and dank like some bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cat & Fiddle does serve up tasty English specialties. It offers live 
music on its garden patio. And it's a great place to sink a pint of beer and 
sling some darts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it," said owner Kim Gardner, 46, "a pub is a poor man's 
nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade ago, the English native and his wife, Paula, got tired of 
driving to Santa Monica to drink "decent pints of beer." So Gardner decided it 
was time that Hollywood had a pub of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 With little experience and a lot of enthusiasm, Gardner, a musician who has 
played bass with the likes of Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and the Rolling Stones, 
set out to create a British pub, complete with dartboards and a snooker table. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought it was a strange gig for a bass player," Gardner said. "I 
didn't know anything about the (restaurant) business." 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the 50-seat bar on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and named it in honor of 
a pub where he played stand-up bass as a teen-ager. It was an instant success. 
Two years later, the pub moved to its present location at 6530 Sunset Blvd., 
once home of the popular Chinese restaurant Sunset Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its British offerings, the decor is more like that of a Mexican ranch 
house. It is built around a romantic Mediterranean-style terrace. The patio is 
surrounded by white, stucco walls and wrought-iron gates. Tiny lights are 
strung through trees, making it a great place to dine and watch the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Using some of his mother's recipes, Gardner serves up traditional pub fare, 
including shepherd's pie, lamb chops, fish and chips, bangers and mash. A good 
selection of English beers are on tap, which has helped to attract a loyal 
following of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll grab dinner and a couple of beers," said Rohitash Rao, a Hollywood 
resident and an art director who stopped by on a recent Tuesday night. "The 
atmosphere is very friendly. . . . It's so wonderful to sit outside and have a 
beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Sunday from 7 to 11 p.m., the restaurant features the Pat Britt/Wilbur 
Brown & Friends Jazz Quintet on the patio. Occasionally, Gardner plays a set or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have great music," said regular customer Shawn Gallipeau. "There's 
something for everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cat & Fiddle is at 6530 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. Hours are from 11:30 a.m. 
to 2 a.m. daily. Information: (213) 468-3800. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

 DEPARTING COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Academy has notified girls' basketball Coach Ed Aronin that he will 
not be returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin, 50, was told in a letter from Principal Gina Marie that his coaching 
philosophy did not meet school standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know exactly what she means by that," Aronin said in dismay. "I 
handled myself and the team in a professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Marie refused to comment about Aronin's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin, a lawyer, was a walk-on coach at the school for four seasons. He had a 
64-13 record and was named The Times' 1992 Westside Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regals have reached the quarterfinals three of the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Academy (17-3) had to forfeit a game against Immaculate Heart when 
Aronin substituted a junior varsity player who had played earlier in the day. 
Notre Dame was leading the game by 40 points  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know the rule that a junior varsity player could not play two games 
on the same day," Aronin said. "I was trying to avoid running up the score." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, Notre Dame Academy scored 90 points against St. 
Matthias, with sophomore Taryn Reynolds scoring 51 of the points. Aronin said 
he was criticized for running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Aronin questioned whether that was the cause for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that big of a deal," Aronin said. "I'll get another job. I just feel 
sorry for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin, who has coached softball at Loyola Marymount, is currently a softball 
coach at Malibu High. PITCHING PROSPECT 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine pitcher Cade Gaspar was recently listed as the eighth best major 
league prospect by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, the son of former New York Met Rod Gaspar, has a 4-1 record, 2.66 
earned-run average and 56 strikeouts in 64 1/3 innings. The sophomore 
right-hander has given up only 44 hits, a .191 batting average against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar was listed eighth among the top 25 players expected to be picked in the 
June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves, meanwhile, defeated the University of San Francisco, 10-5, to 
improve to 27-17. After Monday's win, Pepperdine (16-8 in the West Coast 
Conference) trailed first-place Santa Clara by 1 1/2 games with six conference 
games remaining. Pepperdine has a 4-2 edge in head-to-head competition with 
Santa Clara but must win the rest of its games to have a shot at an at-large 
bid to the NCAA tournament. PENNANT RACE 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica has a chance to tie Peninsula for first place in the Bay League 
when the teams play a two-game series this week. The Vikings (10-7, 4-2 in 
league) have lost three games by one run, including a 5-4 loss Saturday to 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula is 6-0 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get guys in scoring position, but we need to clutch up and score these 
runners," Santa Monica Coach Pete McKellar said. "We're leaving (an average) of 
four to five players in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings will need to beat Peninsula pitcher Brian Bowles, who has a 5-2 
record and an 0.85 ERA. Bowles pitched a no-hitter against Hawthorne. SOFTBALL 
MADNESS 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City will see how strong of an arm Kimberlee Johnston has. She will be 
pitching two crucial Ocean League games against Redondo that should determine 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Johnston will match up against Crossroads' Jessica Schulman in 
the second round of the Thousand Oaks tournament. On Monday, Johnston will 
pitch against Santa Monica in a rescheduled game between two of the area's top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, a right-handed senior who signed with Texas Arlington, entered the 
week with a 10-4 record with 168 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a young team to support Kimberlee," Culver City Coach John Sargent 
said. "She's an integral part, but we need the team to play well to beat 
opponents of this caliber." SOARING COMETS 
</P>
<P>
 After opening the season 1-7, Westchester has won 10 of 11 games, including 
eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Those eight victories came in the Coastal Conference, where the Comets are 
battling University for the best record. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering this week's showdown against University, Westchester pitcher Mike 
Escamilla has a 4-0 record and 0.00 ERA in conference games. Jelani Ferguson, 
who pitched a five-hit shutout last week against Manual Arts, has given up only 
one walk in 24 innings. He has a 3-0 record and a 1.65 ERA in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets also have been using sophomore Mike Hayes as a spot starter and he 
has an 0.88 ERA in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to make a good coach out of me," Westchester Coach Ron Kasparian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting has played a big part in the Comets' rebound. Rod Washington leads the 
team with a .415 batting average, followed by Seka Edwards (.379) and Henry 
Jones (.367). 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets' exceptional speed has contributed to an area-leading 16 triples. 
Jones and Ramel Greenfield each have three triples. SCHEDULING WOES 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica Coach Norm Lacy got his wish and filled one of two openings in his 
football schedule. Unfortunately, the Mariners will have a tough task when they 
open the 1994 season at Westchester in the first meeting ever between the two 
Westside schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my hands full," Lacy said. "Other than that, everything is pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners also play nonleague games against Santa Clara, Blair, St. Francis 
and Calabasas. They begin play in the revamped Camino Real League against St. 
Anthony. They also play Verbum Dei, Harvard-Westlake and Cantwell-Sacred Heart. 
HOT STREAK 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's Brandon Pernell hit his sixth home run Saturday in a 10-4 win 
over Harvard-Westlake. Pernell, a junior shortstop, drove the first pitch of 
the fourth inning over the left-field fence to make the score 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell also hit a home run April 20 against Harvard-Westlake to tie the 
score, 4-4. The Vikings won that game, 5-4, on Paul Lopez's home run with two 
outs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Melendez, who plays for the Dodgers' double-A team in San Antonio, holds 
the school record with nine. RECRUITING 
</P>
<P>
 One of the area's top point guards, Duane Davis of Fairfax, scored 830 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-foot junior is eligible to take campus visits in September and accept 
a scholarship during the November signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis averaged 15.2 points and 3.9 assists and was named to The Times' 1994 
Westside all-star second team. FALCONS PICK KLEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Former Palisades and Carson High quarterback Perry Klein was selected by the 
Atlanta Falcons Monday in the fourth round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3, 210-pound Klein, who attended Cal before transferring to C.W. Post in 
Brookville, N.Y. for his senior season, passed for 3,757 yards and accounted 
for 4,042 yards in total offense in 1993 to lead C.W. Post to a 9-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought it was stupid for me to leave Cal, but I felt like the 
situation at Cal was a dead-end for me," said Klein, whose family lives in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein worked out for Falcon Coach June Jones and assistant Mouse Davis on 
April 18 at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, the guy can throw it," Jones said. "In high school, he completed 
46 of 49 once and (speaking) as a former quarterback, you don't do that even 
throwing against air most days." SEAN WATERS and JERRY CROWE

 NEW CLIMATE: Football star Todd Steussie isn't used to cold weather. He went 
to high school in Agoura and college at Berkeley.Well, he'd better buy some 
long johns. He's been drafted by the Minnesota Vikings -- and drafted is 
certainly the right word. "My head's spinning," he said after returning from 
two days in Minneapolis. (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 NO EXCUSE: Giving to the needy is not always convenient. No wonder, then, that 
a lot of would-be donors won't take the time to drive to their local Salvation 
Army. Well, for some West Valley do-gooders, now there's no excuse. The 
Salvation Army is coming to you! . . . All you have to do is leave donations by 
the curb, where they will be scooped up once a week (B6). 
</P>
<P>
 UNINTIMIDATED: CSUN basketball officials have got things all wrong. Somebody 
should tell them that when you lose a lot of games, you should plan an easier 
schedule, not the other way around. Yet, even though the Matadors finished 8-18 
last season, they've added Pepperdine and UNLV to next year's schedule. . . . 
That's not all. The school may move to the Big West Conference (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 OUTDATED: Seismologists must not be too sentimental. Otherwise, why would they 
continue to suggest that the Richter scale no longer be used to measure 
earthquakes? After all these years, why mess with tradition now? . . . It's 
simple, really. It's not precise enough for the bigger temblors and "it is not 
based on well-defined physical principles," according to one expert. Michael

FEDERAL OFFICIALS OFFER PLAN TO REFURBISH, PROTECT GRANT'S TOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of bad press and an attempt by Illinois to take the monument 
away, the National Park Service unveiled a plan Wednesday to refurbish and 
revitalize the beleaguered Grant's Tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper Manhattan burial site of Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President, has 
long been a target for vandals, graffiti artists and homeless people seeking 
shelter, and attendance has dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which needs congressional approval, would provide $400,000 for 
the current fiscal year and $450,000 next year. The current operating budget 
including salaries, maintenance and operating costs is $323,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came on the 172nd anniversary of Grant's birth and the tomb's 
97th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the Park Service follows through, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) 
said he will introduce legislation today calling for an independent assessment 
of the site's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the site was only staffed during business hours. It will now 
be staffed seven days a week, and nighttime security will soon be in place, 
Park Service regional director Marie Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves come in the wake of stories detailing deteriorating conditions at 
the tomb where Grant and his wife, Julia, are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, descendants and admirers of Grant sued the federal government to 
restore the monument. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems had persuaded the Illinois Legislature to propose moving the 
bodies to Galena, Ill., Grant's adopted hometown.

 TUNING IN? To many, Timothy Leary epitomized what was wrong with the 1960s, 
embracing psychedelic drugs and counterculture theories. But Leary has remained 
in demand for a new generation and will speak today at Chapman University's 
"Gathering of the Minds." It's a daylong symposium with numerous avant-garde 
leaders of the '60s. . . . His topic? The program says: "The High Priest of the 
'60s drives you into realms of sensory overload with his 21st-Century band of 
technoillusionists."

 POPULAR ART: "Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection" at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum is drawing such a good crowd it's going to be extended a 
month -- through July 3. Its 122 craft objects, drawn from a private collection 
in Northern California, have brought in 6,700 visitors the past month. . . . 
Says Newport Harbor spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber: "I think it's so popular because 
it's reaching a broad range, both people who like visual arts plus the craft 
audience."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARTER GETS RECORD, BLUE JAYS GET ROUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things started off well for Joe Carter and the Toronto Blue Jays Wednesday 
night at Arlington, Tex., as Carter set a major league record by driving in his 
30th run of April with a single in the top of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter drove in Paul Molitor from second to give Toronto a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the night belonged to the Texas Rangers, who banged out 12 
hits -- 11 singles -- to record an 11-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers scored three runs in the bottom of the first and got five more in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers (2-2) gave up six hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out seven and 
walked two as the Rangers won consecutive games for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter started the day tied with Ron Cey (1977), Dale Murphy (1985) and Dave 
Winfield (1988), all of whom had 29 RBIs in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco got things going for the Rangers in the first when he singled 
home David Hulse. Doug Strange then delivered a two-run single to give the 
Rangers a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas added a run in the second with the help of two fielding misplays by left 
fielder Carlos Delgado. Delgado was charged with an error when he failed to 
pick up Dean Palmer's single, allowing Palmer to take second. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Lee then reached second when his line drive to left hit off the heel of 
Delgado's glove. Palmer scored on Hulse's second single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers took a 5-2 lead in the third on Pat Hentgen's wild pitch, and 
added five runs in the fourth, highlighted by RBI singles by Canseco and Will 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 8, Chicago 7 -- Rookie Manny Ramirez hit a two-run homer and Mark 
Lewis hit an RBI double as the Indians scored three runs in the 12th inning to 
beat the White Sox at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians stopped a string of six consecutive losses to the White Sox and 
moved a game ahead of them in the American League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago committed five errors, including two in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox had taken a 7-5 lead in the top of the inning on Darrin 
Jackson's two-out, two-run double off Eric Plunk (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 But Chicago's defense -- ranked 13th in the league entering the game -- was 
true to form in the bottom half. Third baseman Robin Ventura booted Paul 
Sorrento's leadoff grounder for the White Sox's fourth error, and one out 
later, Ramirez homered off Roberto Hernandez (1-1), his fifth of the season and 
second in two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Merullo walked, and Chicago second baseman Joey Cora bobbled Kenny 
Lofton's grounder, sending Merullo to second. Lewis then doubled into the 
corner in left. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams stranded runners at third base in the 11th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle homered and drove in three runs and Carlos Baerga had three hits 
for Cleveland. Belle extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a two-run 
homer in the fourth, his sixth of the season and his third in three days, and 
added an RBI double in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, 2-12 in extra-inning games last year, are 3-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 1, Oakland 0 -- Billy Hatcher drove in the game's only run with a 
groundout and also threw out a runner at the plate as the Red Sox won at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Boston's 14th victory in April, tying the franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Athletics have lost nine in a row, and 10 in a row to the Red Sox, dating 
back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Viola (1-1) beat Ron Darling (2-2), giving up two hits and five walks in 
six innings. The A's hit into four double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was the first time Viola and Darling had faced each other since a 
classic NCAA tournament game on May 21, 1981. In that matchup, Darling pitched 
11 no-hit innings for Yale but dropped a 1-0 decision to Viola and St. John's 
in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Bankhead pitched two perfect innings, and Jeff Russell worked the ninth 
for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling gave up five hits, striking out six and walking three in his first 
complete game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 12, Seattle 2 -- Jim Leyritz hit the Yankees' third grand slam in 
five days in this game at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees sent much of the Kingdome crowd heading for the exits with a 
five-run fifth inning capped by Leyritz's line-drive homer to center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Leyritz's third homer of the season and the second grand slam of his 
career. Paul O'Neill hit a grand slam for the Yankees Saturday and Matt Nokes 
hit a grand slam against the Angels on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees scored five runs on seven walks and a hit batter in the third 
inning.

 The Oakland Athletics released reliever Dave Righetti and recalled Vince 
Horsman from triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Righetti, 35, whose 252 saves are the the most by a left-hander, had no 
decisions with a 16.71 ERA in seven appearances.He gave up 13 runs and 13 hits 
in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Horsman, a left-hander, was 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in seven games at Tacoma in 
the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 Righetti, who signed with Oakland as a free agent, is eighth on the career 
saves list.

 The St. Louis Cardinals lost their third pitcher in four days when left-hander 
Rheal Cormier left after one inning Wednesday against the Atlanta Braves, a 
game that was eventually rained out. Cormier, who threw 18 pitches and gave up 
one hit, felt tightness and soreness in his left shoulder "that appeared to be 
muscular in nature," Cardinal spokesman Brian Bartow said. Cormier will undergo 
an MRI test this morning and Manager Joe Torre said he would probably know the 
extent of the injury by this afternoon. . . . The American League denied that 
University of Kansas Chancellor Gene Budig has been recommended by a search 
committee to succeed Bobby Brown as league president. Budig said he had not 
been offered the job, and two members of the search committee said no decision 
had been made.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS FACES DECISION ON DL

<P>
 Pending an examination by Dr. Michael Mellman this morning, the Dodgers might 
be forced to put Delino DeShields on the disabled list, Executive Vice 
President Fred Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Dr. Mellman tells us that Delino needs to be out another four days to a 
week, then we'll make the move and bring a player up," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With each day that he misses, once he starts getting ready it makes it that 
much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields continued to experience headaches Wednesday from the concussion 
suffered in Saturday night's collision with Raul Mondesi. They eased up during 
the day, Claire said, but he definitely will not leave with the Dodgers for New 
York this morning. 
</P>
<P>

 Chan Ho Park, making his second start for San Antonio, shut out Midland for 4 
2/3 innings. He gave up four hits and two walks, and struck out seven. Park has 
pitched 8 2/3 scoreless innings in the Texas League, striking out 14 and giving 
up six hits. He makes his next start Monday, with Claire attending. . . . . 
Mike Piazza drew a rest Wednesday night. He is batting .383 over the last 11 
games, but Manager Tom Lasorda said Piazza still seems to be trying too hard. 
"I don't think he's pressing," Lasorda said. "The word I would use is anxious. 
He's still too anxious." . . . . Lasorda operated out of the third-base 
coaching box, replacing Joe Amalfitano, home with a cold. ROSS NEWHAN

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BUTCHER JUST COULDN'T FINISH

 During their trip East, the Angels lost a catcher and a pitcher to injury and 
had a real scare Tuesday when Jim Edmonds was hit below his left ear by an 
errant throw. But "the weirdest thing of all," Manager Buck Rodgers said, was 
Mike Butcher's "brain cramp," when he gave up four runs with two outs in the 
ninth inning Thursday in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were leading, 11-3, before Butcher threw a pitch behind the head of 
Mark McLemore, gave up two singles, hit Brady Anderson, walked in a run and 
went 2-0 on Rafael Palmeiro before Rodgers replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about ready to pat ourselves on the back and all of sudden we're 
scurrying to get someone up and worrying about losing the game," Rodgers said. 
"He just went bonkers and got so far away from his normal delivery that he 
couldn't keep the ball in the park, yet alone the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher is now in triple-A Vancouver trying to regain his confidence and 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might be a positive thing, though," Rodgers said. "We're still counting 
on Mike Butcher being a guy at the end of a game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, examined by team physician Jules Rasinski and diagnosed as having a 
slight concussion, said he felt worse Wednesday than he did Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little nausea and a little headache today," said Edmonds, who was 
not in uniform for Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds was examined by an eye specialist Wednesday afternoon and was told 
there was no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just fortunate it didn't hit me in the face or the jaw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have decided not to put Ken Patterson on the disabled list for the 
time being. Patterson suffered a torn ligament in his left elbow Sunday in 
Boston and the Angels were expected to call up John Farrell from Vancouver. But 
that would mean leaving a player currently on their 40-man roster unprotected 
because Farrell is not on the 40-man roster. "(Patterson) will go on the DL, 
that's inevitable," Rodgers said, "but I think we'll go with 10 (pitchers) and 
24 (players) for now."  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels might wait for Joe Magrane, who is on rehabilitative assignment in 
Vancouver and is expected to be ready to make his Angel debut early next month. 
. . . . Mark Langston, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery April 12, threw 
off a mound for the first time Wednesday. "We'll see how it bounces back 
(today) and then we'll know where I am," Langston said. JOHN WEYLER

LOS ALAMITOS; LAMBERT PICKS HIMSELF UP TO RIDE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After jockey Jerry Lambert suffered a serious back injury three years ago, few 
thought he would race again. But Friday night at Los Alamitos, Lambert returned 
to the races again.  
</P>
<P>
 A thoroughbred rider who guided Native Diver to stakes victory after stakes 
victory, Lambert returned aboard an Arabian trained by L. Yancey Carter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert failed to hit the board with his first attempt, but returned Saturday 
night and finished first and second on horses trained by Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert began riding in 1958, and few things have kept him away -- not the 
Army, injuries or his 53rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd only been galloping horses two weeks when I rode my first race," Lambert 
said. "It was in Shelby, Montana, and the dust was so thick I couldn't even see 
the turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert rode in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon and Washington 
before trying Southern California in 1962. Almost immediately, he found both 
success and complications. M.E. (Buster) Millerick gave him the mount on Native 
Diver, who went on to earn more than $1 million and retired with 34 stakes 
victories. But almost before Lambert got started, he was drafted.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first day I ever rode Native Diver I got a draft notice in the jockeys' 
room," Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
 So for two years, he was a soldier during the week and rode on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, Lambert was still riding at Golden Gate, Bay Meadows and 
the Northern California fair circuit. The bit broke during a race at Pleasanton 
in 1987 and Lambert went "out the tailgate," as he put it. He suffered broken 
ribs, a broken cheek bone and a broken ankle. Eight weeks later, he was back in 
the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 At Golden Gate in 1990, Lambert's mount ducked the whip and threw Lambert to 
the inside rail. The back injury, a compressed disk, required a year's therapy 
and appeared to have ended his career.  
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Larry Sterling hired Lambert as an assistant manager of his West Coast 
Training Center. But the desire to ride remained, and Lambert started 
exercising horses. Sterling moved to Oklahoma and Lambert moved his tack to 
Emerald Meadows Ranch in Riverside, where he met Arabian trainers Yancey and 
Ruthie Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware of his reputation, but had never seen him ride," Yancey Carter 
said. "He's a great talent and once he started riding, it became apparent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert asked Carter for a chance to ride races and Carter believed it was 
worth a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 30 years of riding thoroughbreds and only a few months aboard 
the Arabians, Lambert says he still is getting used to the new breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not as fast and the conformation and the fractions are different," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lambert plans to continue with Arabians unless Carter decides to train 
thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are trainers and there are horsemen," Lambert said. "And he's a 
horseman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jockeys Carlos Bautista, Eddie Butler and Brian Long each fell -- Long twice 
-- in races during the weekend. Bautista suffered a strained shoulder, but the 
others escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista, who rode 39 winners and finished eighth in the 1993 jockey 
standings, was aboard La Donna Blanca in Friday's fourth race. He was thrown 
after crossing the finish line in a dead heat for second. He was taken to Los 
Alamitos Medical Center and X-rays revealed the shoulder injury and a bruised 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista did not ride again for the weekend, but hopes to on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Long first fell in Thursday's sixth race. He was leading with Y-O Gold Tack 
coming out of the turn when the gelding bolted to the outside. Mike Burgess, 
riding Ringdangdoo and running second, barely avoided Long, who came back to 
ride the next race. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's sixth race, Long again had the lead when he fell. Riding Lovely 
Fashion in a 4 1/2-furlong thoroughbred race, Long lost his balance on the 
backstretch and bobbled along a couple of strides before being thrown into 
traffic. Another horse clipped him in the back of the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one got me. I'm done here," he said, walking off the track and favoring 
his right leg. "I ride thoroughbreds at Santa Anita, and that's it for this 
track. They can keep this."

<P>
 Long rode three races on Santa Anita's final card Monday and finished that 
meeting with three victories, five seconds and four thirds in 78 mounts.

 Beginning tonight, Los Alamitos will increase the purses on thoroughbred 
races. Purses between $4,000 and $7,500 will increase $1,000. Purses of fewer 
than $4,000 will add $500.

 "We did it to encourage more thoroughbreds to race here at Los Alamitos,"

 Trainer Barbara Jagoda would like to start her record-setting Arabian, Magna 
Terra Smoky, in the Equest International California Open on May 13, but she's

 The one-eyed gelding defeated four others in winning the Sierra Knights 
Handicap on Friday, becoming the first Arabian to win 33 races. 
</P>
<P>
 "He only runs in stakes races now and there's one a month (for Arabians)," she 
said. "But we're having trouble filling our races, so I don't know if that one 
will go."

PRAISE THE LARD; OH, LARDY CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 England has a lot of ghastly-sounding sweets, such as singing hinny and 
spotted dick, but the most repellently named of all has to be lardy cake. 
Forget the name, though. Lardy cake is actually a very appealing rustic pastry, 
something between a not-terribly-rich Danish and a very rich scone. It dates 
from the pre-baking-soda age, when all English cakes were yeasted, so it has 
the wholesome aroma of fresh bread.  
</P>
<P>
 In effect, it's a risen puff pastry, and it really has to be made with lard; 
you could never get such a flaky result with butter. And in its defense, two 
ounces of lard compares favorably with the amount of butter in many a pastry 
with a handsomer name. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth David published this Northumberland recipe in "English Bread and 
Yeast Cookery" and commented: "When using home-made pork lard (and it must be 
pork lard, not vegetable fat) rather than the bought variety, it is advisable 
that it be very cold and hard before starting to work it into the dough; it is 
also advisable to cool the dough in the refrigerator between turns, as for puff 
pastry. . . . A final and useful piece of advice comes from a little book of 
Hampshire recipes: '. . . the secret of a good lard cake is to turn it 
upside-down after baking so that the lard can soak through.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David had already observed that only very clean, pure lard can be used for any 
kind of bread or cake: "The slightest taint or rancidity in lard communicates 
itself to dough in a most disconcerting manner. If you cannot lay hands on pure 
pork lard, don't attempt lardy cakes." NORTHUMBERLAND LARDY CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 ounce yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup milk, warm 
</P>
<P>
 Lardy Filling 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour with dash salt and leave in warm place. Cream yeast with sugar in 
bowl, add egg and warmed milk and mix with flour to make soft dough. Cover and 
let rise in warm place until doubled in volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Place risen dough on floured board and roll flat. Spread 1/2 Lardy Filling 
onto 2/3 of dough. Starting from unfilled end, fold 1/3 of dough over Lardy 
Filling, then from filled end fold remaining 1/3 of dough over that, as if 
folding letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll out dough and spread remaining 1/2 Lardy Filling on 2/3 of dough and 
repeat letter-fold process. Cover and allow dough to rest in refrigerator 1/2 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out. Fold in thirds, letter-fashion as 
before, then roll out and fold in same manner once more. Shape to fit 8-inch 
cake pan. Allow to rise, about 1 hour, until dough almost doubles in size. Bake 
at 350 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. Makes about 8 servings.

 Rhubarb is in season now, but any excuse will do to make a classic American 
pie. In modern cookbooks, such as Fanny Farmer, the crust recipe given here is 
likely to call for unspecified "shortening," but lard is what gives this crust 
its light and flaky quality.

<P>
 On lightly floured board, roll out 1/2 of Basic Lard Crust to overlap edge of 
9-inch pie plate by about 2 inches. Fit crust to pie plate. Fill with rhubarb 
mixture. Roll out remaining 1/2 of Basic Lard Crust into circle to cover top of 
pie. Place crust over rhubarb mixture. Trim edges, flute and cut air vents.

 Almost on a lark, we decided to substitute lard for butter in one of America's 
favorite recipes -- the chocolate chip cookie. After Sarah Parsons baked them 
in The Times Test Kitchen, the results were surprising, if a bit mixed. The 
larded version puffed up higher and was crisper than the one made with butter. 
But some tasters objected to the faint meaty taste in the background. Maybe 
some things were not meant to be messed with.

PRAISE THE LARD; RISKY GRIBBENESS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the Jewish version of pork rinds or chitlin's and it is alternately 
spelled gribbeness or griveness or some variant thereof, depending on what part 
of Europe your grandparents came from. It is chicken skin that is cooked until 
laden with fat and crispy to the bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Gribbeness ' raison d'etre around my house was for snacking. It was Jewish 
popcorn. My father once used chunks of it in a chicken sandwich schmeared with 
more chicken fat, and of course my father later in life had heart bypass 
surgery, which for people who eat traditional foods like this is another Jewish 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that back then, in the 1950s, cholesterol was not the feared 
enemy it has become. No one worried about foods of tradition, foods that had 
been around for a century. We ate, we lived to be 80. Who knew? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact was, we didn't have gribbeness more often only because it was a pain 
in the neck to make. 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered the smell of onions frying and the exquisite, oily taste and I 
knew vaguely of the painstaking process; what I didn't know was how, exactly, 
the stuff was made. But bringing up such a subject to my parents at this stage 
of their lives, now that anything fatty is a verboten subject, well, I couldn't 
just call on the phone and say, "Mom, how'd ya make gribbeness ?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This required deft handling. I called my parents, invited them out for dinner. 
We went to a cafe, I ordered a bottle of wine ("That's good for my heart, I'll 
have a glass," said dad), and I slowly guided the conversation around to Jewish 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally I took the plunge. I mentioned it. Mom said gribbeness was chicken 
skin that had been cooked with chicken fat ( schmaltz ) until crispy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, but how did you make it?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I never wrote down the amounts," she said. Then a look came over her 
face and she went back in time to an era when she stood over the stove on a 
Friday afternoon and stirred the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 "You needed chicken skin, chicken fat rendered from the chicken you were 
using, never bought in a jar, salt and chopped onions. I never measured. I 
guess you get about a cup of skin per chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "You almost never got enough fat from one chicken to make it, so you saved the 
fat from one chicken in the freezer until you were cooking chicken again. That 
way you accumulated enough fat to make gribbeness.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I put the salt, the chicken fat and the skin in a pot and put it over a very 
low flame. And I cooked it until it began to turn very slightly brown. Then I 
added the coarsely chopped onions." 
</P>
<P>
 "At what point do you add the onions?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's the tricky part, very hard to teach," she said. "You have to time 
it so when the onions are brown, the gribbeness is crispy. You just have to 
know when to add the onions. If you know the color the skin turns, you'll know 
just when to add the onions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you add the onions too soon, they'll get brown but the gribbeness will 
still be soggy -- and if you cook it too long the gribbeness gets crispy but 
the onions get burned. And if you add the onions too late, they don't get brown 
when the gribbeness is crispy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it seemed to me, this was the Jewish equivalent of cooking risotto: 
You had to watch the pot and stir it constantly or the stuff would ruin. It had 
a mind of its own, and if you turned your back for even 30 seconds . . . poof , 
the whole thing would be overcooked, inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My younger brother, Sid, tripped and fell in the next room one day while mom 
was in the kitchen. "Help me up," he cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm cooking gribbeness ," Mom said, "so come in here and I'll help you up." 
</P>
<P>
 When the gribbeness is cooked until crisp, put it (including the onion bits) 
into a strainer and let the remaining chicken fat drain into a small dish that 
later is placed in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can tell, that leftover chicken fat is good for only two things: 
moistening and flavoring sandwiches and guaranteeing your nephew the heart 
surgeon some business later in life.

PRAISE THE LARD; IN THE KITCHEN; AS EASY AS DUCK SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We were sitting around the other day talking about lard and I mentioned my 
favorite duck chicharrones -- duck skin cooked until the bits of skin are crisp 
and brown in the rendered fat. That sounds great, someone said, but what do you 
do with the rest of the duck? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you could have knocked me over with a tail feather. There is so much you 
can do with a duck that I hardly knew where to start. If, as the old saying 
goes, you can use every part of the pig but the squeal, think of a duck as a 
pig built for two. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove my point, I decided to stop at a local Asian market to get a nice 
fresh duck. The good thing about Asian markets is that the ducks are sold with 
the heads and feet still on. That's nice because the feet add a lot to the 
stock, and with the heads on, you get the full neck, which is loaded with good 
fat. The thing to check, though, is the cavity. Sometimes the butcher might 
happen to kind of accidentally forget to leave in the liver -- strictly an 
accident, you understand, but a near-criminal offense in my book. If you've 
ever tasted a terrine made from duck livers -- or even duck livers just lightly 
sauteed in butter -- you'll know why. They're like Little League foie gras.  
</P>
<P>
 Rinse the duck well, then strip away the skin and any fat and cut them into 
roughly two-inch squares or strips. Put these in a pan with about one-quarter 
cup of water and cook over medium heat. Pretty soon, the water will evaporate 
and all you'll have left is rendered duck fat (the liquid will start to sizzle 
when this happens). Cook it until the skin bits turn dark-brown, then retrieve 
them with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels. Let the fat cool, 
then pour it through a strainer into a glass container. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The skin cracklings, or chicharrones , are terrific lightly salted -- kind of 
like popcorn from cardiac hell. For the more cautious, they can be used as a 
garnish. They're also wonderful folded into an omelet, but don't tell them you 
heard it here. The duck fat you've just rendered is one of the best cooking 
mediums around, with a wonderful brown flavor. I love to fry potato pancakes in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to remove the two duck breasts. Using just the point of a 
very sharp knife, trace the line where the keel bone separates the breasts. 
Lift up gently and continue tracing the line where the breast meat meets the 
ribs. When it is free, remove it to a plate, cover it with plastic wrap and 
repeat on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The breasts are wonderful broiled, grilled or sauteed in a very hot skillet. 
And by serving them separate from the legs, you can cook them to only 
medium-rare, thus keeping them juicy and flavorful. (If you cooked the duck 
with the legs, of course, you would have to have rare-rare legs to get a 
medium-rare breast, and that would be very unpleasant.) 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the legs from the frame and set them aside. Take off the feet and wings 
and put them in a roasting pan. Chop the remaining bones into four or five 
pieces and add them to the feet and wings. Toss in a peeled whole onion and a 
carrot and roast at 450 degrees 30 to 45 minutes or until everything starts to 
brown and smell really good. Using a slotted spoon to leave as much fat as 
possible behind, remove the browned bones and vegetables to a large saucepan. 
Cover well with water, add some parsley stems and whatever else you like in a 
poultry stock, and let it cook over medium-high heat for a couple of hours. Top 
off with water as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the stock is deeply colored, ladle it off into a separate, clean 
saucepan. At this point you will have a delicious, intensely flavored stock. 
Either add a little more water to use it as a base for a duck soup (nothing 
easier), or set it to cook over a low flame and reduce it to a demi-glace, or 
duck jelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing left is the duck legs. These are tendon-y and a bit tough but 
very flavorful. Put them in a shallow pan with a little duck stock. Cook, 
covered, over medium heat for about 20 minutes. Test with a small sharp knife. 
It should slip into the meat fairly easily. Let the legs cool, then remove the 
meat. Shred the meat into strips. (If you're still cooking the stock, throw in 
the leg bones. What can it hurt?) 
</P>
<P>
 This meat is great in salads, as part of a filling for stuffed pastas or even 
for sandwiches. Do a couple of ducks and you'll have enough to make duck 
sausage, if you're that ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the bottom line? Out of one 5 1/2-pound duck, I got three cups of duck 
fat, two cups of duck cracklings, two duck breasts (about 1/4 pound each), five 
cups of concentrated duck stock (enough for two quarts of soup, or 2 cups of 
stiff duck demi-glace), and 1 1/2 cups cooked, shredded meat from the legs. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what you can do with a duck. 
</P>
<P>
 I had duck; I had arugula. How to bring them together? I wasn't sure what my 
dressing would be until I opened the plastic bag of lettuce. The intensely 
nutty smell of the arugula reminded me of sesame oil, so I put together this 
Asian influenced dressing.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 cup duck chicharrones, coarsely chopped from 1/2 of skin of 5 1/2-pound duck

duck. Divide among 4 chilled plates and sprinkle chopped duck chicharrones over 
top. Makes 4 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: ODDS-ON FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Derby is a splendid place, an old race-track restaurant a few furlongs 
east of Santa Anita, hard by chain restaurants and coffee shops and bars with 
fragrant names such as "100-1" and "Drinkers' Hall of Fame." The Derby sign is 
a violent burst of neon in the warm San Gabriel Valley night. There are a lot 
of horsy restaurants in the Southland, in the South Bay and down on old Route 
19, but the Derby might be the grooviest, crowded with well-fed men, many of 
them pretty obviously ex-jockeys; women customers gone prematurely blond; pinky 
rings, pearls and rakish sports coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Waitresses wear tight riding silks, kid around with each other and serve you 
flaming baked Alaska on your birthday. The Derby is dedicated to the memory of 
George Woolf, a jockey who ran the restaurant until he was thrown from a horse 
and killed in 1946, and the restaurant is something of a dark-wood race-track 
museum, with track souvenirs, race-track murals and portraits of the great 
horse Sea Biscuit . . . Woolf's favorite mount. Old racing columns ("Rube 
Barbs"!) mentioning Woolf are printed on the backs of the menus, and 
autographed jockey pictures line whatever wall space Sea Biscuit has left them. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I went to the Derby, after winning the price of a steak dinner 
on a turf race down the street, I almost believed, at least for a minute, that 
I had stumbled into the single best restaurant in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rye Old Fashioned?" the waitress asked. "Will that be a regular, or would 
you like to make that a Daily Double?" 
</P>
<P>
 A minute later, she delivered a tumbler of rye big enough to intoxicate all of 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve a good drink here at the Derby," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Derby, you will find stuffed mushroom caps, and Cobb salads, and good 
shrimp cocktails that sit on a bed of what could be interpreted as celery 
remoulade. There is a respectable assortment of luxury fish and "scampi"; also 
grilled chicken-breast dishes for those who have wandered into here by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 With your meal, you have a choice of gooey, cheesy onion soup, kind of bogus 
but also kind of delicious, or a salad tossed at table. (The croutons are 
tasty, the greens crisp and fresh, but the house dressing the waitress 
describes as "sort of like a Caesar" is more like an oversweet vinaigrette: go 
for the blue-cheese instead.) There is garlic-cheese toast, the powerful, soggy 
kind that is in theory mildly detestable but in practice everyone demands more 
of -- "I feel embarrassed that I have to serve you this terrible stuff," a 
waiter said last week, winking as he set down a basketful, "but it seems to be 
company procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Brasholi," charred steak rolls sauced with an old-fashioned marinara that 
tastes overwhelmingly of tomato paste, should by all rights be dreadful, but 
somehow ends up as something wonderful, a crisp, pungent epitome of '50s 
dinner-party food. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, of course, as at all track-oriented restaurants, the specialties 
involve giant hunks of cow: great slabs of Prime rib with 
horseradish-reinforced whipped cream, rare grilled strip steaks encrusted with 
peppercorns, Brobdingnagian hamburger steaks with brown mushroom gravy on the 
side. Rare filet mignon wrapped with bacon -- "Odds-On Favorite," says the menu 
-- is a ruddy disk of meat, so soft it seems a little like meat-flavored 
butter, the best thing in the house. Chateaubriand for two is the size of 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's forearm, a tremendous, tender piece of meat rimmed in 
black char, served with a sauce boat of Bearnaise sauce and carved table-side 
with great ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 If you are for some reason not sated, there is smooth, cool cheesecake, not 
too sweet, . . . or one of the Derby's special coffee drinks.

 It's not that these skinny bread sticks are any lower in fat than the average 
bread stick. After all, the basic ingredients are just flour, water, yeast and 
a bit of oil. (We have, however, seen recipes that call for more butter and oil 
than is strictly necessary.) It's just that sometimes we need reminding that 
not everything that's good and crunchy is necessarily bad for us. 
</P>
<P>
 These bread sticks each have one gram of fat -- not bad when you consider the 
fat you take in with a couple of potato chips. Munch on these bread sticks if 
you have to snack when you're trying to lose weight. They also make good 
accompaniments to salads, soups and pasta dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Be creative when making them and sprinkle with different combinations of 
spices and herbs before baking. One of our favorite mixes is crushed Sichuan 
peppercorns and kosher salt. 
</P>
<P>
 The bread stick dough is easy to prepare, with only a short time needed for 
rising. After the dough rises, knead it, then roll it out on a lightly floured 
surface. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch strips, fold each strip in half, then 
twist together for a spiral effect. If you prefer long, skinny bread sticks, 
skip this step and just twist the strips SKINNY BREAD STICKS

GOOD COOKING: FISH FIRSTS

<P>
 First courses traditionally act as an introduction to a dinner party. But they 
can double as lunch or supper dishes, becoming "little meals." 
</P>
<P>
 Seafood is a logical choice for this kind of dining. It's satisfying, yet not 
heavy, especially when combined with vegetables and greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following recipes, which make lively, light presentations. 
Soft-shell crabs signify spring. Here, they are plumped in buttermilk and fried 
crisp and served on watercress or arugula leaves with a lime wedge and a lime 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay scallops sauteed in a ginger dressing and tossed with chilled haricots 
verts make an appealing Asian-inspired first course in which hot plays against 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoked salmon is chopped and mixed with fennel, shallots and fresh dill, then 
mounded on endive "fingers" and arranged on mixed greens.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One practical note: It's essential to buy the freshest seafood and to cook it 
just through and no more. Scallops should retain their natural juices and are 
especially disappointing when they're overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-shell crabs look complicated, but nothing could be further from the 
truth. Once they are cleaned out by the fishmonger, they're almost effortless 
to cook. Plumping them up in buttermilk gives the soft-shells great taste and a 
fuller appearance. The tang of the watercress or arugula goes well with the 
crab.  
</P>
<P>
 SPICY SOFT-SHELL CRABS WITH LIME DRESSING 
</P>
<P>
 4 cleaned soft-shell crabs, 3 to 4 ounces each 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup crisp watercress or arugula leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Lime Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Lime wedges 
</P>
<P>
 Put crabs in large bowl. Pour buttermilk over and refrigerate at least 30 
minutes, up to 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, salt, cayenne and black pepper on plate. Remove crabs from 
buttermilk. Dredge in flour mixture, coating completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil and butter in 12-inch non-stick skillet over high heat. When sizzling 
hot, saute crabs until golden on both sides, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  
</P>
<P>
 Garnish each serving plate with watercress. Top with crab and put dollop of 
Lime Dressing and lime wedge on side. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

 Cook the scallops through in the dressing, but just to the point that their 
natural juiciness and good taste are retained. Young spring beans can be 
substituted for the haricots verts. This dish would be great for a light lunch 
or supper, partnered with steamed rice mixed with green onions.

 Fennel gives a particularly nice balance to the smoked salmon mix. But if you 
can't find it, substitute firm cucumber (no seeds). The "fingers" are the 
feature here, arranged on mixed greens and herb leaves, dressed in a peppery

WINE: THE ITALIAN STYLE: NEW VERSUS OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy is one country whose winemaking techniques may be changing even faster 
than California's, and one reason is an apparent shift in consumer demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Many producers have come to believe that today's consumers want a wine of 
fruit and aren't as interested in earthy flavors as they once were. 
</P>
<P>
 In many regions, wines are now made in two contrasting styles. One is made by 
those who still hew to old-fashioned methods, making wines characterized by the 
scents of earth and truffle. Another breed of winemaker offers wine with more 
of the character we associate with contemporary winemaking: fruit and spice, 
and, for better or worse, oak flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Italy's two best-known red wines still offer the elements we like. 
Chianti, from Tuscany, is made largely of Sangiovese and is a lighter-weight 
wine of high acidity and lean, tart flavors. Nebbiolo-driven Barolo and 
Barbaresco, from the Piedmont, have weight and power -- and tannin. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the new and old differ most is in texture. Old-style Chianti is soft but 
lacks fruit. Newer styles are more tannic but are appreciated by people who 
want to taste the grape. The Barolos and Barbarescos made as in the past are 
harsher and more tannic than those made by more modern techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons Chianti used to be made the way it was. By law it 
had to be blended with white wine grapes; it was fermented in open-top tubs and 
then aged in old wooden vats for two years before bottling. All this gave 
Chianti a mature, slightly oxidized taste, a character that was more developed 
bouquet than fresh fruit aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, most of the red wine we made was consumed locally, and Italian 
wine drinkers liked young red wine," says Ambrogio Folonari, winemaker and 
owner of Chianti Ruffino. "The wines were lighter, less alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Italy was still largely agricultural, with most of the 
population living in the countryside, he said. As more people moved to the city 
in the 1970s, per-capita consumption of wine dropped, Folonari says, and 
Italian winemakers decided to seek a more "international" style so the wines 
could be exported. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two decades, producers have beefed up Chianti by using cooler 
fermentation (preserving fruit), blending in smaller amounts of white grapes 
(the law is less stringent than it was), aging the wine less in vats (and aging 
some in small oak barrels for additional nuances of flavor) and using better 
clones of the Sangiovese grape. 
</P>
<P>
 Folonari admits he has made changes at Ruffino to make the wines more modern 
in style. "We are giving up what was bad of the old style and keeping what was 
good," he says. But he declines to age the wines in new oak barrels, arguing 
that that would change Chianti too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Chianti is exemplified by the attractive 1991 Brolio Sangiovese, 
technically not a Chianti but a simple vino da tavola. At its price of $9 or 
less, it's an excellent buy. The wine shows true Chianti character, with hints 
of violets, raisin and sandalwood and a tart, lean finish. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit heavier but still with an old-style aroma is 1989 Banfi Chianti Classico 
"Riserva" ($12), which has hearty, ripe flavors and a high dose of astringency. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chianti-type wine in a more modern style is typified by the 1992 Santa 
Cristina from Antinori ($7), which has hints of smoke and earth and a very tart 
finish -- another wine built for food. (As reported recently, this is the only 
red wine Antinori will release from 1992 because of the poor crop, caused by 
horrible weather conditions.) 
</P>
<P>
 Barolo and its sister wine, Barbaresco, have likewise been improved from the 
old model and now don't need decades of aging before being ready for drinking. 
In the past, Barolo was fermented without temperature controls, making for a 
massive, inky wine with enough tannin to strip enamel from teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Wasserman, in his book "Italy's Noble Red Wines," credits the late 
Renato Ratti with pioneering newer, gentler methods of production that meant 
less massive wines. Still, some producers have not changed, and those wines 
demand time to smooth out. Some never will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A great example of a superb, age-worthy Barolo made in the new style is the 
Ratti winery's magnificent 1989 Barolo from the Marcenasco dell'Annunziata 
vineyard. This wine, my favorite in a recent tasting of Barolos, shows floral 
and spice characteristics of rose petals and anise and has a California-like 
intensity. It improved for two days in the bottle (!), indicating it will live 
as long as any of Ratti's past wines. And since 1989 was a great vintage in 
Barolo, this wine is actually fairly priced at $35 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 More gripping and gritty in texture was 1988 G. Borgogno Barolo ($25), from an 
old-style producer. The wine has intriguing notes of white pepper and a load of 
flavor, but the tannins are so brutish at this point that you should wait 
several years to consume it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Chianti's lack of aging ability, you can disprove that simply by 
tasting any older Chianti from a producer with a track record for making 
well-aged wine. Among them are Fossi, Badia a Coltibuono, Antinori and Ruffino 
(especially Ruffino wines designated "Gold Label Riserva Ducale"). 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I tasted the 1988 Ruffino Chianti Classico "Gold Label Riserva 
Ducale" ($22) side by side with the same wine from the 1957 vintage. The older 
wine was fascinating for its fruit and concentration (a faint hint of Port in 
the aroma). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the older wine was well preserved and entirely enjoyable, it was 
clear from the still-gritty tannins that this was a wine made by techniques of 
the past. The 1988 was deeper in fruit and showed better tannin structure but 
retained a trace of that familiar earthy aroma and taste of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate older Chianti, we have to remember that these wines are quite 
different from those of the 1990s. These older wines were not deep, dark and 
raspberry-fruity when young, as are so many Chiantis today. Instead they were 
relatively rough and tannic wines, still with intense flavors, but so "dry" 
that they demanded long bottle-aging to cut down the astringency. And because 
of the production process, these wines often had a pronounced oxidized smell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barolo, too, has come a long way since its hit-and-miss days, when tasting 
good vintages was like sipping sandpaper with fruit, and with the bad vintages 
you thought you were at an alum tasting. The better ones did age, but even 
after 20 years in bottle, many were still so tannic that only the hardiest of 
collectors loved them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Barolos, especially those from producers making them in the more 
modern style, are more delicate and approachable than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they age as well as those of the past? That's difficult to say, of 
course, but my guess is that they will. From what I've tasted of the last 
decade, Chianti made in the modern manner is aging better than the former 
wines. And certainly there will be more good examples of Barolo to experiment 
with, which is always more fun than banking on one or two bottles that may fail 
the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 I definitely prefer the Barolo made in the modern style. Try the stunning 1988 
Michele Chiarlo Barolo ($26), a wine of dramatic fruit (violets, blackberry and 
spice) and a lighter weight in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Folonari how many vintages in a decade produced great wines 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two, maybe three," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how many today?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes twinkled as he replied: "We used to count the vintages we made; now 
we count the vintages we miss." Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1989 Villa Pattono, Renato Ratti ($12) -- When I first tasted this wine, I 
thought it was a Rhone. The aroma is big and leathery and loaded with very ripe 
fruit, with hints of blackberry and raisin. There is obvious aging in oak, and 
the dark, brooding, powerful aftertaste is a sure sign the wine will age 
nicely. Plenty of complexity here and an excellent value. The wine is the Ratti 
winery's unique blend of about 75% Barbera with almost equal parts of the light 
red grape Freisa and an ancient local grape, Uvalino. This is only the eighth 
vintage of Villa Pattono. Splurge of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1988 Brunello di Montalcino, Tenute Il Greppone Mazzi ($38) -- There may be no 
better example of the new style of Italian wine than this deeply complex, 
voluptuous example of Brunello, which is made entirely from the Sangiovese 
Grosso grape. The wine has an astounding toast and violet aroma, hints of roses 
and jam, and a supple, racy taste that seems to go on and on. Brunello, which 
gained fame over the last two decades because of the powerful wines of the 
house of Biondi-Santi, has a reputation for being a fairly astringent wine. 
This one is graceful; astringency is muted. A masterpiece, showing off the 
grape and still offering depth.

AMERICA'S BEST: HOME OF THE LARS BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lars and Leif Anderson never intended to become part of the family candy 
business. The brothers went off to college and then worked at other jobs. 
Eventually, though, they moved back home -- and started making candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are kind of an independent lot and so we have a difficult time working for 
other people," says Lars. "We might not get rich, but we are at least king of 
our own domain." 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 ago, their grandfather, Arthur R. Anderson, began making peanut 
fritters, an unraised brittle that's been pressed into a patty. He sold the 
fritters to newspaper stands and cigar stores in Chicago. Then he rented a 
storefront near a busy movie theater on Chicago's Armitage Street and started 
dipping the candy in chocolate. When the rent was doubled in 1926, from $10 a 
month to $20, an outraged Anderson closed the shop in protest and moved his 
business 60 miles northwest to its present location. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Anderson's Candy Shop is best known for its buttery English toffee, 
intense chunks of chocolate-dipped crystallized ginger and rich 
chocolate-covered butter creams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make our own cream," says Lars. "We buy the milk from a farm and separate 
it." It takes six gallons of whole milk to make one gallon of cream. Lars says 
that Anderson's cream has as much as 50% to 60% butterfat; the whipping cream 
in most supermarkets contains about 20% to 30%.

 None of Anderson's candy is more than two weeks old, which presents a problem 
during the busy holidays. "There are only 24 hours in a day," Lars points out, 
"and you need to sleep sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Another product unique to the shop is a chocolate block of caramel and pecans 
with a layer of fluffy white divinity, called the Lars Bar. "I developed it, so 
the employees named it after me," says Lars. "Plus, Lars rhymes with Mars ."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, brother Leif hasn't been honored with his own namesake product. 
"That's because there already is a Leaf Candy Co., and even though it's spelled 
different, we could get into trouble," says Lars. "Besides, Leif hasn't come up 
with a candy bar yet that we want to add to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 But things could soon change. A local honey shop has been in touch with the 
Andersons about developing a candy containing their honey. "A honey 
marshmallow, a chocolate with liquid honey inside and a few other candies have 
been on the back burner for a while," says Lars.  
</P>
<P>
 So might there be a Leif candy after all? "Leif Honey Marshmallow?" says Lars. 
" Hmmmmmm. . . . You never know." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Because Anderson's candy is perishable, delivery is available through Mother's 
Day and then again after Labor Day. Candy bars cost 9 5 cents apiece; a pound 
of chocolates runs between $8 and $12, plus shipping.

VEGETABLES AS MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home economists used to suggest that we plan menus by deciding on a main 
course of meat, fish or poultry and then designing the rest of the meal around 
it. But these days, doctors tell us we should eat many more vegetables than we 
do. So if beautiful, nutritious broccoli, snow-white mushrooms, shiny purple 
eggplants or brilliant sweet red peppers are featured in the market, why not 
start with them? 
</P>
<P>
 I have always liked the Chinese style of serving rice with a variety of 
accompanying dishes, rather than thinking in terms of a main course of meat and 
one or two side dishes. Or you can prepare one or more vegetable dishes and 
serve them with pasta, rice or another grain. With this approach, a meal can be 
nutritious, colorful and satisfying. Often you will find you either don't need 
meat at all or end up eating it in smaller amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 For diversity in menus, try the exotic and newer vegetables -- the many 
varieties of squash, the baby vegetables, the wild mushrooms, the Chinese 
greens. It's not unusual now to find vegetables that were unknown to us several 
years ago, such as broccoflower, sugar-snap peas and sweet dumpling squash. 
This is true not only at farmers' markets but also at regular produce markets 
and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it easier to include vegetables in menus, markets now provide many cut 
and cleaned vegetables for convenience. There are broccoli florets, sliced 
mushrooms, washed spinach, shredded cabbage and other ready-to-cook vegetables 
from both the produce section and the salad bar section. Ready-washed salad 
greens make preparing salad a delight -- you just put the greens you want in 
the bowl and sprinkle them lightly with a small amount of dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 One easy way to incorporate more vegetables in your diet is to cook enough for 
two meals at one time. Most vegetables can be cooked ahead; even green 
vegetables can be reheated easily. You can always heat the second portion of 
vegetables with a small amount of tomato sauce or sprinkle it with herb- or 
garlic-scented olive oil, vinaigrette or a little salsa. You can add the 
vegetables to soups, meat or bean stews or vegetable medleys. Or turn the extra 
vegetables into a new dish. Make them into salads, soups or purees, or toss 
them with rice pilaf, tortellini or other types of pasta. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With so many possibilities, you can easily make vegetables into the most 
exciting part of the meal.

 My friend Somchit Singchalee, a Thai chef in Paris, taught me how to make this 
dish. She used this as a basic Thai red curry recipe for all sorts of 
vegetables -- squash, eggplant, even potatoes. For this dish we sometimes 
bought tiny Thai green eggplants that looked like large peas. But our common 
large eggplants work just fine. This curry is very rich, and so I like to serve 
it in small portions with Thai jasmine rice and another simple dish such as 
grilled chicken breasts or a quick spinach salad.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the ingredients for this curry are available in good supermarkets. My 
local market in Santa Monica often has the Thai chili paste, canned coconut 
milk and even the fish sauce, which is occasionally labeled "Thai seasoning 
sauce." You can also buy these ingredients in Asian specialty shops.  
</P>
<P>
 THAI MUSHROOM AND RED CHILI CURRY 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound large fresh mushrooms, halved 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium shallot, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium cloves garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Thai red chili paste 
</P>
<P>
 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon Thai fish sauce (nam pla) 
</P>
<P>
 1 small eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper, cut into strips 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup shelled fresh or frozen peas 
</P>
<P>
 1 (15-ounce) can baby corn, rinsed and halved 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup small Thai or Italian basil leaves, optional, plus basil sprigs for 
garnish 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon oil in saute pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, salt 
and pepper to taste and saute 4 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over low heat. Add shallot and garlic 
and saute 1 minute. Stir in chili paste, then 1 1/4 cups coconut milk and bring 
to boil. Simmer over low heat 5 minutes, stirring often. Add sugar and 2 
tablespoons fish sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Add eggplant and red pepper strips. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer, stirring 
often, about 15 minutes or until tender. Add remaining coconut milk and bring 
to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Add mushrooms, peas and corn. Cover and simmer 5 minutes or until vegetables 
are tender. (Curry can be kept, covered, 2 days in refrigerator. Reheat in 
covered pan.) If sauce is too thick, gradually stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons 
water. Add remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, or more to taste. Remove from heat 
and stir in basil leaves. Taste and adjust seasonings. Garnish with basil 
sprigs. Makes 4 to 5 main-course servings.

 I first tasted this soup when it was cooked by a friend's teen-age guest from 
Mexico City, who knew how to cook only one thing -- tortilla soup. We thought 
it sounded like a strange dish, but it turned out to be delicious. The soup is 
made in different ways throughout Mexico. It might contain only tomatoes and 
onion, or it might have zucchini, carrots, chiles or sweet peppers. I like to 
add corn for its taste and texture and because it complements the corn 
tortillas. I also stir raw tomatoes and cilantro into the finished soup for a 
fresh touch.  
</P>
<P>
 Many versions of this soup call for cheese, such as crumbled Mexican queso 
fresco or shredded Monterey Jack. You can serve cheese separately if you like, 
but I prefer the soup without it; it's lighter and still flavorful. You can 
also accompany the soup with avocado slices.  
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of lightness I have tried making the soup with toasted 
tortillas instead of fried ones, but the results are disappointing. If you 
don't wish to fry the tortillas, use 2 or 3 cups packaged tortilla strips 
instead; some are now available without oil or without salt.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMATO AND CORN TORTILLA SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 6 corn tortillas, preferably stale 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) can 
plum tomatoes, drained and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 long mild green chiles, diced small 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock or mixed broth and water 
</P>
<P>
 1 ear corn, kernels removed, or 1 cup frozen kernels 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon coarsely chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Pure ground chile or cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 If tortillas are not stale, let stand about 30 minutes unwrapped in 1 layer 
until dry. Cut tortillas in half, then cut each half into 1/4-inch-wide strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy, medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Test with 1 
tortilla strip, when oil is hot enough, it should bubble around strip. Add 1/2 
of strips to pan and fry 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly darker and firmer but 
not crisp. Do not brown and do not stir too often or strips will break up. 
Remove pan from heat and quickly transfer tortilla strips with slotted spoon to 
paper towels. Reheat oil slightly, add remaining strips and fry them. Remove to 
paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Set aside 3/4 cup chopped tomatoes for finishing soup. Heat remaining 1 
tablespoon oil in large saucepan. Add onion and chiles and saute over medium 
heat 5 minutes or until light-brown. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds. Add stock 
and remaining tomatoes and bring to boil. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. Add corn 
and simmer 5 to 10 minutes or until corn is tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving, reheat soup if necessary. Add reserved 3/4 cup chopped 
tomatoes, 1/3 cup cilantro, salt, pepper and ground chile to taste. Serve soup 
sprinkled with tortilla strips and remaining 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro. Makes 
4 appetizer servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : If fresh green chiles are not available, substitute 1 cup diced green 
peppers or canned mild green chiles.

 DEAR SOS: You recently printed a recipe for Cincinnati chili, one of the 
things for which that wonderful city is known. I was told that chocolate was 
the secret ingredient. We love Cincinnati chili so much that several years ago, 
while driving home from New York at 4:30 a.m., we pulled over after spotting a 
billboard advertising Gold Star chili, to await the opening of one of the 
restaurants featuring it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought your readers would be interested in the recipe that was published in 
the Cincinnati Enquirer. The name "5-way Chili" derives from the ingredients 
added to the chili, such as spaghetti, beans, onions and Cheddar cheese.

 DEAR SOS: Can you help me find a recipe for "tunnel of fudge" cake? I lost my

<P>
 DEAR PEGGY: As you might recall, the recipe had only five ingredients plus a 
box of chocolate frosting mix. It won a $5,000 prize at the 17th Pillsbury 
Bake-Off contest in 1966. The recipe was so popular that housewares departments 
around the country were emptied of bundt pans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pillsbury Co., bowing to the demands of its consumers who adored the 
prize-winning recipe, decided after a long dry spell to whet our appetites 
again with a tunnel of fudge cake made from scratch. This is it. TUNNEL OF

GROUP VOWS REFERENDUMTO CHALLENGE CAMARILLO'S STRICT ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of angry smokers and restaurant owners in Camarillo has taken out 
papers to place a referendum on the November ballot in an attempt to challenge 
the City Council's tough new smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, a collection of about 50 restaurant owners and smokers' rights 
advocates, also took out papers to recall the entire City Council and is 
contemplating a class-action lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, the City Council gave final approval to the tougher of two 
proposed smoking ordinances. After the vote, however, opponents vowed to 
continue their fight to overturn the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to go the distance on this thing," said Pat Johnson, owner of 
Li'l Bit O' Country restaurant on Lantana Street. "Basically, we have five 
people on the council who are dictating what more than 100 restaurants and 
50,000 people can and cannot do. It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Robert Flandrick said it is already too late to attempt to recall 
the three members of the council who voted for the ordinance -- Charlotte 
Craven, Stan Daily and Mayor Ken Gose -- because they are up for reelection on 
the November ballot. Flandrick said state law prohibits recall attempts within 
six months of a municipal election. But if at least 10% of the city's voters 
signed petitions, a referendum on the smoking ordinance could be placed on the 
November ballot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During its April 13 meeting, the council passed the stronger of two smoking 
ordinances by a 3-2 vote with council members Michael Morgan and David Smith 
dissenting. The ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, effectively bans 
smoking in most public places in the city, including all restaurants and most 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers of the campaign said they are ready and willing to spend their 
own money on the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are talking about here is protecting our very livelihoods," said 
Dorothy Walden, owner of Dorothy's Chuckwagon Cafe. "If we can turn this 
ordinance over, we can save our customer base. We see this as worth the 
expense." 
</P>
<P>
 But Craven, Daily and Gose said in separate interviews before Wednesday's 
meeting that they they supported the tougher ordinance out of concern for 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all wet on the recall," Craven said. "They can't do it. Now, if they 
want to run their own candidates against me during the election, that's their 
business, but I'm not really worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Gose said that he was not intimidated by the threats and would vote the same 
way he did when the council dealt with the issue earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not impressed," Gose said. "We've been threatened with recall from all 
sides on this issue. We had the non-smokers threaten to take us out of office 
if we didn't vote for the ordinance. Now we have these folks threatening us 
because we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily, a longtime veteran of the council, said he had never reconsidered 
changing his vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recalls come with the territory," Daily said. "It's nothing new to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the campaign would not disclose how much they were willing to spend 
on the effort, but Walden said she hopes cigarette manufacturers help out in 
funding the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to get a hold of them and let them know what we are doing," 
Walden said. "So far, we have not been able to touch base yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington said the 
institute, while sympathetic to the cause, has a policy of not funding local 
recall or referendum campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not something that we get involved with, although we wish them a 
lot of luck," Lauria said.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN PLAYERS ON A GOOD RUN OF BAD LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Cal State Northridge first baseman Jason Shanahan has seen any black cats 
lately, disaster could be just around the corner. Or in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan shares a townhouse with four teammates, each of whom has spent at 
least part of the season in the repair shop. Bad luck seems to rub off on the 
home front.

 Andy Shaw, a sophomore first baseman, had knee surgery in the preseason and 
hasn't had a single at-bat.

 His Kind of Guys 
</P>
<P>
 Matador baseball Coach Bill Kernen is looking for a few good men. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen has signed only one player during the NCAA's spring signing period, but 
that's purely by choice. Already in the midst of his worst season in six years 
at Northridge, Kernen doesn't plan to repeat the experience in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said he is making his list and checking it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still scouting," he said. "I want to make sure whoever comes in here is 
an animal . I want to make sure they can play for me, that they know what's 
going on and what's expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been on a losing team before as a player or coach. . . It's my 
fault some of this stuff is going on. I'm looking for my kind of guys." JUNIOR

<P>
 A victory for Pierce over visiting Bakersfield today in a Western State 
Conference baseball matchup between South Division leaders -- both are 13-7 in 
conference play -- would have additional significance for the Brahmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is that we want to make sure we don't lose the season 
series to them," said Bob Lofrano, Pierce coach. Head-to-head results are used 
as the first championship tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofrano believes, however, that a loss today wouldn't be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game still doesn't determine who wins the championship because of the 
games that are left (five, including a makeup of Tuesday's rained-out game 
against Canyons) and the way the teams have been bumping each other off (in the 
division)," Lofrano said.

 He didn't compete last season and he's had to change his takeoff leg because 
of an injury suffered during basketball, but Glendale College freshman Mike 
Wright is performing as well as ever in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a three-sport standout at Glendale High, had personal bests of 23 feet 
9 1/2 inches in the long jump and 48-3 in the triple jump for the Dynamiters. 
But he did not compete in sports during the 1992-93 school year while 
completing requirements for his high school diploma at a continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
 He played for the Glendale College basketball team this season but, after 
twice twisting his left knee in games, learned to long jump off his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright jumped 22-10 in his first meet before tying his personal best to win 
the junior college division of the Mt. San Antonio College Relays on April 15. 
He followed that with a 23-8 1/2 effort to lead all qualifiers in last week's 
Western State Conference preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he stays healthy, he should definitely go over 24 feet and possibly, much 
further," Coach Tom McMurray said. "A 25-foot jump is not out of the question."

 * In six WAC games against Cal State Sacramento, Northridge pitchers allowed 
an average of 10.5 runs and 14.8 hits. Of the 63 runs scored by the Hornets, 56 
were earned, giving the Northridge staff an earned-run average of 9.69. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the opposition is batting .302 against the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge, racked by injuries to its pitching staff, has lost five 
consecutive nonconference games played on a Tuesday. The last four defeats are 
by a combined score of 53-23, which might be reason enough to celebrate 
Tuesday's rainout with the University of San Diego.

SHERIFF'S DEPT. GETS A MIXED REVIEW; LAW ENFORCEMENT: REPORT ON REFORMS CITES 
PROGRESS IN CURTAILING EXCESSIVE FORCE. BUT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
DISCIPLINE AT HIGHER LEVELS IS CRITICIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is making progress on controlling 
deputies' use of excessive force, but Sheriff Sherman Block and his commanders 
still do not exert enough control at the station house level, according to a 
monitor appointed by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick J. Bobb, in his second semiannual report on compliance with reforms 
recommended two years ago by an inquiry headed by retired Superior Court Judge 
James G. Kolts, also suggests that there is not enough accountability or 
discipline at higher levels of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main deficiency" of a draft on duty standards prepared by senior officers 
"is that it pushes responsibility and accountability down to captains, 
lieutenants and sergeants," Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The duties become more and more detailed the lower one goes," he added. "The 
draft is too timid even to touch the duties or responsibilities of the 
assistant sheriffs, undersheriff or sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
 At another point in the 111-page report, Bobb writes, "There is a widespread 
perception within the Department that managers and executives are almost never 
evaluated critically or disciplined, that discipline is reserved for deputies 
and the occasional sergeant." 
</P>
<P>
 Block, reacting Wednesday to the report, criticized it for "nit-picking." He 
said that, in fact, he has ordered that several lieutenants and sergeants be 
suspended without pay for one to 10 days for failures of supervision in a 
widely publicized incident last year in which on-duty deputies partied in 
Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the lieutenants were suspended for 10 days, the sheriff said. By 
contrast, 25 deputies were suspended last December without pay for periods of 
up to 30 days for the Alondra Park party. 
</P>
<P>
 Block also revealed that a letter was recently issued formally reprimanding 
one of his two assistant sheriffs for involvement in a preventable vehicle 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state law forbidding the identification of law enforcement 
officers who have been disciplined, Block did not make any names public. 
</P>
<P>
 Block noted that Bobb had complimented his department on a decline in the last 
two years in deputy-involved shootings and cases involving litigation over 
allegations of excessive force. He said, "We must be doing something right, 
because the statistics show it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the statistics listed by Bobb, the number of shooting incidents 
fell from 56 in 1991 to 47 in 1992 and 29 in 1993. Seven were reported in the 
first three months of 1994. The number of people wounded or killed dropped from 
63 in 1991 to 49 in 1992 and 34 in 1993. In the first three months of this 
year, there were seven casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of verdicts and settlements and providing legal defense in excess 
force cases also went down in the last year, although Bobb cautioned that such 
costs routinely have varied over recent years and it may be too early to reach 
solid conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Bobb said, the department's progress in curtailing the use of 
unwarranted force "remains on track, and in some areas the department has been 
particularly impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 But having said that in his introduction, Bobb was quite critical in the next 
110 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb was particularly scathing in decrying a commitment by the sheriff's 
office to "the least intensive management style" by commanders in directing the 
activities of captains at the various stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the goal of empowerment of captains is laudable," he said, "and we 
agree that commanders should not micro-manage captains, we nonetheless believe 
that, regardless of style, the most intensive management should be at the 
intersection of the station and the region," he said. "Commanders should be 
proactive managers, more than workhorses, stand-ins or gatekeepers." 
</P>
<P>
 He added later in the report, "In our view, there is no place in the Sheriff's 
Department for the bizarre notion of 'least intensive management' at the first 
hint there are deputy cliques at a station running roughshod over sergeants or 
lieutenants, as has occurred, or if uses of force are starting to get 
uncomfortably high." 
</P>
<P>
 At several points, Bobb observed that many of the procedures for more 
intensive investigation of shootings by deputies and tracking of problem 
deputies are unpopular with the deputies themselves. But his report urges more 
such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased diversity in the ethnic and sexual makeup of the staff of the 
Sheriff's Department is being impeded, he reported, by budgetary constraints 
that have prevented hiring and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite commitments, for example, to reduce the amount of time young deputies 
spend in the jail division, he said, some deputies now serve there as long as 
six years before being assigned to patrol duty.

COURT ARBITRATION TO COPY BASEBALL SYSTEM; LAW: JUDGES' EXPERIMENT WILL HAVE 
PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS SUBMIT SETTLEMENT OFFERS IN DISPUTES INVOLVING LESS 
THAN $50,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Borrowing a name and some tactics from professional baseball, three Los 
Angeles County Superior Court judges on Wednesday unveiled a new arbitration 
program designed to generate prompt settlements of legal disputes involving 
$50,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said they expect the program to put money into the hands of 
plaintiffs more swiftly, reduce insurance companies' legal costs and save the 
courts time, energy and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Voluntary Baseball Arbitration, the new program is patterned after the 
binding arbitration rules that major league baseball clubs and players use in 
contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some litigants have used arbitration for years, judges can order only 
non-binding arbitrations. The new program -- although still voluntary -- is 
binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the arbitrator will decide which side is correct and will accept 
the winner's settlement proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea behind baseball arbitration is to force each side to submit a 
realistic figure," and prevent cases from going into "extra innings," said 
Superior Court Judge Richard G. Harris. "A plaintiff reaching for the moon 
risks forcing the arbitrator to choose the defendant's figure. A defendant who 
low-balls may force choice of the plaintiff's figure." 
</P>
<P>
 There is some wiggle room, however. Opposing sides exchange proposed damage 
awards 30 days before arbitration, then submit revised figures to the 
arbitrator 10 days before arbitration. After the hearing, the figures may be 
revised one more time before the arbitrator makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The arbitrator is required only to render a decision and does not have to 
prepare written findings, reducing time and costs, Harris said. This also means 
that the only public record will be the initial case filing and any resolution 
approved by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Mallano, presiding judge of the Superior Court, said he had spoken 
to Tom Roberts of Rancho Palos Verdes, one of baseball's leading arbitrators, 
to get insights on how that program works. Its application in the Los Angeles 
courts is expected to be considerably more mundane than the world of 
multimillion-dollar contracts that Roberts routinely handles. The judge said he 
expects the program to be used primarily in auto accident cases, thousands of 
which are filed in the county every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said it has taken almost a year to design the program, with 
considerable input from plaintiffs' attorneys, defense lawyers and insurance 
companies that play a prominent behind-the-scenes role in civil litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Allstate Insurance Co., State Farm, the Los Angeles Trial 
Lawyers Assn. and the Assn. of Southern California Defense Counselwere on hand 
to endorse the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said they could not state precisely how many cases would be 
affected. However, Harris said 25% of the 75,000 civil suits filed in Los 
Angeles County Superior Court each year involve auto accidents. He said 50% to 
60% of all personal injury cases involve disputes of $50,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano said only 1% of all civil suits stemming from auto accidents go to 
trial; the rest are settled. However, he said it often takes considerable time 
to reach a settlement and valuable court resources are used in the early phases 
of a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a large part of economic benefit of the program is to the participants," 
said Superior Court Judge Richard C. Neal, because injured parties would be 
paid off sooner and defendants would cut the costs of preparing cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to settle cases early; if the court system can help us, that's good 
for everyone," said Scott McFarland, a casualty claim manager for Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano said retired judges would preside over most of the arbitrations under 
the new program, and would be paid varying fees by the litigants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the judges announced a new court-ordered mediation 
program, also involving disputes of $50,000 or less. It was established because 
a new state law requires courts in Los Angeles County to institute a pilot 
mandatory mediation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori R. Behar, past president of the Assn. of Southern California Defense 
Counsel, said she thinks the mediation program is likely to be used in cases 
where emotional issues may be involved, rather in disputes over purely money 
damages. She said a boundary dispute between two neighbors is one type of case 
that would be suited to mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano said the new programs are among several the courts are devising as 
they face severe funding problems. In the last two years, the budget of the 
Superior Court has declined $20 million, he said.

AIDS 101; 1,200 STUDENTS LEARN THE FACTS IN UCLA'S MOST POPULAR CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARINA DUNDJERSKI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA freshman Sara Angargolian expected to learn statistics about the AIDS 
virus in her biology class, but she was not quite prepared for the reality 
check that accompanied the lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first lecture, the business/economics major said she left feeling 
shocked, nauseated and quite depressed. She had not realized that more than 1 
million people in the United States are HIV positive and that anybody -- 
including herself -- could get the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know the disease was so big and that so many people were dying," 
Angargolian said. "I actually did feel invincible, but now every time I go to 
class, that feeling shatters more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Angargolian is one of 1,200 students enrolled in the most popular course on 
the Westwood campus and the largest UCLA class in recent memory: AIDS and Other 
Sexually Transmitted Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for taking the class range from curiosity to necessity. At a time when 
the national Centers for Disease Control lists the college-age segment of the 
population as one of the fastest-growing groups in contracting the AIDS virus, 
students are searching for awareness with an increasing sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for students not to be influenced by AIDS now," said 
sophomore biology major Rachel Bush, who would like to teach a similar class in 
high school someday. "Not that everyone goes sleeping around all day long, but 
it's something you have to think about when you start dating someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The class was first offered at UCLA in 1989 as a series of talks by various 
visiting lecturers. Only 12 students signed up for the course. Five years 
later, after modifications that included a new instructor and format, and 
increasing AIDS awareness, the class size has surged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider this the most important class I teach," said biology Professor 
Roger Bohman, who added that he teaches the class both as a public service and 
as a way to interest students in learning science. "Because students are 
sexually active, AIDS is very immediate to them, and I'd like them to 
appreciate the importance of the AIDS epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the class prompted administrators to set up Ackerman Grand Ballroom 
this spring as a makeshift classroom. Where UCLA's largest classroom, Moore 
Hall 100, has a seating capacity of about 420, the ballroom can accommodate 
1,200 students. Still, hundreds of students were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students grumble about sitting in folding chairs without desks and about 
the large room. Sophomore Lilach Aviv said she was overwhelmed by the number of 
students and could hardly see the professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know what the teacher looks like," Aviv said. "If I saw him walk 
past me, I wouldn't recognize him." 
</P>
<P>
 Seats near the front are coveted. But most of those who find themselves 
sitting toward the back say it does not matter as long as they can hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students say the class has already opened their minds and dispelled 
various myths about sexually transmitted diseases. "I didn't really believe 
anything I heard before because someone will say one thing, and another person 
will say something else," said freshman Bob Buch. "This class has begun to 
change my way of thinking and I'm getting the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the course focuses on AIDS. The course covers fears and 
stereotypes, immunology, historical perspective of the epidemic and explores 
the various scientific and social issues raised by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say the class influences them to change their way of life. "This 
class has a direct application to your lifestyle," said Vicky Parente, a senior 
who took the course last year and is now a teaching assistant. "There were 
times when I left class and said, 'Oh my gosh, sex is so scary!' But you learn 
exactly how to moderate your behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, AIDS was almost always a mystery," Parente said. "Now I know what it 
is, how I can get it, how I can protect myself and how it affects my body." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, however, the class has offered a harsher reality. "One of the things 
I've realized with this class is that you're not talking only to people who 
might get the disease but those who also have the disease," Bohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One young man a few years back wrote a paper in which he said I was the first 
person who told him that he was going to die from this disease. He said he 
hoped no one had noticed him crying."

PRIEST'S SLAYING SHOCKS PARISHIONERS; VIOLENCE: FATALLY SHOT WHILE VACATIONING 
IN SAN DIEGO, HE WAS TO HAVE CELEBRATED 30 YEARS IN THE PRIESTHOOD THIS 
WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Were he to preach about it, Msgr. Louis Gutierrez might have told his 
parishioners at St. Paul's Catholic Church not to be sad for the good man cut 
down by violence -- for he is with God -- but to lament a society where murder 
has become routine. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have told them that prayer is not enough in times such as these, that 
tears should not become indulgence, that anger must be channeled to good. 
</P>
<P>
 But others will have to tell this parable now. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, who was planning to celebrate 30 years in the priesthood this 
weekend, was murdered in San Diego on Tuesday, where he had gone on vacation 
with a longtime friend, a fellow priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Gutierrez, 61, died of a single gunshot to the head. His friend, 
who was staying in an adjoining room at the beachfront Surfer Motor Lodge, 
reported hearing a crash in Gutierrez's room about 6:15 a.m., and then a 
slamming door. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, a marathon runner, may have been about to leave for -- or just 
returned from -- an early morning walk. He was wearing casual clothing and his 
running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could understand it in Los Angeles -- murder happens here every day," 
said 13-year-old Krystal Hunt, an eighth-grader at the Mid-City parish's school 
who described Gutierrez as a friend, father figure and adviser. "But San Diego? 
I was thinking that San Diego was a really peaceful place." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly more peaceful than here, thought Krystal and other children at the 
parish school. There are bars on the windows of St. Paul's for a reason, and 
the church doors are locked. Just around the corner are a methadone clinic, 
liquor stores and pockets of blight at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The children said they know enough not to wear certain colors so that they 
don't offend the gangs. They say that on the better streets, you hear gunshots 
only now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the neighborhood where Father Gutierrez felt at home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the pastor of St. Paul's for nine years, leaving only last week to 
begin a new assignment at Holy Spirit Catholic Church. He preached his last 
homily at St. Paul's on April 17, and after Mass, 1,000 people attended a 
farewell party. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the students at the school presented him with cards and gifts. He was 
to be invested at his new church on Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gutierrez had already preached one Sunday at Holy Spirit, and LaVerne 
Duncan, who has been a member of St. Paul's since 1965, said that for a reason 
she does not quite understand, she felt compelled to be there to hear what he 
had to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something kept telling me to go," Duncan said. "So I was up and dressed at 6 
a.m. and went to Holy Spirit. The monsignor saw me and he said, 'There's my 
guardian angel from St. Paul's' and then he went ahead and preached his 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started with when he was a little boy, about the green-eyed girl he fell 
in love with, and then the brown-eyed girl, and the school he went to, 28th 
Street School, and USC, and he told all about his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan and other parishioners said that in hindsight, it seemed as if 
Gutierrez might have been giving his own eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragedy has left such sadness in me," said Claude Jasmin, the organist 
at St. Paul's. "About three weeks ago, in a nice sermon he was giving, it seems 
he felt death. He was talking about what he would do if God gave him the choice 
between winning the Lotto and going to heaven. And he said, 'I'll tell him, I 
want to go to heaven right now!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the message that Gutierrez often preached was that heaven, and God, can 
also be found on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say, 'I was at the AIDS hospice and I saw God through each nurse, 
through each cleaning person, through each person there. Any time you act 
right, do good, that is the Lord Jesus Christ,' " Jasmin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt, said those who knew Father Gutierrez well, he would have 
forgiven the person who took his life. Gutierrez was often asking forgiveness 
himself for doing wrong, but not in quiet apologies or letters of regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his friends said, he would stand at the altar of the church and ask 
forgiveness of all the parishioners and of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last Sunday that he preached here, he was talking about the AIDS hospital 
and about how because he had an operation on his foot, he didn't get a chance 
to go there," said Matthew Balthazar, a St. Paul's member since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, one of the patients died and he didn't get the chance to see him. So he 
made that into a parable about how quickly these things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The patient who died was Rodolfo Dominguez, and like all the other men at the 
nearby AIDS hospice, the Serra Project, he was a friend of Gutierrez. The 
priest -- who also helped found a homeless shelter -- visited the AIDS hospice 
every Saturday, just to sit with patients, listen, and share a meal of soup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a great humanitarian relationship," said the hospice manager, 
Alfonso Green. "It wasn't about religion. It was about taking care of your 
fellow man. That was his whole approach."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TAKE YOUR 
DAUGHTER TO WORK ON METROLINK -- FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are planning to take your daughter to work today for "Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day," the Metrolink rail system will get them there for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will allow one child 18 years or younger to ride the train free when 
accompanied by a fare-paying adult.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kids need to understand that driving to work alone is not an example we 
should perpetuate," said Metrolink Chairman Larry Walker.  
</P>
<P>
 "By taking the train to work and working alongside adult role models, children 
will have a rare opportunity to gain insights into their ability to contribute 
to the economy and society," Walker said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING CASE 
EXPERT DESCRIBED AS TOO DEPRESSED TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police training expert whose testimony helped convict two officers of 
violating Rodney G. King's civil rights said he feels alienated from fellow 
officers and is too depressed to testify in King's lawsuit, a police 
psychologist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Glaser, who heads psychiatric services for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, testified outside the jury's presence that Sgt. Mark Conta suffers 
from "situational depression." 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't feel part of the Police Department anymore," Glaser said. 
"He used to feel a real camaraderie with the officers. Now he said that kinship 
is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies ordered that Conta be examined by an 
independent psychiatrist. The trial is in a second phase to determine if King 
should be awarded punitive damages from 15 current and former police officers. 
King already has been awarded $3.8 million in damages from the city in the 
March 3, 1991, beating.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MTA VOTES TO USE ITS 
OWN SECURITY FORCE FOR PATROLS, CITING SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday selected its own 
security force to patrol the region's transit system instead of a joint squad 
of Los Angeles police officers and sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an attempt by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to delay the decision, 
the MTA board of directors voted 11-2 to go with its in-house force, citing 
substantial cost savings for the cash-strapped agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Los Angeles Police Department and the county Sheriff's Department 
would have cost $20 million more a year than using its own force, an 
unjustifiable expense for an agency grappling with a projected $126-million 
operating deficit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Riordan, who had voiced support for the police-sheriff's bid, 
sided with the majority after winning approval of an amendment to establish a 
multi-agency task force to monitor security services on the MTA's extensive 
network of bus and rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope and expect that this is going to start a process of . . . 
constant improvement," he said after the vote, which directors pushed to the 
top of their meeting agenda so that the mayor and others could attend the 
funeral of former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the task force would foster better collaboration between transit 
police, the LAPD and sheriff's deputies, and would reduce duplication of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Police Chief Sharon K. Papa said she was pleased with the outcome: "To say 
we need to work cooperatively with the LAPD and the sheriff's is what I've said 
all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Her force is likely to jump from 300 officers to about 800 to fulfill its new 
mandate of patrolling all MTA buses, the Red Line subway, the aboveground Blue 
Line and the Green Line light-rail service due to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, transit police oversee everything but the Blue Line, which is 
patrolled by sheriff's deputies. However, that contract expires June 30. Papa 
said negotiations will begin to transfer jurisdiction to her agency. HENRY CHU

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; 10 CITY 
OFFICES SERVED SUBPOENAS IN FBI PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI served subpoenas on 10 Compton city offices and departments this week 
as part of a federal probe, a city official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is targeting the former mayor, U.S. Rep. Walter R. Tucker 
III (D-Compton), and former City Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas result from an undercover federal agent posing as a businessman 
and offering Tucker, Moore, and perhaps other officials, bribes to have items 
placed on the council agenda, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Charles Davis verified that the subpoenas were served on his 
office, the offices of the city manager, city attorney, treasurer and grants 
manager, as well as the Community Redevelopment Authority and the Personnel, 
Police, Public Works and the Planning departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign disclosure statements for Tucker and Moore, and possibly other 
politicians, from 1985 to the present are among the documents requested by May 
5, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore has denied any wrongdoing. Tucker has referred all questions on the 
matter to attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who declined to comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD TO 
RELEASE DATA ON CRIME TRENDS ACROSS CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, under pressure to release information about 
crime trends across the city, will make public a number of documents sometime 
next week, an LAPD spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are reports compiled by each of the department's 18 geographic areas 
in which crime data and other information has been analyzed by LAPD officials. 
Cmdr.David J. Gascon, who noted that the crime data already is a matter of 
public record and is routinely made public by the LAPD, said the department 
will release that information but will delete references to the LAPD's proposed 
responses to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime report data is something that we make a practice of releasing," 
Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said only information that highlights operational plans of the 
department or that threatens to invade privacy rights will be withheld.

MEXICO CANDIDATE TAKES CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO L.A.; ELECTION: CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS, 
THE OPPOSITION PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, SAYS HIS NATION SHOULD ALLOW 
EXPATRIATES TO VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was billed as a historic visit, Mexico's leading opposition candidate 
Wednesday brought his long-shot presidential campaign to Los Angeles, home to 
millions of expatriate Mexicans and U.S.-born residents of Mexican ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 With his Southern California audience in mind, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate 
of the Democratic Revolutionary Party in presidential elections scheduled for 
Aug. 21, denounced "xenophobes and racists" who foment hatred of Mexican 
immigrants, and called for the Mexican government to seek bolstered protections 
for its citizens who live abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cardenas reiterated his position that the Mexican Constitution 
should be revised to allow citizens living abroad to vote in national 
elections, just as U.S. citizens residing overseas can cast absentee ballots. 
Ruling-party lawmakers have blocked efforts to permit such a potentially huge 
number of expatriates to influence the Mexican electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the visit of Cardenas, son of a revered former Mexican 
president, marked the first time that a Mexican presidential hopeful had 
traveled abroad during the formal campaign period. Mexican lawmakers last year 
revised a statute that had long prohibited presidential aspirants from leaving 
the country during campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas came to Los Angeles not to campaign, aides said, but in response to 
an invitation from the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, a nonpartisan 
citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
 In comments Wednesday, Cardenas generally stressed familiar themes, calling 
for true democracy in a nation ruled since 1929 by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are demanding an opening to democracy," Cardenas told a morning news 
conference at the Biltmore, where he later gave a formal address before meeting 
with Mexican residents at an auditorium near Downtown. "We want to put an end 
to the party-state regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas went one step further, though, calling on Mexico City to request that 
the United Nations send a formal contingent of observers to monitor the 
elections in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid pressure for reform, Mexican authorities recently amended the law to 
allow some independent electoral observers in a nation where ballot stuffing, 
repeat voting and other chicanery have traditionally marred election days. 
</P>
<P>
 Many supporters still believe that Cardenas himself was robbed of the 
presidency in the 1988 elections. Official tallies gave Cardenas almost 
one-third of the votes, leaving him second to Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
Salinas won a bare majority, announced after an eleventh-hour computer 
breakdown delayed counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas' visit to Los Angeles -- at least the fourth trip he has made here 
since the 1988 elections, supporters say -- underscores the increasing 
importance that Mexico's ever-growing expatriate population has on events back 
home. Both opposition and ruling-party leaders have endeavored to extend their 
popularity to compatriots north of the border, knowing that such moves may pay 
political dividends in Mexico, where visits such as Cardenas' trip tend to be 
heavily publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very high sensitivity in Mexico to the exploitation of the migrant 
worker, and to the extent that he (Cardenas) can associate himself positively 
with that issue, it can only gain him support," said Wayne A. Cornelius, who 
directs the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas has also been eager to shore up his reputation among U.S. and Mexican 
business leaders, many of whom are suspicious of his leftist leanings. "We need 
foreign investment," Cardenas pointedly told a Los Angeles World Affairs 
Council luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cardenas opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, he vowed 
Wednesday that, if elected president, he would enforce the accord, in effect 
since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he now heads Mexico's leading opposition force, Cardenas, 59, was 
long a PRI loyalist and served as governor of the state of Michoacan under the 
party's tricolor banner. He broke with the PRI before the 1988 elections, 
however, after launching a movement that he said was intended to bring greater 
democracy to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show Cardenas trailing substantially behind Ernesto Zedillo, who was 
named the PRI standard-bearer after the assassination last month of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana. But Cardenas has gained somewhat since Jan. 1, when 
rebels in the southern state of Chiapas launched an insurrection that has 
galvanized opposition nationwide to what critics -- including Cardenas -- call 
the ruling party's economic program of concentrating wealth at the expense of 
the poor and middle classes. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong pro-Cardenas network has arisen in Los Angeles. Supporters were 
predictably thrilled about his visit. "Cardenas is the man to change Mexico," 
declared an exuberant Jesus Cardenas, who runs an Eastside tortilla factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputing that viewpoint was Ruben Arenas, president of a Los Angeles-based 
group that supports the PRI. "Cardenas is just trying to get publicity for 
himself here," said Arenas, a businessman. "He's wasting his time."

FIRST PERSON: WHERE ANGELS TREAD; SCREAMING PAST THE SPEED OF SOUND IN A 
ONE-JET SHOW 
</P>

 Every job has its perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a reporter, I can borrow a company car for assignments and use all the 
pens and paper I need. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and on Wednesday I got to fly faster than the speed of sound, higher than 
the clouds, rolling and turning and flipping upside down in the back seat of a 
$25-million fighter jet that belongs to the military's elite stunt troop. 
</P>
<P>
 For a day -- OK, for about a minute, when I grabbed the "stick" that maneuvers 
the plane and spun that baby over onto its side for a full 360-degree roll -- I 
was a Blue Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, work is a whole lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, fun. The scariest part was having to leave my notebook and tape 
recorder behind, knowing that I would have to write this story with nothing but 
my memory to help. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember zipping along a couple dozen feet above the runway, then, whoosh, 
heading straight up (they said 50-degree nose-up, but it seemed straight) to 
the sky, with 6.1 times the earth's gravity -- and nine iron-locked straps -- 
keeping me in my seat. I remember sitting sideways, one wing of the F/A-18 
Hornet jet pointing skyward, the other to the ground, doing 180-degree turns 
back from whence we came. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember "sustained Gs," the never-ending (it lasted about a minute, real 
time) pressure slamming me into the seat, dragging my cheeks away from my face 
and slapping my hands back down to my legs every time I tried to lift them. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember floating a foot above my seat in the tiny, glass-enclosed cabin as 
we cruised upside down at negative Gs, weightless. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember looking at the wings, horrified to realize that my adventure vessel 
was designed to carry missiles and fight wars.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember gliding through the clouds, flimsy white cotton surrounding me like 
I was in a toilet paper commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember not knowing which way was up -- and not really caring. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1946 to keep up public interest in aviation, the Navy's Blue Angels 
take military maneuvers and turn them into show biz-like tricks. They'll fly at 
68 air shows this year and are the headliners for El Toro's extravaganza, which 
opens to the public Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Angels have flown in front of some 257 million spectators. A 
million more will watch over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, as Lt. Dave Kidwell and I danced around the sky, the crowd was 
just a dozen jealous local Marines in camouflage lined up near the runway, 
shaking their heads as the clear canopy slowly closed over me and I strapped on 
the bright blue helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew Chief Pete Amendolare had reviewed the procedures in the safety of a 
briefing room: Tighten your muscles and grunt "hook" when the Gs hit; don't 
touch the yellow and black buttons that say "eject;" monitor speed, altitude 
and G-levels on the TV screens in front of you; keep your legs out of the way 
of the steering stick; turn the knob on the helmet to adjust the visor; tell 
the captain if you're about to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
 (I didn't throw up, though I felt sick, grabbed the barf bag and spit a 
little. Kidwell said his craziest passenger was an actor who plays a pilot on 
the TV show "Wings"; he yacked twice.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking you up there to see how tough you are," said Amendolare, who 
hopes to become a pilot someday. "Don't let this scare you. This is your ride." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he upped the ante, telling me that women "outdo the guys every time 
they fly." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're usually laughing when they get in the airplane," he chuckled as I 
sputtered a nervous giggle, "and they're laughing when they get out." 
</P>
<P>
 I laughed while airborne too. It was hard to keep a straight face at 12,000 
feet as we accelerated to 750 m.p.h. then slowed for wingovers and loops and a 
simulated carrier break -- that's big Gs, major multiplication of the gravity 
forces -- and a whole bunch of other stuff I'd never heard of, including some 
weird flip where Kidwell turned us upside down and then lifted the nose up, 
delivering a blow to the stomach not unlike a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 See, I'm no military brat. Never heard of the F/A-18, just learned about Gs 
yesterday. But I love roller coasters and I had a blast up in a helicopter the 
day after the earthquake. So when they asked if I wanted to fly with the 
Angels, it wasn't a hard choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Tuesday I started to read other reporters' accounts of the adventure.  
</P>
<P>
 It got worse Wednesday morning when I showed up and people started talking in 
a language I barely understood about flights they'd been on before, and the 
experts just kept shaking their heads and saying, "Faster. This is faster." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally I signed some waiver saying: "I hereby release and discharge the 
United States, its agents, servants or employees from any and all claims for 
property damage and/or personal injury or death resulting from . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It was too late to back out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all just a blast," Kidwell, 36, said when I asked about the most fun 
he's ever had in a plane. "Doing maneuvers. Dogfighting. Dropping bombs . . . 
it's all fun." 
</P>
<P>
 A Kansas native, Kidwell began flying when he joined the Navy in 1984, and was 
named a Blue Angel last fall. He's a father of three, but with the Angels' 
hefty road schedule, he's home in Pensacola, Fla., only on Mondays and 
Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe," he asked on our bird-like climb straight into the sky, 
"that they pay me to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, tell it to the grunts in camouflage, eyes fixed on the spectacular shiny 
blue jet as it zoomed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like owning a Corvette but you never get to drive it," seethed the one 
with SMITH printed in black letters on his shirt pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do anything," said his buddy, BUCHANAN. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jealous," agreed another friend, LONGORIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I joined the Marine Corps, but I can't get a ride on a F/A-18," Smith 
repeated. "I'm gonna get a job at a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Just another little perk.

PROFILE IN PAPER WAS BAD NEWS FOR SCAM SUSPECT

<P>
 No one would confuse the Wall Street Journal with television's "America's Most 
Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Donald Lee Peterson, sitting in the Orange County Jail, the two might 
seem interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his arrest April 20, the day after a profile of him appeared in the 
Journal, the 56-year-old Peterson was wanted on charges of posing as a 
bookkeeper at seven West Coast businesses over the past seven years and 
embezzling in excess of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1993, a Huntington Beach company named Nathan J. International Inc., 
reported to police that its bookkeeper had embezzled $44,000. An investigation 
by the Police Department's fraud unit indicated that the man, using the name 
Michael Hammond, had been operating throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Customarily, police said, Hammond -- or David Shelton or 13 other aliases -- 
would answer ads for a bookkeeper at a small business, using a faked resume. 
Then he would create false suppliers who billed for work never done, according 
to Huntington Beach Lt. Charles R. Poe. Sometimes he would deposit only a 
fraction of money paid to the business, siphoning off the rest for himself, Poe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 19, using information provided by Huntington Beach police, the Wall 
Street Journal profiled the man and the scam in a 1,100-word article on the 
front of its second section. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Journal, an unnamed man, believed to be in his 50s, had been 
victimizing small businesses from San Jose to Long Beach to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, after reading the Journal story and recognizing his employee, a 
business owner called Huntington Beach Police, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wall Street Journal is not something you think of for something like this 
to happen," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business owner asked police not to identify him or his business, "Probably 
out of embarrassment," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Huntington Beach detectives arrested Peterson at the business 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't say or do anything," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson is being held on a $1-million warrant from San Jose and on $500,000 
bail for two counts of grand theft in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Police don't know much about Peterson, apart from his name, which they learned 
through fingerprint identification. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely no idea where he's from, and he won't tell us," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrest, Poe said, investigators have traced Peterson's record to the 
1950s, when he served time in federal prison for similar scams.

CHAN TELLS JURY OF TAY KILLING; TRIAL: HE SAYS THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING ORDERS OF 
ANOTHER CHARGED IN THE CRIME AND THAT THE VICTIM PLANNED TO BLOW UP HIS HOUSE. 
'I HAD TO KILL HIM BECAUSE OF THE BOMBS.' 
</P>

<P>
 Robert Chan, the teen-ager accused of masterminding the 1992 New Year's Eve 
slaying of a high school honor student, testified for the first time Wednesday 
that he helped four other youths bludgeon and bury the victim but claimed he 
was only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, 19, told an Orange County Superior Court jury that he joined in the 
slaying because he believed the victim, Stuart A. Tay, had rigged his Fullerton 
home with explosives and was going to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to kill him because of the bombs," said Chan, looking boyish in a pale 
yellow pullover sweater and gray slacks. "I had to participate in killing him 
because that was the only way to stop him, prevent him from blowing me up." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the prosecution, Chan was the ringleader who plotted the murder 
because he believed Tay was about to double-cross him in a planned robbery of a 
computer salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the defense, Chan is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who 
killed Tay because he believed that he must kill or be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, 17, of Orange, first contacted Chan in October, 1992. He used an alias 
and portrayed himself as a 19-year-old crime figure who had more than 100 loyal 
followers and the ability to pirate computer programs and counterfeit $100 
bills, driver licenses and credit cards, Chan told jurors. Tay also bragged 
about access to high-powered explosives and other weaponry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said he was "alarmed, amazed" to learn that Tay had spies at his high 
school who reported back with personal information about Chan, including his 
address, details about his clothing, even information about a cheerleader Chan 
had liked a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum, has chalked up the 
bizarre testimony about guns, counterfeiting and spy networks to Tay's youthful 
attempts to impress, but he said he doubts the events ever even took place. But 
the defense says Tay's bragging fed Chan's paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay claimed he was handpicking Chan as an associate he could trust, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed pretty powerful by now. Obviously, he had the ability to find out 
information about me. He had people spying on me," Chan explained to jurors, 
adding that that was why he felt he could not refuse to participate in the 
planned robbery. "I didn't want to upset him by saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan testified that he tried to avoid contact with Tay but that the victim 
threatened him with a "nasty" surprise. Chan later became convinced that Tay 
had rigged his home with powerful explosives and could kill him at the touch of 
a button, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan appeared slightly nervous at the start of his testimony and was 
repeatedly admonished to speak slowly. During his seven hours on the stand, 
Chan showed no signs of remorse about the murder and seemed to wear an odd grin 
as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, Chan said he was not 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I talk, that happens. I don't know why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Mun 
Bong Kang, 19, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, both of Fullerton, will go on trial 
after Chan's case concludes. The defendants attended Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was beaten before rubbing 
alcohol was forced down his throat, and his mouth and nose were taped shut. He 
was then buried in Acosta's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was a fifth assailant, Charles Choe, 18, of 
Fullerton, who testified that Chan plotted the murder and personally 
administered the alcohol and taped Tay's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Chan told jurors that it was Kang's idea to kill Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned robbery scheme began to unravel when Chan learned that Tay was 
lying about his identify. Fearing a double-cross, Chan told the others about 
his suspicions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to kill him, we can't trust him," Chan quoted Kang as saying. Chan 
told jurors that Acosta planned the attack and said Acosta and Kang landed the 
first blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said he only struck Tay twice and taped his mouth shut at Acosta's order 
but insisted that he did not pour the alcohol down the victim's throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by his attorney, Chan told jurors that around the time of 
the slaying, he heard voices, could not sleep without the lights on and was 
convinced that people were trying to hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chan also told jurors that he knew what he was doing was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that we shouldn't be killing people, no matter what the reason is," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime contender for class valedictorian, Chan faces life in prison without 
parole if convicted of all charges. He resumes the witness stand today.

HOUSE OF HOPE TO OPEN, WITH HELP OF FAITH, CHARITY; SHELTER: THE 20-BEDROOM 
RESIDENCE, DESIGNED TO GIVE HOMELESS WOMEN AND KIDS A NEW START, WAS BUILT WITH 
$3 MILLION IN DONATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Huge stuffed animals sat like sentinels in the corners of the House of Hope's 
spacious lobby, as volunteers painted doors and hung pictures Wednesday for the 
opening today of the largest shelter in the nation for homeless women and 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 The huge home, on a quiet street near Chapman University, was built with $3 
million given by 4,000 private donors and labor donated by builders over the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1940s Craftsman style home beginning today will house two women and three 
children. Five more families are expected within two weeks, said Jim Palmer, 
executive director of the Orange County Rescue Mission, which will operate the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Palmer said, homeless mothers numbered so few in Orange County 
that the mission didn't count them. Now, he said, it estimates their number at 
6,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Those invited to the House of Hope will find 20 spacious bedrooms with 
separate bathrooms, a children's playroom, a counseling room -- particularly 
for victims of spousal abuse -- and a health clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 It also has training classrooms and 15 computers designed to guide women 
through an 18-month rehabilitation period to prepare for jobs and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is not just to provide services but hope," Palmer said. "We found 
that (the women) needed a comprehensive approach to getting back on their 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The house rules will require that the women cease receiving government aid and 
pursue jobs, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a cycle of dependence on the government. We want to cut off that 
cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 The 21,000-square-foot house was built primarily by Standard Pacific Corp., 
William Lyon Homes Inc. and Wormington Homes, working through HomeAid Orange 
County, a nonprofit program of the Building Industry Assn. for the homeless. 
The building group contributed about $1 million to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project was so huge that no one company could do it," said Scott Hearty, 
director of purchasing for Standard Pacific Corp. "The whole concept was to 
divide work in segments." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 subcontractors took turns working on the construction, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Standard Pacific, based in Costa Mesa, has been building heavily in Orange, 
and the House of Hope was "a good chance to give back to a city that has been 
good to us," Hearty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who said members of the mission researched other homeless shelters for 
women, said this is the largest in the nation. It will house a maximum of 45 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Women and their children, who must be 10 years or younger, will be referred to 
the home through public service agencies, churches and community groups. The 
shelter will attempt to stagger the times that families enter the home to 
ensure a regular and uncrowded flow through the 18-month phase.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY TO MAKE OFFER FOR COUNTY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has directed the planning staff to prepare an offer to buy 
county-owned land on Dale Street, between Artesia and Malvern avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant 6.35-acre site, next to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, 
is owned by the county flood-control district and has been used for 
flood-control purposes, said Thomas E. Lynch, director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has been cooperative. Our desire is to begin active negotiations 
with them on the property," Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said any agreement resulting from the negotiations to buy the property 
would be approved by the council at a regularly scheduled public meeting. The 
decision to go ahead with the offer was made at a closed session of the council 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said if the city buys the land, about 1 1/2 acres would be used for a 
$9-million project that will realign Dale Street to intersect with Burlingame 
Avenue and to build a railroad underpass on Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live on Burlingame and other neighboring streets in the 
Bellehurst tract opposed the realignment plan, which has been approved by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said no plans have been proposed for the remainder of the land.  
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials have eyed the property as a possible site for a train 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's a train center or is used for another development is yet to be 
determined," Mayor Donald L. Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone added that if the city is successful in buying the property, the city 
will be able to determine how the land is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With ownership, we can begin to have a say on what finally goes onto that 
piece of property," he said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FAIR BOARD TO ASSESS BUFFALO RANCH COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Fair Board will decide this morning whether to proceed with 
plans to move buildings on Irvine's historic Buffalo Ranch to the fairgrounds 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 An architectural consultant hired by the board to assess the plan's 
feasibility will release a report today that estimates how much it would cost 
to move the buildings. The report also will examine where the buildings should 
be placed on the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board decides to move ahead with the plan, fair officials would begin 
negotiations with Irvine Co., which owns the Buffalo Ranch, and prepare an 
environmental impact report, said Jill Lloyd, a fair spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is doubtful that all of the dozen or so buildings on the ranch complex will 
be moved to Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the buildings are more unfinished. One looked more like a garage and 
has a barn floor," said Lloyd. "We won't consider (taking) those." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair probably will seek the ranch's larger, more prominent buildings, such 
as the tall red silo tower at the center of the complex. Fair officials want to 
use the buildings for classrooms, meeting halls and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Ranch's future has been a controversial topic in Irvine and 
Newport Beach ever since the Transportation Corridor Agencies proposed 
relocating several ranch structures to make way for the expansion of Ford Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch -- at the corner of MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road -- was an 
amusement park in the 1950s known for its bison and other livestock that roamed 
the hilly area. In the 1960s, the architects who designed UC Irvine, Fashion 
Island and parts of Irvine used the ranch as their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, the ranch was home to several businesses. But the Irvine Co. 
cleared out the complex in part because Ford Road construction will limit 
vehicle access to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranchland is zoned for residential development, and the Irvine Co. has 
expressed its intention to one day build houses on the site. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; COUNCIL RELUCTANTLY RENEWS BAR'S PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite strong opposition from residents and council members, the City Council 
has renewed the entertainment permit of a local bar where police have responded 
to 32 calls in the past 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they feared a lawsuit if the city did not grant the 
permit renewal to the owners of The Casbah.But along with the renewal, the 
council required that the bar hire two uniformed security guards to patrol 
inside and outside the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stern voice, Councilman William D. Mahoney cited a list of serious police 
calls to the bar, including one that resulted in the arrest of a patron and an 
employee after the pair stabbed each other, and two others that involved 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need those kinds of people in this community," Mahoney told The 
Casbah's owner, Eric B. Bewley, at the council session last week. "You're 
drawing the kind of people that we don't like in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Mahoney and the four other council members said they voted for 
the permit renewal to avoid a lawsuit. The permit allows Bewley to hire 
"theatrical dancers" to perform on stage, play recorded music and operate a 
jukebox, a video game and pool tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Bewley's attorney, Joshua Kaplan, said he did not believe uniformed security 
guards are necessary and that the current security guards, who don't wear 
uniforms, are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "A uniform is just going to cause more problems than it will cure," he said, 
adding that "I don't think there is a problem at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and people who own businesses adjacent to the bar, however, 
complained that the bar's patrons constantly urinate, litter and vomit in the 
parking lot and leave beer bottles, cans, used condoms and other trash on the 
sidewalks.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; VIVISECTION FOES MOUNT UCI PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 60 members of Orange County People for Animals, some holding pictures 
showing such sights as a live cat with a thick metal probe in its head, 
gathered on the UC Irvine campus Wednesday afternoon to protest vivisection. 
</P>
<P>
 They decried the research of UCI's Dr. Edward G. Jones, whose work involves 
"sewing a monkey's eyelid shut and sitting back and watching it for a year," 
according to OCPA founder Ava Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, of the university's department of anatomy and neurobiology, could not 
be reached for comment, but Leonard Kitzes of the same department called the 
pictures the group displayed "quite an intentional misrepresentation of what we 
do" and said all research at UCI is in accord with the National Institutes of 
Health guidelines and is supervised by a campus veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 That was no consolation for the group, which included several toddlers and a 
great-grandmother. They walked from the edge of campus to the chancellor's 
office, where Park gave an emotional speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be assured some people will choose not to do this work because you 
told the truth today," she told protesters. In a letter to UCI Chancellor 
Laurel Wilkening, she asked for a meeting. Wilkening did not attend the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she led the group through the campus, where students eyed the pictures 
with horror.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's nasty stuff," said one person as a protester walked past with a 
picture of a monkey with metal rods and bars wedged into its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Park said the pictures, for which her group spent $800, came from "various 
sources," but would not confirm that they represented work done in UCI labs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that following federal guidelines in such research is "of little 
comfort to the dozens of monkeys whose eyes are being sewn shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitzes said research on monkeys is "a tiny portion" of his department's work 
-- as little as a tenth of 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, 39, became involved with animal rights in 1986 when she met a UCI 
medical student who took her to his lab. She saw live animals immobilized in 
metal vises as part of procedures done on them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was so horrified that she immediately stopped wearing leather goods and 
eating meat, and two years later founded the group. Today, she said, she spends 
most of her time working for the group for no salary, and the rest running a 
small, private business. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said that few students joined the protest 
because they understand that using animals is important in the work of research 
institutions such as UCI. ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; IRVINE CO., CITY OK DEVELOPMENT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. and the city this week moved ahead with plans for hundreds of 
homes, apartments and affordable senior housing on four properties, including 
two prominent parcels overlooking Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 A new tentative agreement provides for $20 million in street improvements to 
be paid by the company and 152 acres of open space to be dedicated to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, Newport Beach voters resoundingly defeated an effort to buy 
the bay-view property known as Upper Castaways and Newporter North for $69 
million, thus opening the way for these development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. officials say that bulldozers may begin moving dirt in about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our perception that the marketplace is beginning to show signs of 
life," said Tom Redwitz, senior vice president of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The development will fill in much of Newport Beach's remaining undeveloped 
land over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the product of three years of planning and consensus with the city 
and the community and covers all of the significant undeveloped properties we 
own within the city," Redwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most prominent properties scheduled for development are the 77-acre 
Newporter North and the 57-acre Upper Castaways, both of which provide an 
impressive view of the city, the harbor and the ocean and were the subject of 
the November election to preserve them. Those two sites someday will house 363 
townhomes, athletic fields, view parks and open space to be dedicated to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. plan involves two other sites: 16 acres of the Lower Bayview 
Landing near Backbay Drive, where senior housing is planned, and 21 acres near 
San Diego Creek South north of University Drive, where a 300-unit apartment 
complex is planned.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan also address other Irvine Co.-owned properties scattered throughout 
the city. The entire scope of planning includes construction of 956 homes and 
apartments, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and 120 units of affordable 
senior citizen housing.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is high demand for affordable housing room from both the city and 
community," Redwitz said. The Irvine Co. announced this week that it is 
attempting to find a nonprofit organization to help with plans for the 
affordable housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has approval in concept from the city and the California 
Coastal Commission for its development plans but must get new approvals from 
both bodies when streets and lots actually are mapped. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY TO FORM POOL OF SERVICE CONSULTANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are planning to form a pool of consultants that will provide 
specialized services for the Engineering and Public Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants will provide design, planning, inspection and engineering 
services that often are too large, time consuming and complex, said Victor 
Rollinger, the city engineer and public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinger said the city administers up to $2 million a year in road repairs, 
traffic signal and storm drain improvements, bridge analysis and other city 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more cost-effective to retain professional consultants on a contractual 
basis for the larger and more complex projects," Rollinger told the City 
Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinger said the city will invite engineering firms to apply as consultants 
next month and will make the selection in July. Contracts will be signed in 
August, he said, and the consultants will be called on a "as-needed" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, city officials decided to combine the jobs of city engineer and 
public works director -- after the retirement of Public Works Director Jerry 
Andersen -- to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinger was hired in January to serve as public works director and city 
engineer, although BSI Consultants of Santa Ana remained the city's consulting 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract with BSI expires April 30 and will not be renewed because the 
city has its own engineer, officials said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY TOLD SMALLER DEFICIT IS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's budget for the current fiscal year has improved, but a shortfall is 
still predicted, City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga has informed the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly report to the council, Uberuaga said that the city now faces 
about $100,000 less in red ink than predicted a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The former forecast was for a deficit of $149,015 by June 30, the end of the 
fiscal year. Uberuaga said that because of some spending reductions by the city 
and some improvements in the overall economy, the city now faces a $53,972 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Additional expenditure reductions will be implemented," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said that in many revenue-producing areas, income to the city is 
falling shorter than anticipated. "The latest reductions in revenue are from 
the state motor vehicle license fee (returns) to the city, which are down 2.7% 
from what the state projected in April of 1993," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga also said the city has received less income from building permits 
than expected in the first three months of 1994. He said this resulted from a 
lag in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city can expect increased revenue from property taxes between now and 
the end of the fiscal year. Uberuaga said the city now expects to get about 
$400,000 more in property taxes this year than anticipated, largely due to 
fewer tax delinquencies. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY JOINS GROUPS PLANNING BASE USE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city this week officially joined two groups seeking to craft separate 
redevelopment plans for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday voted to join both a panel that favors converting 
the base into a commercial airport as well as a county-sponsored agency, which 
includes some cities that oppose an airport use for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said joining both groups will underscore the city's neutrality on 
the airport issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just really want to get the most information," said Councilman Frank 
Laszlo, who will serve on the two groups. "The real issue is to represent our 
residents and to maintain our neutrality." 
</P>
<P>
 Laszlo has been attending Orange County Regional Airport Authority meetings 
for several months. Members of the group -- who include representatives from 
Newport Beach, Anaheim and Garden Grove -- said that turning the 4,700-acre 
base into an air cargo facility could give the county economy a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 But several South County cities opposed to the idea of a commercial airport 
fear it will generate traffic, noise and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is sponsoring its own agency charged with creating a redevelopment 
plan for the base once the military pulls out by the end of the decade. The 
agency will look at several options, including an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cities on the agency's nine-member executive board -- such as Irvine 
and Lake Forest -- are opposed to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Laszlo said he will report to the council periodically on both groups. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PARENTS PRESS FIGHT OVER PHONE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dispute over a 90-foot cellular transmission tower near the playground at El 
Morro Elementary School has angered parents so much that some have threatened 
to transfer their children to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are vowing to fight until the tower comes down, parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some bloody battles ahead," said Doug Rowe, who has two 
sons at the school. "We will not take no for an answer. We're very, very 
determined." 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch Cellular, previously PacTel, installed the tower and a microwave dish 
in August, according to an agreement with the Laguna Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The company made a concession to parents in January by removing the microwave 
satellite dish after parents complained that the electromagnetic radiation 
emissions could pose a health risk to children. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents have continued to lobby for the removal of the rest of the 
equipment, including the tower -- which allows cellular telephones to operate 
in the area -- underground radio equipment and an above-ground cooling system. 
They say the system is ugly and noisy, and that in leasing the land to AirTouch 
for $18,000 per year, the district has allowed the "commercialization" of 
school property. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving notice from AirTouch Cellular this week that the tower will 
not be removed, parents said they would meet tonight at 7 p.m. at the Wells 
Fargo Bank Building in Laguna Beach to consider their next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens if it gets hit by lightning? It's the highest thing around," 
Rowe said. "My phones have been ringing off the hook from people who are just 
furious. People are screaming they're going to take their children out of 
school, which is the last thing we want to have happen." 
</P>
<P>
 David Carroll, who also has two sons at El Morro, said some parents still fear 
that the equipment poses a possible health risk, but most dislike the 
transmitter for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ugly, it is inappropriate," he said. "We don't want the 
commercialization of the school grounds. . . . Why not put a McDonald's there? 
Where's it going to end?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Melissa May, a spokeswoman for AirTouch Cellular in Irvine, said the 
equipment provides a valuable service to thousands of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be any damage to anyone or anything as a result of 
this," she said, adding that the company has been "trying very hard to educate 
(the parents) about the tower and the radio transmission." 
</P>
<P>
 School district Supt. Paul M. Possemato said he and school board members have 
met with parents and, essentially, agreed to disagree on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I can only tell them they're on their own in pursuing this," he 
said. "We will honor our contract." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HIGH-TECH HELP TO FIND LOST PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When her Siamese cat vanished about three years ago, Rebecca Rosenbaum found 
herself in a scenario all too familiar to many Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, she searched for Crystal, a white cat with brown paws and 
bright-blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up spending every day (looking for the cat)," she said. "I had to 
take time off to do this, and I had my boyfriend taking off on his lunch hour." 
</P>
<P>
 But, finally, unable to find her beloved pet, she gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, however, other Orange County residents may benefit from her loss, 
because Rosenbaum is spearheading a drive to create a computer network to help 
reunite pets and owners. Rosenbaum, treasurer of the Animal Assistance League 
of Orange County, is heading up the group's plan to build a "PetNet" 
communications system to link all the county's shelters via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum said the network is needed because lost pets may easily meander 15 
miles before being picked up by a stranger and left in a shelter far from home. 
Currently, the county's 11 shelters lack an effective way of communicating with 
one another, and so pet owners often drive from to one to another in a 
fruitless search, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very frustrating process," she said. "Dogs and cats can wander for 
weeks before they're actually picked up and turned in. . . . There are too many 
lost and found animals that never make it back to their owners." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem, said the Foothill Ranch resident, is that some 
shelters won't release information over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put a computer in every shelter in Orange County and eventually 
network them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system would contain data on every animal turned into any of the shelters. 
Currently, shelter workers keep lists of found animals and exchange that 
information by telephone, said Ruth Frankel, the league president. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Animal Control Officer Joy Lingenfelter called PetNet a wonderful 
idea and said it deals with "one of the greatest challenges we have locally." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the league will not begin lobbying other shelters to join PetNet 
until next year, it has purchased four computers to launch the system and is 
hoping other shelters will get their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we get those animals into the database," Rosenbaum said. 
"If it means we have to buy the computers for" the other shelters, the league 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest project is an ambitious goal for the nonprofit Animal Assistance 
League of Orange County, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary. It was 
formed in November, 1973, by a handful of women who set up a help line in a 
Huntington Beach office to assist residents with pet problems, particularly 
lost pets. 
</P>
<P>
 About six years ago, the group moved into an office offered by the Orange 
County Animal Shelter in Orange. All activities are funded by donations from 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the league operates a kennel, subsidizes spay and neuter operations and 
assists in pet adoptions. Telephone operators field more than 2,400 calls each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think as more people understand what we're trying to do (for lost pets), 
the idea will catch on," Rosenbaum said. "It's just one of those things -- 
unless you've lost a pet yourself, you don't realize the lack of structure 
there is." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; LAST SECTION OF CABOT ROAD OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last section of Cabot Road, which officials expect will become an 
important alternative to Interstate 5 between Oso Parkway and Crown Valley 
Parkway, opened this week during a dedication ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley presided over the ceremony to 
mark the opening of the last section of Cabot Road between Rapid Falls Road and 
Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the road was completed, motorists traveling between the eastern borders 
of Laguna Niguel and Laguna Hills had to use Interstate 5 between Crown Valley 
and Oso parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.6-million project, expected to help residents in their local commutes 
and ease notorious freeway jams, was paid for through the Coastal Area Road 
Improvement and Traffic Signal Fee Program. The program, also known as CARITS, 
collects fees from new development in the area rather than using gas-tax funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the final section of the road, which has been in the planning stages 
about 10 years, started in October, 1992, by Sully-Miller Contracting Co. of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The first link of Cabot Road from Oso Parkway to Rapid Falls Road was 
completed in 1989 through a joint county/developer effort. ANNA CEKOLA

<P>
 The City Council agreed to let City Manager Fred Sorsabal negotiate for police 
helicopter service with a new contractor this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department will help form a regional group for 
joint air support, and the council was advised by city officials to join the 
newly created joint powers agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa have become part of the 
organization, called Airborne Law Enforcement Services. Newport Beach is also 
considering becoming part of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new contract, Mission Viejo would be billed each time the helicopter 
is called. The rate will be $120 per call with no time limit on how long the 
helicopter is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal is negotiating the pact with the joint powers agency. The only issue 
left unsettled is liability for midair collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically don't want to be responsible for plane crashes," Sorsabal said. 
"Several other cities have a problem with this, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal said he expects the issue to be settled soon.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FATES OF FIREFIGHTERS TO BE DECIDED SOON 
</P>

<P>
 City officials said Wednesday they will decide next week whether to dismiss 
two battalion chiefs, two captains and a paramedic for alleged payroll abuses 
in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Another battalion chief is facing suspension in the wake of an independent 
auditors' report released this month that city officials say indicated 
widespread payroll abuses in the Fire Department over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire union officials insist that the firefighters have done nothing wrong 
and that the allegations against them are in retaliation for their support for 
a recall drive against Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other members of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are serious allegations," said Assistant City Manager Don Anderson, who 
conducted the dismissal hearings Monday and Tuesday. "It will take some time to 
review all the materials and come up with a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson declined to name the employees, citing city policy. But officials 
said high-ranking Fire Department officials are involved. Two are directors of 
the firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
 The only identified employee so far is Mike Garrison, a fire captain and 
director of Westminster Firefighters Local 2425, who said this week that he 
received a termination notice from Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Alan C. Davis, said Garrison is facing termination for helping 
issue a press release Jan. 28, charging that cuts in the Fire Department were 
partly responsible for the death of a mentally disabled man during a fire 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison has been suspended since January for what city officials said was 
"unprofessional conduct" by publicly commenting on the fire that was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Davis said, city officials are charging Garrison with failure to 
provide required documentation on 18 different occasions that he has taken sick 
leave and other time off from work since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said that during his dismissal hearing this week, Garrison provided 
pay stubs that indicated deductions were made on his salary for every occasion 
that he was on sick leave and other Fire Department-approved leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco issued the termination notices April 14, two days after the city 
released a KPMG Peat Marwick report of Fire Department payroll practices since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors found, among other things, that in more than 1,400 instances, 
Fire Department employees failed to submit so-called transaction slips that are 
required when employees come back from sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that because sick leave records were not available, 
firefighters received sick leave pay, vacation pay and other compensation 
fraudulently. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; EXECUTIVE NAMED TO WATER COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach businessman Thomas S. Maddock has been appointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson to the Western States Water Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddock, the 66-year-old chief executive officer of Boyle Engineering Corp., 
will replace state Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), who was asked to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilson wanted to put a public member on the council," spokeswoman Jan 
Dana said. "There's already a state employee and a state senator. Sen. Ayala 
agreed; it was a very friendly parting and a mutual understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The other California members of the 51-member council are state Sen. David G. 
Kelley (R-Hemet), and David Kennedy, director of the state Department of Water 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salt Lake City-based Western States Water Council encompasses 17 western 
states, each of which appoints three representatives. The council advises the 
Western Governors Assn. on water policy, particularly regarding federal 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddock was selected for the post, Dana said, because "he is very well 
qualified and widely recognized as an expert on water issues." 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican, Maddock holds a master's degree in civil engineering from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a member of the California Chamber of Commerce, where he serves as 
chairman of the Water Resources Committee. He is also a member of the National 
Society of Professional Engineers, the Institute for the Advancement of 
Engineering and the American Water Resources Assn. DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; WOMAN IS ARRESTED AFTER ROBBERY, CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Garden Grove woman suspected of robbing two businesses Wednesday is in 
custody after a police chase that ended when patrol cars bumped her car and 
forced her to stop in front of a busy golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified as Sandra Ann Arauza, 29, stumbled out of her car and 
threatened to kill herself by pointing a gun to her head. She finally 
surrendered, said police Sgt. Dann Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen police officers had their guns and rifles pointed at the woman 
before she surrendered, Bean said. One officer who suffered a concussion was 
sent to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, where he was 
treated and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 1:35 p.m., police were alerted to a robbery at Nick's Pizza D'Oro, 
10585 Slater Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant employees told investigators that a woman walked inside and 
approached the cashier, Bean said. The robber took out a large-caliber gun from 
her jacket and demanded all the money from the register, said Bean. The cashier 
ducked under a counter and the suspect ran out of the place, firing a shot at 
the business, he said. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car was spotted a few blocks from the robbery by police officers on their 
way to the pizza parlor and a chase ensued, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 About six patrol cars joined the chase, which ended at Warner Avenue and Ward 
Street when several patrol cars slammed against the woman's car, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said Westminster police suspect the woman may have been involved in the 
robbery of a tobacco shop in that city less than a half-hour before the 
attempted robbery at the pizza parlor, Bean said.  
</P>
<P>
 Arauza is in custody at Huntington Beach city jail on suspicion of armed 
robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and evading arrest.FERNANDO ROMERO

19 NEW CASES OF TB FOUND IN STUDENTS AT SANTA ANA SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skin testing of 146 students and staff at Sierra Intermediate School, prompted 
by the discovery of a classmate with symptoms of active tuberculosis, has found 
19 students with previously undiagnosed TB infections, officials reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional eight students and staff were found positive for the disease who 
had also tested positive in the past, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Weismuller, the Orange County Health Care Agency's manager of disease 
control, said all students and staff with positive skin tests will receive 
chest X-rays later this week at the school to help determine if they have 
active cases of tuberculosis. Sputum cultures would have to be taken for a 
definitive diagnosis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county tested only those students and faculty who came in contact 
with an ill 12-year-old girl at the school, Weismuller said the results do not 
indicate that the girl's disease is highly contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point (the 19 positive cases) appear to be just a part of the rate of 
infection that we would expect in the school," Weismuller said.  
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said a large portion of the student body at Sierra Intermediate is 
Latino, an ethnic group that tends to have a significant incidence of 
tuberculosis because of immigration from countries where the disease is 
endemic.

2 SHOOTING DEATHS COULD BE RELATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were investigating two shooting deaths Wednesday night that might be 
related. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:15 p.m., police received 911 calls about gunshots, according to Officer 
Michael McKernon. The bodies of two people, which have not been identified, 
were found in the 1500 block of Palm Lane and the 800 block of Aspen, several 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appear to be connected in some way," McKernon said, but the 
investigation is continuing.

BURGLARS ROB CHARITY OF VAN, EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A charity that feeds thousands of hungry people each month was hit by burglars 
last weekend and lost a van, computer and copier. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen McGlinn, director of Share Our Selves, said that thieves broke through 
the wall of the building at 1550 Superior Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They backed our van up to the door and just filled up," McGlinn said. "It was 
very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer discovered the break-in Saturday afternoon and police are now 
investigating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves tossed calculators, packages of cereal and dried food in with the 
more valuable items, McGlinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 People around the county have called to offer help, she said. One person lent 
a van, which is now used to pick up food donated by bakeries and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Another person offered to do copying work for free, and Taco Bell, a regular 
supporter, lent a computer, McGlinn said. "We have a really wonderful base of 
support in this county and they just never seem to fail us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS, as the 23-year-old nonprofit agency is known, serves about 22,000 bag 
lunches to homeless people each month and gives out about 8,000 packages of 
groceries to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also runs a dental clinic -- the only free one in the county -- 
which serves more than 400 people each month. In addition, its medical clinic 
serves about 1,200 people each month, McGlinn said. SOS also provides financial 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS was founded by about 150 parishioners of St. John the Baptist Roman 
Catholic Church, McGlinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about SOS, call (714) 642-3451.

CONSULTANT CHOSEN TO GUIDE REUSE PLANS FOR EL TORO BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel formed to oversee conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
selected a consultant Wednesday to guide the complicated and controversial 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-3 vote, with one member absent, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority 
chose Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan Inc. as its master consultant. Those 
dissenting had sought more time to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member panel, composed of the five county supervisors and three 
council members from Irvine and one from Lake Forest, began meeting in January, 
months after much wrangling to determine how to plan uses for the 4,700-acre 
Marine base, set to close as early as 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulting team chosen Wednesday consists of Orange County-based firms and 
lists among its experience the closures of Homestead and Lowry Air Force bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The team proposes to bring three plans for El Toro to the panel for 
consideration in about 15 months, a process that will include numerous public 
hearings and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven firms initially submitted consultant proposals to the panel, with two 
finalists ultimately chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough decision," said Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, a member of the 
panel. "Both were very well qualified, but it was my opinion that (they) had a 
team with more experience in base closures." 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the local experience of the team, led by Executive Director Dan 
Miller and project director Bill Vardoulis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is the former interim general manager for the Santa Margarita Water 
District and is a former chief of staff for the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. He has also worked as interim city manager and transition 
consultant for the cities of Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, Dana 
Point and Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vardoulis is a former Irvine councilman and member of numerous commission 
boards and panels, including the Airport Land Use Commission and the Orange 
County Sanitation District. He was also involved in forming the joint powers 
agency that is responsible for financing the 70 miles of toll roads being built 
by the Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the contract, expected to be covered largely by federal planning 
grants, has yet to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, officials with the federal Bureau of Prisons renewed 
requests that panel members consider a minimum- or low-security prison with a 
minimum of 1,600 beds as one possible use at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel did not take any action involving the request.

FLYBYS AND DOLLS; AT THE 44TH EL TORO AIR SHOW, SKY-DIVING G.I. JOES ARE JUST A 
FEW OF THE ACTION HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Boy, do kids have it great these days or what? 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, playing with "army men" meant taking a few cheap molded 
plastic figures, splitting them into opposing forces and, after some cursory 
gunplay (with appropriate mouth noises), wiping out the whole lot with an 
aerial dirt clod attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ka-pow!" "Boom!" End of story. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive-green army men have long since been routed by "action figures" outfitted 
with battery-operated weaponry (sold separately), complete biographies and more 
accessories than Imelda Marcos. And lately, they've taken to becoming human, 
coming to life at your local mall in the form of costumed actors dispensing 
autographs and tips on clean living. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're jumping out of airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, the G.I. Joe Heroes Skydiving Team drops into the 44th 
annual air show at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. (For a complete air 
show schedule, see Page 11). But these are no actors. Comprised of four 
top-rated sky-divers portraying G.I. Joe characters Snakeyes, Zap, Duke and 
Scarlett (yes, she's a she), the act is among more than two dozen military and 
non-military performances scheduled at the free show. 
</P>
<P>
 The air shows begin at 9 a.m. and end about 4 p.m. both days. They include 
such performers as Jim Franklin, who flies a modified World War II UPF-7 WACO 
upside down at 185 m.p.h., and Lori Lynn Ross, a professional stuntwoman who 
walks the wing of Franklin's plane, as well as airborne demonstrations of 
military aircraft such as the USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon, USMC AV-8B Harrier and 
the Canadian CF-5 Freedom Fighter. Other performers include Sean D. Tucker, who 
plummets his Pitts S-2S biplane tail first, rights it at the last minute and 
flies backward at 100 m.p.h., and ground displays of 150 vintage and 
state-of-the-art military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The finale on both days is by the Blue Angels, the flight demonstration team 
launched in 1946 on the orders of Adm. Chester Nimitz to keep public interest 
in naval aviation alive after World War II. Known for their spectacular 
formations, the Blue Angels have performed for 257 million spectators 
worldwide. The team now flies the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, a 
fighter-attack aircraft currently used by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro show marks the debut of the G.I. Joe Skydiving Team, assembled by 
the toy's manufacturer, Hasbro Inc., as part of the 30th anniversary 
celebration of G.I. Joe. After El Toro, the team will travel to air shows in 
nine U.S. and Canadian cities, including a show this August at Miramar Naval 
Air Station in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will perform in El Toro once daily, jumping from a height of 15,000 
to 20,000 feet. Before and after the jump, team members can be found at their 
"ground-based headquarters," marked by a 25-foot-tall G.I. Joe Balloon, where 
they will greet visitors, sign autographs and pose for photos. 
</P>
<P>
 The area will also include a "G.I. Joe Hall of Fame," which will trace the big 
guys (and gals; there are a half dozen female characters in all) from the 
dolls' debut in 1964 to its 1990s role as defender of the environment and 
drug-free living. G.I. Joe went on hiatus from 1978 to '82, when the price of 
petroleum stopped production of the plastic toy.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been 300 million G.I. Joe dolls sold, said Gary Serby, Hasbro's 
director of public relations and marketing. He said the sky-diving team, which 
represents the first time Hasbro has "brought to life" the G.I. Joe character, 
is a natural choice to celebrate the toy's anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sky-diving concept encompasses the (spirit of) heroism and adventure that 
kids express when they talk about G.I. Joe," said Serby in a phone interview 
from the company's Rhode Island headquarters. "Also, we wanted to reach a lot 
of children, and air shows are very family oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 While in this area, the team will visit patients at Memorial-Miller Children's 
Hospital in Long Beach and appear at selected Target stores in Santa Ana, 
Irvine, Mission Viejo and Laguna Hills. They will also perform along with the 
rest of Saturday's and Sunday's acts during an invitation-only dress rehearsal 
Friday for disabled children, senior citizens and military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Air Show, which last year attracted more than a million viewers, 
is billed as the largest air show of its kind in the country. Many consider it 
as much a part of the Orange County experience as a trip to Disneyland or the 
Big A, but not everyone is wild about it. More than one family I know in Irvine 
refer wryly to the Marine base as "our neighbors with a mission," and avoid the 
tremendous crowds and noise by leaving town every year during the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy has also left its mark on the air show. Since 1985, three crashes have 
occurred at the event, killing three performers and seriously injuring another. 
At last year's show, an F-86 Mk 6 crashed in a fiery explosion during an 
aerobatic display, killing the civilian pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 But such tragedies are exceptions and should not discourage families from 
attending air shows, says Bret Willat, the Warner Springs sailplane pilot who 
completed his act just before last year's fatal crash. Willat, aided by his 12- 
and 2-year-old sons and his wife, Karen, will return to perform in this year's 
air show. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the U.S., air shows are set up with the audience safety foremost," said 
Willat, who uses his older son, and occasionally his younger son, in ground 
activities for his act. "What (pilots) do looks difficult, but with the level 
of expertise we're dealing with, it's really very safe." 
</P>
<P>
 In this show, Willat and his 900-pound fiberglass plane (popularly known as a 
glider) will be towed by his wife to an altitude of about 4,500 feet. After the 
towline is released, he performs a series of maneuvers to music, trailing 
colored smoke and winding up with a 150 m.p.h. flyby 10 feet above the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families seem to like my act the best," Willat said. "It's so different from 
the rest of the show (because) it's not noisy, and most people have never even 
seen a sail plane before. It's really very peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 What: 44th Annual El Toro Air Show. 
</P>
<P>

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: WYNONIE HARRIS "WOMEN, WHISKEY & FISH TAILS" (1953-57)

 Harris was the purest and arguably the most effective practitioner of blues 
shouting during his roughly decade-long prime. A vulgar, greasy man who reveled 
in and celebrated his own debauchery, he took his songs about whiskey and women 
to heart. His booze-marinated, prodigiously muscular pipes are a marvel to 
experience, his voice an instrument of undiluted power and macho unequaled in 
sheer might and testosterone level by such contemporaries as Joe Turner, Roy 
Brown and Eddie (Cleanhead) Vinson. By the mid-'50s, though, Harris' 
uncompromising style and double-entendre lyrics were being eased out of 
fashion, replaced by the relatively scrubbed-up, watered-down and 
commercialized sound of early rock 'n' roll. Thus, many of the tracks in this 
collection went unreleased for years, although the material and performances 
are in most cases as vital as such Harris hits as "Good Rockin' Tonight," 
"Bloodshot Eyes" and "I Love My Fanny Brown" (this collection serves as a fine 
companion piece to Harris' "Best Of" anthology, recently issued by Rhino 
Records). Harris died broke, ill and forgotten in 1969, but somewhere, at this 
very moment, he's doubtless shouting down the devil. MORE CLASSICS:

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BUSTER POINDEXTER "BUSTER'S HAPPY HOUR" FORWARD  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The big-band swing bandwagon is getting more and more crowded, seemingly by 
the minute. So far this year we've seen new albums not only from Mr. "Hot, Hot, 
Hot" Poindexter, but also from former rockabilly revivalist Brian Setzer, who 
is touring with his own horn-heavy 17-piece orchestra, and Canadian blues 
singer-guitarist Colin James, whose "little big band" covers jump blues and 
other pre-rock 'n' roll tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the others have the near-ideal mixture of swing, swig and swagger 
that make Buster Poindexter's third outing such a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Other musical archeologists can sound either too square or too earnest; 
Poindexter, a.k.a. David Johansen, knows how to make the music swing, but he 
also understands the proper attitude toward it, which is loud and loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this music is making a comeback because it was born in a time that was 
more relaxed and people seem (at least from this vantage) less zealous about 
making the wise, moral or healthful decision about every aspect of their lives. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, there are loads of songs celebrating imbibing mass quantities of 
demon rum ("Knock'm Down Whisky"), having too much fun ("Saturday Night Fish 
Fry") and, of course, libidos at large ("Big Fat Mamas Are Back in Style"). 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter's larger-than life voice, from the Louis Armstrong-Tom Waits 
gravel-pit school, is the perfect vehicle for them. Musically, the colorful 
arrangements are a refreshing change of pace from pop music styles in which 
vocals are buried in a wall of grunge, or chanted over cerebrum-numbing rhythm 
tracks. There's nary a sign of "artistic growth" from Poindexter's previous two 
outings, unless you want to count his dour album-closing rendition of Ray 
Davies' "Alcohol" as the missing moral to all the preceding songs about 
satiating the various human appetites. Until then, it's just more of the same 
loopy fun. RANDY LEWIS

HEDGEHOGS, SEX AND TOE SHOES; GREAT BRITAIN'S ROYAL BALLET HAS IT ALL IN A 
SINGLE ENGAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Dowell, artistic director of Great Britain's Royal Ballet, likes to 
describe the company as "very versatile," and the description truly seems apt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal's current engagement, through May 8 at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, presents a broader range of subjects than most first-rate 
companies might muster -- drug- and sex-obsessed royalty, gang rapists, 
whimsical animal characters and Shakespearean elfin comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're flesh and blood people who are able to portray emotions not normally 
associated with ballet," Dowell stressed. "We're able to be real people and not 
just fairy-tale dancers." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Kenneth MacMillan's full-length "Mayerling," a story-ballet about the 
murder-suicide of Crown-Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary and his 17-year-old 
mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera. Created in 1978, the ballet draws on the heavy 
Romanticism created by the heady music of Liszt. It will be danced in Costa 
Mesa on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillan continued his interest in dark, serious subjects up to the end. (He 
died in 1992, after collapsing backstage at the Royal Opera House during a 
revival of "Mayerling.") His last ballet, "The Judas Tree" (May 5 and 6), which 
he created that year, took as its subject gang rape, murder and suicide in 
London's Docklands. It will be danced in Orange County by Irek Mukhamedov and 
Viviana Durante, the ballet's first cast. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lighter side will be Frederick Ashton's "Tales of Beatrix Potter" (May 
7 and 8), in which the dancers wear costumes of mice, pigs and hedgehogs -- 
characters familiar from Potter's beloved Victorian children's tales. 
Originally created for a film made in 1971, the choreography was revived as a 
live ballet in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton already had proved a master of subtle narrative when he captured the 
nuances and complexities of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" with 
astonishing compression, veracity and wit in his 1964 "The Dream." Almost every 
major element of the play is included, and John Lanchbery has adroitly, 
wonderfully arranged and filled out the familiar Mendelssohn score with other 
music by the composer. This ballet is paired with "Beatrix Potter"; one work 
for kids, one for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Of another magnitude of genius entirely is Ashton's "A Month in the Country," 
a 1976 ballet based on Turgenev's 1850 play. The ballet begins almost in farce 
and ends in utter heartbreak as it chronicles the shattering impact the love of 
a charismatic young tutor has on various members of a Russian household. 
</P>
<P>
 This work will also be danced on May 5 and 6, separated from "The Judas Tree" 
by shorter pieces by Balanchine, Ashton and William Forsythe. Fairy tales, sex, 
love and toe shoes: exactly the variety Dowell was talking about.

COMEDY; HENRY CHO: NEVER OUT OF CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennessee native Henry Cho likes to tell audiences about growing up as the 
"only Asian guy in, like, four states" and how he hated playing army, because 
the teams were always the same: 
</P>
<P>
 "All my buddies would go, 'OK, it's the neighborhood against you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But in retrospect, it wasn't such a bad deal. Cho, who headlines at the Irvine 
Improv through May 1, didn't know it at the time, but he was laying the 
groundwork for what would become a specialized niche in a highly successful 
stand-up career. The personable comic is the only known full-blooded Korean 
raised in Knoxville working the comedy circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say, 'You've got a great character.' Well, it's not a 
character, it's me," he told The Times in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But shtick can carry a comic only so far. Cho continues to earn fans because 
of his ability to expand beyond the ethnic core. He still addresses the 
Asian/Southern contradiction at the beginning of his act because if he doesn't, 
he says, too many first-timers don't know what to make of him. But once he 
calms the initial uncertainty, Cho moves on to the bulk of his act, drawing 
personal anecdotes from friends, family and youthful experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Brea Improv is featuring the "LoveMaster" himself, Craig 
Shoemaker, in a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipping in and out of multiple characters, Shoemaker takes the crowd on a 
romp through his life, revealing that his mother belly-danced at his high 
school graduation party and that his father runs mule rides and a tepee village 
in the Poconos. Shoemaker also does more than 100 impersonations, from Barney 
Fife to Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Philadelphia native's main man is the deep-voiced, sex-on-the-brain 
LoveMaster ("Hey, Baby, you look so tasty my eyes are getting fat"). As a 
counterpoint, Shoemaker brings in Freedom Spivey, a prissy apologist for 
LoveMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian -- who says he was "a wedgie waiting to happen" in high school -- 
will be in Brea through May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Centerfield Sports Bar & Grill in Huntington Beach on Tuesday night are 
co-headliners Keith Evans and Bobby Gaylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylor, after starting his career as a very blue comic, has changed gears, 
building his set around family life in general and a cantankerous but loving 
father, specifically. Television appearances include "Evening at the Improv," 
"Comic Strip Live" and ABC's "Into the Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans has opened for George Carlin and Sam Kinison as well as working top 
clubs throughout California.

COUNTRY MUSIC; TILL KAHRS IS PLAYING FOR KEEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Born in Germany. Raised in Orange County. Till K. Kahrs doesn't have the 
likeliest of country-music pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he didn't even discover he liked country music until he was 
nearing 30. But despite the late start and the not-quite-Nashville roots, the 
singer-songwriter keeps forging ahead, with tunes that range from sentimental 
tales of love gone wrong to more tongue-in-cheek looks at life. 
</P>
<P>
 He has built a local coffeehouse following and even landed a Top 10 country 
hit back in his native Germany. The biggest break in his stateside career comes 
Monday, when he and his band headline the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahrs was just a year old when his parents immigrated to the United States, 
and German was his first language; he didn't learn English until he entered 
kindergarten. In elementary school, his lingering accent made him the butt of a 
few "Hogan's Heroes" jokes; today, at 36, he retains the language but not the 
accent. After college, he sold wine and spirits for a while, but an affection 
for music finally caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really raised on rock 'n' roll, quite honestly," Kahrs said in a phone 
interview, adding that he played in a couple of rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends told him, however, that his own songs had more of a country flavor, an 
idea Kahrs resisted at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Country? I hate country' " he recalled. "But then I started 
listening to it a little more and thought, 'Wow, this is really good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He made a demo to send to Nashville, selling himself as a songwriter, but 
ended up singing the songs himself when the singer he hired fell ill. Again, 
friends persuaded him to keep singing his own material, telling him his 
baritone was ideal for country music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really self-taught," Kahrs said. "I started sending out my tapes and 
doing showcases in L.A. and places like that." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Nashville hasn't come knocking, but Kahrs is still working on that. He 
did get a call in 1992 from a German record label, and he went to the 
Netherlands to record a 16-song album, "Playing for Keeps." 
</P>
<P>
 The title song was a hit on German country radio, which Kahrs said has a 
surprisingly large following. Since returning from Europe, the Irvine resident 
has been a regular on the Orange County coffeehouse circuit, building a local 
following that he hopes will pack the Crazy Horse (he is selling tickets to the 
show himself). 
</P>
<P>
 He has also invited some music industry executives, hoping the Crazy Horse gig 
(which came up suddenly when another headliner canceled) will serve as a 
showcase. He has started distributing the German album himself to local record 
shops, and "Playing for Keeps" has seen some airplay on country station KIK-FM, 
but his goal is still to land a major record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he continues to work the European connection. He goes back to 
record his follow-up album in June and will also tour the continent, expecting 
to be gone at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Crazy Horse show "is like my last big home stand, for the fans," 
Kahrs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The German audience for country music is fairly big and getting bigger all the 
time, he said, and much of that growth is due to a fascination with the Old 
West. He figures his ability to converse with fans in German will give him an 
edge over some bigger American stars, who are starting to tour Europe more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing the German record deal "was really my first big break," Kahrs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step for me is to get a spot on German television." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: The Till Kahrs Band in concert. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Monday, May 2, 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the Costa Mesa (55) Freeway to the Dyer Road exit. From the 
north, go right on Grand Avenue, then take the first right, Brookhollow Drive; 
from the south, go left under the overpass, right on Grand and right on 
Brookhollow. The club is on the right.

FESTIVALS & EVENTS; FULLERTON DRESSES UP THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a frequent contributor to The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When organizers of the yearly cultural festival "A Night in Fullerton" 
assemble the events and the geography of the evening, there's not much doubt 
that they mean a night in all of Fullerton. For one night, Friday, free music, 
art, drama and dance programs will be offered at 13 locations throughout the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 From an exhibition of hats at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center to musical 
performances by a choir, a jazz band and a country-Western band at Pacific 
Christian College, "A Night in Fullerton" will offer four hours of concentrated 
culture -- between 7 and 11 p.m. -- for the 30th year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The event began in 1964, the brainchild of the internationally known abstract 
artist Florence Arnold, who was also a longtime Fullerton educator and arts 
advocate. Arnold died in March, and this year's celebration is dedicated to 
her, said Joe Felz, director of the Fullerton Museum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and some other artists and gallery owners in the area wanted to promote 
the Muckenthaler Center, which had just opened," Felz explained. "Also, there 
were other galleries that were opening in the city. They worked with the city 
and the Chamber of Commerce and decided a nighttime event would be something 
different and decided to open everything for free." 
</P>
<P>
 The event is strictly non-commercial, and selling of any kind is prohibited at 
all the official sites, which are marked with searchlights and banners. (See 
accompanying list for details.) Participating galleries, studios, schools and 
colleges donate their facilities and services for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's grown ever since the first year," said Felz, adding that this year's 
total of sites is about double what it was 30 years ago. Between 25,000 and 
27,000 people are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs that detail events at each of the sites are available at an 
information booth on Wilshire Avenue just east of Harbor Boulevard, as well as 
at all the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus service between sites is also available throughout the evening.

 Peters Canyon Regional Park, the most recent addition to the county park 
system, is a rolling swath of green that straddles the Orange-Tustin border, 
with a lake at the north end, eucalyptus groves at the south and a 
well-developed trail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened a year ago, the 354-acre park has become a popular destination 
for mountain bikers, hikers, trail runners, equestrians and nature enthusiasts.

REWIND: A 'NIGHT' OF TITANIC PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can have all those tarted-up disaster movies of the 1970s -- "The Towering 
Inferno," "The Poseidon Adventure," the procession of "Airport" potboilers. A 
few spiffy special effects, a handful of flavor-of-the-month stars (remember 
O.J. Simpson playing a cop?), a cliffhanger scene every seven or eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 None of them can compete with the real thing, or even a dramatization of the 
real thing, particularly when it's put together with restraint, a 
matter-of-fact tone and an abiding faithfulness to history. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is "A Night to Remember," what might be called the first disaster movie. 
Released in 1958, three years after the publication of Walter Lord's book of 
the same name, "A Night to Remember" offers all the historical accuracy and 
reliance on Lord's research into the sinking of the Titanic without tarring the 
plot with melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 There are blessedly few subplots here -- no shipboard romances for dramatic 
effect, no shady characters or women of mystery. Recognizing, as Lord did, that 
the loss of the most magnificent ship afloat -- a ship packed to the davits 
with the cream of London and New York society, captains of industry and sons 
and daughters of the most glittering of the great families of Europe and 
America -- provided more than enough drama, Roy Baker directed with a light 
hand and an ear for true dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly British cast will likely be unfamiliar to many Americans (with the 
exception of David McCallum, Honor Blackman, and, possibly, Alec McCowen, who 
has a fine turn as the ship's ingenious baker with an instinct for survival), 
but they are a well-drilled ensemble. They reflect the courage, cowardice, 
foolishness and Edwardian morality of the time with believable accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Night to Remember" (1958), directed by Roy Baker. 123 minutes. Not rated.  
</P>
<P>
 MORE VIDEOS: 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961), directed by Stanley Kramer. 178 minutes. Not 
rated. Where "Schindler's List" addressed itself to the "what" of the 
Holocaust, "Judgment at Nuremberg" draws on the "why" -- in this case, why 
would a group of highly respected German judges preside during the war over a 
series of infamous kangaroo courts, drumhead courts-martial and false 
condemnations that resulted in the deaths of thousands? Spencer Tracy is 
brilliant as the presiding American judge at the trials of the German judges; 
Burt Lancaster is in the dock. Also in the cast are Marlene Dietrich, Richard 
Widmark, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift. PATRICK MOTT MORE VIDEOS: 
"Suddenly" (1954), directed by Lewis Allen. 77 minutes. Not rated. Frank 
Sinatra is a bloodthirsty gun for hire in this simmering thriller about an 
assassination plot against the President. Sterling Hayden as the stiff, 
square-jawed lawman and James Gleason as a captive, are enjoyable to watch, but 
the movie clearly belongs to Sinatra. -- GEOFF BOUCHER

KIDS ON FILM: IT'S NO CRIME TO LAUGH AT 'COPS,' ESPECIALLY IN CHASE SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Cops and Robbersons," an outwardly perfect but truly dysfunctional 
suburban family with a bumbling, ineffectual, cop-wannabe dad (Chevy Chase) 
allows a crusty old policeman and his assistant to move in to monitor a 
gangster who has moved in next door. (Rated PG.)  
</P>
<P>
 So what if the critics have been lukewarm? 
</P>
<P>
 Kids, especially in the 10- to 13-year-old range, said this "dumb comedy" was 
plenty good enough for them.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was better than average, I guess," said Morgan McGilvray, 13. "Most of it 
was pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
 After a confusing start, the movie picked up in the middle and became 
genuinely funny toward the end, they said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was weird because at the beginning you didn't know what was happening; 
they just gave money to this guy and he got blown up," said Dana Birnie, 10. 
"But then it cleared out. . . . It's funny, and it keeps you on the edge of 
your seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Jocelyn Jolley, 10, agreed about the suspense.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some parts you didn't know what was going to happen. I was going like this," 
she said, covering her round tortoise shell glasses with her hands.  
</P>
<P>
 One of those parts came when the mom (Dianne Wiest) gets in the shower without 
realizing the young assistant is already in there, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agreed they laughed the hardest when Chevy Chase, in classic 
slapstick form, tries to rescue his family after they are taken hostage by 
their gangster neighbor in the midst of a showdown with another gangster. 
Imitating his movie heroes, Chase swings a grappling hook over to the house 
next door, hoping to make a dramatic entrance through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's swinging and hit the wall two times," said Jack Reid, 12.  
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Clark, 7, said she liked it when the mom was a hostage and picked up 
one of the gangster's guns and threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really funny. She was saying, 'Put down the gun before Mommy tells 
you twice.' " But then, it was pretty clear she was probably going to snap 
when, only a few days earlier, she was getting up at 4 a.m. to bake bread. Her 
older son smokes, and her daughter thinks she's a woman trapped in a teen-age 
body. And the mom insists through clenched teeth that she loves being a 
housewife and her life is perfect . 
</P>
<P>
 The younger son also got some laughs with a vampire obsession -- sleeping in 
his closed toy box and biting unsuspecting members of the household on the 
neck.  
</P>
<P>
 But even though they were all smitten for a while with the decisive, macho, 
smoker, loner cop "Uncle Jake," they come to realize, predictably and 
improbably, that it's their bumbling dad who loves them the most.  
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the kids said they were already Chase fans, from old movies such 
as "Fletch," and "Funny Farm" -- as opposed to late-night TV. But they agreed 
with the critics that in this movie he didn't get the chance to show off his 
best form.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's better than they showed him," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, suggested Morgan, might be that Chase wasn't showcased as the 
main character but was treated as just a family member. 
</P>
<P>
 Which wasn't necessarily all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a little variety with all the different characters," Morgan added. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was anything wrong with the movie it was that, at an hour and a half, 
it was too short, Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a little longer. We thought it was going to be two hours."

SPECIAL SCREENING: THE FUTURE'S BRIGHT IN 'CENTURY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ildiko Enyedi's "My 20th Century" opens with wildly promising imagery. The 
year is 1880, and the movie's first scene captures the unveiling of Thomas 
Edison's electric light in an elaborate ceremony in Menlo Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of strung bulbs flicker as the crowd gasps. Then a marching band, 
outfitted in lit helmets bizarrely trailing extension cords, tramps past. The 
Technology Age is here, the future is upon us, anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 That thought anchors Enyedi's difficult, original and quirky 1989 film, the 
Hungarian director's first full-length release. "My 20h Century," screening 
Friday night as part of UC Irvine's "Off the Beaten Path" series, successfully 
evaluates and documents a time when the horizon was being extended almost 
daily, leaving people and ideas in wonderful flux. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this turmoil are Dora and Lili (both played by Dorotha 
Segda), twins separated as youngsters, now on very different paths in Budapest. 
Dora is a glittering seductress, using men for both fun and profit. Lili is 
plain-dressed and serious, a revolutionary willing to die for an obscure 
political cause. 
</P>
<P>
 We first meet them just moments after that evocative opening passage (Enyedi 
jumps from America to Europe, from scene to scene, in a quicksilver, often 
arbitrary fashion) as girls selling matches on a snowy street corner. An 
elliptical, poetic mood is created as Enyedi shifts from Edison's twinkling 
lights to the sky's twinkling stars, then back to Lili and Dora, almost 
swallowed by a flurry of snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of this beauty appear two old men, who creep up to the sleeping twins, now 
asleep on the corner. They flip a coin, make their choices and walk off, girls 
in tow, in different directions. We can only guess what that means or what 
happens to Lili and Dora in their next few years. It's part of the picture's 
charm to be ambiguous, non-literal. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence, the big kind that often brings twins together in the movies, 
later places Dora and Lili on the Orient Express. Now fully grown, we see what 
a contrast they are. Dora is sizing up a couple of men, easy targets to be 
sure, while Lili worries about the bomb she's carrying. They never meet and 
don't until near the movie's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, we see some of the day-to-day of their lives, all against a 
backdrop of changing times. The miracle of Edison is in the air, as is the new 
thrill of motion pictures. Beyond that, the suffragettes are speaking out, 
demanding a reinvention of women's roles. Lili and Dora become Enyedi's symbols 
of that, especially where sexuality is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Before "My 20th Century," Enyedi made highly experimental short films and her 
interest in the abstract clearly marks this one. Sometimes that seems 
indulgent, as in a self-conscious passage where a zoo ape talks mournfully to 
the camera about how he was caught, but other times it brings a layer of 
artfulness that can be fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also satisfying for film fans to see how reverential and referential 
Enyedi is when it comes to the medium. Several scenes echo the great 
melodramatic silent films, especially the work of D.W. Griffith, and the finale 
even borrows from Orson Welles' famous hall-of-mirrors episode in "The Lady 
From Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Ildiko Enyedi's "My 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, April 29, 7 and 9 p.m.

NEWSBITES: SOUL KITCHEN JAZZES UP MAIN STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Soul Kitchen, a quiet, jazzy alternative to the rock of Huntington Beach's 
Main Street, opened recently at the site of the former Surf Taco. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner is Scott Cochran, whose Java Jungle just two blocks away has become 
one of the area's most popular coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran has hired Steve Hazelton as head chef at the Soul Kitchen. The two met 
during a brief and aborted stint Cochran did at the California Culinary Academy 
in San Francisco. Hazelton, who graduated, participated in the opening of the 
now-defunct Rex, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soul Kitchen (no relation to a defunct Santa Ana dance club of the same

CASSIS SPLITS PERSONALITY IN A FRENCH TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cassis is barely three months out of the starting gate, but it's already one 
of our better French restaurants. Too bad hardly anyone seems to have noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the problem is its contradictory style. Decor and menu want to suggest 
both the lap of luxury and the feeling of a humble bistro. On one hand, crisp 
linens and fine wineglasses await at your table; on the other, there are 
rustic-looking indoor awnings and posters of French wine regions, as in your 
basic casual restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxy, warehouse-like effect of the huge dining room -- its ceiling, walls 
and exposed air ducts all painted mauve -- would go better with something 
self-consciously hip or festive, such as the previous occupant, the late, 
unlamented Cabo Coast. And the enormous glass view windows, which display the 
traffic whizzing by on Jamboree Road, belong to still another school of 
restaurant design. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, Cassis may seem somewhat gauche. By night, though, when the traffic 
subsides and the lighting is soft and subtle, a grudging elegance comes 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner George Foddai brings a wealth of experience to his new restaurant. He is 
a French-born Italian who already owns two successful restaurants, Giorgio's 
Place and La Grotte, both in downtown Long Beach. Foddai is hoping Orange 
County diners will respond the way that his Long Beach patrons have, and he's 
improved his odds by hiring Byron Gemmell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemmell has been an Orange County restaurant star for more than a decade. He 
was trained by a chef famous for his touch with delicate foods -- Jean 
Bertranou of the legendary Los Angeles restaurant L'Ermitage. In the early 
'80s, Gemmell was chef-owner of the excellent Gemmell's in Costa Mesa. Most 
recently, he headed up the kitchen at Chanteclair. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt about his skills as a cook. At Gemmell's, he prepared one of 
the best versions of foie gras I have ever tasted. But don't expect that type 
of dish at Cassis. The restaurant doesn't plan to serve anything over $15, 
which rules out masses of foie gras.  
</P>
<P>
 Happily, that $15 price point still leaves Gemmell a lot of room. The best 
value is a $12.95 prix fixe dinner of soup, entree and dessert. One evening I 
had a fragrant pureed green pea soup, followed by rotisserie chicken with 
potatoes and a spinach timbale, then a crusty apple tart.  
</P>
<P>
 On the a la carte menu, the appetizers are generally opulent, with occasional 
touches of lightness and originality. Gulf shrimp are sauteed to crispness and 
served on a bed of spinach in a well-balanced balsamic vinegar sauce with just 
enough sweetness. Roasted goat cheese, which has become a cliche in lesser 
hands, is a pleasure. Gemmell serves it with slivered almonds and a gutsy 
handful of sauteed cabbage, a combination that makes sense as soon as you taste 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other appetizers are marinated salmon with a smooth dill sauce and 
prosciutto with celery root, capers and shaved Parmesan cheese. Gnocchi with 
asparagus and foie gras (a little bit of it, diced into a deglazed sauce) is 
too rich for a first course but not substantial enough for an entree, and the 
flavors don't quite go together. "Baby artichoke baked Provencale" is stuffed 
with a salty mixture of bread crumbs and diced tomatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 The entrees frequently showcase Gemmell's sauce-making abilities. One solid 
choice is roasted duck, available with either a cassis sauce (that is, a sauce 
based on cassis , or black currants) or a rich green peppercorn sauce. Gemmell 
serves his duck in the Nouvelle Cuisine fashion started around 25 years ago in 
France. The breast is sliced and the leg is served en confit (preserved in salt 
and fat and then fried). It's a dish I'd eat any day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several entrees are hearty bistro-type dishes, perhaps a bit upscaled. Braised 
lamb shank is straight-ahead -- one large shank with mashed potatoes and baby 
vegetables -- but the pork loin with mustard sauce (thick slices of perfectly 
cooked meat) comes in a sauce that is much more patrician than you'd expect at 
any bistro.  
</P>
<P>
 The chef's fish preparations look luxurious beside the bistro dishes. The 
ethereally light sand dabs are sauteed in olive oil and white wine, then 
sprinkled with pine nuts. Whitefish is baked with baby artichokes and a 
sprinkling of a sweet spice. Poached salmon comes in a light parsley sauce with 
asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't miss the golden puffs of pureed potato that Gemmell calls Byron's 
potatoes. They are a take on the classic French pommes dauphine , and they 
happen to be exquisite. One of my guests remarked he'd like to eat a plate of 
them for dinner, with sour cream and caviar. Soon afterward, a side of them 
arrived -- with sour cream. (Caviar is probably too luxurious for the concept 
here, remember.) 
</P>
<P>
 While he was enjoying his potatoes as a dessert, the rest of us had a pear 
poached in red wine and filled with a light chocolate mousse, plus a lemon tart 
with a pungent filling and a light crust. But even though our pastries capped 
the meal off with a flourish, we secretly envied our friend and his dish of 
potatoes. So maybe Cassis's oddball mixture of bistro heartiness and 
lap-of-luxury haute cuisine works after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassis is moderately priced. Appetizers are $4.50 to $9. Entrees are $12.95 to 
$14.95. CASSIS

LOST IN O.C.: DOING THE GOOD DEED, FOR SMOKEHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition.

 I suppose we all know a few people who are just plain good. Whatever the right 
thing is in any given situation, they just do it automatically, like it's the 
only thing to do. You find out they've been doing charity work for years 
without saying a word about it; supporting their parents; feeding strays; 
learning CPR; helping kids with their graffiti spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Most folks other than my girlfriend -- who knows me too well -- think I'm a 
pretty nice guy. But these genuinely nice people really get my goat, because 
it's never so easy for me. If I do something kind, it's only after I've weighed 
all the wretched things I could do instead. Sometimes I think I never became an 
ax murderer or extortionist simply because it's too much work. And when I do 
the right thing, it's rarely without considering the credit I might get to bask 
in as a result. Basking in credit is fun, nearly as satisfying as eating a 
Snickers in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 If I wind up being honest more often than not, it's only because lying is so 
easy and common that it just isn't interesting. Look at all the successful numb 
skulls driving $46,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 My own considerably more humble vehicle presented me with a bit of a quandary 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago my sweetheart and I were vacationing in Big Sur and at 
dusk were only just pulling into the campgrounds when a kid came tearing down 
the road on a bike. I took my spiffy Saturn from a crawl to a stop, and he 
whizzed by on my left. Then a second kid followed him, heading straight at us. 
He possibly could have swerved to either direction. He could have tried 
braking. Instead, he got this surprised look on his face, like, "Wow! A 
Saturn!" and plowed right into us. 
</P>
<P>
 The bumper stopped his bike, but he kept on sailing, my field of vision 
filling with his pudgy, bucktoothed 10-year-old's face hurtling directly toward 
mine. Then he hit the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 He rolled off the hood to my side of the car. My girlfriend was already out 
comforting him on the ground while I was still taking it in. My first thought 
was of those commercials where you see colored air slipping around the 
aerodynamic design of an auto. That design evidently applies to kids as well: 
He'd slid over the hood and right on up the windshield, so he never had a solid 
impact. He was winded, scared, had a sore knee and chin, and mostly needed some 
hugs and a new front wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The other kid fetched the father, who was much relieved, thanked us and 
offered to pay for any damage to the car. I declined, being too delighted that 
the kid was OK to care about some metal and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at our campsite, though, I kept going back to survey my hood's two new 
scratches and small circular dent. The dent, on first inspection, had seemed a 
mere dimple, but on subsequent viewings it started taking on the dimensions of 
a lunar crater. 
</P>
<P>
 That night and the next day I let my minor good deed be sullied by thoughts of 
finding the other party's camp: "Oh, just checking to see how your son is 
doing. It's amazing how little damage he did to my car . No, really, you don't 
have to pay me for it. Oh, all right, if you're going to insist ." 
</P>
<P>
 I almost did something selfless this past week, though I'm going to blow that 
by telling you about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month I wrote here about my cat of 11 years, Smokehouse, who disappeared 
into a noisy cat fight on March 15. Several of you have called or written 
asking for an update on him, or have passed on encouraging cat stories -- how 
they'll wander and return -- and a couple of you called with sightings of a 
potential Smokehouse helping himself to your pets' dishes. That would have been 
just like him, to go larking on the cat version of a wine tour of France while 
we worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Heartfelt thanks to all for your concern and input, but until last week we 
still had no clue what had become of him. My roommate, who was always closer to 
Smokehouse than I was, had done a lot of detective work, following leads and 
even mapping out the routes the neighborhood cats take on their nightly forays. 
A few weeks ago a neighbor kid told her about a dead cat that he and others had 
looked at in another neighbor's yard -- you might recall the attraction gross 
things have to the young -- but at the time, the kid's description of the cat 
didn't match ours. Maybe he was trying to be kind then, but when she talked to 
him again recently, he described our gray, hefty pugilist. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly widow who lives right behind us confirmed that her granddaughter 
had found the cat, gray and undoubtedly ours, in a little-traveled part of 
their yard. She'd already thrown out our notices, and not knowing how to 
contact us, paid her gardener to bury him. So for the past month he'd been 
there, 30 feet from our back yard while we'd been searching shelters and 
everywhere else for him. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone, be it person or pet, departs, I think the valuable part that 
lingers is what they've left in our hearts. I have no great feeling for 
cemeteries or vacant remains. 
</P>
<P>
 My roommate, though, said she'd feel better if Smokehouse was resting at home. 
I couldn't imagine the relocation process making anyone feel better, so I took 
it on myself to do it when she was at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever this neighbor had paid her gardener to inter our cat, she got her 
money's worth. He was buried so deep that I had nearly concluded the gardener 
had pulled a fast one. Then I hit gray fur and the smell. As far gone as he 
was, he looked featureless, like a Pompeii dog, but I knew it was him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling him out was the most horrible thing I've attempted, but I felt 
detached somehow. To be honest, I was thinking what I might write about it, how 
to turn my grief into a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been able to rationalize several of life's more painful moments that way: 
that when you fancy yourself some kind of artist, all experience becomes good. 
That wall held for about five minutes until, while driving Smokehouse home, I 
saw our flyer still on a phone pole, with the photo of him looking noble, 
idiotic and alive. His dead weight hit me, and I broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 I dug our own hole deeper, figuring I should do at least as good a job as this 
stranger had done. Also, as long as I kept digging, I didn't have to face 
looking at him again. Finally I rolled him into his last home from the black 
plastic lawn bag I'd had him in, chucked in a can of Trader Joe's salmon, and 
shoveled on the dirt. Not quite up to the mythic pomp of the JFK funeral, but 
what can you do? I'm planting catnip on top. And now I'm getting paid for it.

3-HOUR TOUR: COLLEGE COUNTRY IS A STUDY IN CAFFEINE, SOPHOMORIC PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're a student at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, you just had that 
big test, and there's no way you're going to crack another book. What are you 
going to do? Head across the street to College Country Center. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:45: Give yourself a whack upside the head and get mindless at Tecmo 
Gameland. 
</P>
<P>
 Invest your quarters and any extra testosterone in such games as Strato 
Fighter, Thunder Blaster and Over Drive, or the more cryptic Neo-Geo and R-Type 
Leo. Gals Panic proved an odd mix of spiders and cupids. Using boxing gloves 
attached to Sonic Blast Man, my jabs at a giant crab earned this message: "You 
blew it -- a cruise ship has fallen victim to the monster." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fuddy-duddies among us, Gameland also offers more recognizable pinball 
adventures such as "Indiana Jones," "Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends" and 
"Jurassic Park." I played "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Captain Jean-Luc 
Picard seemed to be trying to tell me something important, but I couldn't hear 
a thing over the din. Beats me if I won or lost. 
</P>
<P>
 I popped for four final quarters and consoled myself with a large Slush Puppy. 
</P>
<P>
 2:45 to 3:30: Fill your now-emptied brain cavity with something that could 
keep your attention for a lifetime instead of 60 seconds. According to owner 
Vincent Morgan, Morgan's Big Trains Emporium carries trains "for every age on 
the block. There's nothing magical about a number. Some children at 3 can run 
an electric train. Some adults shouldn't be allowed near them." An innocent 
question about scale elicited a detailed explanation of gauges from Morgan, 
summarized thusly: "There are a zillion different sizes out there. Gauge is the 
distance between rails. Gauge 2 narrow track got nicknamed G-gauge. Everything 
you see in here runs on G gauge. By a certain amount of fudging, trains of 
different scale can fit that gauge." 
</P>
<P>
 Brio is a wooden train system "powered by imagination." Circus trains come 
complete with lions and tigers and bears -- oh, my! Take a few moments to 
admire the LGB locomotives (up to $900) in a glass case. Morgan's favorite? 
"Anything this company makes," he said. "My preference might be Rocky Mountain 
style, but I love to watch the Swiss engines run." 
</P>
<P>
 Books include "Rails Through the Orange Groves, a Centennial Look at the 
Railroads of Orange County, California," Volumes I and II. Videos range from 
"Great Trains of the West" to any number from the "Thomas the Tank Engine and 
Friends" series, such as "James Goes Buzz Buzz." 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 to 4: College students need a well-rounded education, and an adult shop 
called Paradise, for which you must be 18 years or older to enter, is 
guaranteed to broaden one's horizons. But having already earned my degrees, I 
was content to merely break out in a sweat as I passed, and explored instead 
the shop next door, which in any case presented a more realistic view of 
post-grad life: Little Ones' Reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The store specializes in used children's clothes, toys and maternity wear. 
There is also a rack of new clothes, occasionally new furniture such as a crib, 
stuffed animals and blankies, ski boots and cowboy boots. I picked up a copy of 
Dr. Seuss' "One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish" in perfect condition for 
$2.25. Who brings the stuff in? "People like you," said proprietor Birgitta 
Elward. "And it's often the same people buying and selling." 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5: Strange Brew Espresso Bar, which offers gourmet coffees and 
accessories, is actually two rooms in one: Strange on one side, Brew on the 
other. "This room is 'Strange,' " explained counterman Max Petitt. "Where are 
you? You're in the '60s." Indeed, the room where comedy, live music and poetry 
readings take place at night is psychedelic. " 'Brew' looks like a bar you 
might see in Chicago or New York." 
</P>
<P>
 An on-the-go-kind-of-breakfast menu includes waffles and bagels. Lunch is 
limited to soup in a sourdough-bread bowl. At night, Petitt said, "the 
entertainment is our menu." Pshaw. Check out locally made Brothers Ice Cream 
Truffles; flavors include Czechoslovakian chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rear is a small honor library and reading room, and an exhibition of 
jewelry and other items made from hemp fibers. "Not marijuana, hemp, " he said. 
"There's a big difference. This shirt is made from hemp. Hemp can be used to 
make paper with a shelf life of 1,500 years as opposed to 80 years, that can be 
recycled at least 10 times instead of two or three." On one wall, printed on 
hemp paper, hung the Declaration of Independence. Golden West College in

CITY HALL NEWS / MONTEREY PARK; RACISM CHARGED IN LIBRARIAN'S OUSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an action that library staff and several patrons called racially motivated, 
the Monterey Park library board last week forced the resignation of City 
Librarian Jeannette Cheng, one of two Asian city department heads in the 
majority Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the city's Friends of the Library -- a white woman -- 
denounced the action against Cheng. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think this was racially motivated. A groups of Caucasians -- old 
timers -- were very upset when an Asian was appointed librarian and wanted her 
out," said Tisa Levine, who heads the group that raises money and provides 
volunteer services to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The four members of the Bruggemeyer Memorial Library Board of Trustees who met 
last Thursday to discuss Cheng's dismissal gave no reason for forcing her out; 
a written statement made no mention of the nature of the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Cheng expressed pride, and the board expressed its appreciation for Ms. 
Cheng's efforts as city librarian," the statement said. When interviewed, none 
of the board members would discuss the allegations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of many staff and supporters who called her "a great team 
leader," the trustees asked for and got Cheng's resignation after a long 
meeting, most of it behind closed doors.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the library is considered a city department and is financed by the 
city, the five-member board controls the library independently of the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng, a Chinese American, took over as city librarian two years ago. She 
previously had worked in the Madison, Wis., library system. 
</P>
<P>
 After agreeing to take a $60,000 buyout and to refrain from discussing the 
matter publicly, Cheng was relieved of her duties Friday and will formally 
leave her $57,000 post Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very angry, but I cannot go on without the board's full support," she 
said in an interview before signing the agreement. "The board said I'd given 
too much attention to the divided community," a phrase she interpreted to mean 
the Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Kathleen Brzozowski said the terms of the buyout do not allow 
her or other board trustees to comment, but she did say, "(Cheng's) previous 
evaluations haven't been satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
 Only trustee Marina Tse, one of two Asian American members, openly voiced 
support for the librarian. The other Asian American member, Carolyn Chan, was 
part of the three-member majority that sought Cheng's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time that racial issues have touched library politics. In 
1987, the City Council took control of the library from the board, saying it 
had too many foreign language books. Then-Mayor Barry Hatch declared that 
Chinese-language books donated to the library should be kept in a separate 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights organizations sued to reinstate the board and a judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Cheng had plenty to say at Thursday's meeting. "I like what I 
see . . . if anything over the last few years she has improved things," said 
Debra Salz, a local teacher who takes her daughters to the library.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: SPRING IS HERE -- AND IT'S CAT MATING TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring will no doubt win the fight, but winter muscled in and took the match 
this week. Chilly northern winds and icy rains lumbered in, providing us with 
the surreal scene of neon-colored wildflowers flash frozen to their stalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may complain, but I, like many native Southern Californians, enjoyed the 
novelty of cold weather and appreciated the opportunity to wear my winter wool. 
It also gave me a reprieve from some of the more irritating (and less reported) 
aspects of spring: pollen-laden olive tree blossoms all over the patio (hence, 
all over the dining room floor), the continuous gnarl of the leaf blower, the 
slightly fetid smell of jasmine past its prime. And then there is that 
all-time, award-winning irritant: the squall of the lovesick cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us have considered throttling old Muffy when that happens," 
staff writer Jeff Meyers said. "But to avoid problems with the Cat Police, it's 
a better idea to get her fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was why he wrote this week's cover story on kitten season, that time of 
year when a cat's amorous instincts can get us all in trouble. In this county 
alone, several thousand felines are euthanized annually, a sad and costly 
solution to a problem that would easily (and humanely) be solved if owners 
would neuter and spay their cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds simple, but some people just don't get it," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers never thought that he would find himself in the position of Great 
Feline Protector. This may be a form of penance for a satirical column he wrote 
many years ago for another paper. The headline of the piece tells the whole 
story: "Unabashed Hater of Cats." 
</P>
<P>
 The column created a controversy, with the paper's reader's advocate coming 
out against Meyers with a piece titled "Cat Lovers: Jeff Meyers Hasn't Killed 
His Pets." Meyers insists that his column was a joke, but he learned a valuable 
lesson: Cat lovers don't have a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spay-neuter issue is very serious," Meyers said. "Seeing these great 
animals needlessly destroyed or, even worse, taking an unwanted cat to the 
pound, is tough on the emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Life, Jaunts columnist Jane Hulse tracked some very big animals 
to report on the three days of riding and roping events of the Conejo Valley 
Days rodeos, which will be held Friday through Sunday at Conejo Creek Park in 
Thousand Oaks. Last year, the rodeos attracted 4,000 to 5,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 professional riders, most of whom are from around the state, 
will compete for two days in the adult events. 
</P>
<P>
 And the youngin's -- age 5 through 18 -- get into the act for the Junior Rodeo 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids actually compete all day long," Hulse said. "What the spectators get 
to see are the finalists." 
</P>
<P>
 It ought to get really exciting. Let's hope it doesn't snow.

FIRE VICTIMS SAY INSURANCE COMPANIES MISLED THEM; DISASTER: RESIDENTS AT A 
GET-TOGETHER MARKING SIX MONTHS SINCE THE ALTADENA BLAZE SAY THEY ARE HAVING 
TROUBLE GETTING ENOUGH MONEY TO REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners burned out by the Altadena fire commemorated six months since the 
blaze with a barbecue Sunday at the site of a razed home and a workshop 
addressing insurance problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims mingled with state insurance officials, munching on charbroiled 
chicken and ribs and voicing complaints that their insurance companies had 
misled them about their coverage and now aren't offering enough money to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints were directed against California Fair Plan, the 
insurance industry's pool for homeowners in high-risk areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank and Zlata Kordic hosted the event at the site of their former home in 
the Kinneloa Mesa area. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering from the fire has been a slow ordeal for the couple, who learned 
too late that they were covered for less than half the value of their $600,000 
house. Their Fair Plan policy covered $257,000, and Frank Kordic said their 
requests for higher coverage were denied. Instead, they had purchased 
supplemental insurance through Safeco to cover the difference.  
</P>
<P>
 But after the fire, they found that the Safeco policy didn't insure for fire 
damage. A cryptic line in the policy, called an S-option, voided fire coverage. 
Although the policy explicitly stated that it did not cover earthquakes, 
nowhere did it say fires were not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Sproull of Kinneloa Estates found the same hitch in her insurance. A 
Fair Plan policy covered $210,000 -- about a third of the value of her home, 
she said, and the maximum her agent said she was eligible for. An additional 
policy with Safeco was to have covered another $265,000, she said, but the 
S-option canceled that. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeco has since agreed to pay the $265,000, Sproull said, but has not paid 
the living expenses her policy entitles her to. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Ossias, an attorney with the California Insurance Commission, said these 
complaints are typical of ones she has been hearing about Fair Plan. Homes were 
underinsured, policies covered only actual cash value and not replacement cost, 
and the responsibility for upgrading policies was not clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Plan spokesman Mike Harris, who did not attend the barbecue, said in an 
interview afterward that the company clearly labels documents with a sticker 
proclaiming "it is solely your responsibility to make sure your coverage is 
adequate." 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1993, he said, the company sent out fliers notifying policyholders that 
replacement cost coverage was newly available. 
</P>
<P>
 California Fair Plan does not do appraisals, have agents or set policy limits. 
Homeowners can buy the insurance directly, or go through an insurance company 
agent or an independent broker. The plan is intended as the insurance of last 
resort, after applications for regular policies are denied. Too often, though, 
Ossias said, agents write a Fair Plan policy after a first application is 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18% of policyholders in brush fire danger zones opted for replacement 
cost coverage, but many who did not say they never received the notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Sproull and the Kordics said they requested higher policy limits 
through their agents, Harris said records showed no evidence of those requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't tell agents and brokers how to deal with their clients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossias said they should be doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Oakland firestorm, when it was discovered the companies had 
seriously underinsured people, they have taken more trouble to appraise houses 
correctly and let people know what they're getting," she said. "While those 
companies have been doing that, the governing board of the Fair Plan has not 
made sure the Fair Plan does the same thing."

RELUCTANT NOVICE: ON A JET SKI, FALLING MEANS THAT YOU MUST BE HAVING FUN; THE 
OUTING TEACHES THAT SPEED, ALTHOUGH INITIALLY FEARED, ACTUALLY KEEPS YOU UP AND 
GOING. STANDING, THOUGH, IS ANOTHER MATTER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blind prejudice is a sad thing. Educated prejudice, on the other hand, is a 
handy survival skill -- allowing you to avoid such unpleasantries as chain 
letters, insurance salespeople and fruitcake. To grasp the obvious is to avoid 
the painful. 
</P>
<P>
 You have observed a few facts about Jet Skis, namely that they make a lot of 
noise and blow a lot of smoke. They also go fast. Your average recreational 
model can hit speeds of 40 m.p.h.; soupier versions can send your cheeks 
scurrying behind your neck. Such speeds are fine when enjoyed from the comfort 
of a pressurized cabin with a bag of peanuts at hand, but not so good when the 
only thing that separates you from impact is your reflexes and the skin on your 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 This may explain why it's hard to rent Jet Skis. Impossible, actually. You 
call the only Jet Ski rental place in town. The owner, named Howdy, tells you a 
few things, most notably that he no longer rents the things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much liability involved," says Howdy, who will soon take his moniker and 
a like greeting to another, less regulated state. "I'm closing down and getting 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Your neighbor Scott is less concerned with potential litigation. An affable 
fellow and avid Jet Skier, Scott has offered to take you any time, an offer 
you've always declined, wise cowardice reinforced each time Scott slaps you on 
the back and says things like, "Once you feel the power, you'll want to go as 
fast as you can." You don't believe in rushing into things. Jet Skis are barely 
20 years old -- Kawasaki sold its first model in 1974. This is not nearly 
enough time, you think, to iron out potential kinks or to clear things with 
Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, curiosity and shame get the best of you. Scott is enthusiastic; 
perhaps in his eagerness, he has overlooked the potential headaches of 
supporting a second family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome," he says, clapping you on the back. "You'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the next day you find yourself standing in waist-deep water while Scott 
goes over the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start button, stop button," says Scott, pointing to the appropriate green and 
red buttons. "The throttle's right here, just below the handlebar. It's just 
like a motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Let him think what he wants, but if motorcycles were meant to be ridden on 
water, Sean Connery wouldn't have had stuntmen. 
</P>
<P>
 You have one primary concern. Where's the brake? 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't one. There are three sure-fire ways to stop a Jet Ski: fall, press 
the stop button or intersect any unyielding object. Given the dynamics of 
forward momentum, pressing the stop button at 30 m.p.h. isn't much different 
from hitting an immovable object -- only the object you'll be impaled upon will 
be the handlebars. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves falling, which Scott assures you is tremendous fun. You will be 
buoyed by a wet suit and life vest and, if you're going fast enough, says 
Scott, you'll skim across the surface like a flat stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll just plane on the water. It's great. If you're not falling, you're not 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Already you know this will be a guaranteed good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the propeller?" you ask, knowing that falling means clambering 
back on board over the rear end. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a Jet Ski's propeller is set well back underneath the machine. 
Churning furiously, the prop drives water down a narrow cylinder where it 
emerges in a powerful burst. This propels the Jet Ski. It can also give the 
poorly positioned rider a lively jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott offers a last word of encouragement before you push off. "It's like most 
other things," he says. "Once you do it a time or two, it's easy. Of course, it 
would be a lot easier in a river without waves and chop. Plus, typically, you 
don't have big fishing boats coming in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has chosen to take you to Ventura Harbor. It's a weekend morning, and 
things are hopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's Jet Ski is a smaller version of the deluxe models you see in magazine 
ads, ads that show neatly coiffed families whooping it up while comfortably 
ensconced on seats that could accommodate Roseanne Arnold. The rear portion of 
Scott's Jet Ski allows just enough room to stand or kneel. Kneeling seems an 
appropriate position given your vague sense of terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before you juice the throttle, Scott, perhaps sensing your anxiety, 
informs you that his Jet Ski has one other essential feature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insured," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to where you're going -- an expanse of sheltered water nestled behind 
a protective breakwater -- means cutting directly across the harbor mouth and 
rush-hour boat traffic. Fine, if you could juice the throttle and roar across 
in a blink. Unfortunately, you have to obey the speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, driving a Jet Ski at 5 m.p.h. is a bit like walking a 
high wire using a sack of bricks for balance. The Jet Ski lists wildly from 
side to side, not helped in its forward progress by your mad jerks on the 
handlebars. You make it across, but not before quickening the pulse rate of at 
least one charter boat captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Jet skiing is actually easier with speed, something Scott had harped on 
incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you feel like you're going to fall, give it more gas," he says, advice 
that at the time had seemed like encouraging a potential suicide to climb a 
bridge and balance on one foot. "Speed will keep you up and going." 
</P>
<P>
 This proves true. Juicing the throttle smoothes out the wobbles. Plus the 
speed is, well, fun. The wind tears at your face. The water shoots beneath you 
like freshly Zambonied ice, blurring past in a gray rush. The sensation is 
mildly hypnotic, until you bury the nose of the Jet Ski and go arcing over the 
handlebars. But getting back in is easy, too -- realizing that very few people 
can swim 30 m.p.h., Jet Ski manufacturers have designed the machines to slow 
instantly then circle back to you like a chastened mechanical dog. 
</P>
<P>
 After a time, other Jet Skiers show up. They carve graceful, sliding arcs at 
full throttle, leap each others' wakes and generally whip their machines about 
with the casual elan of shoppers negotiating a supermarket aisle. Emboldened by 
these displays, you begin to dabble in your own feats of derring-do. Getting 
off your knees, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when you discover that standing on a Jet Ski is a lot more difficult 
than kneeling on one. Standing raises your center of gravity, making you more 
vulnerable to every bump and buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed, too, becomes doubly important; without lots of it, you simply totter 
over sideways like a drunk leaning for a wall that isn't there. With lots of 
throttle you fall, too, the added speed lending more zest to your impact. Each 
time you hit the water, you drive enough saltwater up your nose to start your 
own desalination plant. 
</P>
<P>
 You fall hard and often, a display of self-flagellation that isn't missed by 
Scott and his family, who are watching from the beach. Still, when you pull 
back to the beach, Scott thumps you on the back and congratulates you on your 
performance, a shameless display of lying that you attribute to good manners 
and profound relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's son Zack is more honest. Like most 5-year-olds, Zack is unschooled in 
the adult art of noise and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were riding the Jet Ski," says Zack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like your dad." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but you were falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Child-abuse laws being what they are, you decide to let this pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most little ones, Zack is also keenly observant. He looks up at you and 
smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, you had fun, huh?"

FAULTY GAS SYSTEM MAY HAVE RELEASED TOXINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hazardous gases may have been released into the air this past winter at the 
Monterey Park landfill by a deteriorating gas control system, according to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill gases, including methane and cancer-causing vinyl chloride, may have 
been released into the atmosphere on a number of intermittent days from 
November, 1993, through March of this year from the Operating Industries Inc. 
landfill, a federal Superfund site, according to EPA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A system of gas smokestacks designed to burn off the gases was not operating 
at a high enough temperature, EPA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wouldn't be considered an immediate health risk," said Roy Herzig, 
project manager for the site. "A large proportion of the gases was still being 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 An EPA monitoring program inside and outside nearby Montebello homes did not 
indicate a problem with the air in that period, he said. However, the EPA does 
not have sampling equipment on the stacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill, with its 300-foot-high mountain of waste on either side of the 
Pomona (60) Freeway, was closed in 1984 and placed on the EPA's list of 
Superfund sites after it was revealed that the 190-acre dump was contaminated 
with hazardous waste and polluting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the EPA has persuaded about 65 blue-chip companies that dumped 
toxic waste to spend more than $200 million to clean up the site through two 
specially formed companies, Cure Inc. and New Cure Inc. Last month, 14 cities 
that used the dump agreed to give the companies $31 million toward the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) said he is concerned that the EPA 
has not directly rebutted concerns among nearby residents "that cancer-causing 
chemicals were being spewed out of the smokestacks." 
</P>
<P>
 "The EPA still (hasn't) satisfied me there's no ongoing hazard," he said. In 
addition, he said the EPA has yet to produce data showing when the burn-off 
problems occurred because it has to rely on Cure Inc., which operates the 
stacks, for information. "The EPA needs to be diligent in monitoring this 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ullensvang, an EPA project manager, said the agency will give more 
specific information about the number of days the temperature fell below 1,400 
degrees Fahrenheit, the required temperature, when it receives the information 
from Cure Inc. in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, a January sample "showed a number of days with temperatures 
below 1,350 degrees." Bud Neumann, Cure project coordinator, declined to answer 
questions, deferring to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Caponi, an engineer for the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, 
said a temperature below 1,400 degrees on a stack means higher exposure for 
nearby homes. "Whoever is downstream is exposed to greater level of toxics." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the gas system, landfill gases would migrate through the soil into 
nearby homes. Herzig said even with the system, 4% percent of 197 homes near 
the landfill in Montebello tested for hazardous substances last year had high 
levels of vinyl chloride. The EPA installed special barriers under their 
foundations to prevent further problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the EPA is protecting anyone. . . . There is no safe level of 
vinyl chloride," said Phyllis Rabins, a Monterey Park resident who was 
instrumental in forcing the landfill's closure. She said three schools are 
within a mile of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say the low temperature from the gas control system was solved 
in March by repairing pipes that had deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzig said the system was mostly built by the old landfill owners; this 
summer Cure will replace a large number of gas pipes and in the future will 
install a new gas extraction system at a cost of $6 million to $14 million.

POWER OUTAGE FAILS TO FAZE FIRST LADY IN CLAREMONT TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't skip a beat Tuesday afternoon when a power 
outage plunged the stage into darkness as she accepted an award from Scripps 
College, the only one of the prestigious Claremont Colleges that enrolls women 
only. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say you have to be prepared for anything," the First Lady ad-libbed as 
the microphone went dead and she raised her voice to be heard throughout the 
auditorium filled with 2,500 students, faculty, alumnae and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it's like my great mentor Eleanor Roosevelt said, it's better to 
light a candle than to curse the darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 The blackout, caused by a storm, sent Secret Service agents scrambling onto 
the stage, but it didn't appear to fluster the First Lady, who in the last 15 
months has faced increasing public scrutiny and controversy, including a 
lengthy grilling by the press last week regarding her Whitewater financial 
dealings and a $1,000 investment that yielded her $100,000 in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton, who attended Wellesley College, another all-women institution, 
and went to Yale Law School with Scripps President Nancy Y. Bekavac, was in her 
element Tuesday afternoon, surrounded mostly by admiring, poised, educated and 
intelligent women. 
</P>
<P>
 She received the first Ellen Browning Scripps Medal, which the school 
inaugurated to recognize pioneering accomplishments by women. Bekavac announced 
that Scripps was also launching a Hillary Rodham Clinton Scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding more like a commencement speaker than a First Lady pushing her 
husband's domestic programs, Mrs. Clinton urged students at the women's college 
to listen to their inner voices and reach their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen the many choices that young people are facing today and 
particularly the concerns that young women bring, how they will carve out their 
lives, make sense of all their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no recipe book, no road map for one's life. Each decision has to be 
made individually . . . every day. . . . I want all women to be given the 
respect they deserve for the choices they make," the First Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
 She told the assembled crowd that some of her own college friends became 
mothers and homemakers. Others never married or had children but instead 
devoted themselves to careers. Many struggled to balance both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are satisfied and live their life with integrity, then that is the 
right choice for them," Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady also described her admiration for two women from an earlier age 
whose accomplishments have inspired her -- Ellen Browning Scripps, the 
newspaperwoman, entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded Scripps College in 
1926, and late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Perry-Lorek, class of '87, was one alumna who flew down from her home 
in Northern California to watch what she called a historic event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've followed Hillary and Bill Clinton since before they were elected -- I 
mean before he was elected," Perry-Lorek said. "I thought she was so 
straightforward and forthcoming; it just increases my respect for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the next seat, her mother, Beverly Miller, leaned over to add, 
"She's my she-ro."

NIGHT LIFE: OLD-TIME ROCKER GOES THE DISTANCE; PETER WOLF, WHO FRONTED THE J. 
GEILS BAND FOR 17 YEARS, IS AN OLD-FASHIONED ROCKER WHO GIVES FANS THEIR 
MONEY'S WORTH. HIS NEW BAND WILL PLAY IN VENTURA. 
</P>

<P>
 Don't you just hate those rock stars who take two years to make an overpriced 
35-minute CD, then start an hour late during each gig on a two-week tour, play 
45 minutes, give you a "Howzit goin' Ventura?" before leaving the stage 
laughing -- at us. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wolf, who prowled the stage fronting the J. Geils Band for 17 years, is 
not one of those aforementioned rock stars. He's an old-fashioned rocker who 
gives fans their money's worth. Wolf, with a new band, will be making people 
sweat all over the venerable Ventura Theatre on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his two-hour-plus sets and boundless energy, Wolf won't be putting 
on one of those Geezers of Rock Tours, the frantic front man himself said 
during a recent phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played a lot longer than two hours before," he said. "We'll play as 
long as the audience wants to rock 'n' roll. This isn't classic rock or some 
sort of J. Geils reunion show. I'm just doing what I do with a bunch of my 
songs, and obviously there'll be some Geils songs, because I wrote a lot of 
them. I'm a rocker that still likes to rock and meet new people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a very eventful life, there can't be too many people left who Wolf hasn't 
met. A son of bohemian parents, Wolf grew up in the Bronx in the '50s. He 
studied at the Museum of Modern Art, became a painter, then a disc jockey on 
one of those gillion-watt stations loud enough to be heard all the way to 
Tierra del Fuego. Later, he became a rock star, was married to Faye Dunaway for 
a few years and, at one time, even lived with weird filmmaker David Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 "David was a very nice guy," Wolf said. "We lived together for a while and had 
a lot of craziness together. In the middle of the night, we'd decide we wanted 
a beer, so we'd drive to New York to a place I knew that had 15-cent beers, 
stuff like that, just crazy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'60s, Wolf had a place near a small Boston club called Club 47, one 
of the stops on that endless blues tour. Since the club had such a tiny 
dressing room, Wolf persuaded many of the traveling musicians to hang out at 
his place. So while the musicians were cooking dinner, resting, dressing and 
getting ready to play, Wolf would sit on his couch and discuss the nature of 
the universe with people such as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Howlin' 
Wolf. Not surprisingly, Peter Wolf's own group, the J. Geils Band, which 
started around 1967, had a strong blues base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a rock, blues, R & B, rootsy band until we developed our own sound," 
Wolf said. "But even now, I listen to everything. There's always something 
interesting going on. And it's always cool to rediscover the masters like Muddy 
Waters, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson. I still feel like a 
student-pilgrim." 
</P>
<P>
 The Geils band lasted an incredible (for rock 'n' roll) 17 years with all the 
same members. Most bands last about as long as the "Mom, I quit school and 
joined a band" speech. The Beatles lasted only six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The J. Geils Band recorded 14 albums and toured constantly in support of such 
hits as "Love Stinks," "Centerfold," "Freeze-Frame" and "I Don't Need You No 
More." Bands like the Eagles and U2 have opened for the Boston rockers, one of 
the truly memorable '70s bands that still lives long and prospers on FM radio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good musical marriage until the bad divorce in 1983. Seth Justman, 
the other main songwriter, and Wolf gradually had less and less in common as 
the dreaded creative differences took root. Wolf took the breakup hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were very much like a team that had a unified goal," he said. "The 
music just kind of held it all together. When it fell apart, it was one of the 
dumbest things that ever happened. I tried to patch things up, but they went 
their own way and left me to continue on my own. I didn't choose to become a 
soloist; I didn't have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, some people still think I'm J. Geils because I was the singer of 
the band. Sometimes in the mall, even in Boston, people still get confused and 
say, 'Hey, J. Geils; hey man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since Wolf left the Geils band in 1983, he has recorded a number of solo 
albums but hasn't hit the road. But just within the last year, Wolf formed a 
top-notch band, the Incomparable Houseparty Five. Brian Maes and Doug Dube are 
on keyboards, Tim Archibald is the bassist, Johnny A is the guitar player and 
Dave Stefanelli hits the drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are some of the really choice musicians from New England," Wolf said. 
"They understand the energy and the intensity that I require so I can do what I 
do. We got together to do a festival, but the festival got canceled. So we 
slipped into this bar and the place went nuts. Then a radio station in New York 
got involved, then another in Cleveland, so we've been playing quite a bit in 
the last six months. Since I don't have a new record right now, this will be 
sort of a word-of-mouth tour. I hear this Ventura venue is really cool. I hope 
they let the people come right up to the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf will be the tall skinny guy with the hat -- the one that looks as if it 
came from Chico Marx, not Fenway Park. Wolf may know painting and rock 'n' 
roll, but he's not much into baseball, not even Boston's beloved Red Sox. He 
probably wouldn't know Ted Williams from Ralph Williams or the Yaz from the 
Fonz. Good thing Wolf has that steady night job sewn up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh boy, I guess I'm dyslexic about baseball," he said. "The only sport I know 
is running on and off the stage. Well, one time with the Geils band, we were 
playing Cobo Hall in Detroit, and we ran backstage during one of the encores 
and I told the security guys to wait outside. One of the guys in the band said, 
'Do you know who those guys were? That was the Boston Red Sox.' I thought they 
were the security guards." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, baseball is baseball, but does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure it does," he said, "but we all crave the smell."

THEATER REVIEW; MORE UPS THAN DOWNS IN 'GRAPES OF WRATH'; MOST PROBLEMS IN THE 
STAGE VERSION OF THE STEINBECK CLASSIC ARE TO BE EXPECTED IN SUCH A MAMMOTH 
PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Steinbeck's epic novel, "The Grapes of Wrath," has been brought to the 
California Lutheran University stage by playwright Frank Galati as a tragedy of 
epic proportions. Under the direction of Michael Arndt, the production's 
virtues far outweigh the problems inherent in a mammoth production in which 
more than two dozen actors show up for the curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grapes of Wrath," as valuable as a lesson in American history and the 
labor movement as it is a rewarding theatrical piece, dramatizes the move to 
California from Oklahoma of the fictional Joad family, who are searching for 
work during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, they run into hardship and death, and things don't improve once 
they arrive in California. Yet, there's that indefatigable spirit that is often 
invoked as being typically (or at least ideally) American. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is presented on Sharon Yesh's magnificent abstract wood-and-metal 
set, with one or two characters moving into the foreground while the others 
stand around quietly. The result sometimes looks more like a painting than a 
play. With dialogue delivered earnestly, in a manner that some may regard as 
stately while others call it stilted, the production sometimes sounds more like 
a painting than a play. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is more acceptable in this setting than it would be in a more 
realistic one, and some of the performances are quite good -- among them Sam 
Cooper as Tom Joad; Jack Ledbetter as former preacher Jim Casy; Herby Borde as 
the "Mayor" of Hooverville (the nickname for any of numerous ramshackle 
communities thrown together by transients during the era); Kelly Culwell as a 
religious zealot; and Craig Johnson as Floyd Knowles, another Hooverville 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice touch finds Jeff Ashbrenner, Rick Anderson, Chad Helmuth and Perry 
Ursem as a quartet of singing used-car dealers, perhaps inspired by the 
barbershop-quartet town council in "The Music Man." There are a couple of good 
fight scenes, staged by Kelly Foran. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the set, the costumes (credited to Lolita Ball) figure strongly in making 
this production memorable. Atmosphere is also provided by original music, 
performed on- and off-stage by a live string band. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Grapes of Wrath 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Tomorrow and Saturday night at 8; closes Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m.

TOPICS / AGING; LIP SERVICE; EVERY WEEK AT THE ARCADIA COMMUNITY CENTER, SPEECH 
PATHOLOGIST FRANCINE HOKIN KATZ HELPS SENIOR CITIZENS COPE WITH HEARING LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Francine Hokin Katz's lips move but she doesn't speak to her class at the 
Arcadia Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when she makes sounds, however, many of her students can hear little 
more. Yet, thanks to the class, they understand what she's saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz teaches lip-reading to more than 200 moderately to severely 
hearing-impaired senior citizens in the San Gabriel Valley each week. For some 
it's a hedge against future hearing loss, or a backup to hearing aids. But for 
others with more serious hearing problems, it's virtually the only way of 
understanding verbal communication -- and a lifeline out of the isolation that 
deafness can bring. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of each year, students learn to recognize letters and words 
by the lip positions that create them. They then perform exercises that test 
their ability to watch speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In a drill to recognize food-related words, Katz tells students to think of 
something they eat with meat. She pronounces the word silently and students 
select gravy -- the rounded lips on "r" and the bite on "v" give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz began her career as a speech pathologist for children, then moved into 
lip-reading. She has been teaching this class for 33 years through Pasadena 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
 About 26 million Americans are hearing-impaired, she says, and almost everyone 
loses some hearing with age. "This is an invisible handicap and it doesn't get 
the attention that visible handicaps do," she says. "When we see a person with 
a bandage on their leg we offer to help. When we come close to a 
hearing-impaired person we're very annoyed if they don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Katz's students have been coming for a decade or longer. Many say the 
skills they have acquired greatly improve their quality of life.  
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday morning, Kay S. Barham, 78, leaves her Los Angeles home at 
6:25, walks half a mile with the aid of a cane and takes two buses to get to 
the class. Her hearing is so limited that on her way to class one morning she 
was nearly struck by a fire engine that raced, sirens blaring, down the street. 
Learning lip-reading was her only recourse, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of necessity," she said. "I was told that they couldn't operate 
and they couldn't give me a hearing aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Dazzo, 71, had been losing her hearing progressively, then it 
worsened dramatically in a brief period.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I hadn't come to class, I think I would be a recluse," the Arcadia 
resident said. "I really think I would stay home. But I go out there and 
struggle and do the best I can. My attitude has changed since I came to class."

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; WEST COVINA TO BE PART OF WATER FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley residents concerned about local drinking water can ask 
questions of national and local ground water experts next week during a town 
hall meeting at the West Covina council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Wednesday's event, "Ground Water 
Protection: Looking at Solutions," is part of a national teleconference to be 
broadcast live via satellite from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the fields of environmental research, urban planning, public policy 
and community relations will discuss national ground water issues. They also 
will field questions from participants calling in from West Covina and more 
than 100 other town hall meetings that day at city halls and college campuses 
nationwide. Dialogue among callers and the experts will be telecast during the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the national conference, which will run from 10:30 a.m. to 1 
p.m., there will be an hourlong live presentation in the West Covina Council 
Chambers on contamination and cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley water basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley's huge aquifer is one of the nation's more 
contaminated. Household, farming and industrial chemicals have crept for 
decades into the aquifer and rendered it a Superfund site. That aquifer 
supplies water to more than a million people in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will listen to, and ask questions of, representatives of the Los 
Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board and the San Gabriel Basin Water 
Quality Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected topics of discussion: Is the San Gabriel Valley's ground water supply 
still being contaminated? Who should pay for cleanup of a problem that hundreds 
of businesses contributed to? What are other communities doing to protect their 
ground water? 
</P>
<P>
 The local presentation is sponsored by the East San Gabriel Valley League of 
Women Voters, a citizens organization called the Superfund Working Information 
Group, West Covina and that city's public-access channel 56, which will make 
the entire conference, including the local presentation, available to other 
cable stations in the area for rebroadcast.

THEATER REVIEW; FESTIVAL PROVIDES TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING; MOORPARK COLLEGE'S 
PRESENTATION OF ONE-ACTS RUNS FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS, WITH DINNER AND DESSERT 
ALONG THE WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First the good news: Moorpark College's 10th annual spring festival of one-act 
plays is, in most every way, the college's best, at least of the last three or 
four editions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the complete presentation lasts more than six hours, ending 
past midnight. It's so long, they're thinking of serving breakfast at the end. 
It's so long that the participants' relatives are leaving before it's over. 
It's so long that the Singapore government is protesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening consists of eight programs, with the audience twice forced to 
choose between two alternates. A tri-tip and chicken dinner follows the second 
play, with a dessert break between numbers 5 and 6. Last Saturday, one of the 
two final choices wasn't performed at all -- some of the principals had 
night-shift jobs and couldn't stay. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is "Millicent and the Endangered (X)," written and directed by 
Jennifer L. Racine, a regular contributor to these festivals. Aimed at 
children, it features a spoiled young princess (Corinne White) who learns about 
endangered species. It's cute, funny and features audience participation, 
including the opportunity to name the cuddly animal in question. "Millicent" 
deserves life beyond this evening and is indeed being presented to schools 
around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the second show may be the evening's high point: Nisan Cerami has 
wittily condensed Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to slightly over an 
hour; it's performed in several areas of the Moorpark College campus, with the 
audience following the cast from stage to stage. Leading the crew is Greg Crock 
as an energetic and occasionally ad-libbing Puck. Cerami's script neatly covers 
for the excised scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner come the evening's more serious plays, not suggested for 
youngsters. "Bums," a fairly standard exercise in showing sympathy for the 
underprivileged, has several homeless people telling their stories. Student 
Shannon Twiss directs non-student Robert Shaffron's script. The characters 
include David Ford, Jennifer Brown, Rich Scheirmann, Glenn Friedman (as a gay 
hustler) and, already affecting a stage name, one "Charles D." As with the 
remaining plays, the performances and direction transcend the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who's ever seen an episode of "Twilight Zone" will anticipate, 
practically from the beginning, the twist ending of "Staring Into the Abyss." 
The play features an unseen interrogator (Rob Thain) quizzing a young man 
(Joshua Morrow) who is so resentful, so self-centered, that you'll wish him 
dead. The experience would be considerably less annoying if the play were cut 
in half. First suggested edit: There's no need to repeat the punch line; we saw 
it coming. John Mulhalt scripted and directs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the stretch -- and last stop before cheesecake and coffee -- is a 
comedy, "The Adventures of Captain Neato-Man," which rises above its title, if 
only barely. The titular character is a would-be super-hero (Scheirmann), who 
lives with his mother (Sevrin Mason) and is searching for a sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering a classified advertisement, which he misread, is the nebbishy Larry 
(Brian Robertson). Hilarity ensues, director Stephanie Ayling and her cast 
giving the script more panache than the professionally written play promises. 
We'd call it "sophomoric," save for fear of offending sophomores in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Last up last Saturday was another professionally written, student-directed 
"Slam!" by Jane Willis. It's a coming-of-age drama, in which teen-ager Linc 
(Steve Connell) reveals to his best friend (Greg Crooks) that he's about to 
enlist in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis' script, evidently supposed to take place in the present, includes such 
pop-culture references as Annette Funicello and the Bee Gees that are strange 
in this context. Don't today's kids have their own icons? For that matter, 
isn't "Slam!" (as in "slam-dancing") a dated term, replaced by "mosh"? Still, 
Connell and Crooks give powerful, energetic and convincing performances under 
the direction of Sean Budway. 
</P>
<P>
 Also available for view are a series of student films and, when the cast 
doesn't have to work, a second choice for the final play, Gabriel Tissian's 
"Night Baseball," directed by Richard Foss. Details

 ALHAMBRA: Two men armed with .45-caliber pistols stole an undisclosed amount 
of cash from an Alpha Beta supermarket at 2810 W. Alhambra Road at 12:45 p.m. 
Friday. The two fled in a car minutes before officers arrived. No arrests have 
been made and no injuries were reported, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST: A Pasadena man lost an eye Monday when a Los Angeles 
Police Department mechanic, angry over the way the man was driving, allegedly 
stopped in front of his car and shot him in the face on the Angeles Crest 
Highway. Noel Milovic, 51, was in stable condition at Verdugo Hills Hospital 
and is expected to recover, deputies said. Sheriff's detectives arrested 
Michael Shinkman, 52, of Antelope Valley and booked him on suspicion of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: Half a dozen gunmen stole about $56,000 in cable converter boxes from 
the TCI Cablevision Co. at 641 W. Duarte Road early Monday morning. At 7:10 
a.m., several armed men assaulted an employee as he was opening the doors to 
the offices, tied him up and loaded the converter boxes into a van parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: Police are searching for the driver of a black Pontiac Fiero who 
hit a bicyclist early Tuesday morning and then sped away. The bicyclist 
apparently turned in front of the Fiero at 6:15 a.m. at the intersection of 
Badillo Street and Badillo Circle. The cyclist, who has not been identified, is 
in critical condition with massive head injuries. The automobile involved was 
missing its left headlight cover and had some front-end damage. Anyone with 
information is urged to call Baldwin Park police. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE: A single-engine plane made a successful emergency landing at the El 
Monte airport about 4:45 Friday afternoon, police said. Robert Kappmeyer, 67, 
of Whittier, was flying his Cessna 210 from Whittier to El Monte when he 
noticed his nose landing gear would not come down. Kappmeyer managed to set his 
plane down with only moderate damage to the aircraft and no injuries, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 INDUSTRY: Sheriff's detectives are asking for witnesses to help solve the 
killing of a man gunned down as he was driving northbound on the San Gabriel 
River (605) Freeway last week. Juan Ramos, 19, died April 18, the day after he 
was shot by four men in a Ford Mustang hatchback about 9 p.m. Witnesses said 
the Mustang and Ramos' Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme were being driven 
erratically, as if trying to ram each other, when shots were fired from the 
Ford. At least three of the four men in the Mustang, who were described as 
being in their 20s, wore white cowboy hats. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A judge ruled Friday that grand jury transcripts of the hearings 
that led to murder charges being filed against five suspects in the killings of 
three Pasadena boys last Halloween will remain sealed until May 9. Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito also pushed back until May 9 the arraignments 
of Lorenzo Newborn, 23, of Los Angeles; Aurelius Bailey, 19; Solomon Bowen, 18; 
and Herbert McClain, 25, all of Pasadena, and Karl Holmes, 19, of Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSEMEAD: A standoff between sheriff's deputies and a distraught Rosemead man 
ended when he was killed by a single shotgun blast fired by a deputy, 
authorities said. The man apparently ignored warnings to drop a pistol he was 
pointing at the deputies. Arthur Victor Dacapias Jr., 23, had been barricaded 
in his house in the 9100 block of Guess Street for about half an hour on the 
night of April 20 when he emerged and began waving a semiautomatic pistol at 
officers, said Deputy Irma Vecerra of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department.

 Ishita Patel, 16, blends traditional Rajesthani and Gujrati dance styles this 
month at Charter Oak High School's Unity Festival.The Covina school's festival 
celebrated 13 of the school's many cultures, including Indian, Korean, Chinese, 
Japanese, African, Native American and European. Traditional costumes and foods 
formed a backdrop to performances that included belly dancing and flamenco. The 
school's Unity Club formed this year to mitigate racial tensions that flared 
last fall. "We're trying to use the cultural diversity at our school as a 
resource, rather than a source of conflict," said club Vice President Sapna 
Patel.

THEATER REVIEW; 'MISS REARDON' RATES A MIXED REPORT CARD; GIVE THIS STRONG, 
EMOTIONAL PLAY AN 'E' FOR EFFORT AND LOWER MARKS FOR PRODUCTION.

<P>
 Anybody who's ever attended a PTA meeting or watched a board of education in 
action realizes that politics in the halls of academe can be pretty 
nerve-racking. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright and former science teacher Paul Zindel knows better than most: He 
followed his Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the 
Moon Marigolds," written in 1965 and set in an academic arena, with another 
dissection of teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little" is appearing for the next few weeks at the 
Ojai Center for the Arts. The group deserves an "E" for effort, but the play 
and production rate mixed marks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three Reardon sisters. Catherine lives at the home in which they 
grew up, taking care of Anna, who has been emotionally unstable -- "flipped," 
as one character puts it -- ever since she did (or didn't) contract rabies 
while on vacation in Italy. Anna has also become a militant vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The third sister, Ceil, has married and left the family home; she's also left 
the teaching profession to become an administrator. There are a lot of 
intra-familial pressures; it's no wonder that Miss (Catherine) Reardon drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire play takes place during a single evening, where the Reardon women 
come together -- and fall apart -- while visited by a neighbor couple, Bob and 
Fleur Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound a bit reminiscent of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," and it 
is, though Zindel is no Edward Albee. Throughout, Zindel tends to reach too 
much: Catherine keeps raw meat in a candy box to snack on when Anna isn't 
looking. Another character has refused to use a particular bathroom for nine 
years. Such unnecessary breaks from anything approaching realistic situations 
weaken the whole play. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are a number of laughs in the play, "Miss Reardon" is strong 
emotional stuff by the standards of the Ojai Art Center, where lightweight 
comedy is the usual menu. Director Tish Winkworth has assembled a cast that 
works hard at the material, some more successfully than others: Especially 
notable are June Barrett-Browning as Anna, and Michael Proctor and Carolejo 
Adams as the horrific Steins. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little" is Winkworth's last play for the company. 
After 15 years in the Ojai theatrical community, including helping formation of 
the current incarnation of the Ojai Shakespeare Festival, she and her husband 
will soon move to Northern California. Her presence, enthusiasm and skill will 
be missed. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., through May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ojai Center for the Arts, 113 S. Montgomery St. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $8 general admission; $6 for students, senior citizens and Arts 
Center members.

THEATER REVIEW; A NEW, LIVELY TWIST TO AN OLD FAIRY TALE; A SHOW SUITABLE FOR 
THE ENTIRE FAMILY, 'SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN SURFIN' DWARFS' OFFERS GOOD LAUGHS 
ALONG WITH FINE SINGING.

 It's not easy searching for the perfect wave in the middle of a forest. But 
the seven dwarfs have spent their lives doing just that. Until one day, a 
princess, who is on the lam from a queen who's trying to have her killed, comes 
into their lives . . . well, you probably know the rest. So do the producers of 
the Moorpark Melodrama, who are presenting "Snow White and the Seven Surfin' 
Dwarfs," a lively twist on the old tale. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Melodrama's best elements are here, in generally superior form. 
Erin Appling, a company regular who plays Snow White, has one of the 
Melodrama's best singing voices, and the cast has no weak members. Several 
newcomers to the Melodrama appear to good effect, and Jeff Wallach -- familiar 
from onstage roles -- makes an impressive debut as director. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Melodrama has sprinkled several popular songs throughout the 
script; highlights here include three ladies-in-waiting (Jackie Hendrickson, 
Pati Slon and Malaika singing "Proud Mary" as a renaissance waltz -- beefing it 
up, like Ike and Tina Turner's version, later on); Appling's lilting "A Little 
Bit of Good in Everyone" and "I Whistle a Happy Tune," and the ensemble finales 
of "It's in His Kiss (the Shoop Shoop Song)" and "Chapel of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The new face most familiar to local theatergoers is that of Gabriel de la 
Vega, a big man with a big voice who plays the huntsman who takes Snow White 
into the woods. Another welcome newcomer is Gayle Hendrix-Harris, who plays the 
wicked queen. In this version, the witchery is done not by the queen but by a 
full-time witch, played by Carla Jimenez, and Damian Gravino supplies some 
welcome physical comedy as a clumsy Lord Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that three of the performers -- Appling, Abigail Jones and 
David Webster (all longtime Melodrama actors) -- will be leaving the area after 
this production to pursue fame, fortune and bitter cold in Chicago. Better 
catch 'em while you can in a show that's particularly suitable for children, if 
not infants. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Snow White and the Seven Surfin' Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursdays at 7 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Matinees 
Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m., through June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Co., 45 E. High St. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: All seats $12; ask about senior citizen, child and group rates for 
some performances. Visa and MasterCard accepted. 
</P>

 * FYI: For reservations or information, call 529-1212.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: HAVE DANCERS GOTTEN COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE?; MUSICIANS, CLUB 
OWNERS AND OTHERS COMPLAIN OF HARASSMENT, VULGARITY AND ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE 
THE FLOOR. SOME BLAME INSTRUCTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 You can't dispute the popularity and aerobic benefits of line dancing. But not 
everyone's a convert. Doug Supernaw, Academy of Country Music's top new male 
vocalist nominee, told me recently: "I'm from Texas. And in Texas, cowboys 
don't line dance. They call it 'barroom aerobics.' And cowboys want to save 
their energy for later," he said with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
 With Supernaw, it's just personal preference. But some folks closer to home 
would argue that the only good line dancer is a dead line dancer -- or at least 
a little hamstrung. That's because in their collective zeal, line dancers have 
managed to alienate many people around them. And critics -- in general -- think 
that practitioners of Tush Push have crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked one club owner about offering line dance lessons, the response 
fired back was: "Hell, no. I don't need no water-drinking line dancers in here. 
I can't make any money off them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most line dancers don't tip or drink," said one of several musicians who 
asked not to be identified. "But some of them come out eight nights a week for 
the lessons and dominate the dance floor. Then they all do the same thing -- 
kind of bug-eyed -- like Moonies. It's like a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they intimidate the average guy who wants to bring his girl out once 
a week and dance intimately. I see 'em chasing couples -- who might spend more 
money -- off the dance floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Many musicians complain that they are sick of "being harassed" by what one 
guitar player called "Fascist line dancers who fanatically insist that every 
song be played just like the cover version. But if you go to Santa Barbara 
clubs, they teach different line dances than here, like Pink Cadillac." 
</P>
<P>
 Another musician said: "They call different songs to certain dances, 
especially for slappin' leather. And if some dancers don't hear the song they 
expect to associate with the line dance, they get critical. And some dance 
instructors will also come up and tell us, 'You're playing it too slow,' or 
'You're not on tempo for this dance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to placate dancers, one musician told me: "We programmed the 
drum machine to exactly the same tempo of the line dances on the CD. I know 
guys who have quit playing at certain places because of the harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 A local industry insider, who asked to remain anonymous, said, "The line 
dancers are completely out of control. And I blame the dance instructors. Many 
think they are the only reason people come to a club. They often take too much 
time to teach a dance, while people who know it are bored and waiting on the 
sidelines. And they tell the dancers they can only do a certain dance to one 
song." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many qualified professionals among the ranks. But some instructors 
bark orders, leave early or teach silly, complicated dances that are never done 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others, including Patsy Swayze, who choreographed dancing in the film 
"Urban Cowboy," complain about what they consider revealing fashions and the 
vulgarity of some line and couples dances, like Spanish reggae and El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't shoot me. I'm just the messenger. But if you think that you might be 
part of the problem, try to become part of the solution. Country is here to 
stay, so let's make it better for everyone to enjoy. 
</P>

<P>
 Chances are that country-Western dance teachers Dave and Esther Howells of 
Camarillo don't consider themselves trendsetters. But thanks to their 
persistent efforts during the last 18 months, the Pleasant Valley Recreation 
and Park District now offers several line and couples courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are held during the day, which appeals to older people who want to avoid 
crowded clubs. But Howells said he wants to avoid age divisions. So the classes 
are usually open to anyone age 13 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a bonus for their students, the couple started a series of smoke- and 
alcohol-free family-oriented dances at the Camarillo Community Center. The next 
dance will be held Saturday. Dave Howells will teach a dance lesson, and the 
Rhythm Rangers band will provide live music. 
</P>
<P>
 Other park and recreation districts are following their example. The next 
monthly family dance sponsored by the Conejo Recreation and Park District at 
the Borchard Community Center in Newbury Park will be May 7. And the district 
will inaugurate a similar program at the Thousand Oaks Community Center on May 
6. 
</P>
<P>
 A family dance held a few months ago at the Barranca Vista Center was so 
successful that the Ventura Community Services Department will hold another May 
7. Coincidentally, the Ventura County Special Olympics will hold a family 
hoedown the same day at Peter's Arabian Ranch in Moorpark for developmentally 
disabled adults age 18 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Howells said that at first the park district had been skeptical about 
offering country dance classes. But enrollment in their first line dance course 
in January, 1993, swelled and had to be closed at 65 people. Details

COVER STORY; TOWN VS. GOWN; A GROUNDLESS RUMOR RAISES THE SPECTER OF RACISM AND 
CASTS A SHADOW OF SUSPICION OVER TEMPLE CITY'S BRIDAL SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No one knows how the rumor got started. 
</P>
<P>
 Been around a few years now, Temple City residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked the authorities to investigate, the city manager confirms. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to it, the cops conclude. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet it persists, casting suspicion on a group of hard-working people who 
have gone from bewilderment to anger as the topic refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumor that hangs over Temple City goes like this: The city's nine bridal 
shops are fronts for illegal activity, including prostitution and money 
laundering. Why else would there be so many within a square mile of each other? 
How else could they stay in business? What else could bring all that traffic of 
young men and women some evenings, when bridal shops are traditionally closed? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and another thing: All the shops are owned by Asian Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 The rumors swirl within a background of changing demographics: The 
historically white community has seen its Asian population swell in the last 
decade to more than 20% of its 31,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal shops even took on political overtones earlier this month when City 
Council candidate Joe Walker, 33, a crime analyst with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, distributed flyers that proclaimed: "Stop Bridal Shops. 
Investigate these businesses that are plaguing our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans accused Walker of racism; he said he merely worried that the 
bridal shops -- which do a large business in rentals and services -- generate 
little sales tax. He later apologized for the "discomfort and grief" caused by 
the word plague. He lost the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, civic leaders said his platform struck a chord, giving public 
voice to a private concern that has long gnawed at the innards of some 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a minority who resent the Asians moving into our city, and perhaps 
for them bridal shops have become the symbol . . . of those demographic 
changes," said Thomas Breazeal, a Temple City councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Breazeal said he finds the rumors about the bridal shops "abhorrent, 
repugnant, unconscionable. I don't know if I can adequately find words to 
describe my emotional feelings for someone who introduces racism into an 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 But step inside Pie 'n Burger, a 1950s-style coffee shop on Las Tunas Drive 
that is a remnant of Americana amid a thicket of signs advertising Asian 
businesses, and you meet the type of folks who took Walker's slogans to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's dope going out the back door and prostitution in the front," 
asserted Norman B. Stachler, a former Temple City businessman, when asked about 
the bridal shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Stachler, who raised his family in Temple City and later moved to Arcadia, 
said of Asian immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying us out of our community, our city, our own golf courses. This 
goddamned town is ruined. It's another Monterey Park. All the homeowners are 
moving out."  
</P>
<P>
 Patrons at several other tables echoed Stachler's remarks. A man who 
identified himself only as Bob said the United States should prohibit 
immigrants from buying property until they become citizens. The man, whose 
parents immigrated from Yugoslavia, accused Temple City of being too lenient 
with Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people are pretty shrewd," he said. "The way they work, you don't even 
know what they're doing in (the bridal shops)." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors are so pervasive that at least one bridal shop owner found herself 
fending off would-be johns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Viado, a Filipino American who owns Veekee's Bridal Shop on Las Tunas 
Drive, said three or four men have called wanting to hire prostitutes. A car 
full of young men once pulled up to her store in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the whores?" they asked as customers gaped in astonishment. "We're 
looking for whores." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the wrong place," Viado told them. Her store of six years is 
exactly what it appears, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they will investigate; we're not hiding anything," Viado said, waving 
her arm to encompass the floor-length wedding dresses, prom gowns, jewelry, 
slippers and veils that adorn the boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridal-shop owners said the suspicions about them illustrate an ignorance of 
Asia and its customs, where entire city shopping districts are often devoted to 
one type of business. In Taipei, Taiwan, they said, there is one street lined 
with 30 or more bridal shops where customers can compare prices and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want a one-stop shopping street; that's one of our biggest selling 
points," said Peter Zhang of Top Bo Bridal shop, which opened in a shopping 
mall on Las Tunas Drive six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from fearing that other shops would pose too much competition, Top Bo was 
drawn to Las Tunas specifically because of the plethora of shops, Zhang said. 
</P>
<P>
 When told about the comments of Stachler and others, Zhang shrugged his 
shoulders. "It's sad that they feel like that. They should be more educated 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Wang, 40, and her husband Daniel, 46, own Lucy's Bridal, an elegant Las 
Tunas shop that features elaborate Marie Antoinette-like dresses trimmed with 
black lace. The Wangs studied photography in Japan, then ran a bridal shop in 
Taiwan for 15 years before moving to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After working at a one-hour photo shop for a year, the Wangs bought their own 
shop and spent long hours making it profitable. Then they bought a house in 
Cerritos, where they raised two sons. In 1992, they opened Lucy's in Temple 
City, where the bulk of their business is wedding photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we know is the bridal business and the photography business, 
so that's what we did to make a life," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "American people don't take too many wedding portraits but Chinese people like 
studio portraits, a lot of them, with different backgrounds and different 
poses." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the corner liquor store or vacuum repair shop, she said, Temple City's 
bridal shops don't depend on local consumers. They attract brides from New 
York, Texas and San Jose, drawn by the city's reputation as a wedding center. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many shops in Temple City, Lucy's Bridal provides centralized shopping 
for wedding dresses and tuxedos (for rent or sale), wedding portrait 
photography, a gift boutique, jewelry and services such as make-up, 
hair-styling and manicures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bridal shops estimate that 90% of their business comes from outside city 
limits. Working brides often make late appointments, which may account for the 
evening traffic. Many activities take place in side rooms or portrait studios 
that aren't visible from the large display windows on Las Tunas Drive, which 
could give the impression that the stores are eerily empty. 
</P>
<P>
 In many Asian cultures, the bride changes three times during the wedding, 
going from a full-length, Western-style white dress to a traditional ceremonial 
gown and headdress (chosen from styles popular in the Ming or Ch'ing dynasties) 
to an elaborate banquet dress for the feast that follows the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Wang's business comes from elegant portraits that can cost $700 to 
$1,000 and require the entire day to shoot. Last week, Angela Lin braved the 
traffic from Orange County for a photo session at Lucy's. She arrived with her 
fiance at 10 a.m. and stayed until 3 p.m., taking dozens of photos in her three 
wedding gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend told me the service was real good and it's convenient; I can go to 
one place and I don't have to run around," said Lin as a hairdresser sprayed 
and curled her hair into a camera-ready chignon. 
</P>
<P>
 The prostitution rumors came as a shock to the Wangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 17 nail salons, but they don't complain about them, they complain 
about us," Wang said. "When the police came, we didn't know what had happened. 
We thought they wanted to protect us. Then we saw the Chinese newspaper" that 
reported on the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we got very mad. We're still upset." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has united the bridal shop owners, who meet regularly to 
discuss how to improve their image and fight back. Some have proposed holding 
an open house to invite residents inside their shops to dispel the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 While it might seem ludicrous to accuse bridal shops -- purveyors of purity 
and romance -- of harboring the world's oldest profession, sociologists said 
that irrationality is a common response when people feel threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rumors are the result of anxiety about . . . economic survival," said 
Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern 
University. He studies hate crimes and wrote the book "Gossip, the Inside 
Scoop." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, people are very concerned about the influx of Asians and Latinos 
at a time when many Americans are unemployed," he said. "They feel their 
middle-class lifestyle slipping away. This is a way to explain Asians being 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said urban folk tales, however bizarre, often continue to circulate 
until civic leaders make it clear they won't be tolerated and take public steps 
to dispel them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, he said, some Jewish boutique owners in Orleans, France, were 
attacked by a mob after rumors circulated that the shopkeepers were kidnaping 
Christian women into white slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the persistent rumor, the boutique dressing rooms were really 
elevators that took women to a basement connected by a network of canals to 
boats that whisked the women away. Levin said the rumor turned to violence 
because leaders of the town never publicly decried the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Temple City, civic leaders requested an investigation to resolve the bridal 
shop rumors. City Manager Denise Ovrom said she asked the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to look into the shops after receiving numerous calls from 
concerned residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even I've heard there's illegal activity going on in bridal shops," Ovrom 
said. "It's not true, it's just a rumor but it's an unfortunate one because it 
hurts our downtown business community." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Libertone said he heard suspicious talk about bridal 
shops at homeowner and community watch meetings. After the city manager called, 
Libertone made unannounced visits to each shop, some more than once, entering 
at different hours and using the back as well as front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was on the up and up," Libertone concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said they are bewildered as to where the rumors 
started. The only link they can muster is that Temple City residents might be 
confusing bridal shops with a beauty shop that was closed down last year for 
prostitution. The Jai Alai Salon's business license was revoked by the city 
attorney after the city and police received numerous calls alleging illegal 
activity there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of folks felt that if it was occurring there it was also 
occurring at the bridal shops," said Deputy Dwight D'Evelyn, a county sheriff's 
investigator based in Temple City. "We're not aware there's any other 
businesses that are fronts for prostitution, but there are a lot of folks who 
feel if there are so many (bridal shops) downtown they have to be doing 
something illicit." 
</P>
<P>
 That came as news to the Wangs, who were under the impression that their 
elegant storefront was sprucing up Temple City's main shopping street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here, we brought our money from Taiwan," Wang said. "We thought we 
made the city, the street look more nice."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FOR THOSE WITH A HEALTHY APPETITE

 Wild Oats Community Market is the place to pick up a little brown rice udon -- 
and a little attitude adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a holistic-in-one natural foods market that's after your mind and body, a 
grocery store with a deli, bakery and salad, juice and espresso bar -- and 
masseuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Oats Community Market in Pasadena opened its 13,000-square-foot store on 
Jan. 12 in the former Jurgensen's Market building at Lake Avenue and California 
Boulevard. In the patio, black wrought-iron tables topped with vases of fresh 
flowers provide a prime view of South Lake Avenue and the San Gabriel 
Mountains. Inside, distractions include music ranging from reggae to Ravel's 
"Bolero"; the masseuse ($7 for a 15-minute back-and-shoulders massage) resides 
in a screened-off corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The eatery section pulls in diners ranging from the granola-with-whole-milk 
set to the hamburger-and-Diet-Coke crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 That means cheesy chicken enchiladas ooze majestically next to the deli's 
hijiki seaweed salad; big, bad chocolate chip cookies muscle fat-free peach 
muffins for bakery space, and the aroma of caffe lattes mingles with the 
freshly mown scent of fresh-squeezed wheatgrass juice. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also a place where the lacto-ovo-vegetarian is coddled alongside the 
meat-and-potatoes fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around here, they go for the standards, but they also go for (food) a little 
different," said General Manager Patrick Gilliland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Oats is busiest on weekends, Gilliland said. Most of the customers are 
health conscious but no sticklers -- they buy up the dairy-free miso soup or 
the ika (squid) sushi but are not above indulging in an occasional Wild Oats 
submarine sandwich (ham, salami, provolone) or chocolate mousse tart. 
</P>
<P>
 "They demand more," Gilliland said. "Less seaweed and things like that . . . 
Our focus is on high quality. If it's a hamburger, it'll be natural meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the bad food is not so bad -- most steak cuts, for instance, are only 5% 
fat and free of hormones, steroids and antibiotics. The market wanted wriggle 
room, a chance to stray from the all-vegetarian themes of some of the chain's 
other stores (There are 12 Wild Oats markets nationwide). 
</P>
<P>
 "I see us as the chameleons of the natural food world," Gilliland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deli selections, which include 30 salads and 15 entrees, vary daily, depending 
on the whims of the French chef, Pascal Allaire, who has a doctorate in natural 
foods study. Allaire isn't shy about throwing alfalfa seeds into the wild rice 
and yam salad, or soft tofu into the zucchini-almond dip. But fear not -- the 
deli dish signs list each offering's ingredients and other selling points, such 
as its low-fat or sodium-free content. 
</P>
<P>
 Entree and salad prices vary, with most running about $5 or $6 per pound. You 
can get away with as little as $1.99 each for a vegetarian patty or spend up to 
$8.99 a pound for hormone-free lemon chicken. Prices in the vegetable and fruit 
juice bar range from $1.39 to $2.59 for an 8-ounce serving of carrot, cucumber, 
beet or other combinations; and the espresso bar whips up orders ranging from 
99 cents to $1.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Oats also sells fresh daily breads from Il Fornaio and La Brea, including 
wheat, olive and rosemary selections. In the next few weeks, the market will 
open a grill, firing up sprout burgers, charbroiled tofu, hamburgers and 
skewered vegetables. Plans are also under way for a pasta bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensory overload does not escape Wild Oats managers, who have set up a 
toll-free hot line for questions about the difference between radicchio and 
radiatore pasta or tempeh and tofu. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Oats is at 663 South Lake Ave., Pasadena. Hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
daily.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DIAMOND BAR; CITY COUNCIL SETTLES LAWSUIT, AGREES TO CONSIDER 
SUBDIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Diamond Bar City Council has settled out of court with a development group 
that sued the city for $128 million last year after the council rejected its 
proposed 57-home subdivision north of Tonner Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid further legal fees, the city has agreed to take a fresh look 
at the subdivision plans of developer Diamond Bar Associates.The group wants to 
develop the hillside homes next to a gated community called The Country. The 
council rejected the proposal in November, 1992, saying the developer had not 
presented the city with adequate studies showing the soils on the steep slopes 
could hold the luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the developer has agreed to drop its claim for $128 million in 
damages and its allegations that the city unjustly denied the subdivision 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdivision proposal will now be reviewed by the city's geotechnical 
experts, and then discussed at a joint meeting of the City Council and Planning 
Commission. After that study session, which has not been scheduled yet, a 
public hearing on the matter will be set. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement agreement allows Diamond Bar Associates to continue to pursue 
its complaints against council members Gary Miller and Phyllis Papen. The 
developer has alleged that the two council members pressured them for political 
favors, and then opposed the DBA subdivision when none were forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Papen deny the allegations, and in December a Superior Court judge 
ruled that Miller and Papen are immune from litigation challenging their 
decisions as legislators. The developer could appeal that decision.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ALTADENA/ PASADENA; TWO AREA WOMEN CITED FOR COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Gabriel Valley residents were honored Friday by the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office for risking their lives to assist victims of crime 
and help put the attackers behind bars.  
</P>
<P>
 Nona Ross of Altadena and Eleanor Gifford of Pasadena received commendations 
from Dist. Atty.Gil Garcetti at the Ninth Annual Courageous Citizen Awards 
Ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, along with Grand Lee Bush of Santa Monica, helped save a man's life by 
taking him to the hospital after he was shot in the back in the Wilshire 
district of Los Angeles in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Nimmons of Simi Valley was wounded by a man who later surrendered to 
police and said he was trying to start a race war by shooting the first white 
person he saw. The shooter, Darryl Lynn Arnold, turned himself in and is 
serving a 20-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford, 26, stopped a robbery when she tackled a purse snatcher known as "The 
Old Man Bandit," and wrested another woman's bag from him March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 She chased the robber to his car, noted his license plate and informed police. 
Warner Loftus, 61, is awaiting trial on 39 counts of armed robbery and assault 
with a deadly weapon.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; NO MORE CUTBACKS EXPECTED THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fiscal year's $3.4-million recreation budget for the Angeles National 
Forest is 9% less than last year's, a drop that prompted officials in October 
to scale back camping, fishing and picnicking activities. 
</P>
<P>
 No other cutbacks, however, are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, forest officials had announced major cutbacks, including the 
closing of Crystal Lake recreation area on weekends to all but foot traffic. 
The forest service also shut down Crystal Lake's two campgrounds. In the Mt. 
Baldy Ranger District, other closures included Manker Flats Campground and 
Glacier Picnic Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation budget includes $2.7 million for operations and maintenance, 
about the same as the previous year, said Raina Fulton, the forest's recreation 
officer. But the amount isn't enough to keep pace with inflation or the backlog 
of maintenance projects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year's forest budget also includes $10,000 for trail construction, 
compared with $75,000 in fiscal 1993. But last year's budget included money to 
complete the remaining seven miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mexican 
border to Canada.

REWIND; GERMAN CONSCIENCE TAKES THE STAND IN 'JUDGMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened to the Nazi regime the day after Oskar Schindler trundled away 
from his munitions factory for the last time, one step ahead of the advancing 
Soviet army? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies, in large measure, in the crackling 1961 courtroom drama 
"Judgment at Nuremberg," an ensemble vehicle for some of the most prominent 
stars of the early 1960s that still manages to keep the attention riveted on 
the insidious moral vacuum that became the reason for the Nuremberg war crimes 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Schindler's List" addressed itself, a half-century after the fact, to 
the "what" of the Holocaust, "Judgment at Nuremberg" draws on the "why" -- in 
this case, why would a group of highly respected German judges turn their backs 
on the concepts they once revered and preside during the war over a series of 
infamous kangaroo courts, drumhead courts-martial and false condemnations that 
resulted in the deaths of thousands? 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Tracy, brilliant as the presiding American judge at the trials of the 
German judges, finds that the answers aren't easy. Playing the simple Maine 
jurist with understated folksy grace and passion, Tracy must sort out 
impassioned arguments by American prosecutor Richard Widmark and German defense 
attorney Maximilian Schell (who won an Oscar for this role) while being jolted 
by testimony from a mentally unbalanced victim (Montgomery Clift) and a 
persecuted hausfrau (Judy Garland). As he grapples with the demons of Germany's 
recent past, he is wooed circumspectly by the widow (Marlene Dietrich) of an 
executed German general and saddened by the descent into corruption of the most 
famous defendant in the dock before him (Burt Lancaster). 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Kramer's direction manages to keep this 178-minute film consistently 
taut, and Abby Mann's Oscar-winning screenplay not only echoes the still-fresh 
moral outrage of the time, but also paints a picture of a Germany agonizingly 
trying -- and sometimes failing -- to come to grips with the memory of 
all-too-recent horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" makes a fine, if disturbing, companion to "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961), directed by Stanley Kramer. 178 minutes. Not 
rated. PATRICK MOTT

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; SO FAR, CLASS IN STAGE COMBAT HAS NO FIGHTERS; 
JOSEPH NASSI IS OFFERING INSTRUCTION IN MOVIE AND TELEVISION STUNTS THROUGH 
VENTURA COMMUNITY SERVICES. NOW ALL HE NEEDS ARE SOME STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Nassi is used to being shot at, thumped on and thwacked with medieval 
weapons of war. The worst thing, though, is being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Nassi, an instructor in stage combat who's taught at the University of Arizona 
and UCLA, tonight will lead a class in movie and television stunts, sponsored 
by the Ventura Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. So far, nobody's signed up for the new class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about preparing performers to do the easiest stunt work on their 
own," Nassi said, "the basic stuff that a performer needs to know to keep 
themselves safe." 
</P>
<P>
 In his longest-running role, Nassi played a sword-wielding barbarian on the 
Conan set at the Universal Studios tour for five years. His credits include a 
series of B movies he declined to name. He also had the dubious distinction of 
having been involved in the most reviled Oscar ceremony in recent memory, the 
1989 awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coached Christian Slater and Tyrone Power Jr. in a swashbuckling routine, 
one of the few entertainment episodes in the ceremony that went well. It was 
really interesting to meet Tyrone Power's son, because the movies his father 
made were what got me started in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Nassi's hourlong class will be held at the Barranca Vista Center at 7050 E. 
Ralston St. starting at 6 tonight only. The fee is $40. To register, call 
community services at 658-4726.

 A proposal to regionalize the procedure by which production companies get 
permits to film in Southern California communities is being greeted with some 
skepticism by those in the local film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments wants to create a one-stop office 
for film permits, but Fillmore film commissioner John McKinnon said the permit 
process is the easy part. Matching producers with the scenes they need is 
what's tough, and it takes lots of local knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first impression is that it's missing the personality of the individual 
areas," McKinnon said. "I don't think that would work." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinnon, the only full-time film commissioner in the county, said that 
issuing permits is no problem. Police and fire departments review the script, 
and the city charges the producer according to what it's going to cost the city 
to provide the services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That consumes about a tenth of the time it takes. Ninety percent is finding 
the locations. When it comes down to it, there's a lot of legwork involved. 
Things are changing all the time, even in a small town like this. Then there 
are other factors like what businesses are impacted at different times of the 
year, whether shoals are in or out. There are just so many variables."

ON THE ROAD: FOR CLASSIC ROADHOUSE, IT'S HALFWAY IN OUTBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the key guests here at the Halfway Station are noted for their 
capacity to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The guys from Australia, they decided that barkeep Rob Wheeler had an 
insufficient understanding of Aussie football. So they ran a play for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballcarrier commenced his run at the pool table and, rounding the bar, got 
lifted and turned upside down by his defensive mate and sent crashing, 
head-first, to the floor. That nobody died is only part of the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The other part is that the ball, a odd bladderless leather number, now sits 
atop the bar TV, an alien trophy to the itinerants who pass through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Halfway Station, however, is no tavern full of drunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead it's a classic roadhouse, circa 1955: a tidy barn-red cabin, with a 
hearth at one end and a "bathroom" door that leads outside, to a separate out 
building. The small, U-shaped wood bar is complemented by three round tables 
with red-check tablecloths. A jukebox is stocked with ZZ Top and Bon Jovi but 
heaviest of all on Merle Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 Along one wall is a coffee pot with brew that is free for the taking in brown 
ceramic mugs hanging on nails. For those who momentarily forget where they are, 
a glance straight down while pouring reestablishes one's coordinates: Framed in 
wood on the floor is a bear-paw print, a daunting 7 inches across, sliced 
recently from mud in a canyon across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the outback. The Halfway Station enjoys oasis status in Ventura 
County's arid highlands along the northernmost stretch of perilous Route 33, 47 
miles north of Ojai. It takes its name from being roughly midway between 
Ventura and Bakersfield, though no suggestion is made that people from either 
place are rushing to get to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, people find the Halfway Station. Or it finds them. There is so little 
else around. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no phones -- the nearest, a pay booth, is 11 miles north on 33, in 
Ventucopa. The surrounding land is simultaneously alpine, with sharply defined 
mountain slopes covered in evergreen; and lunar, with treeless mountains 
cracked open to reveal serrated tan and yellow bluffs. Snakes and lizards are 
everywhere. Occasionally, a mountain lion is sighted. Occasionally, too, it 
snows, heavily; the roadhouse is at nearly 4,000-foot elevation. Running 
through everything is the Cuyama River, now a vast bleached wash but in heavy 
rains a wall of water that reduces huge boulders to clicking marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Wheeler came here five years ago from Oxnard. He worked on radar at Point 
Mugu. He got tired of his life, which was getting challenged by alcohol; and he 
got tired of fighting neighborhood thieves, who burgled his house repeatedly. 
He signed on as a handyman and, within a year, Dale Lingo bought the place and 
put Wheeler behind the bar. Wheeler, living in a cabin behind the Halfway 
Station, is a very happy, sober man. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wheeler, along with the peaceable Dale Lingo, is key to the ethos at the 
Halfway House. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been a fist thrown in here yet," Wheeler says. "I'm just not the 
burly bouncer type and I like a nice friendly crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, does not mean that the Halfway is without its celebrated 
cowboys. One of Wheeler's duties is manning the grill, for the Halfway bills 
itself as a cafe and features a menu of mostly burgers and chili. And most 
prominent on the menu is The Wild Bill Bacon & Cheeseburger 645903. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent serial number of the burger actually is the Ventura County jail's 
booking number of a longtime patron whom the regulars call Wild Bill. Wild Bill 
works on the Chevron oil platform Hidalgo off the Ventura coast but has a deep 
belief in his cowboy destiny. He shows in black cowboy hat, a pair of black 
pistols mounted in hip holsters, and, on occasion, a long bowie knife dangling 
from his belt. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wheeler says everybody loves and feels safe around Wild Bill, "we've 
finally got him into the habit of leaving his weapons outside." 
</P>
<P>
 That is good, Wheeler concedes, especially in view of the fact that the 
Halfway seeks to be "a family place." Indeed, Lingo recently installed 
campgrounds out back, and until the place is a known camping destination with 
adjacent cafe, there's no charge for a site. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a roadhouse cut off in time and place would offer coffee and a night's 
sleep for free.

FOR THE KIDS; SEWING UP A STORM TO BENEFIT LIBRARY; YOUNGSTERS IN DEON TURLEY'S 
HOUSE OF FABRICS CLASS HOPE TO MAKE 100 BOOK BAGS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE 
QUAKE-DAMAGED FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 9-year-old Cara Kuebert took up sewing last summer, she has stitched 
herself pants, shorts, culottes, two shirts and a nightgown. But lately, she 
has been turning out book bags -- nine so far -- to raise money for the 
Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara's sewing class, taught by Deon Turley at Newbury Park's House of Fabrics, 
set a goal of making and selling 100 bags to help the library, which was 
severely damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the kids have finished 34 of the colorful drawstring bags. Charging $5 
apiece, they've sold 20, mainly on Saturday mornings at the Newbury Park 
library branch where Friends of the Thousand Oaks Library are also fund raising 
with regular bake sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library was especially hard-hit in the children's section," said Turley, 
who came up with the project idea. "The Friends were looking for help from 
children's groups -- any children's groups who wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 When the girls were first learning how to make the bags, it took them up to 
two hours to complete one. With a little experience under their belts, they can 
now turn out one in about an hour. Some, like Cara, even work on them at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I turn around, she's bringing one in," Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bags include a tag designating the Thousand Oaks Library Restoration Fund 
as the beneficiary of the project, as well as the name and age of the young 
seamstress. Some bags have a pocket for a library card. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics donated material for the project, and Thrifty Drug in Newbury 
Park offered colorful shoelaces to serve as the drawstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Turley teaches her classes out of a nook in House of Fabrics called the "Kids 
Korner." There, her students have four sewing machines set up. 
</P>
<P>
 She uses a program called "Kids Can Sew," which includes easy patterns for 
clothing that can be assembled quickly, such as the book bag and shorts. Higher 
levels of sewing include more difficult projects, such as T-shirts or stretch 
pants. The program is provided by the Simplicity pattern company. 
</P>
<P>
 Her students start sewing as young as 6 years old. Most are 8 to 10 years of 
age. She began teaching them in her home more than two years ago, but the 
demand grew and she moved to the fabric store. Now she has one-hour classes 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are finding out that the schools are less likely to offer much in the 
way of sewing now," Turley said. The recession has spurred more interest in 
sewing, not only in making clothing more affordable but in maintaining the 
clothing families have.

FASHION; KIDS WHO MODEL FACE LONG RUNWAY TO SUCCESS; THERE'S LOTS OF

 In the black-and-white lobby of the John Robert Powers school of modeling and 
acting in Thousand Oaks, a circle of girls sits very straight on canvas 
directors' chairs. They range from elementary through high school age, with 
some too small to reach the floor. Sandwiched in the crowd here and there -- 
with a scrubbed look and a fresh haircut -- is a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 At intervals, the youngsters lean over to speak in hushed tones; not to each 
other, but to accompanying adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are called in turn by a woman who shows each candidate into the 
makeup room. As their chairs empty, another parent and child move from the 
sidewalk to fill the space. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are here to be photographed for a modeling portfolio. Some are 
already enrolled in classes; others are considering the step. They will spend 
$15 for the photo session, which could be the entry into a modeling career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought about modeling all my life," said Kristin Combe, 13, of Thousand 
Oaks, "ever since I saw Miss America when I was about 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked the glamour, having everything done for you, and being 
famous," she added candidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin, who has long, curly hair and braces, has emerged from the makeup and 
hairstyling stations, and is in the photography room, watching a boy of about 8 
being coached to lean on one elbow and adjust his chin angle for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin has much in common with the other candidates. Each one we meet has 
wanted to model either since age 6, or ". . . as long as I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the makeup mirror, Melissa Ulmer, 16, of Oxnard is getting 
concealer on her minimal facial shadows. Melissa says her modeling ambitions 
stem from a lifetime of reading fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Cosmo and Glamour," she said, and names print photography as her ideal 
career choice. For backup, she will study graphic design or architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Porbansky, 17, of Oxnard has finished her shoot and is off to her job 
as a hostess at Marie Callender's. She has already had nine weeks of modeling 
classes and, like Melissa, hopes to get into fashion photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "Runway is second choice, but I'm too short," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the real chances of their breaking into modeling? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, better than they used to be, according to Suzanne Henry, director of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agents are looking for so many different kinds of people," she said. "In New 
York, you have to be 5-foot-9 to do runway fashion shows; in California, it's 
not as sophisticated -- it's the California sunshine look." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does a model no longer need to look anorexic, she might work in the 
petite field, or the plus-size field, both of which have become more important 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Henry said, "The ethnic look is very much in now. There's room for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of students are enrolled in the school to gain poise and 
confidence, Henry says. Of those who are serious about getting jobs, the 
majority do get at least some paid work. This means finding an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 To give students experience at auditioning, the school brings in agents to 
meet them on the premises; a few have found their first jobs before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 But making it to the top -- where the pay scale peaks between $5,000 to 
$10,000 an hour, is -- well, not as bad as lottery odds, but rare. More models 
earn second incomes in the trade than have primary careers. 
</P>
<P>
 A few find work in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one agency, Progressive Models in Camarillo, places men and women in 
local jobs in photographic work, fashion shows, cosmetic demonstrations and as 
movie extras. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Lucas, co-director of the agency, says that if models are willing to 
start small, "it's interesting how one job can lead to another; it spills 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 To make a solid career in the industry, though, "you really need to go to L. 
A. on a regular basis," she said. That's where more dues come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids come here, starry-eyed, not realizing how much work it is," she 
said. "They don't realize it's audition after audition. It almost takes a 
non-working parent to take (a youngster) to auditions. It's a tough business." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her advice is: "If you really want it, just persevere, keep working at 
it. Do fashion shows; it's good experience . . . the odds are better than they 
used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 So, add endurance to the list of poise, attitude, makeup and movement to be 
mastered. Likely it won't discourage Kristin Combe. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Kristin is not yet enrolled in modeling school; but she feels that 
it's in her destiny, and plans to persuade her parents of that. This, too, will 
take a measure of perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get my mom," she said of the enrollment prospect. "My dad will be sort 
of iffy on it."

JAUNTS; RODEO RIDERS TOSS THEIR HATS IN RING; MICHELE BURGARD OF OAK VIEW WILL 
BE AMONG MANY IN COUNTY COMPETING IN CONEJO VALLEY DAYS EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When veterinarian Michele Burgard isn't tending a horse, she is most likely 
riding one -- at breakneck speed in the 40 or so rodeos that she competes in 
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Oak View woman will take to the saddle this weekend, along 
with a handful of other Ventura County hopefuls, during the Conejo Valley Days 
rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a three-day riding, roping and wrestling extravaganza in pure cowboy 
tradition. There will be two afternoon rodeo performances Saturday and Sunday. 
The junior rodeo is tomorrow evening. 
</P>
<P>
 For Burgard, a professional rodeo rider since 1982, it means saddling her 
quarter horse, Turbo Doc, for the barrel racing event and guiding him around 
three barrels in a cloverleaf pattern before galloping like the wind to the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 She was eighth in the state last year in barrel racing and, earlier this 
month, she took home $510 for a second-place finish at a rodeo in Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone dreams of making a living at this," said Burgard, who took up rodeo 
riding when she was about 14 and living in Huntington Beach. "But I knew I 
needed a career." 
</P>
<P>
 So she graduated from UC Davis in 1990, having competed in the college rodeo 
circuit. She worked as a vet in Northern California before moving in August to 
Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Burgard will be joined by 210 other professional riders, mainly 
from around the state, for the two-day rodeo. A dozen or so are from Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo gets off to a flashy start, with a parade around the arena featuring 
the rodeo participants and the youthful Conejo Riders showing their precision 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sporting events are all gutsy, backbreaking feats, especially bull riding, 
in which the rider not only has to stay on a 2,000-pound bucking brute but also 
make a safe getaway. In this event, keep an eye out for these locals: John 
Mattivi and Stephen Mederios, both of Camarillo; David Smith of Fillmore, and 
Frank Torgerson of Simi Valley. Two other bucking events include bareback and 
saddle bronc riding. 
</P>
<P>
 In steer wrestling, the cowboy leaps from his horse to catch the steer by the 
horns and wrestle it to the ground. In team roping, two riders rope a steer's 
head and feet and, in calf roping, a cowboy must dismount and get the calf to 
the ground before tying three feet together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the junior rodeo, some of the events are similar, such as barrel racing, 
team roping and calf roping. But some have a different spin, such as pole 
bending, which involves riding through a slalom course, and goat tying, in 
which the young wrangler wrestles a goat to the ground and ties its legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior rodeo is open to kids 5 through 18 years old, and the events get a 
little more difficult as the kids get older. The younger boys ride calves, but 
by the time they are 11, they are atop steers. In the chute dogging event for 
older boys, they run out of the chute with the steer and try to throw it to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo is part of the Junior Rodeo Assn. circuit, and about 20 young riders 
from Ventura County will be competing along with others mainly from Southern 
California -- all of them vying for belt buckle prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The locals include Tiphanie Williams, 17, and Elizabeth Davis, 16, both of 
Newbury Park, who are qualified for state competition this year. Elizabeth's 
sister, Catherine, 13, also is an up-and-comer. Also riding this year is Simi 
Valley's Mike DeVan, 16, whose team roping skills sent him to the national high 
school competition last year. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Conejo Valley Days Rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Creek Park, near the Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 1:30 and 4:30 p.m. Saturday and 1 and 4 p.m. Sunday. Junior Rodeo is 6 
p.m. Friday.

SHOPTALK; NOW IS THE TIME TO START LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A GARDEN; THE 
START-UP COSTS OF A VEGETABLE PLOT CAN BE AS LOW AS $30 TO $40, DEPENDING ON 
SIZE AND QUALITY OF EQUIPMENT YOU CHOOSE.

 Let's play a little game. It concerns New Year's resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of you, at the start of the year, made up your mind to exercise three 
times a week? How many of you promised to get your taxes in on time? How many 
of you decided that this would be the year to start your own home vegetable 
garden? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you folks in the first two groups have already succeeded or failed, but 
for the would-be gardeners out there, guess what? It's show time. Early spring 
is ideal for planting veggies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of you will dive into the new hobby full steam ahead, many, 
undoubtedly, will proceed more cautiously. So, in an attempt to give you a 
gentle shove, we found out what supplies you would need to begin a vegetable 
garden, and then we shopped around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll need a shovel, a cultivator and a hoe," said Vera Villasenor, 
saleswoman and buyer at Ventura's Green Thumb International. "Those three are 
the basic things to start with." You'll also need some seeds or seedlings, soil 
amendments -- such as mulch -- to enhance the quality of the dirt, and 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The start-up cost of a garden depends on its size and on the quality of your 
tools. Tool prices vary greatly: It's a matter of determining how much you are 
willing to spend, and how high-quality you really need the supplies to be. It 
helps to shop at a store that specializes in gardening, and where the 
salespeople can provide knowledgeable advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, however, Villasenor said an average house garden, 
measuring 4 feet by 30 feet with two rows of vegetables, can cost as little as 
$30 to $40 to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, let's take a closer look at some of the requisite supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll start with shovels. We chose the long-handled, rounded-point models. We 
found low-end Ames brand shovels for $13.88 at the Valley Ace Hardware store in 
Santa Paula, $13.99 at Green Thumb (which has a tremendous selection) and 
$14.98 at Home Depot in Oxnard (where the selection is also sizable). We also 
could have picked up a True Temper brand long-handle shovel for $4.99 in the 
garden section of the Oxnard Target store. 
</P>
<P>
 As for hoes, Home Depot was selling the American Made brand with wood handle 
and steel neck for $10.28. An Eagle brand with plastic (and more fragile) neck, 
was $3.47. At Green Thumb, an Ames steel-neck hoe was $10.99 and the Ames 
plastic neck was $6.99. Target hoes were, again, $4.99. 
</P>
<P>
 On to amendments. Not surprisingly, Green Thumb and Home Depot had far and 
away the largest selections among the stores we visited. 
</P>
<P>
 For the novice, it's pretty tough to tell one brand from another. When we 
asked for amendment guidance at Home Depot, we were referred to, among others, 
Scotts Vegetable Builder. A 2 1/2-pound box of the stuff was going for $1.97 
there and $2.69 at Green Thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fertilizer arena, we looked, none too closely, at steer manure. Again, 
it's difficult for newcomers to tell the difference between brands. At Home 
Depot, we were led toward Vita Hume Composted steer manure, which sold for 50 
cents for a cubic foot. At Green Thumb, Farmers brand steer manure was 99 cents 
for 1 1/2 cubic feet or $1.49 for two cubic feet. And at Target, one cubic foot 
of Hyponex steer manure was 69 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the vegetables themselves, you can buy packets of seeds. Burpee seeds 
are an easy-to-find, popular local brand, going for between 99 cents and $1.57, 
depending on the vegetable. Nurseries like Green Thumb are apt to stock seeds 
from other companies as well, with prices varying just a tad. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can go for the young vegetable plants themselves. They are generally 
sold in four-inch containers or slightly larger "pony packs." We priced the 
pony packs: They were 89 cents each at Target and Home Depot, and $1.19 at 
Green Thumb, which had, by far, the most substantial selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, go out and follow through on your New Year's promise to yourself. Then 
again, you could just begin working on next year's taxes.

AT THE MARKET: SOWING THE SEEDS FOR THE VEGETABLES OF SUMMER; OPTIONS RUN FROM 
THE JUICY TOMATOES AND MELONS, TO THE CRUNCHY CORN AND BELL PEPPERS. NOW IS THE 
TIME TO PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RODNEY BOSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As we make the inevitable march toward summertime, veggie gardeners are busy. 
The time has arrived to sow the garden beds -- that all important first step to 
enjoying a bountiful harvest during the dog days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool weather crops -- like broccoli, some leafy greens and root vegetables -- 
have by now gone the way of all things to make room for the succulent 
vegetables of summer. Here, your options run from the juicy bonanza of tomatoes 
and melons, to the crunch of corn and bell peppers. Even herbs, such as basil, 
can be planted right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Area nurseries and garden shops are well-stocked with seasonal supplies to 
fulfill your gardening needs and get you planting pronto. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two options: sow your garden with seeds or seedlings -- tiny 
vegetable varieties that are pre-sprouted and ready to plug into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's somewhat more economical to purchase seeds, the already-sprouted 
version offers advantages to those of us with less than green thumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, you can expect to pay about $1 to $2 for one of those small 
packages of seeds, depending on the vegetable variety. Compare that with a 
single 4-inch baby plant, which will run $1.29 to $1.49. A pack of six -- 
containing young plants much smaller than 4-inches -- are running from 79 cents 
to $1. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-plant "jumbo pack" -- with larger plants -- is about $2.50. Prices, of 
course, vary depending on the variety and where you make your purchase. Often 
more favorable prices can be found at the large discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the big difference between seed vs. seedling, besides cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Some plants prove more difficult to germinate, said Marty Martinez of Baron 
Bros. Nursery in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the more heartier plants -- like squash, melons and corn -- can be 
planted from seed and will be just fine," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County grower John Wooten -- who sells his plants at the Ventura 
(Saturday) and Thousand Oaks (Thursday) farmers markets -- suggested the 
following summertime favorites should be grown from starter plants: bell 
peppers, tomatoes and eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucchini and green beans will do just fine by seed, Wooten said. "These kinds 
of vegetables are very easy to start from seed and usually the plants will 
actually be better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide on growing from seed, you need to get started right away to 
provide the seeds the best chance of successful germination, Martinez said. 
"It's a good idea to plant before it gets too warm," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And those living along the coast will be happy to know that they have a good 
chance of succeeding with a great variety of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along the coastal areas you can plant just about anything this time of year," 
said Wooten. "It's generally cool enough to grow cool weather crops and warm 
enough to grow summer vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
 So don't be afraid to plant the head lettuces, cabbages, broccoli and the 
like, he said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 When sowing seeds, be sure to pay careful attention to your planting method. 
Following are some tips to help ensure your seeds germinate and thrive up until 
harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
 * SEEDS: Never plant your seeds too deeply; a plant will die before breaking 
the surface. The directions on the package should provide the correct depth. 
However, if your garden consists of heavy soil, you may want to actually plant 
more shallow. Seeds should not be pushed into the soil, but covered gently. 
</P>
<P>
 * SOIL: Soil should be moist, loose, well-worked and enriched with organic 
materials. Be careful when watering, you don't want to wash away the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * NAME BRANDS: According to Marty Martinez of Baron Bros. Nursery in 
Camarillo, common, good-quality seed types generally seen in most nurseries 
include Burpee, Stover and Northrop King. "Most seed quality is all pretty 
good," he said. "There's really nothing to be leery about seeds. Just make sure 
you check the expiration date on the package."

GARDEN TOUR; INSIDE THE MAGIC KINGDOM OF LOTUSLAND; VISITORS STEP INTO A WORLD 
OF RARE AND WONDROUS PLANTS AT THE FORMER ESTATE OF MADAME GANNA WALSKA IN 
MONTECITO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So what would you do if your ship came in? Buy a new car? Take a trip? Quit 
your job? Buy a house? 
</P>
<P>
 Madame Ganna Walska built a garden. Lotusland, sort of a Disneyland of plants, 
consists of 23 landscaped acres of a 37-acre estate nestled in a residential 
section of Montecito. There are two tours per day, five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1882, the site was a nursery, and over the years it has gone through a 
succession of names and owners. At one time known as Tanglewood, then Cuesta 
Linda and Tibetland, the estate became Lotusland after it was purchased in 1941 
by Mme. Walska, a well-known Polish opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Married several times, Mme. Walska spent the last 40 years of her long life 
experimenting with unusual plants while designing and overseeing the garden. 
Lotusland is not really a flower garden, although flowers abound, but rather 
mass plantings with serpentine trails connecting various areas. Mme. Walska 
consulted noted horticulturists and landscape architects to create her garden, 
which showcases her affinity for rare specimens. For example, Lotusland has 
perhaps the finest collection of palms in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mme. Walska died in 1984 at age 96, Lotusland became a private, 
nonprofit educational institution. A professional staff and trained volunteers 
operate the estate and conduct the tours. It takes a dozen gardeners (10 
working full time) and a million-dollar budget to keep Lotusland operational. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't just drop by. You won't get in. The waiting list is usually a few 
months long to get into Lotusland. The tours, which begin promptly at 10 a.m. 
and 1:30 p.m., are generally limited to groups of about 10 people, but larger 
tours are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests are asked to arrive half an hour before the tour begins. While waiting 
in the parking area, one can browse through the Australian garden featuring 
grevilleas, Australian tea trees and craspedia globosa, a plant covered in 
yellow round flowers. It's wise to use the facilities at this point as the tour 
takes nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop on the tour is the long, winding driveway behind the gated main 
entrance that heads toward the estate house, which is out of sight some 
distance ahead. The driveway is lined with numerous large agaves, all of which 
face the same direction, as though in welcome to any visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit beyond the agave planting is the Japanese garden, featuring a huge koi 
pond, once a lotus garden. According to the docent, some years ago one of the 
gardeners introduced crayfish into the pool, but the crustaceans ate most of 
the lotus plants. Lining the shady path around the pool are a number of 
camellias, a few rhododendrons, some nandinas and a huge wisteria vine in full 
bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 On the path to the aloe garden are some bird of paradise plants. Not the usual 
5-foot or so plants, these giants tower 30 feet above the path. The flowers, 
normally dominant, are borne on the tops of these plants, making them 
incidental. 
</P>
<P>
 The path takes visitors into the sunny aloe garden, which is like stepping 
into a Dr. Seuss book. There are more than 100 species of cartoonish and hardy 
succulents of the lily family, with more than half of them from South Africa. 
At any given time, a particular species might be blooming with yellow, orange 
or red flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The original swimming pool is now the lotus pond or water garden. There are no 
crayfish, but also no lotus flowers until late July or early August. Next stop 
is back to the main driveway for a mind-blowing collection of cacti leading up 
to and surrounding one side of the mansion, which now houses offices. There are 
mass plantings of cacti. A forest of thick-trunked dragon trees fills a large 
planter in front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The shade garden features a number of large ferns plus more than 50 species of 
begonias, some of which bloom year-round. A highlight of this area is a seldom 
seen type of clivia. This South African native is a member of the amaryllis 
family, and is generally known for its electric orange flowers, but a number of 
specimens in this garden have striking yellow blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the house is an expansive bromeliad garden, and in the back, a huge 
NFL-sized lawn. A 100-year-old monterey cypress tree divides the lawn area from 
a formal Italian garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind mass plantings of the typical orange clivias lies an olive orchard, and 
a long arbor with an unusual touch -- lemon trees provide the shade instead of 
some sort of vine. In the background is a rare deciduous redwood tree from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the many highlights of Lotusland is the theatre garden. Set in the 
lawn are rocky seats for 100, and the grassy stage has a variety of plants as 
its backdrop. The nearby cycad garden is reputedly the second best in the 
world. Cycads, which resemble mean little palm trees, have existed for more 
than 240 million years. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly two hours of touring, you will be glad you wore comfortable 
shoes. A garden shop offers Lotusland memorabilia and selected plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mme. Walska was a headstrong woman who got what she wanted and had the money 
to pay for it. She forbade, for example, the use of any power equipment on the 
estate. And while she was alive, no pruning was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Madame is gone, but the rules live on. There are more "don'ts" than on the 
signs at an Orange County beach. No additional vehicles or people are 
permitted. No neighborhood parking. No late admissions. No children under 12, 
including babies. No smoking. No pets. No picnics. No picking flowers or taking 
cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, these rules are a small price to pay for a chance to glimpse one woman's 
amazing vision. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Ganna Walska Lotusland. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 695 Ashley Road, Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Guided tours, Wednesday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $6 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For reservations, call 969-3767. But remember: the waiting list to get 
in to Lotusland is generally very long. Expect a three-month wait.

CENTERPIECE: KITTEN SEASON; IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR FEMALES ARE IN HEAT, WITH 
MALES ON THE PROWL. GETTING YOUR CAT FIXED MAY BE THE HUMANE THING TO DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It begins with Lulu. 
</P>
<P>
 A scrawny homeless cat who appeared at our back door about a year ago, her 
sad-sack face pressed against the glass in an overwrought but convincing plea 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, a hopeless sucker for cats, immediately grabs a can of tuna. I urge 
her to reconsider. One whiff will be enough to persuade Lulu to become a 
permanent fixture at the back door, I argue, and we already have a cat, an 
obstinate 16-year-old female named Amanda who has one eye and an incurable 
habit of picking at the carpet for attention. I like cats and appreciate their 
independence and cleanliness, but I don't need another one. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, however, can't resist those mopey saucer eyes. The young tabby gets 
her tuna and, of course, makes herself a regular dinner guest. Becoming our de 
facto outdoor cat, she hangs out in the back yard for part of the day, then 
dines al fresco before fading into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lulu brings Peewee. 
</P>
<P>
 An undernourished runt, Peewee is probably 6 months old, with short legs and 
an expression even more pathetic than Lulu's. Is she Lulu's daughter? A pal 
from the wrong side of the tracks? When my wife begins using words like 
adorable , cute and cuddly to describe the feral kitten, I try getting used to 
the idea of three cats. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Peewee is so tiny . . . so fragile . . . so pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Peewee rides so low to the ground and acts shell-shocked most of the 
time. She was only 4 or 5 months old, a kitten going into heat for the first 
time, when a brutish male chased her down and sent her on the road to 
motherhood. One day she's slinking down my driveway, the next she's prancing 
toward our house, leading four gerbil-size fur balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, the roll call at dinner changes drastically: Amanda, an only cat 
all her life, learns to share, but not very graciously, with Lulu, Peewee and 
the fearful foursome of G. I. Joe, Teddy, Chili and Wussy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time we forget to close the back door, terror ensues. Cats pop out of 
closets without warning. Cats mistake the bathtub for the litter box. Cats get 
trapped under the dishwasher. Cats chase cats in a feline version of demolition 
derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Cats reach critical mass in our lives. As the kittens progress through various 
stages of cuteness, my wife and I take turns assigning blame for our 
predicament. Had she let me shoo Lulu the first time the animal appeared, the 
wolf pack would be someone else's problem by now. Had I booted the little 
beggar, I would have been a Neanderthal. However, had some fool thought to fix 
his tomcat a few years ago, none of this would have happened in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The cats purr sweetly and work their charm on us. Growing increasingly 
attached to them, we keep postponing the trip to the pound or the hard-sell, 
basket-o'-kittens approach at Vons. We spend a few hundred dollars getting 
three of them fixed, along with Peewee and Lulu (Wussy is too spooked to 
catch). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when their obnoxious antics -- such as foraging in neighbors' 
kitchens -- begin drawing complaints, we can't wait any longer. Some of the 
seven will have to go, but which ones? Do we make lists? Draw names from a hat? 
Lulu and Peewee make it easy by accepting offers from empathetic neighbors; we 
manage to place G. I. Joe with an adoring young family in another county; Teddy 
displaces Amanda on our couch, and Amanda goes to live in a carton behind the 
garage (I'm not making this up). 
</P>
<P>
 This cautionary tale, however, doesn't have an entirely happy ending. Chili 
and Wussy are missing. Chili bolted and hasn't been seen since; Wussy is gone, 
rumored to have been remanded to an orchard by the anti-cat squad across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't say I really miss Chili and Wussy, but every day about dinner time, I 
glance out the back door expecting to see those wayward scamps with their pink 
noses pressed against the glass, begging for a handout. Population Explosion 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every spring. Female cats go into heat and males go on the prowl, 
the ensuing courtship sparking a feline population explosion 63 days later. 
Lulu is no doubt a survivor of the class of '91. Peewee is a '92 graduate. But 
most strays don't find happy homes; usually, they die a cruel and premature 
death as road kill or coyote lunch. Or they just starve to death. The best 
these unwanted cats can usually hope for -- outside of a miraculous adoption -- 
is a merciful one-way trip on sodium pentobarbital. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year in Ventura County, a few thousand cats are humanely destroyed by 
lethal injection; last year, a total of 4,629 were euthanized by county Animal 
Regulation in Camarillo and the Humane Society in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass destruction of these beautiful animals is agonizing to cat lovers and 
animal activists, but it also angers them because the slaughter could be 
drastically reduced if owners simply spayed or neutered their pets. That's a 
message the Humane Society and Animal Regulation have been trying to get out 
for years -- the Humane Society made 545 presentations at schools last year. 
But the public apparently hasn't been listening: The annual number of 
euthanized cats remains about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't get it," fumes Kathy Jenks, Animal Regulation director. 
"Every year, we get these people who let their cats get pregnant so their kids 
can experience birth, then they come in here with a box of kittens, grinning 
like they're doing us a favor. Talk about morons!" 
</P>
<P>
 Did we mention that cat people are angry? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to be angry," says Jolene Hoffman, shelter director of the 
Humane Society. "Especially when we've got low-cost clinics making it so 
inexpensive to get the animals fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 For every cat euthanized at the pound, countless abandoned cats try to survive 
on their own, most living short lives under homes and in river areas, orchards, 
dumps and alleys. Although a healthy female can have three litters a year, 
strays have enough trouble keeping themselves, let alone a family, alive. If 
predators and starvation don't kill these unwanted animals, cars and abscesses 
-- from internecine warfare -- usually do. 
</P>
<P>
 And "kittens born in the wild don't stand a chance," says Joyce George, 
president of the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Cat lovers break into a cold sweat thinking of all the terrible fates 
befalling felines who don't find loving homes. It's a jungle out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of low-life, dirt-bag people who want to hurt cats," says 
Simon Oswitch, founder of Ventura-based Animal Emancipation, a small nonprofit 
organization dedicated to saving doomed cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of kitten season in mid-summer, newspaper classified 
sections contain columns of ads offering "free cats to a good home." But 
according to experts, these kittens can wind up in the hands of dealers who 
sell them for medical experimentation, or weirdos who use them for satanic 
rituals, or sadists who torture and kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard of a guy (in the county) who used 14 kittens a day to teach his pit 
bull how to fight," Hoffman says. "I know of people feeding kittens to snakes. 
You should beware before you give your kittens away. If you were irresponsible 
to let your cat have kittens, then at least be responsible and check out the 
people you're giving them to." 
</P>
<P>
 House cats are as vulnerable as strays if allowed outside. "Indoor cats live 
longer, but try telling that to people," Jenks says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitten season has just begun. How can you tell? Those yowls outside your 
bedroom window at 4 a.m. should be the first clue. You've also probably noticed 
your normally aloof house cat acting affectionately, purring uncontrollably and 
vibrating her tail. She's in heat, and you should get her fixed before letting 
her out or you will surely become a godfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Cats in heat almost always get pregnant, sometimes by more than one male. 
Females release a chemical when in heat, attracting every eligible male on the 
block, and can be in heat for months, or until they get pregnant. Tomcats fight 
to see which one mates with a female. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of kitten season, the Humane Society receives several litters a 
week. The arrival of kittens at the shelter makes the older cats undesirable 
for adoption, sealing their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This not a good time for the staff," Hoffman says. "You feed these cats, you 
pet them and then you have to put them down. The staff has the hardest time. 
You see signs of depression and extra stress. If anybody has vacation, now is 
the time to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Animal activists are also busy during kitten season. Animal Emancipation is 
one of several organizations in the county (see sidebar) that places unwanted 
pets. Last year, it found homes for about 30 cats. New owners must sign 
contracts promising to take care of their new pet "and, if they balk, no 
animal," Oswitch says. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswitch's group also supports several cat colonies in secret locations in the 
county, including three in the city of Ventura. Each colony is made up of 10 to 
12 wild cats, all neutered or spayed. The cats are fed regularly, but otherwise 
fend for themselves. It's not an easy life, but it beats the alternative. 
Oswitch says: "A cat can have a bit of a quality of life instead of 
euthanasia." 
</P>
<P>
 For cat overpopulation to be solved, some experts say, government will have to 
get involved. A 1992 ordinance requiring all outdoor cats over 6 months to be 
spayed or neutered has been successful in San Mateo County, which destroyed 
1,200 fewer cats the year the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a struggle in (Ventura) county to get people to fix their animals," 
Oswitch says. "We need an ordinance with criminal penalties to wake people up." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County has never considered an ordinance like San Mateo's. "It 
would be absolutely unenforceable," Jenks says. "There are no officers 
enforcing (existing) animal ordinances, so why add another one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jenks believes that public awareness is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to think having a pet is an inalienable right," she says. "It's 
not. It's a privilege." A Low-Cost Way to Stop Overpopulation 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are mind-boggling: According to the Humane Society, one female cat 
and her offspring can produce 420,000 cats in only seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaying and neutering will end cat overpopulation. To encourage cat owners, 
Ventura County Animal Regulation in Camarillo offers $20 vouchers, good at any 
veterinary hospital; the Humane Society in Ojai provides low-cost clinics 
Mondays through Thursdays, charging $20 for males and $25 for females. 
</P>
<P>
 Most vets charge about $50 to spay a female and $35 to neuter a male. 
</P>
<P>

GROUPS EAGER TO HELP FIND HOMES FOR FELINES

 Cindy Nealer went shopping for groceries and wound up with a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nealer, 33, noticed a bake sale outside an Ojai market and was drawn to a 
photo of an injured tomcat.A group named SPAN (an acronym for spay and neuter) 
was holding a fund-raiser and also trying to find a home for the abandoned 
animal, but there was a catch: The cat needed expensive surgery for a broken 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the picture of him -- it hit my heart," Nealer said. "I was told the 
operation would cost from $800 to $1,800, but I didn't care. I didn't want him 
to be put to sleep.' 
</P>
<P>
 Nealer, a masseuse who works in Ojai and lives in Oxnard, got the OK from her 
boyfriend to get the cat, their second, and was willing to pay the price for 
the surgery. SPAN, however, was able to find a vet who would do the operation 
for about $350. SPAN volunteers chipped in more than $250, the couple holding 
the cat made a contribution, and Nealer had to pay only $40. That was about two 
months ago. Today, the cat, a 4-year-old named Smokey, is healed, thanks in 
part to Nealer's massages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cats have such unconditional love for us," Nealer said. "We can learn a lot 
from them. But they're a lesser species. We have to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Most cats aren't as lucky as Smokey. Nationwide, only one of 10 cats in 
shelters gets adopted, says Joyce George, president of the Humane Society in 
Ojai. 
</P>

THEATER; THE SECOND DRAMA QUARTET FOLLOWS IN FAMOUS FOOTSTEPS; IT REPRISES A 
'DON JUAN IN HELL' ACCLAIMED WHEN DONE BY CHARLES LAUGHTON, TYRONE POWER AND 
AGNES MOOREHEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the hell according to George Bernard Shaw, dialogue comes cheap and 
plentiful. Down there, they've got all the time in the afterworld. And so we 
find Don Juan and Beelzebub holding forth on a plethora of subjects, with 
interjections from characters out of Don Juan's mortal life -- a woman he 
seduced and a man he killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the provocative thematic turf of Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell," extracted 
from the third act of his large-scale play "Man and Superman." The work will be 
presented as a dramatic reading Saturday night at the Lobero Theater, directed 
by and starring Harris Yulin, along with Ed Asner, Rene Auberjonois and Mira 
Furlan, a well-known actress in the former Yugoslavia who has recently 
relocated here. 
</P>
<P>
 This production has come into being thanks to Yulin, actor of stage and 
screens large and small who has been -- like many -- fascinated with the 
material for many years. His interest was first piqued decades back after 
hearing a recording made by the First Drama Quartet, featuring such talents as 
Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Agnes Moorehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolved to fill Don Juan's shoes for himself, Yulin enlisted the eager 
involvement of Asner and Auberjonois, and dubbed the loosely bound ensemble the 
Second Drama Quartet, "in homage to the first, if you will," Yulin explained in 
a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Launching the production two seasons back, Yulin had qualified expectations. 
"It seemed to me that it would work. But I didn't know what the feeling of 
audiences was today -- if there was still interest in such a dialogue, such 
prose, such a piece of theater. But they are. We did it once for a benefit, and 
it was an enormously enthusiastic response, so that cheered me on." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the show takes to the road. This weekend's Santa Barbara stop comes 
between a show in Olympia, Wash., and upcoming shows in Los Angeles, Princeton, 
N. J., and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic readings such as this, without the appurtenances and window dressing 
of fully staged theater, demand a special brand of audience appreciation. But 
Yulin commented that dramatic readings are "more common than we think, perhaps. 
The first group toured this play a long time ago, and then there was another 
group in the late '50s and '60s that did it, with Ricardo Montalban and Myrna 
Loy." 
</P>
<P>
 In this pared-down context, do audiences appreciate readings as a kind of 
refuge from the more blatant sensory impact of film, television or even 
conventional theater? 
</P>
<P>
 "It does have a different content," Yulin said. "You can't go to films like 
this. The only person I can think of who makes films at all like this is Eric 
Rohmer. There is no TV like this. An audience comes to this for a different 
kind of experience, an audio experience. It's the experience of the ear more 
than of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessarily a richer experience, but it's a different experience. 
It's like listening to radio: People's imaginations were engaged in a different 
way than with television. Perhaps because I was brought up on radio, I still 
have a feeling that it's a livelier medium, in a way, than television. 
Television seems deader." 
</P>
<P>
 Yulin even goes so far as to suggest that this form of theater, however 
unorthodox, can have advantages over more traditional staging. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a dramatic reading, you don't have the problem of movement distracting 
because there is none, essentially. The movement is interior. It isn't 
explicit. So it focuses the attention on what's being said, automatically. It 
does that by definition. I think that's helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if more Shakespeare was done in that way, people would start to 
hear the text more clearly. Wonderful things can happen. Most Shakespeare that 
one sees, or at least that I see, is not clear. It's pointless. It's only good 
if it's clear. If it's clear, then it can be something very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here plumping for static theater, or reading everything. There's a 
clarity obligation that's paramount -- to make everything understood. This form 
allows us to concentrate very much on the text and, I think, losing nothing. I 
don't think we lose anything by not having the staging." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than four actors to keep the Second Drama Quartet alive and 
kicking. Others involved in Yulin's project, filling in when others can't make 
it, are Gena Rowlands, Dianne Wiest, Harold Gould, David Warner, Martin Landau 
and Charles Durning. 
</P>
<P>
 Yulin has found that the reputation of the work precedes it and tends to 
attract actors hungry for a challenge. "Everybody wants to do it. This is a 
favorite piece of material with actors -- those actors who are from theater. I 
don't know of any actor who would take a pass on it, really. It's wonderful, 
challenging, brilliant material." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Yulin is realistic about what it takes to fill theater seats. 
</P>
<P>
 He shrugs, saying: "I would suppose that most people are coming to see Ed 
Asner, and then some other people are coming to hear 'Don Juan in Hell,' and a 
few people are coming to hear Rene, and three people are coming to hear me. 
Nobody's coming to hear Mira. 
</P>
<P>
 "However they get in the theater is how they get in. Once they're in the 
theater, then we have them and it's up to us to provide them with something 
that seems worthwhile." Details

 The Critical Companion was not very critical as we left the parking lot. "That 
was," the CC murmured as we drove out of the shopping center on the edge of 
North Ranch, "some of the best Italian food I've eaten in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the sort of comment that frequently leads to vigorous disagreement over 
what was good and what wasn't so good, but on this happy evening -- not our 
first at this restaurant -- we were very much in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritrovo sits in a fairly new shopping center, so far out on the edge of 
Westlake Village that it's practically in Simi Valley. The restaurant has only 
been open a few months, and its operators, John Spina and Gino Setola, are new 
to the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Johnny Piero, who comes from Sicily via Sardinia, works in an open 
kitchen of stainless steel looking out to a fairly large room. There's a small 
bar as you walk in, and the whole place is set in a melange of pinks, beiges 
and mauves. Waiters roam the room in the traditional Italian outfit of black 
pants, white shirt and black tie, protected by long white aprons. Apron-less 
waitresses wear short black skirts and, as one said, would look a bit strange 
with long white aprons. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters at Ritrovo are a mixed bag. Insalata di Cesare ($5.50 lunch) comes 
out much too creamy and, to top it off, (pun intended) with much too much 
dressing. The fritto misto ($9.95 dinner), a mixture of deep-fried shrimp, 
squid and scallops, produces seafood that lacks the requisite firm textures, 
and the breading might have come out of a box. 
</P>
<P>
 But the antipasto buffet ($8.95 lunch) easily makes up for this. There's 
tender eggplant wrapped around goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, and platters 
of fagioli e gamberi -- white beans and bay shrimp, the shrimp cooked gently 
and the concoction sauteed in olive oil and white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most traditional antipasto -- especially for Romans, for whom this 
is a down-home dish -- is the potato croquet, deep-fried mashed potatoes with 
mozzarella cheese wrapped in a crumb-and-egg breading. It's served cold, but 
ask your waiter to have it warmed up -- much better that way. Also, as a 
starter, the carpaccio ($8.25 dinner) gets high marks. The CC, who has tried 
this dish of raw, thinly sliced beef in perhaps 50 spots around the world, 
swears by it. This version arrives with olive oil and lemon and -- a touch not 
always seen -- capers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the CC nor I are enthusiastic about the pizzas. The Siciliana ($9.25), 
with black olives, capers, anchovies and spicy salami, is much too salty. The 
vegetarian model ($8.75) is cheeseless, but by the time it comes out of the 
oven, its mushrooms and eggplant are dried out. 
</P>
<P>
 So pass these by. Go directly from the antipasto and appetizers to the meats 
and pastas. There's a small, range-fed chicken, the polletto Ritrovo ($13.25 
dinner), grilled and pressed, and served -- what sacrilege! -- without garlic, 
but with luscious flavors of fresh herbs on a crisp skin. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was the lombata di vitello -- a substantial grilled veal chop, also 
with marinated herbs -- that introduced me to the restaurant's simple but 
excellent sauteed side dish of fresh leaf spinach in olive oil and lots of 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritrovo's pastas, together with several other vegetable side dishes 
beautifully done, are the restaurant's strength. The simplest of pasta dishes, 
the capellini filetto pomodoro ($7.95 dinner), is angel hair pasta in a light 
tomato sauce, with garlic, fresh basil and olive oil. It is so good I thought 
that both the basil and the tomatoes were fresh. Turns out I was half right -- 
the basil was. 
</P>
<P>
 The penne ($7.95 dinner), although served in a variety of sauces, is at its 
best with a sauce of sapori eggplant, gooey mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and the 
fresh basil. Comes out with a sort of charred, smoked flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritrovo's service, much like the food, can be a mixed bag, ranging from slow 
and inattentive to cordial and professional. It took questioning of three 
waiters to correctly identify the crushed olives (calamatas) mixed into the 
olive oil that accompanies each meal -- a superb flair with which to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, we choco-holics have a field day with one particular dish, the 
chocolate brownie cake. Very rich, also very chewy, beautifully fine chocolate 
flavoring, without being too sweet. Made on the premises. Details

 In 1990, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill entered the restaurant scene when its 
proprietors opened an establishment in Newbury Park. Within a year, the budding 
Westlake-based chain had added another restaurant in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in its fourth year, Baja Fresh has expanded to six operations, also 
including Westlake, Woodland Hills, Beverly Hills and, as of mid-February, in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baja Fresh menu features healthy and, as the name would imply, fresh fare. 
The folks who run the chain boast that their traditional Mexican food is 
grilled rather than fried, that the chicken is skinless, that no lard is used 
in preparation of the food, that the tortilla chips are made with 
cholesterol-free canola oil and that the salsa is fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Lopez, Baja Fresh corporate director of operations, said the Camarillo 
location, the baby of the chain, started up, at least in part, because of 
customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of requests from people visiting our other locations," he said. 
"They really wanted us to put a restaurant there. We just happened to find a 
location that was perfect for us." Baja Fresh Mexican Grill is at 1855 Daily 
Drive, Suite D, Camarillo.

 Business has been so brisk at Wheeler Hot Springs spa and restaurant, owner 
Tom Marshall said, that the folks on the restaurant end of things are now 
looking for an additional cook for their Saturday and Sunday brunches. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are they most looking for in a candidate? Consistency, Marshall said. 
And, he said, "they should have line-cook experience, and they should have fine 
dining experience. . . . It's not coffee shop experience or fast-food 
experience that will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler has received plenty of recognition of late, not the least of which was 
placement among the Top 10 restaurants in a 1994 Santa Barbara County 
restaurant guide. And it isn't even in Santa Barbara County. Wheeler is located 
above Ojai, at 16825 Maricopa Highway.

 Good news for carnivores.

<P>
 Mark Pogeano, manager of Champ's in Oxnard, said the former steakhouse, which 
turned into a steakhouse/bar and grill, and then into a bar and grill -- will 
return, in part, to its beefier roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the beginning of summer, he said, customers can expect to find barbecue 
ribs and tri-tip on the menu. Champs is at 1900 S. Victoria Ave.

STATE OKS $11.8 MILLION TO WIDEN SIMI FREEWAY; TRANSPORTATION: PROJECT WILL ADD 
TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION ALONG A 12-MILE SEGMENT. WORK IS EXPECTED TO START 
IN DECEMBER. 
</P>

 Close on the heels of the massive project to repair the earthquake-damaged 
Simi Valley Freeway, work will begin anew before year's end to enlarge the 
freeway by four lanes, Caltrans announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission, meeting in Sacramento this week, 
allocated $11.8 million to widen the freeway from west of the Los 
Angeles/Ventura County line to the Golden State Freeway, a distance of about 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year project will add one regular lane and one car-pool lane in each 
direction. Construction is expected to begin in December and be completed by 
the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Park-and-Ride lots to serve the Simi Valley Freeway will also be 
constructed near its intersection with the San Diego Freeway and at Winnetka 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Commission will contribute 
$15.7 million to the $27-million project, said Joe Shaw, spokesman for the 
state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will include median and shoulder reconstruction, drainage 
modification, bridge widening, retaining walls and sound walls, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the funds have been allocated for the project, contracts can be 
awarded for the work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of the freeway were closed by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Crews worked 
round-the-clock to make preliminary repairs, and through traffic resumed just 
over a month after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete repairs, including the rebuilding of several freeway overpasses, is 
scheduled to be done by June, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall traffic volume on the Simi Valley Freeway, in some places reduced to 
two lanes, has steadily increased since the earthquake. From an average of 
107,000 daily trips early in March, traffic has increased to an average 118,000 
daily trips this week, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening peak hour traffic of 9,400 daily trips has now nearly reached the 
pre-quake level of 9,950 trips, according to Caltrans studies. Morning volume 
remains somewhat lower at 8,800 daily trips, compared with 10,800 before the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the Simi Valley Freeway experienced increasingly 
heavy traffic as suburban populations grew in northwestern Los Angeles and 
eastern Ventura counties. Traffic was also slowed during peak hours by the 
changing configuration of the freeway, which varied from three lanes to five. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool lanes, known officially as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, 
are reserved for cars with two or more occupants and are designed to relieve 
congestion by concentrating more people into a portion of the freeway. Some HOV 
lanes carry up to 40% of the people traveling on a freeway, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The HOV program is designed to significantly increase the capacity of the 
freeway system in a relatively short time and at minimal cost," said Jerry B. 
Baxter, director of District 7 for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are 65 miles of HOV lanes in Los Angeles County. Other HOV 
lanes are under construction on the Harbor and Artesia freeways, and the 
Ventura Freeway east of the Hollywood Freeway.

SPECIAL DELIVERY; FIRST LADY BRINGS DEVON INDUSTRIES PART OF $9 MILLION IN 
QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an unprecedented week in Washington of being grilled, poked, prodded and 
scrutinized more than an Arkansas chicken, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
came to ChatsworthWednesday for a bit of relief -- earthquake relief, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton presented Devon Industries Inc. with the first installment of a 
$9.1-million Small Business Administration loan, the largest disaster loan in 
U. S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave a speech supporting the travails of San Fernando Valley residents and 
basked in the thanks of Mayor Richard Riordan, U. S. Reps. Howard P. (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) and Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), Devon officials 
and the 398 employees whose jobs the loan will help preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the grant to Devon, a medical supplies manufacturer, the SBA limited 
businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees to maximum loans of $1.5 million. 
But Devon, which suffered more than $10 million in damage from the Jan. 17 
quake, lobbied the SBA, in cooperation with the Valley Industry and Commerce 
Assn., to offer bigger loans to smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, SBA Administrator Erskine Bowles agreed to qualify businesses 
with 250 or more employees as "a major source of employment," making them 
eligible for the larger loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this SBA help, there is very little reason to believe that Devon 
could remain here, reopen, re-employ people and get back to business," Clinton 
told the applauding dignitaries, who were seated on a parking lot that had been 
part of the main plant before it was damaged in the quake. "They would have had 
to perhaps move production to their plants elsewhere, which would have been a 
devastating loss to this area." 
</P>
<P>
 And in fine ribbon-cutting tradition, Clinton, who was in town for former 
President Richard Nixon's funeral, also toured the recovered parts of the Devon 
plant and briefly worked on an assembly line. As workers and photographers 
looked on, she soon discovered the hazards of sending needle counters through a 
sealing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my gosh!" she said as she pressed the start button and fumbled with the 
red rectangular boxes, trying to stuff them into their proper places on the 
conveyor belt. "You've got to be fast!" 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Moreno, who normally does the job, laughed as he stepped in for the 
First Lady and showed her his technique. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parking lot, before Clinton could thank supporters and her fellow 
speakers for their encouraging words about her health care proposals, they all 
thanked her. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a visit to Los Angeles in January, when she was criticized for not 
making it to this side of the hill, it was the Valley officials who began the 
thank-yous. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Clinton Administration) came, they helped and we are here to see the 
results of that help," Riordan said. "Mrs. Clinton, the $1.9 million is 
concrete proof that flexibility combined with compassion can make government a 
friend to the people and businesses in need." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Dan Sandel, Devon's owner: "The immediate response from the so-called 
bureaucrats was so wonderful that the word bureaucrat -- which has a cynical 
connotation -- should be replaced with the term 'Angel of Mercy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who took no questions from the press, smiled, nodding her head 
throughout the speeches as a way of acknowledging the praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least of those thankful was Alejandro Cordero, who stood in the back 
with scores of other factory workers and craned his neck over the crowd to see 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero came to America from Guatemala City six years ago and has worked at 
the Chatsworth plant as a receiving clerk for about a year and a half, he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 His job and the benefits are good, he said, though he once feared the 
earthquake might end all that.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud to see her and I thank her for everything she has done," 
Cordero said. "This loan probably saved my job and my family's future -- my 
dreams."

COPIES OF CSUN PAPER STOLEN IN POLITICAL CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an election-day caper reminiscent of old-time, big-city politics, almost 
the entire run of Cal State Northridge's student newspaper was stolen, thrown 
in trash dumpsters, and replaced in some distribution bins with flyers touting 
Keith Weaver, a candidate for student body president, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly all of Tuesday's edition disappeared, the Daily Sundial reprinted 
that edition Wednesday, with the headline "CENSORED!" stripped across the top 
-- only to have much of that edition stolen as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Now mysteriously referred to as the "Stolen Edition," the disappearing paper 
contains an editorial endorsing Weaver's opponent, candidate Fabio Escobar. The 
election was held on Tuesday and Wednesday to give part-time students a chance 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bins are empty," said Paul Bond, the paper's editor in chief. "This is 
costing the journalism department a lot of money, and we're taking this quite 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The university's journalism department spent about $500 to produce Tuesday's 
edition, and the paper contained several hundred dollars' worth of advertising, 
Bond said. About 7,000 of the 9,000 copies of the paper were taken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses on Tuesday spotted two women removing newspapers from distribution 
bins, and two men were later seen filling the bins with "Keith Weaver for AS 
President" flyers, campus police said. About 500 copies of the paper were later 
found in a trash dumpster, smothered with tomato sauce, and other copies were 
found in trash cans and dumpsters throughout the campus. Weaver was unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery continued Wednesday morning, when university employees witnessed a 
woman take newspapers from the bins, place them inside her car and drive away, 
according to Lt. Michael Sugar of the State University Police. She appeared to 
be one of the women who cleaned out the bins Tuesday and was photographed by 
the Daily Sundial. 
</P>
<P>
 "She may be a supporter of one of the candidates who was not supported by the 
newspaper," Sugar said. 
</P>
<P>
 University police are keeping a vigil over all newspaper bins, trying to catch 
the culprits in the act -- but there is little they can do, even if they are 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing free newspapers from a distribution bin is not illegal in Los 
Angeles, even if a person takes them all, according to the city attorney's 
office, Sugar said. It is, however, a violation of the university's student 
code of conduct, and is punishable by suspension and other disciplinary action, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Cal State Northridge students on Wednesday didn't seem to care what 
happened to the Sundial, but they thought removing the papers was infantile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The publicity of this is probably going to sway voters to the other 
candidate," said Mauricette Mancini, 27, a junior. "I think it was very 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy did, however, entice more students to read the paper -- if 
they could locate a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one respect, these people are creating more demand for the Sundial," Bond 
said. "People are very curious about what would make a group of people so 
anxious."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY TO PROMOTE STARLIGHT VENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Burbank is budgeting $90,000 for an enterprise fund to promote the 
Starlight Amphitheater, an outdoor venue for concerts and events that has been 
financially struggling for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphitheater had been closed for three years, falling out of use and 
poorly maintained, when the city decided to reopen it in 1992.However, while 
some events, like a July 4 fireworks display, had been successful, other 
concerts and performances were poorly attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Starlight Bowl (amphitheater) is to be successful, we have a lot of 
work to do," Parks and Recreation Director Mary Alvord told the City Council 
Tuesday night. A major problem for the amphitheater has been a lack of 
marketing, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had budgeted little for advertising and promoting events at the bowl, 
a mistake underscored in March, when experts in marketing and representatives 
from other performing arts facilities were brought together. Only one member of 
the group knew that Burbank had been trying to revive the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the suggestions from these experts, the city has come up with a plan to 
better promote the facility's events. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * a better brochure; 
</P>
<P>
 * drawing up a patron list for a targeted direct mailing; 
</P>
<P>
 * posters and newspaper advertising; 
</P>
<P>
 * developing a logo for the amphitheater; 
</P>
<P>
 * public service announcements; and 
</P>
<P>
 * improving the programming by using themed events, pre-concert entertainment, 
and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also included setting up corporate sponsorships and support groups to 
back the facility events. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; PHILHARMONIC BRINGS CLASSICS TO THE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strains of classical music threading through a leafy glen -- what could be 
more divine? 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Philharmonic Orchestra will create just such an atmosphere at 2 
p.m. Saturday, when members perform their 16th annual benefit concert for the 
Topanga Co-Op Preschool at Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor 
amphitheater at 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestra members -- professional and amateur musicians -- come together but 
once a year to put on a show, which features classical music, a casual dress 
code and a kid-friendly environment. Music enthusiasts in jeans generally tote 
picnic baskets to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest draws of the concert is the lush scenery that forms its 
backdrop: oak trees, a waterfall and a brook running under the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has become a celebratory rite of spring in the canyon," said Laura 
Whitney, event coordinator and parent of a preschool student. 
</P>
<P>
 Guido Lamell of Santa Monica has volunteered as the orchestra's conductor and 
music director since 1990 for the chance to perform in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Topanga is a beautiful area. There's a wonderful lifestyle and a wonderful 
feeling," Lamell said. "Second of all, the natural setting is really 
unparalleled. Those two things combine to make it the treat that it is."  
</P>
<P>
 This year, audience members may recognize a familiar face in the string 
section -- that of Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, who will play the 
cello and be recognized for his role in ensuring that 662 canyon acres once 
slated for development will be preserved as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will feature the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi's "The Pines 
of Rome," written in 1924. The music attempts to capture the mood of children 
playing at a grand Italian villa, the military glory of the Appian Way, and the 
mystery of a catacomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamell and guest conductors Barry Socher and Ivan Shulman will also present 
other works by Mexican, Italian, Russian, French and American composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the orchestra hail from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Long 
Beach and Pasadena symphonies, and the ranks of "very good" amateur and student 
musicians, said Lamell, who plays second violin with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers have to be good, the conductor said, to cope with the fact that 
there is only one rehearsal -- on the morning of the concert. 
</P>

 After the rehearsal, after the stage is decorated and children's artwork 
displayed in a nearby garden, there will be nothing left to do but pray that 
the weather cooperates, said organizer Whitney, who has been planning the event

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; NAMING NEW PARK IS CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A month and a half after plans for a luxury home development in Topanga were 
scrapped in favor of preserving the wilderness, acreage once slated for Canyon 
Oaks Estates is the subject of a new controversy: what to call it. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to name the newly purchased parkland after Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, who brokered a last-minute deal to preserve the 
662 acres, snagged last week after ever-vigilant residents expressed concern 
over the naming process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some worried that christening the property the Edmund D. Edelman Wilderness 
Park as proposed could complicate future efforts to add the land to the state 
or national park systems, in which land usually is not named for living people. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said naming the hilly land after a politician would ignore the Native 
American heritage of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Place names often last for a long time," said Chester King, an archeologist 
and Topanga resident. "The old Indian names, such as Topanga, give a sense of 
heritage, that people have been here a long time. The question is: Do we want 
to honor politicians or do we want to reflect other values?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which closed escrow on the property 
early this month, agreed to reconsider at its Monday meeting a name for only 
the 257 acres once set aside for the Canyon Oaks homes and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions will be accepted from Topanga residents and other concerned 
citizens, and a name for the rest of the tract will be considered later. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston, who proposed naming the 
land for Edelman, said he hopes the board of directors will name the 257 acres 
for the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who plans to retire at the end of this term, brought the developer 
and the conservancy to a late-night bargaining session hours before a hearing 
on whether to approve the Canyon Oaks development project. In the supervisor's 
hearing room the next day, gleeful residents cheered the surprise announcement 
that the land would be sold to the parks agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disturbed that some of the members of the community didn't seem to 
recognize the contribution Edelman made," Edmiston said. "Certainly, he has 
warranted the honor as much as, if not more than, other persons who have had 
parks named for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians with fewer environmental credentials than Edelman's have been 
honored with namesake parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman's former colleague, Pete Schabarum, had a regional park in Rowland 
Heights named for him despite the ex-supervisor's steadfast support of 
developers and criticism of environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parks have been named for former Gov. George Deukmejian and President 
Ronald Reagan, both of whom tried to eliminate many park programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, said spokesman Joel Bellman, would prefer to see the namesake issue 
settled with little fanfare.  
</P>
<P>
 "The sideshow over whether it should or shouldn't be named for him is 
unfortunate," Bellman said. "It detracts from the main issue, which was saving 
that area from development." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY SELECTS NEW PUBLIC SERVICE CHIEF 
</P>

<P>
 City officials Wednesday announced the appointment of Bernie Palk, a 31-year 
veteran of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, as Glendale's public 
service director.  
</P>
<P>
 A 54-year-old assistant chief engineer, Palk currently manages 1,600 DWP 
employees.In his new job, Palk succeeds Mike Hopkins, who retired last month. 
Palk takes over June 6.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay said Palk's management experience will help the city 
raise employee morale. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by Woodland Hills-based consultants The Warner Group released earlier 
this month reported morale was low among city employees who faced heavy 
workloads and unrealistic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens called Palk "a visionary leader and a good team player -- 
along with being a good engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 Palk promised to include employees at all levels in decisions made by the 
public service department. He said he will also ask employees to participate in 
implementing department policies.  
</P>
<P>
 The new public service director, who lives in Seal Beach, was chosen from 
among 80 applicants from around the nation. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ARRAIGNMENT DELAYED IN HIGHWAY SHOOTING 
</P>

<P>
 An arraignment was postponed Wednesday for an Antelope Valley man accused of 
shooting a Pasadena motorist in the face after the victim allegedly tailgated 
him on Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Shinkman, 50, who is being held at Los Angeles County Jail, was 
charged with attempted murder, mayhem and shooting at an occupied vehicle in 
the Monday incident, said Barbara Murphy, deputy district attorney in charge of 
the Glendale courts. Bail was set at $555,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinkman will appear in Glendale Municipal Court to enter a plea to the felony 
charges and a preliminary hearing date will be set on May 11.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Noel Milovic, 51, of Pasadena, was taken to Verdugo Hills 
Hospital, where he was treated for a gunshot wound to the face and released 
Wednesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 1 p.m. after Shinkman pulled his Plymouth into a 
turnout on Angeles Crest Highway about 10 miles north of Foothill Boulevard to 
let Milovic pass in his red Corvette, said Detective Ken Talianko of the 
Crescenta Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cars traveled a short distance, Shinkman sped up and passed Milovic, 
turning his car in front of the Corvette and stopping to block the road, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milovic tried to pass Shinkman on the right shoulder until he saw that 
Shinkman, an auto mechanic with the Los Angeles Police Department, was wearing 
a work shirt with LAPD patches embroidered on the sleeve and front pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim then stopped his car because he thought Shinkman, who had gotten 
out of his car and was standing near the driver's door, was a policeman, 
Talianko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinkman pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol at him and fired four 
rounds into Milovic's car, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the rounds from the weapon, which police said Shinkman was carrying 
illegally, hit Milovic in the left cheek and slammed into his nose, sending 
shrapnel into Milovic's right eye, police said. Milovic has apparently lost 
vision in his right eye because of the incident, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Milovic fell unconscious and took his foot off the brake, 
causing his car to roll about 70 feet down an embankment, Talianko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinkman apparently drove to a nearby Shell station and asked an attendant to 
call for help. Crescenta Valley deputies later arrested Shinkman at the gas 
station, Talianko said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: IMMIGRANTS PUT NEW ENGLISH SKILLS TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One by one, they stepped nervously to a microphone and waited for the word 
they would be asked to spell. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 adult immigrants faced off Tuesday and Wednesday in a series of 
spelling bees at the San Fernando High School gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the language students, it was their first American-style 
competition and a welcome break from the daily juggle of low-income jobs, night 
school and family commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The first word -- onions -- was tested on a group of contestants with three 
months or less of classroom study. 
</P>
<P>
 "A -- N -- E -- O -- N -- E -- S," said Eduardo Aleman, 23, from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The ringing of a cowbell indicated he was wrong, and he returned to his seat 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people. All the people, yakety, yakety . . . I don't know what 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more contestants failed to spell the word before Alejandra Benini, 20, a 
student from Argentina, succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, (the bee) is very important because I go to college next month," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrants -- mostly Spanish speakers from Mexico, El Salvador and Ecuador 
-- are studying English as a second language at the Kennedy-San Fernando 
Community Adult School, and they are at varying levels of skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most students are coming to school to learn English so they can look forward 
to a brighter future," she said. "They study on weekends, on the bus, at work. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fourth year, the spelling bee is a chance for students to show off 
their new language skills to friends and relatives who come to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some still had trouble because they are accustomed to spelling words 
phonetically and are unfamiliar with spelling bees, said Carlyn Buckel, a 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows a dedication to education through events like this," Buckel said. 
The students love the competition and study hard. They're proud of what they're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of one of the bees, only Gonzalo Campos was left standing. With the 
correct spelling of the word semester , he won a 12-inch, gold-plated trophy 
with an American flag wrapped around the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling so happy," said the 20-year-old carpenter from Mexico. "I never 
won a trophy. This is the first time." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; PLAN WOULD REOPEN PRAIRIE STREET SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from San Fernando Valley's first charter school said Wednesday that 
they would like to reopen an elementary school to entice white students back to 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual proposal to reopen Prairie Street school, which has been closed 
for nearly 10 years, came during a meeting Wednesday between the Vaughn Next 
Century Learning Center and Los Angeles Unified School District officials.The 
Vaughn school, which broke off from the district last year, is seeking greater 
financial independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Chan, the school principal, said the staff wants to reopen Prairie 
Street School in Northridge, next to CSUN, to lure white students back to the 
system and to operate a desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to run our own program," said Chan, whose campus is made up of mostly 
Latino students. "We want to bring back the white students who are now in 
private schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie was closed by the school district in June, 1984, when the Board of 
Education closed about a dozen campuses because of declining enrollments. Some 
of the campuses are now being leased to private schools, others have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said the district has set up another meeting with her to discuss several 
financial issues and the Prairie proposal. The school, which says it saved $1.2 
million this year, is hoping to get better funding next year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the meeting Wednesday was the first to begin hammering 
out the funding questions for Vaughn. Last year, bitter and protracted funding 
disputes resulted in Vaughn receiving about the same funding per student as 
other elementary campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are like the pain-in-the-neck students asking a lot of questions or the 
inquisitive students who keep on asking and asking," Chan said. "We generated a 
lot of questions and now they have to respond." BETH SHUSTER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; MOVE TRANSFORMER, PARENTS TELL LAUSD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated parents of children who attend Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary 
School in Sherman Oaks criticized school district officials for not keeping 
their promise to move an electrical transformer away from an outside wall of a 
kindergarten classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressured by parents and a kindergarten teacher at the school, Los Angeles 
Unified School District officials agreed six weeks ago to relocate the 
transformer at an estimated cost of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a meeting with parents last week, district officials said they agreed 
too hastily to relocate the transformer and that moving it is not the most 
cost-effective solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just do that overnight," said David Koch, the school district's 
business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch said the district is examining other alternatives, such as shielding the 
transformer or making the classroom near the transformer a storage room so 
children will not be exposed to the high levels of electromagnetic fields 
measured there in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Electromagnetic fields are present wherever an electrical current passes 
through a wire. EMFs are the subject of a scientific debate as a potential 
cause of childhood cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixie Canyon parents, who first reacted angrily March 11 to reports that the 
transformer exposed their children to strong electromagnetic fields, said they 
were frustrated that no action had been taken. They again called for the 
district to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going away," said Anne Ward, whose daughter is in the kindergarten 
class near the transformer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33 kindergartners whose classroom is the focus of the controversy are 
attending class in the school library until a new bungalow can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," Ward said. "It really is. The kids don't understand what's 
going on." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; FAMILY CENTER WAITS FOR WORD ON GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A family care center is preparing for all contingencies in case it doesn't get 
a $400,000 state grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Word on whether the grant has been approved for the East Valley Family Care 
Center, based at Glenwood Elementary School in Sun Valley, is expected next 
week.However, an open house to celebrate the award of the grant is already 
scheduled for May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "With or without the grant, the community needs to be involved either way," 
said Ann Britt, chairwoman of the center's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the grant is not approved, the open house will be used to try to draw 
the interest of other community groups to help with the center.  
</P>
<P>
 The center offers a range of services from immunizations and screenings to 
parent counseling. The grant money would be used to renovate two bungalows on 
the site now being used to teach parents English and for expanded medical and 
dental services. A parenting center offering resource materials and workshops 
would also be created. The center helps parents from three other local schools: 
Roscoe Elementary in Sun Valley as well as Camellia Avenue and Arminta Street 
Elementary Schools in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The care center was created last year to try to fill a gaping hole of needs in 
the community, Britt said. The site is already being used for gang-intervention 
programs with parents through the Los Angeles County Department of Probation. 
Counseling services are also being offered at Glenwood through the Valley 
Community Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the North Hollywood Rotary Club donated a dental chair to the 
center and promised to help arrange for dentists to volunteer their time, but 
the center lacked the equipment needed to install the chair. Organizers hope to 
get a dental clinic running. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITY WORKERS TELL COMMITTEE OF WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee investigating waste in City Hall heard 
city employees complain Wednesday about a burdensome purchasing process and 
prices for supplies and equipment that are up to twice the retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 On its first day of testimony, the Government Efficiency Committee heard 
several stories of waste, ranging from a camera offered to narcotics 
investigators for nearly twice the price at a retail store to computer discs 
sold to the city at six times the retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 "This waste is unbelievable," said the committee's chairman, Councilman Joel 
Wachs, who represents parts of the northeast San Fernando Valley. "And it's 
marbled throughout the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is Wachs' latest effort to identify and cut waste in the 
city's system for buying supplies and equipment. He predicts that up to $70 
million annually can be saved by eliminating inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was attended by about 80 department heads and vendors who listened 
intently to the testimony. Some vendors recommended that the city eliminate 
some paperwork and procedures required of them by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first examples of overpricing came from Los Angeles Police Officer 
Kenny Knox of the West Valley Division. The officer said he was asked by his 
commanding officer to replace a special camera used in narcotics investigations 
that was damaged during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A vendor who was authorized to sell such equipment to the city offered a 
replacement camera for $1,700, Knox said. But the officer found that a retail 
camera store in Hollywood offered the same camera for $649. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Knox said. "It was the same identical camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs began the hearing by pointing to a chart his staff prepared that 
outlined the 23 steps needed to buy a chair through the city's approval 
process. The chart says the process can take 57 to 172 days to get 
administrative approval to buy the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle congratulated the committee for "putting your 
finger on a major problem." But he reminded the group that some of the city's 
procedures are part of the city's internal controls required to eliminate 
waste, fraud and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs instructed department heads to return to the committee by its next 
meeting next week with written recommendations to streamline the purchasing 
process and allow the city to buy at the lowest prices available. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; NOW EVENT PLANNED FOR SLAIN WOMAN

<P>
 A little more than a year ago, Sherri Foreman was murdered outside Great 
Western Bank in Sherman Oaks while using the automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at 11 a.m., the San Fernando Valley chapter of the National Organization 
for Women will hold a news conference at the bank to remember Foreman and to 
highlight National Anti-Violence and Victims Rights Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, 29 and pregnant when she died, was stabbed and left for dead behind 
the same wall that her killer hid behind before attacking her. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison parolee who admitted to the murder was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after her death, NOW was successful in getting the property owner 
to remove the wall which ringed the bank parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 So it may come as a surprise when NOW announces its opposition to Gov. Pete 
Wilson's "one strike you're out" bill for rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're opposed to any kind of bill that can be seen as grandstanding instead 
of funneling money where it can be used effectively . . . to help women who 
have been victimized by crime," said Jean Morrison, NOW spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison said current rape laws need to be enforced and that the proposed law 
could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "One potential effect of the law would be that judges and juries would be less 
likely to convict, knowing that they're going to be sending somebody to prison 
for the rest of his life," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group supports the federal crime bill, which it says will help fight the 
country's domestic violence problem by funding education and battered women's 
shelters. 
</P>

HEAVY RAINS DRENCH VALLEYS; ANOTHER STORM IS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The tail end of what one weather forecaster referred to as a "mother lode" 
storm system brought more heavy rain to parts of the San Fernando and Santa 
Clarita valleys Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain gauge maintained by the National Weather Service in Santa Clarita 
registered a half-inch accumulation of rain by evening, with more expected 
later that night, said meteorologist Bruce Entwistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain was especially heavy in Santa Clarita, with 0.3 of an inch coming 
down in just one hour, starting at 4:10 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rain and thunderstorms were also reported in Tujunga and several other 
northeast San Fernando Valley areas. 
</P>
<P>
 And although this system -- which in three days has brought rain, hail, 
thunderstorms and even snow to Southern California cities -- is finally leaving 
the Los Angeles Basin, more bad weather is probably ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is another storm system heading this way, and there is a chance that by 
late Saturday night, there could be more rain," said Bruce Thoren, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 This system spun off from a powerful low pressure center near the Aleutian 
Islands, Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the next three days at least, while the sun's appearance may be 
spotty, there is no rain in the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Skies should be partly cloudy today, as the storm gives way to a strong high 
pressure system about 100 miles off the coast. This kind of system provides the 
sunny days more common for this time of year, Entwistle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent rains were unusual in that they drenched some areas of the San 
Fernan d o Valley while letting others off far more easily. Woodland Hills in 
the West Valley accumulated about one inch of rain over the last three days. 
While rainfall totals aren't available for communities to the east, Entwistle 
estimated that they received from one-third to one-half of an inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the dwindling storm system Wednesday, there were reports of rough 
weather in other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A helicopter pilot reported seeing a funnel cloud associated with a 
thunderstorm moving north over East Los Angeles about 4 p.m., Thoren said.

AIR-QUALITY INSPECTORS SEARCHING AUTO CLUB OFFICE FOR ASBESTOS; HEALTH: THE 
EFFORT STEMS FROM A REPORT THAT PIECES OF EXPOSED FIREPROOFING HAD FALLEN FROM 
THE CEILING. COMPANY SAYS REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Air-quality inspectors are investigating building repairs at the Northridge 
district office of the Automobile Club of Southern California, following a 
report that pieces of exposed asbestos fireproofing above a quake-ravaged 
ceiling have been falling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Air Quality Management District officials said they took samples 
on Tuesday of particles found on a typewriter and other surfaces, and will 
analyze them for asbestos content. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was spurred by a complaint from an irate Auto Club insurance 
customer, who said he called the air district after a private lab he hired 
found asbestos in debris picked up inside and on the parking lot behind the 
brown-brick building in the 9400 block of Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the fireproofing contains asbestos, Auto Club officials 
said they have complied with asbestos regulations and have verified through air 
tests, as recently as Wednesday morning, that levels of airborne asbestos are 
well below legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have that building open if we thought it wasn't safe for our 
employees and our members," said Jeffrey Spring, corporate communications 
supervisor for the Auto Club. "We welcome the fact that they're (the air 
district) here to take a look at it. . . . We don't believe they'll find any 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Staffed by about 50 employees, the Northridge office provides insurance and 
travel planning services to Auto Club members. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos fibers scar the lungs and have been linked to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The member who called in the air district was Michael E. Stevens, a Northridge 
resident with asbestos problems of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, 47, said he has lived for several months in a motel while awaiting 
asbestos cleanup of his house. He blames contamination of his house on Auto 
Club insurance adjusters, who he said failed to take proper precautions with 
asbestos when directing repairs to the home. Spring said he was not familiar 
with Stevens' case. 
</P>
<P>
 While transacting business at the club's Northridge office this month and 
last, Stevens said he noticed the fireproofing and saw what he thought was 
asbestos debris in the parking lot out back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the stuff and said, 'Man, that's asbestos. . . . That ain't 
supposed to be out here,' " Stevens recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said his suspicions were confirmed when he took a sample of the 
material to Asbestos Analysis Laboratories, the Studio City lab he had retained 
to help him with his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at Stevens' behest, the head of the laboratory, Patrick M. Michaels, 
took samples from the carpet and parking lot of the Auto Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels said he presented written findings Wednesday, telling Auto Club 
officials that particles he took from the carpet contained 18% asbestos, while 
a "fibrous white mass" from the parking lot was 25% asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People shouldn't be going into that building if it's contaminated," Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other commercial buildings wracked by the Northridge quake, the Auto 
Club office suffered extensive damage to its drop ceiling that exposed asbestos 
fireproofing normally hidden from view. 
</P>
<P>
 To allow for replacement of the ceiling, Spring said the Auto Club hired a 
licensed asbestos contractor to carefully remove small areas of fireproofing so 
wires could be attached to hold a new drop ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the air district tests confirm that asbestos had fallen into work 
areas, that in itself might not constitute a violation of the agency's asbestos 
regulations. The rules mainly require that those removing or repairing asbestos 
materials take specific precautions to keep harmful fibers from becoming 
airborne.

AROUND THE VALLEY: MEMORIAL BENCH SYMBOL OF TRAUMA AND JOY AT SHAKEN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's funny what bothers people most in a crisis. What bothered Carol Jellison 
after the Northridge quake hit the Sepulveda VA hospital was the sight of a 
small concrete bench overturned in a patch of roses. 
</P>
<P>
 To put that in perspective, you have to understand what the quake did to the 
stately, red-brick federal hospital complex where Jellison, a friendly, 
diminutive woman with steel-gray hair, has worked for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was massive, its effects terrifying. In the central hospital, 
nurses used hand-pumped ventilator bags to keep several patients alive because 
there was no electricity. Water poured from shattered pipes, turning hallways 
into sluiceways. Operating rooms were wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Braving aftershocks that swayed the six-story building as if it was rubber, 
employees half-dragged bedridden patients down a dark stairwell as they clung 
desperately to mattresses. By the end of the day, 331 veterans had been 
evacuated to other VA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time afterward, some employees worked in tents in the chill winter 
weather. Others doubled or tripled up in undamaged offices. Even at other VA 
hospitals, many thought the Sepulveda complex had been destroyed, though its 22 
buildings remained standing. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the destruction and dislocation, Jellison, Sepulveda's assistant 
personnel chief, zeroed in on that bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? The bench was installed as a memorial to Diana L. Johnson, a personnel 
clerk who had been friends with Jellison. At age 39, Johnson died of lung 
cancer. Jellison remembers her as a quiet, unobtrusive woman who lived with her 
mother and always smiled no matter how much work was dropped on her. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jellison saw the bench, knocked over by the quake, it hit her harder, in 
some difficult-to-explain way, than all the other wreckage around her. She 
wanted it fixed, and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bench made me cry," she said. "It's humanity. It's what keeps you 
connected. . . . It recalled all the things we had been through together." 
</P>
<P>
 These are emotional times at the Sepulveda VA. Many of its 1,800 employees 
have worked there for years, even decades, and they are deeply attached to 
their co-workers, patients and Sepulveda's serene, college-like environs. 
</P>
<P>
 VA hospitals have a lousy reputation, and there are veterans at Sepulveda who 
will give you an earful about its shortcomings. But Sepulveda employees, many 
of whom are vets themselves, often speak of their patients as if they were 
family. Some vets even allow that the hospital isn't all that bad; hell, 
sometimes it's pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Sepulveda employees worked heroically to get the institution up and 
running again. A number of its pre-quake clinics are open again, including 
those for kidney dialysis, spinal cord injuries and methadone treatment. There 
are new urgent-care and women's health centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake and its ensuing dislocations changed Sepulveda, in ways as 
obvious as a cracked wall and as subtle as a nurse pausing to catch his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage closed the central hospital, Building 3; the VA is replacing it 
with a $65-million outpatient center. Meanwhile, more than 500 Sepulveda 
workers were transferred to the big West Los Angeles VA hospital and other 
facilities to care for evacuated patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, many veterans were angered at losing in-patient services at 
Sepulveda. And many employees shared those feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Building 3 was shuttered, employees gathered outside for an impromptu 
"memorial service." A nurse laughingly told how she had "trained" a doctor in 
his first days on the job. A man said he'd worked in the building for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers are upset at being uprooted to West L. A., 15 miles away over the 
often congested San Diego Freeway. They don't like working in a much bigger 
hospital where they have no friends and don't know the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollie Whitehead, Sepulveda's assistant director, recalled seeing some doctors 
and nurses picnicking on a lawn one day. They were Sepulveda employees who had 
been transferred to West L. A. and wanted to see each other again -- on their 
day off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was how they were dealing with the grief and trauma," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Building 3 closed, the plan called for Sepulveda patients who needed 
hospitalization to be sent by ambulance to West L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Sepulveda doctors don't like that. In the past, they only had to take 
their patients over to Building 3 and admit them. Now they have to turn them 
over to another doctor at a different site. 
</P>
<P>
 "That interrupts the continuity of care. I don't think it's the best model," 
said Dr. Dennis Cope, who heads Sepulveda's managed-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Sepulveda doctors are admitting their sickest patients to nearby 
Granada Hills Community Hospital and Olive View. But that, of course, costs the 
government more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite everything, though, Sepulveda slowly rebuilds. Its 120-bed nursing 
home is still closed, but renovations are under way. Except for a few nooks and 
crannies, the whole complex has heat and hot water again. 
</P>
<P>
 And, thanks to Carol Jellison's request, Diana Johnson's bench is upright 
again. Jellison saw it when she came in to work about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was all by myself and I remember saying out loud, 'The bench is fixed!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just so happy."

4 DISTRICTS TO EXEMPT STUDENTS FROM CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY 
CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS REQUEST IT WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Skirting state law to appease opponents of the new California assessment 
tests, several Ventura County school districts have agreed to exempt individual 
children from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four school districts -- Fillmore Unified, Oxnard Elementary, Oxnard 
Union High School and Mesa Union -- have agreed to honor the requests of 
parents who want their children excused from the California Learning Assessment 
System exams, despite a state law requiring that all students take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 And other districts, such as Ventura Unified, are giving implicit permission 
to parents who request to have their children excused from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school board members agreed Tuesday that they could fulfill their 
legal responsibility by simply placing the test in front of students, without 
forcing them to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Antelope Valley Union High School District refused to even 
administer the tests, a stand that brought warnings from state education 
officials that their actions could result in removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley board president Billy Pricer said he wants the tests 
"re-examined and re-evaluated," and vowed to withhold them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simi Valley school trustees are among the first in Ventura County 
to review the tests themselves and publicly express support for them as a 
valuable assessment tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found none of the things that were alleged to be in the test by some of the 
groups" opposing CLAS, Simi Valley board member Doug Crosse said. "I found the 
literature to be age-appropriate. I found the literature to have a lot of 
socially redeeming values, to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 All California school districts are legally required to administer the CLAS 
exams this spring to students in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to give it and kids have to take it," said Susie Lange, spokeswoman 
for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials have advised districts that they have no legal 
authority to excuse individual students from the exams, Lange said, but so far, 
the department is not considering legal action against districts that agree to 
such exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School Boards Assn., estimated 
that dozens of the state's 1,000 school districts are agreeing to excuse 
students from the CLAS exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, anti-CLAS groups have fanned opposition to the tests by 
passing out copies of materials, supposedly excerpted from CLAS, that include 
stories some parents consider too dark or disturbing for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lange said much of the material being passed out by CLAS opponents is not 
on the 1994 tests. "They're basing their complaints primarily on bad 
information," she said. 
</P>

 A 36-year-old woman who had been stabbed several times was discovered dead 
inside her condominium Wednesday morning by her young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robin McLean, who lived in the Steeplechase Condominiums on North Lost Hills 
Road, was stabbed several times in the chest, according to Los Angeles County 
sheriff's investigators.The 8-year-old girl, whose name is being withheld by 
police, discovered her mother's body about 7:30 a.m. when she woke up. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl did not hear her mother being attacked, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Lt. Joe Brown said, and there were no signs of a forced entry into the 
two-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual (that) it happened rather quietly," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that someone stabbed McLean several times in the chest 
with a knife during the night late Tuesday or early Wednesday, Brown said. But 
detectives have not located the murder weapon and know no motive for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 They declined to say in which room the body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, neighbors in the large, gated complex described McLean as 
committed to her daughter, but said they did not know much about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very involved with her child," said Jeff Ames, the president of the 
homeowners association. "She was very nice and sociable."

FEMA WON'T REIMBURSE CITY FOR RELOCATING COWBOY EVENT 
</P>

 In addition to shaking up everything else here, the Northridge earthquake 
shifted the bottom line of Santa Clarita's Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have announced that they won't 
reimburse Santa Clarita the $22,500 spent to hold last month's festival at the 
Melody Ranch movie lot rather than at a high school auditorium damaged in the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just isn't covered," said George Thune, FEMA spokesman. "We can pay for 
brick and mortar rather than for moving an activity to a different site." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials, counting on the funds from FEMA, said earlier this 
week that the three-day festival would cost the city $2,697. Expenses totaled 
about $101,800 for printing, postage, promotion, supply and hiring costs, while 
ticket sales, merchandise sales, sponsorships and vendors generated about 
$76,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita was counting on the $22,500 FEMA grant to help make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 60 days to appeal the FEMA ruling. If the appeal is unsuccessful, 
the money will come out of the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was originally going to host the festival at William S. Hart High 
School in Newhall. Damage to the auditorium prompted the move and cost the city 
$15,000 in rental fees and additional costs for lights and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that if the earthquake has not forced a change of venue, we 
probably would have made money on this first-year event," said Cecilia Burda, 
the city employee who organized the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's reimbursement request to FEMA prompted varied reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the federal relief money was to be used for true disaster needs 
and not to help pay for a festival. Supporters said the city simply asked for 
financial assistance for a legitimate economic investment that suffered because 
of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Santa Clarita is certainly entitled to appeal," Thune said.

MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT WILL STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING; SANTA CLARITA: STUART EDWARD 
MILBURN IS ACCUSED OF STRANGLING VERONICA ESTRADA, A TAE KWON DO STUDIO 
CO-WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A martial arts expert was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on a charge of 
murdering a female co-worker who was one of the top-ranked tae kwon do 
competitors in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, is accused of strangling Veronica Estrada, 29, of 
Canyon Country along Soledad Canyon Road about 8:15 p.m. on Dec. 15. He is in 
custody without bail and could receive the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Darryl Mounger tried during the second day of Milburn's 
preliminary hearing in Newhall Municipal Court to counter testimony that three 
people saw Milburn at or near the murder scene. Lisa Smith-Putnam, an adult 
student at Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where Milburn and Estrada taught, 
testified for the defense that she saw Milburn while she was participating in a 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be around 8:20 to 8:25 p.m.," she said. "Mr. Milburn was in the 
hallway of the school. He was placing a (Christmas) card in my gym bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz questioned how accurate her memory of the time 
was and why none of the other students saw Milburn then. In addition, Foltz 
pointed out that even if her story is true, it contradicts Milburn, who said he 
was at a video store continuously between 8 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, who primarily taught 5- to 8-year-olds at the studio, was the 
American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the second-level 
black belt division. Her partially clothed body was discovered hidden in brush 
Dec. 16, and coroner's officials said she died of strangulation, possibly 
during or after a sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Noah Ben-Menashe, a College of the Canyons student, testified that at 8:17 
p.m. she drove by a person who appeared to be dragging someone down an 
embankment on Soledad Canyon Road near where Estrada's body was found. 
Ben-Menashe picked Milburn from a photo lineup of six men as the person she 
believed to be the man she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and members of the tae kwon do studio say Milburn, also a black 
belt, may have been motivated to kill Estrada out of professional jealousy over 
her achievements. Milburn and Estrada had both worked for the studio for about 
six years and were friends at first, but developed personal differences that 
they tried to work out on numerous occasions, said Ken Lewis, owner of the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Keith Byrum denied Mounger's motion calling for the case to be dismissed 
due to insufficient evidence. Byrum also kept in place three special 
circumstances allegations of lying in wait, forcible sodomy and attempted rape. 
Milburn will be arraigned May 11 in Superior Court in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger, who has emphasized that there is no physical evidence against 
Milburn, said he will introduce physical evidence at trial indicating that a 
different person is responsible for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sgt. Doral Riggs, a homicide detective with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, said all current physical evidence has been evaluated and 
does not point to there being any other suspect.

CITY PURSUES OPTION TO ANNEX SHOPPING CENTER SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials, concerned about economic and environmental effects of an 
860,000-square-foot shopping center proposed for just outside Santa Clarita, 
have acted to retain the option of annexing the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night adopted a formula showing that revenue from 
the Valencia Marketplace would be offset by the cost of providing more 
sheriff's deputies and other services for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is necessary because, beginning this year, annexations must be 
shown to be "revenue neutral" -- not increasing or decreasing municipal 
revenues. Annexing the site would allow the city to receive the sales and 
property taxes from the regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Santa Clarita appealed the Los Angeles County Regional 
Planning Commission's approval of the Valencia Marketplace, proposed for land 
west of the Golden State Freeway between McBean Parkway and Pico Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to review Santa 
Clarita's appeal May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Co. project would divert 
customers from small local businesses, add traffic to local roads, destroy 
native oak trees and disrupt riparian habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Without annexation, Santa Clarita officials say, they would need tax revenues 
from the project. The city asked for 80% of the sales tax revenue from the 
shopping center to pay for infrastructure and public services such as roads, 
police protection, parks and libraries. That would amount to more than $800,000 
a year if the center generates sales tax revenue similar to the 
750,000-square-foot Valencia Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Tuesday reiterated their request for the sales tax revenue and 
questioned whether the project meets the county's rules that infrastructure 
keeps up with growth. They also suggested layout changes to preserve more of 
the site's 141 oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 A major council concern Tuesday was the need for more law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frankly extremely concerned about the budget next year for this city," 
said Councilman H. Clyde Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jan Heidt said four sheriff's deputies were needed for the 
Valencia Town Center when it opened in Santa Clarita in September, 1992, and as 
many as eight may be necessary for the Valencia Marketplace.

GARAMENDI AT 'TOWN HALL' MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi will hear tonight how insurance agencies 
responded to Santa Clarita Valley residents in the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi and the Santa Clarita City Council are hosts of a "town hall" 
meeting from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Boys & Girls Club, 24909 Newhall Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has reportedly received dozens of calls from residents, 
especially senior citizens and mobile-home owners, about insurance concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forum will address the personal interests and experiences (and) we hope 
will provide a level of confidence to our citizens," said Assistant City 
Manager Ken Pulsamp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused about $244.4 million in damage in Santa Clarita. 
Private property in Santa Clarita incurred $145 million in damage, with 169 
homes and 41 businesses declared uninhabitable and 560 homes and 50 businesses 
designated as having limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi and members of his staff are expected to address topics including 
dealing with under-evaluated claims, working with out-of-state insurance 
adjusters unfamiliar with Southern California and handling conflicting 
information from insurance carriers.

KELLY HAS A MOMENT TO SAVOR; BASEBALL: ROOKIE OUTFIELDER FROM LOS ALAMITOS 
ENJOYS EARLY SUCCESS WITH BRAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On feeling the charge from the crack of the bat, Mike Kelly raced from the 
batter's box in long, fluid strides, rounded first base gracefully and eased 
into second as he had countless times before. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, the moment was special, worth savoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Braves' rookie left fielder from Los Alamitos High had just 
notched his first major league hit in his second at-bat of the regular season. 
It came in the Braves' 10-8 victory over the Padres on April 7 at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium; a line-drive double down the left-field line in the final 
inning of a wild battle that took 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Kelly stood calmly at the bag as he knew a big leaguer should, 
emotions of pride swirled within him and a wide grin creased his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he knew the moment would be recorded simply as 2B -- Kelly (1) ; another 
in the myriad of numerical listings that all too often blurs the game's 
meaning. But to Kelly, it was an accomplishment born of dedication to and love 
of a sport. An obscure listing of the moment in the following morning's 
newspaper could not diminish its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later in the visitors' clubhouse at Dodger Stadium, the soft-spoken 
Kelly looked like a grade-school kid after getting his first "A." "It was 
awesome," said a still exuberant Kelly, only a few hours before scoring the 
winning run in the Braves' 2-1 victory over the Dodgers on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I made contact, it seemed like the ball and my swing just sort of 
went into slow motion. I remember it so vividly." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly recorded another first in his young career Tuesday night against the 
Florida Marlins. After entering the game as a pinch-runner in the seventh 
inning, Kelly stepped to the plate with two outs and the bases loaded in the 
eighth inning of a 6-6 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 He took control of the pressure situation, smacking a double down the third 
base line for his first three runs batted in. The Braves won, 9-6, on the 
strength of Kelly's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe such success will become commonplace for Kelly -- soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The product of an Atlanta farm system teeming with prospects, Kelly is one of 
several promising rookies to earn a spot on arguably the game's most 
talent-rich team. And while coaches and teammates see promise in his future, 
Kelly is content to watch and learn for as long as it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff is one of many Braves helping the process along. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran All-Star first baseman remembers his trials as a rookie and wants 
to help Kelly avoid similar pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you break in trying to learn the ropes and everything, it's tough," 
McGriff said. "Mike is a talented young guy, but nobody is so good that they 
don't need help. Everybody needs help." 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance has not gone unnoticed -- or unappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has been going real good," Kelly said. "The team hasn't put any 
pressure on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just up here gaining experience as far as the big leagues and big-league 
lifestyle goes. I'm just picking up pointers from C.J. and all the guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The initials are those of Atlanta hitting coach Clarence Jones, also a Kelly 
tutor. Jones is among a large group in the Braves' organization pulling for 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of confidence in Mike," Jones said. "I think he's going to be 
a hell of a ball player. He uses the whole field and he hits the ball in the 
gaps with authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got center-field power . . . he can go out of the ballpark anywhere. 
He's young and strong, and he loves the game." 
</P>
<P>
 To watch Kelly at work is to understand Jones' effusive praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, 23, looks the part of the up-and-coming rookie outfielder. Heck, at 6 
feet 4 and 195 pounds, Kelly could be the prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 His batting-practice sessions do nothing to taint the image, as he laces one 
ball after another with a forceful swing. He charges balls hit to the outfield 
with a presence that belies his experience, and whips pinpoint throws with 
seemingly effortless flicks of his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar displays prompted the Braves to make Kelly their first-round selection 
(second overall) in the 1991 free-agent draft after a brilliant career at 
Arizona State. Baseball executives make difficult choices everyday, but the 
decision to draft Kelly was as easy as trading with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly left the Sun Devils after his junior season, bringing several chunks of 
hardware out of the desert with him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was named freshman of the year by Collegiate Baseball magazine after 
setting a school freshman record for RBIs with 56, and tying the freshman 
record for stolen bases with 16. Kelly hit .300 with 10 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no sophomore jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was selected player of the year by The Sporting News and Baseball 
America after his second season, batting .376 with 21 homers and 82 RBIs. More 
big numbers and, yes, another player-of-the-year award came in his final season 
as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the honor was from the U.S. Baseball Federation. The organization 
found Kelly deserving of its Golden Spikes award, which was understandable 
considering he hit .373 with 15 homers and 56 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a baseball player that's as pretty to watch," Arizona State 
Coach Jim Brock told The Times in 1990. "Everything he does is just beautiful. 
Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly joined the long list of former Sun Devils, including three-time National 
League MVP Barry Bonds, who made swift progress to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .229 with 25 homers and 71 RBIs for the Greenville (S.C.) Braves during 
1992 in double A. His success continued the following season at triple-A 
Richmond, where he hit .243 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs. Moreover, he cut his 
strikeouts from 161 to 109. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly secured his position on the big club in spring training, batting nearly 
.400 and playing steady defense. As with many young power hitters, Kelly still 
swings as often as a guy cutting through the brush in the Amazon. Recently, 
however, he has displayed a more discerning eye at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first game (in San Diego) was a thrill for me just to be out there," 
Kelly said. "To be down on the field with all these guys who you've seen on TV 
your whole life, and now you're on the field with them, it was pretty 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making a dream reality, reaching the major leagues also helped 
Kelly cope with a painful memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben and Betty Kelly were deluged with college scholarship offers for their son 
after he batted .463 and was selected to The Times' All-Orange County team as a 
senior at Los Alamitos in 1988. But the pros did not seem to have a drop of 
interest in Kelly when the major league draft was held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the 24th round that a major league club called. The New York 
Mets chose Kelly and offered him an $80,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused and hurt, Kelly sought answers. He heard from baseball people that 
the pros believed he was intent on going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 But the draft-day snub did not faze Ben and Betty. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what others thought, they knew their son was special. Education is a 
priority in the Kelly household, so Ben and Betty did not mind Mike turning 
down the Mets' offer and spending another few years with baseball and books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a difficult decision at all," Ben said. "The main thing we stressed 
was getting the education." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, things worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset that I didn't get drafted as high as I thought I should," Kelly 
said, "but that just motivated me to go to college and do even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly has promised his parents, who still reside in Los Alamitos, that he will 
return to Arizona State and finish his degree after getting "his feet wet a 
little," Ben said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's continued progress pleases the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He runs better and he throws much better now than he did when we first signed 
him," said Jones, Atlanta's hitting coach. "He has improved in every aspect of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the only hurdle for Kelly is to get in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Kelly platoons in left field with fellow rookies Ryan Klesko and 
Tony Tarasco. He is batting .250 with the three RBIs, and is also third on the 
team with four doubles despite only 20 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Klesko plays against right-handers and Kelly and Tarasco (both 
right-handers) play against left-handers. But Klesko should play the majority 
of the time because there are more right-handed pitchers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see Mike not playing," center fielder Deion Sanders said. "He's got 
a lot of talent. It's just that we're so deep right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing every inning is Kelly's goal, but he understands the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Atlanta Manager) Bobby (Cox) told me early in spring training what my role 
was going to be, which was, basically, platooning in left field, pinch running 
and pinch hitting," Kelly said. "I accepted that a long time ago, so I'm happy 
to contribute anyway I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Klesko, a former standout at Westminster High, and Kelly played youth baseball 
together in the county and were teammates last season in triple A. The 
competition has not affected their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us feel that we should be playing everyday in the major leagues," 
Klesko said of the rookie left-field triumvirate. "But we know it's a situation 
where there is only one spot open and we're going to share the time and that's 
the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Time is on Kelly's side, and few doubt his moment will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is going to be a great player," Sanders said. "If he played daily, 
there's no telling what type of numbers he could put up." Mike Kelly as a Pro

IT'S A NO-HITTER NO ONE EXPECTED; BASEBALL: FOR ONE GAME, SCOTT ERICKSON ERASES 
LAST YEAR'S EMBARRASSMENT, AS TWINS DEFEAT BREWERS, 6-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Erickson was one of the least likely candidates to throw a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he was baseball's most hittable starter in 1993 and was a member of 
the season's weakest staff. 
</P>
<P>
 So, no one was more surprised when he pitched a no-hitter Wednesday night than 
Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't feel that good before the game," he said after pitching 
Minnesota's first no-hitter in 27 years in the Twins' 6-0 victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the field and the first two guys hit bullets and I said, 'This might 
be a long night.' But I got stronger as I went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Walbeck, his catcher, said Erickson was strong, sharp and "awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a self-confident rhythm," Walbeck said. "He threw all his pitches 
for strikes. His fastball was moving better than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 This from the man who gave up the most hits in the majors last year -- and 
lost the most games (19). 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of weird stuff in baseball," Twin Manager Tim Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson (2-3) struck out five and walked four -- including two with two outs 
in the ninth inning. He also hit a batter in throwing the first shutout of the 
season for the Twins, who entered the game with a 7.41 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitchers have been taking a beating," said Kent Hrbek, who had a home 
run. "I wanted it bad for him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second no-hitter of the season, following Atlanta's Kent Mercker on 
April 8 against the Dodgers. Jim Abbott of the New York Yankees had the most 
recent AL no-hitter, against Cleveland last Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson burst onto the baseball scene in 1991, winning 20 games in his first 
full season and helping the Twins win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has struggled. He was 9-24 in his last 40 starts. And in 
addition to leading the majors in hits allowed (266) and losses, he was the 
leader in runs allowed (138). 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's next start also will come against Milwaukee, but he isn't thinking 
about matching Johnny Vander Meer's mark of consecutive no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I can just have a career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not won consecutive decisions since September 1992, when he pitched his 
last complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson entered Wednesday's game with a 7.48 ERA and opponents were batting 
.384 against him. Two weeks ago, he gave up 11 hits and 10 runs in a 
four-inning performance against Seattle. He had a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't changed anything since my last three starts," he said. "I had a 
better slider today, reminiscent of years past." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson walked Bill Spiers in the fourth, hit John Jaha with a pitch in the 
sixth and walked Dave Nilsson in the eighth. He walked Spiers and Turner Ward 
in the ninth before retiring Greg Vaughn on a short fly ball to left to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of hung it, actually," Erickson said of the final pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 17,988 stood and cheered when Erickson, as usual, ran to the 
mound before the ninth inning. As soon as left fielder Alex Cole caught the 
final ball -- narrowly avoiding a collision with shortstop Pat Meares -- 
Erickson was mobbed on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to get the house back," Hrbek said. "We only had (17,988) people and 
they got loud. I was just as nervous as I was in 1987 and 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was attending San Jose City College when the Twins won the '87 World 
Series. But he drew upon his experience from the '91 Series to remain calm in 
Wednesday's ninth inning, especially after the two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to pretend it was the first inning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, a former star at Arizona, did not need any special defensive plays 
to preserve the no-hitter. Even the two first-inning liners, by Alex Diaz and 
Spiers, were right at fielders. He threw 129 pitches, including 71 strikes, and 
15 outs came on grounders as his slider befuddled the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pitched backwards," said Kevin Seitzer, who went 0 for 3. "He threw 
fastballs in breaking-ball situations and breaking balls in fastball 
situations. I hate it. I don't like to lose and I don't like a pitcher doing 
that to my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee had been held hitless only once before in its 25-year history, by 
Kansas City's Steve Busby on June 19, 1974.

WORLD CUP '94 / 50 DAYS AND COUNTING; MORE TICKETS ON SALE; SOCCER: ABOUT 
450,000 TO BE AVAILABLE SUNDAY, INCLUDING 60,000 FOR ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 About 450,000 tickets to individual games in the 1994 World Cup soccer 
tournament will go on sale Sunday morning, including about 60,000 tickets for 
matches at the Rose Bowl, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets, returned to the organizing committee by sponsors and nations that 
failed to qualify, will be available by telephone only and each buyer will be 
limited to a maximum of 10 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the final allotment of tickets being individually sold for the 52-game 
tournament, to be played in nine U.S. cities between June 17 and July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Official announcement of the sale will be made at a news conference in New 
York today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the matches will not be part of the sale. Five of those are sold out: 
Italy-Ireland and Italy-Norway at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.; 
Argentina-Greece and Argentina-Nigeria at Foxboro Stadium in Foxboro, Mass., 
and Belgium-Netherlands at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one semifinal, the third-place match and the final, all at the 
Rose Bowl, as well as the other semifinal at Giants Stadium, are not included 
in the individual-game sale. Tickets for those matches can be purchased only as 
part of multi-game premier packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, the chairman of World Cup USA 1994 and president of the U.S. 
Soccer Federation, said Wednesday he is confident every match will be sold out. 
If so, the sale of between 3.5 and 3.6 million tickets will bring in about $275 
million to the World Cup coffers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles and San Francisco have been selling like crazy," Rothenberg said. 
"Of course, New York (Giants Stadium) would have been hot regardless of which 
teams it drew, and then it ended up with Italy and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York has been a madhouse. There are a couple of games there that I wish 
Giants Stadium had two million seats. I think we'd sell them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said ticket demand has been high at all nine cites.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're struggling anywhere," he said. "My guess is that there'll 
be a half a dozen games around the country that will take probably right up to 
game time to sell out completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can pinpoint a game here and a game there that don't have glamour 
teams or aren't in a city where there's a clear ethnic connection, (but) I 
still remain confident that we will sell them all." 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets, which will go on sale at 7 a.m. PDT on Sunday via World Cup 
Ticketing (1-800-769-1994), could be sold out quickly because not that many are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Bowl, for example, Rothenberg said availability ranged from 10,000 
to 20,000 per game. Seating capacity for the World Cup will be slightly more 
than 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are less than 10,000 (tickets) available for the round of 16," he said 
"There are less than 10,000 available for the U.S.-Colombia game; there are 
somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 for the Colombia-Romania game, and probably 
between 15,000 and 20,000 for the Cameroon-Sweden and the U.S.-Romania games." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of the 720,000 seats available for the eight matches at the Rose 
Bowl have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said he does not believe there will be empty seats at World Cup 
matches, as was the case in Mexico in 1986 and in Italy in 1990, when all the 
tickets were sold but many went unused because they were sold before the 
competing teams were known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working very hard to avoid that," he said. "I'm really hopeful 
that we'll not only have sold all the tickets but that we'll actually have 
people in the seats." 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets that go on sale Sunday include all price ranges ($25 to $475), 
Rothenberg said, adding that he was satisfied organizers had priced the World 
Cup appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely could have charged more all the way along the line," he said. 
"It's an art form, it's not a science. Obviously, we wanted to price the 
tickets high enough so we can pay for the event -- that was our priority -- but 
at the same time not be unfair to the public."

LOSERS CRIED FOUL; BAD GAME IN '90 CUP FINAL MIGHT END UP GOOD FOR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the casual observer, there is not the slightest connection between Olympic 
Stadium in Rome and Soldier Field in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But, to the soccer fan, the two stadiums are inextricably linked. Olympic 
Stadium was the scene of the last World Cup match, on July 8, 1990, and Soldier 
Field will be the scene of the next one, on June 17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years have passed since West Germany defeated Argentina, 1-0, on a hotly 
disputed penalty kick to become world champion for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 And, because the Germans won, they, and not the Argentines, have the honor of 
kicking off the 1994 World Cup against Bolivia in Chicago 50 days from today. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is not one Argentine who will tell you Germany deserves to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were robbed!" was the cry heard from the presidential palace in Buenos 
Aires to the loneliest Gaucho camp on the pampas four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult to believe? Well, consider this remark made after the match in 
reference to the game's Mexican referee, Edgardo Codesal Mendez, a 
gynecologist: 
</P>
<P>
 "He should go back to concentrating on medicine and not carry on causing 
damage to soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker was Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, an avid soccer fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem's good friend, Diego Maradona, a player whom he had presented with an 
ambassadorial passport, went even further in expressing his outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a mafia even in the soccer world," Maradona screamed once his 
post-match tears had dried. "The penalty didn't exist. It was given just to let 
the Germans win." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Germans took it all in stride. While the Argentines were 
whining, they were winning. Defender Andreas Brehme's 86th-minute penalty kick 
had made certain of that, slipping inside the left post, just beyond the dive 
of goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 But did the Argentines have a legitimate gripe? Was Codesal wrong in awarding 
a penalty kick? Was he merely trying to put an end to the worst Cup final in 
history, an atrocious match that sent the crowd of 73,603 wandering off into 
the Rome night wondering about the future of the sport? 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, those questions still are being debated. But no one argues 
the fact that -- no matter how bad -- the 1990 match succeeded in bringing 
change to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, world soccer's governing body, is notoriously slow to accept change, but 
the worldwide outcry after the Italia '90 tournament, and particularly the 
final, forced it to act. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the 1994 World Cup promises to provide a more wide-open, 
free-flowing, adventurous brand of soccer. Rules have been modified to favor 
attacking players over defenders; the points system has been changed to reward 
victories more than before. 
</P>
<P>
 And, thanks to an abundance of top-flight strikers and the fact that most of 
the big-name defenders are past their prime, goals should, in theory, be 
plentiful this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nagging thought that a team could advance to the final by playing the 
same negative brand of soccer practiced by Argentina in 1990 persists. 
</P>
<P>
 The first World Cup to be played in the United States is supposed to put a 
smile back on the face of the sport. The image left after 1990 was a pronounced 
scowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The final was "a totally unsatisfactory match, which was an affront to the 
game and an appalling advertisement for the world championship," wrote British 
author Jack Rollin. "It epitomized much of what had been an undistinguished 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the match today, it is difficult to find fault with Rollin's 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The final was not five minutes old when Codesal reached into his pocket for 
the first yellow card, cautioning Argentine striker Gustavo Dezotti for 
dissent. That's the polite way of saying Dezotti, obviously wound tighter than 
a spring, was yelling who knows what at the referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the final whistle, Dezotti made a little more World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany attacked relentlessly throughout the first half but was unable to 
finish its moves with any precision. Time and again chances were created, but 
each time the last, decisive pass was intercepted or the shot flew wide or high 
of its target or was smothered by Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, playing without four starters who had been suspended for 
infractions in earlier matches, defended resolutely and, as the game wore on, 
increasingly crudely. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the second half, Argentine Coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo, who 
had led his country to its 1986 World Cup triumph -- a 3-2 victory over West 
Germany in a splendid final played before 114,000 fans at Azteca Stadium in 
Mexico City -- made a fateful substitution. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent on defender Pedro Monzon in place of veteran Oscar Ruggeri, who was 
nursing an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 20 minutes, Monzon became the first player in World Cup history to be 
tossed out of a championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred in the 64th minute after Monzon fouled German striker Jurgen 
Klinsmann, who was breaking free down the right flank. 
</P>
<P>
 The foul was bad -- Monzon driving his spikes into Klinsmann's shin in a crude 
tackle -- but it is debatable whether it was a red card offense. A warning 
seemed called for instead. Klinsmann's spectacular fall had a touch of the 
theatrical about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced to 10 men, the Argentines were trying desperately to survive the final 
half hour in the hope of sending the game to penalty kicks, where they might 
have a chance to steal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 84th minute, however, an excellent pass by German captain Lothar 
Matthaus found striker Rudi Voller in the penalty area with only defender 
Roberto Sensini and Goycochea to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensini stuck out his leg, ostensibly to rob Voller of the ball. Voller 
tumbled. Codesal blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty kick spot. 
</P>
<P>
 With a mere half-dozen minutes remaining, Germany had been awarded an almost 
certain goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentines were dumbfounded and protested long and loud. Codesal was not 
about to change the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's only hope lay in Goycochea, whose brilliant penalty-saving 
exploits had carried the South Americans to victory over Yugoslavia in the 
quarterfinals and Italy in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saving penalties has very little to do with luck, more to do with intuition," 
he later told London's World Soccer magazine. "A goalkeeper can do one of three 
things: dive left, dive right or stay in place. Often, you look into the eyes 
of the penalty taker to try to find a clue. That's what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brehme stepped up to take the vital kick. The fans held their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Goycochea guessed correctly, flinging himself to his right and reached as far 
as he could, but Brehme's shot was perfectly placed and snuck in just inside 
the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany 1, Argentina 0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have taken the kick," Matthaus said later, "but I had problems with 
an ankle. You cannot gamble on something as vitally important to the nation as 
the World Cup final . . . and I knew Andy would not let us down." 
</P>
<P>
 There was time for more drama. 
</P>
<P>
 With the seconds ticking away, German defender Jurgen Kohler was engaging in a 
bit of time-wasting down at his end of the field when Dezotti interceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to get the ball away from Kohler, Dezotti resorted to a stranglehold on 
the German's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Codesal's reaction was immediate: red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two Argentines had been tossed out and, on top of the penalty kick, it 
was all too much to bear. The Argentines surrounded the referee, pushing and 
shoving and shouting. Maradona, who had been ineffective throughout the game, 
led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Codesal could have ejected even more players, but he resisted, content to give 
a yellow card to Maradona, bringing Argentina's total for the tournament to 22 
yellows and three reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was over. The final whistle brought the Argentine bench to its 
feet and onto the field. Codesal had to be protected. By the next afternoon, he 
was on his way home and, before long, he announced that he would never referee 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Up in the VIP section of the stands, Argentine dignitaries fumed. Down on the 
field, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl cavorted with his victorious countrymen. 
It was left to German Coach Franz Beckenbauer to summarize the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no doubts whatsoever who was going to win," he said. "For 90 
minutes we attacked Argentina and there was no feeling of any danger that a 
goal would be scored against us. As I saw it, we outplayed them from beginning 
to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as a player in 1974 and became only the 
second man in history to also win it as a coach -- Brazil's Marion Zagalo was 
the first -- said the penalty "was not the key to the game because in any case 
we would have scored, even if it had taken overtime.. . . 1-0 by a penalty 
doesn't give a fair idea of this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have won, 3-0. I don't remember a single chance Argentina had to 
score a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad Argentina didn't participate in the game. They tried to destroy 
the game. They played a non-game. They were too weak to stand up to us. Still, 
it's not up to us to choose our opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilardo declined to comment about the penalty or the referee, saying only: "Of 
course we are very disappointed, but we also have to be realistic. Going into a 
match such as this, against a team such as West Germany, with four players 
suspended and others not really fit, was too big a burden for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to others to write what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first World Cup final to be resolved by a single goal and it was 
also the worst final in memory," Ian Morrison wrote in his history of the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game did little for football but there was one consolation: Had the 
Argentines lifted the World Cup -- with two wins and five goals in their seven 
matches -- it would have been a catastrophe for the game. At least their awful 
approach to Italia '90 had gone unrewarded." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the World Cup is back. What ended in the Olympic Stadium in Rome four 
years ago begins anew at Soldier Field in Chicago 50 days from now.

A NEW BALLGAME IN NBA; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER THREE-YEAR BULLS RUN, THE RACE FOR 
NEXT CHAMPION IS WIDE OPEN AS PLAYOFFS BEGIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to find this season's favorite in the NBA playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget it. There isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics? 
</P>
<P>
 Only in their minds. Seattle fans booed announcer Bill Walton in his last 
appearance and laid a 150-101 pounding on the Clippers, incensed he said the 
SuperSonics could lose to anyone, but that is true of every team. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperSonic guard Gary Payton says it's "our title to take," but opponents 
follow scouting reports in the playoffs and will pack the lane, daring Payton 
and Kendall Gill to make a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets? 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon's effectiveness can be cut by a double-team, leaving Vernon 
Maxwell and his teammates open for three-point shots. And they will take them 
-- they set a record for three-point shots attempted and made in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Antonio Spurs? 
</P>
<P>
 Not unless David Robinson gets 71 every game. 
</P>
<P>
 The East? 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks tried to fade but couldn't. The Chicago Bulls faltered 
against the weak Celtics with the best record in the conference theirs for the 
taking. The New York Knicks have been on Pat Riley's couch so long, they're 
cross-eyed. The Orlando Magic is young.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a new, level day. With Michael Jordan, the Bulls went 15-2, 15-7 and 15-4 
in the last three postseasons, but he's gone and there's no other giant on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the matchups: WESTERN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Seattle SuperSonics vs. No. 8 Denver Nuggets -- The SuperSonics had the 
best record, the best home and away records and their nine-points-a-game 
differential was 33% better than the No. 2 Knicks. They wouldn't figure to have 
trouble with Denver's young players, most of whom have never played in the 
postseason, but they split the season series, 2-2. Seattle Coach George Karl 
says 7-2 Dikembe Mutombo plays well against them and no wonder: The Sonics are 
cocky, take-it-to-the-hoop guys and Mutombo, though not yet a full peer to the 
greats as he imagines, can block shots. Look for Karl to start complaining 
about Dikembe's elbows during warm-ups for Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Houston Rockets vs. No. 7 Portland Trail Blazers -- The aging Trail 
Blazers made the Western finals three consecutive years, but were ousted in 
last spring's first round. Center Chris Dudley, who sat out most the season 
with a broken ankle returns. The Rockets won the season series, 4-0.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Phoenix Suns vs. No. 6 Golden State Warriors -- The Suns began a 
season-ending seven-game victory streak on April 12. The Warriors went 8-2 and 
averaged 115 points with Don Nelson's "Point Spree" lineup, with no center and 
four players, including forwards Chris Webber and Billy Owens, sharing point 
guard with Latrell Sprewell. Nelson is most dangerous when no one expects 
anything from him, but the Suns have won 20 of the last 21 against the Warriors 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 San Antonio Spurs vs. No. 5 Utah Jazz -- David Robinson carried the San 
Antonio offense as far as he could, but after a 40-16 start, they finished 
15-11. Robinson plays on the wing, where centers can't match his quickness, but 
the Jazz used forward Karl Malone on him and won the season series, 5-0. 
EASTERN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Atlanta Hawks vs. No. 8 Miami Heat -- The Hawks leveled off late in 
their surprising season but are a clear favorite over the Heat, which lost 12 
of its last 16. Rony Seikaly is unhappy at Coach Kevin Loughery for bringing 
him back slowly from an injury. Glen Rice wants more screens set for him. 
Managing partner Lew Schaffel says postseason is the "perfect laboratory" to 
see if Loughery should be re-hired. The Heat has been in the playoffs once 
before and lost all three games. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 New York Knicks vs. No. 7 New Jersey Nets -- After the Nets won the 
season series, 4-1, rarely noticed Jayson Williams "guaranteed" they would do 
it again if they met in the playoffs. The Nets are younger, stronger and 
deeper, but the Knicks have the mystique, the brains and, thanks to Riley, the 
emotional scars. He suspended Anthony Mason for complaining to reporters about 
playing time. If the Knicks can make an occasional jumper, Riley will think of 
something while the Nets are still telling people about the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Chicago Bulls vs. No. 6 Cleveland Cavaliers -- The Cavaliers without 
Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance amount to a first-round bye. Besides, they know 
the drill, having been eliminated by the Bulls in four postseasons: 1988, 1989, 
1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Orlando Magic vs. No. 5 Indiana Pacers -- Shaquille O'Neal, Anfernee 
Hardaway and Co. won 50 games and are eager in their playoff debut. But Larry 
Brown's faceless Pacers had the best finish in the East at 31-12. View From the 
Top 
</P>

look at how the team with the best regular-season record has fared in the last 
10 years. 04,09,24,08,34 Year Team Record Result 1993-94 Seattle 63-19 1992-93

AN EZQ OPENER AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; HORSE RACING: THE NEW BET MAKES ITS DEBUT AS 
THE SPRING-SUMMER SEASON COMMENCES BEFORE 14,559. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Park's spring-summer season opened Wednesday with the introduction 
of the EZQ, a rare bet at American tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The EZQ, a triple quinella of sorts, intrigued R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park's 
board chairman, when he saw the Parisian version of the bet at the Arc de 
Triomphe last fall. Keeneland used a form of the EZQ wager for three weeks, 
then decided it wasn't helping business much and dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans collect on EZQ bets when their choices finish first and second, first and 
third or second and third, in any order. The good news for some EZQ players 
Wednesday, when there was an on-track crowd of 14,559, was that longshots ran 
second and third in the last race, for a payoff of $527.60. But the median 
payoff for EZQ betting on eight races was only $7.60. Sixteen of the 24 EZQ 
payoffs were $9.40 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the purposes of the EZQ is to give racing newcomers a better chance. 
"It's a simple bet that will allow new players to experience the best part of 
our sport -- winning," said Rick Baedeker, Hollywood Park vice president of 
marketing and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a trial period, Las Vegas race books have decided the EZQ isn't 
worth offering. Many of the Nevada books gave their customers in-house 
quinellas for the Hollywood Park opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular quinella, which Hollywood Park offered for every race at last 
year's fall meeting, has been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial reaction to the EZQ has been positive," Hubbard said. "We'll wait 
and see how it does and go from there. Like anything else we try, if it's not 
working, we won't continue it." 
</P>
<P>
 For eight races at Hollywood last fall, the quinella handle was 3.7% of the 
overall betting. For eight races Wednesday, the EZQ betting amounted to 2.7% of 
the handle. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no EZQ for the feature race, because three scratches resulted in a 
four-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita, which ended its season Monday, also struggled to get full fields 
for its races, and another race at Hollywood Park on Wednesday drew only five 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the number of applications for stall space, Hubbard is optimistic 
about running full fields this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time since I've been involved, we have a fairly major shortage 
of stalls," he said. "I was jumped about a dozen times today by trainers who 
were hot because they didn't get the number of stalls they wanted. So I think 
that speaks good for the meet as we go on. Roughly, we have about 1,900 to 
2,000 stalls, and as I understand it, we have enough people on the waiting list 
to fill another 200 or 300 stalls." 
</P>
<P>
 Prospector's Ghost, who won the $44,000 feature, has been filling a stall at 
Santa Anita. After being shipped cross-town Wednesday, the 4-year-old gelding 
was ridden to victory by Laffit Pincay for trainer Jim Buss, who also saddled 
another winner earlier on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron rode one winner Wednesday, giving him an unofficial total of 
5,965 in his run toward the 6,000 mark. Only 10 jockeys have reached the 6,000 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Flyin' J. Bryan has a new trainer. Joseph Fenley, the owner of the speedy 
3-year-old, has moved Flyin' J. Bryan and three other horses from Doug 
Peterson's barn to Neil Drysdale's. "I went out of my way to do everything to 
the best of my ability," Peterson said. "I'm sorry it didn't work out. This 
kind of thing happens in racing, and of course I'm sorry to lose the horses. 
But I think it's more important to keep owners in the game, even if it's with 
another trainer." Flyin' J. Bryan, who won the San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes 
at Santa Anita, was the early leader before finishing last in the Santa Anita 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, the French import who won the Breeders' Cup Classic when Jerry 
Bailey rode him for the first time, will have a new jockey, Eddie Delahoussaye, 
for the John Henry Handicap at Hollywood Park on Sunday. Arcangues, scheduled 
to make his first start in almost five months, has been assigned high weight of 
122 pounds. Other probables for the 1 1/8-mile grass race are Misil, Earl of 
Barking, Marshaallah, Kingdom Found and Tinners Way. The Breeders' Cup was 
Arcangues' first start on dirt after 15 grass races in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Truce, bothered by a cracked hoof that prevented her from being sent 
to Oaklawn Park for the Apple Blossom Handicap, will be favored in the first 
stake of the Hollywood Park season, the $100,000 A Gleam Handicap Friday night. 
Golden Klair, Tour, Minidar, Desert Stormer and Cargo will also run in the 
seven-furlong stake, with Southern Truce the high weight at 120 pounds. . . . 
Jockey Pat Valenzuela was off Wednesday, reporting to the stewards that he had 
a strained back.

<P>
 Bertrando, expected to resume racing when the breeding season ends, has gotten 
35 mares in foal, co-owner Eddie Nahem said. . . . Hollywood Wildcat, last 
year's champion 3-year-old filly whose 1994 campaign has been compromised by a 
cough, is expected to run in the Hawthorne Handicap on May 29. Hollywood 
Wildcat hasn't run since finishing third in the La Canada Stakes at Santa Anita 
on Feb. 5.

CLIPPERS CUT BACK ON THEIR OFFER TO WILKINS; PRO BASKETBALL: TWO-YEAR, 
$8-MILLION DEAL BECAME THREE YEARS AT $7.5 MILLION. AGENT RIPS TEAM EXECUTIVE'S 
NEGOTIATING APPROACH. 
</P>

<P>
 In an apparent negotiating ploy, the Clippers last week withdrew an 
$8-million, two-year contract offer to forward Dominique Wilkins after Wilkins' 
agent complained that a Clipper executive tried to deal with the player 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers gave Wilkins 10 days to accept a $7.5-million, three-year deal 
with an $800,000 annual bonus for making the playoffs. The deal, which was 
rejected, would have been $1 million per season less than Wilkins' $3.5 million 
salary this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kauffman, the agent, said Andy Roeser, Clipper executive vice president, 
had acted unprofessionally in trying to negotiate with Wilkins directly during 
a meeting before the new offer. Wilkins declined the overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm astonished," Kauffman said. "I've never had it happen in 20 years. I told 
Andy how upset I was and I gave him a chance to rectify the situation and he 
did not do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins is reportedly seeking a $21-million, three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately faxed them back and said we didn't need the other nine days," 
Kauffman said of the second offer. "It was absolutely foolish what they sent 
us. I don't know what they felt it was going to accomplish other than to make 
Dominique Wilkins extremely mad. You're not buying a piece of real estate, 
you're trying to sign a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said: "We will conduct our business privately and 
we will not negotiate in the newspapers. That's for agents to do." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clippers fail to sign the NBA's fourth-leading scorer, acquired from 
the Atlanta Hawks for Danny Manning on Feb. 24, they will wind up with only a 
1994 first-round draft pick for Manning, their all-time leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who left for Switzerland on Tuesday, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, last week he indicated it was unlikely he will return to the 
Clippers. He becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances right now are slim and I'll leave it at that," Wilkins said. "I'd 
love to be back, but things haven't happened that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be here. I love L.A., I love the city. But if it's not for me to 
be here, I won't be here and it doesn't look that way right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not asking for the world. I'm just asking for what's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Mark Jackson has asked to be traded and there is speculation the 
Clippers will deal him to Indiana for former Bruin Pooh Richardson. . . . The 
NBA Board of Governors has approved the Clippers' plan to play one exhibition 
and six regular-season games at The Pond of Anaheim next season.

RIPKEN BRINGS IT ON EVEN ON AN OFF DAY; ORIOLES: HE PRODUCES A HOMER, A DOUBLE, 
TWO SINGLES, FIVE RBIS AND THREE RUNS SCORED IN 13-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal Ripken took a day off Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell it to the Angels, who suffered greatly simply because the Baltimore 
Oriole shortstop started his 1,917th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, 213 games shy of Lou Gehrig's major league record, didn't dismantle 
the Angels alone in a 13-1 victory before 20,569 soaked fans at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodness knows he had help. 
</P>
<P>
 But his numbers were a rotisserie-league player's dream come true: one home 
run, one double, two singles, five runs batted in, three runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 A good week packed into one night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of a 19-hit, five-homer, 11 extra-base hit night for the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Anderson had two hits, Jeffrey Hammonds had three, Rafael Palmeiro had 
three, and Chris Hoiles two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 And on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 No one spanked the ball quite like Ripken, though. 
</P>
<P>
 He even overshadowed Oriole starter Ben McDonald, who won his fifth 
consecutive start. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that was because it was such an untidy affair, but McDonald wasn't about 
to throw it back. He also was perfectly willing to lean on the hitting by 
Ripken and Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Without it, he wouldn't have had such an easy night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like that all year," McDonald said. "It's the reason I'm 5-0." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Anderson, the former UC Irvine standout, got all this started on Tuesday 
against Oakland, homering twice in a 10-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, who went hitless to snap a nine-game hitting streak Tuesday, picked up 
where Anderson left off. 
</P>
<P>
 He singled in the first, singled in the sixth, hit a three-run homer, his 
first of the season, in the seventh and double in the eighth, raising his 
average to .346. 
</P>
<P>
 His homer, which moved him within two of 300, barely cleared the short fence 
near the left-field foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Eddie Murray, with 333, and Boog Powell (303) are ahead of Ripken on the 
Orioles' all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's game marked the 10th in which Ripken has had two or more hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two days we started swinging the bat," Manager Johnny Oates said. 
"We had a couple of guys who were struggling and now they're starting to come 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken hasn't been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 During his recent nine-game hitting streak, he went 14 for 36 and raised his 
average from .270 to .329. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ripken: "Tonight everything kind of fell into place."

WIRE TO WIRE?; HOLY BULL SETS UP AS THE NEXT HORSE TO WIN DERBY THIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bold Forbes carried his speed 1 1/4 miles to win the Kentucky Derby in 1976, 
and since then only Spend A Buck in 1985 and the filly Winning Colors in 1988 
have won the race in wire-to-wire fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull will probably try to become the next horse to wire the Derby field, 
and while rival trainers are saying he won't have the easy time he has enjoyed 
in recent races, there won't be many volunteers to get in his way at Churchill 
Downs a week from Saturday. Trainers frequently talk about killing the speed in 
the Derby, but by the time they get to the paddock for pre-race jockey 
instructions, it's often a bullet they don't want to bite. When more than one 
horse helps set breakneck early fractions, the only beneficiaries are horses 
with off-the-pace styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, opponents of Spend A Buck expected Eternal Prince, the winner of the 
Wood Memorial, to also be running on the front end. But Eternal Prince broke in 
a tangle -- George Steinbrenner, one of his owners, suggested later that the 
gate crew didn't handle the colt properly -- and was never in contention. Spend 
A Buck, setting some of the fastest fractions in Derby history, was six lengths 
ahead after a half-mile and the race was over. He won by 5 3/4 lengths, with 
his time of 2:00 1/5 being the third fastest, behind Secretariat's 1:59 2/5 in 
1973 and Northern Dancer's 2:00 in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Winning Colors came to Louisville with the well-deserved 
reputation of being a run-off filly. She had wired the field in the Santa Anita 
Oaks, winning by eight lengths. About a month later, trainer Wayne Lukas sent 
her against colts and she won the Santa Anita Derby by 7 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 All week at Churchill Downs, trainers talked about putting pressure on Winning 
Colors early in the race, but by Derby day, no one wanted the gauntlet. Under 
no pressure, Lukas' filly ran the first half-mile in :46 4/5, not a fast time 
by Derby standards, and she and jockey Gary Stevens survived a mad dash by 
Forty Niner through the stretch to win by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, while committed to Santa Anita Derby winner Brocco in this year's 
Derby, won the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct with Irgun, a speedy horse who might 
have been a candidate to put some heat on Holy Bull. But on Tuesday, Irgun was 
scratched from the Derby because of an abscessed right front hoof. 
</P>
<P>
 With Irgun out, Jerry Bailey has picked up the mount on Blumin Affair, the 
second-place finisher under Eddie Delahoussaye in the Arkansas Derby. 
Delahoussaye's Derby mount is Strodes Creek. Bailey, winner of the Derby last 
year with Sea Hero, was second in the Wood with Go For Gin and had accepted the 
mount on Irgun after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron will ride Go For Gin. "I'll just be happy if we have a rider 
who'll pay attention to instructions," said Joe Cornacchia, one of Go For Gin's 
owners and a partner in 1991 Derby winner Strike The Gold. "Bailey was supposed 
to run with Irgun early in the Wood, but he still sat off the pace. We wanted 
to use the Wood as an experiment, to see if our horse could go early. But 
Bailey wasted the opportunity. Now we're going into the Derby still not 
knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont, another fast horse who might have challenged Holy Bull early, ran 
poorly in last Sunday's Lexington Stakes at Keeneland, and trainer Neil Howard 
won't run him in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull has rebounded nicely from his 3 1/2-length Blue Grass victory, 
coming a month after a breezing in the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "That horse shows poise just warming up," Howard said. "He just takes your 
breath away." 
</P>
<P>
 After working five furlongs Sunday at Keeneland, trainer Jimmy Croll said Holy 
Bull would remain at the Lexington, Ky., track before being taken by van the 70 
miles to Churchill Downs on Saturday. His next scheduled work is Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had two concerns in the Blue Grass," Croll said. "When a horse goes 
into the gate, all kinds of things go through your mind, because a lot of races 
are won at the gate. But he broke perfectly. In fact, he's broke the best he's 
ever broke in the last two races. Then I was concerned when Valiant Nature came 
to us at the quarter pole. But my horse strided out and I knew we were in good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Holy Bull's overpowering effort, the second, third and fourth 
finishers in the Blue Grass -- Valiant Nature, Mahogany Hall and Kandaly -- are 
headed for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahogany Hall, bred by Del Mar horseman Shelly Meredith, improved off his 
sixth-place finish in the Jim Beam Stakes. His owner, Cincinnati businessman 
Robert Hoeweler, bought the Woodman colt for $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeweler will be overreaching at Churchill Downs, but so will several of the 
estimated 15 starters in the year of the Holy Bull. These are the probables: 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, Brocco, Tabasco Cat, Soul Of The Matter, Strodes Creek, Valiant 
Nature, Go For Gin, Blumin Affair, Powis Castle, Kandaly, Southern Rhythm, 
Meadow Flight, Smilin Singin Sam, Mahogany Hall and Ulises. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahogany Hall has been beaten by more than 25 lengths in his last two starts, 
but Hoeweler saw something in the Blue Grass that justifies a trip to Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the race, my horse stood there looking at the cameras," Hoeweler said. 
"It was like he was saying, 'Do you want me to do some more?' If he could ever 
figure out how to run the first half of the race, we'd have a monster on our 
hands."

AGOURA HIGH GOT ITS MAN ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Wegher, new football coach at Agoura High, definitely knows the lay of 
the land around these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his first football practice was run on the Agoura field back in 1974, 
when he was a youngster playing Pop Warner ball.He lives in a condominium 
across the street from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my way around pretty well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegher, an assistant coach at Agoura for the last three seasons, replaces 
Frank Greminger, who stepped down after 25 years. Greminger compiled a 154-99-3 
record, leading the Chargers to five Frontier League championships and the 
Southern Section's Desert-Mountain Conference title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegher, 30, won't need a road map to find the teams on the Chargers' league 
schedule. Wegher played against Agoura as a quarterback at Marmonte League 
rival Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegher graduated from Westlake in 1982 and played at Cal State Northridge from 
1982-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his relative youth, Wegher has served as an assistant at either 
Westlake or Agoura since 1987. He was junior varsity head coach at Westlake in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agoura position is his first head coaching job at the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job will probably put some wrinkles on me," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura finished 4-6 last season and in a three-way tie for third in league 
play at 3-4.

NORTHRIDGE REMAINS KEEN ON BIG WEST MEMBERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a continuing game of musical chairs within college athletics, Cal State 
Northridge seems closer than ever to finding a seat in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the recent defections of Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State to 
the Western Athletic Conference, Big West athletic directors and college 
presidents will meet Sunday in Los Angeles to consider a new direction, a 
conference official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the probable topics of conversation: expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure expansion is something that will be talked about," said Jody 
McRoberts, an assistant Big West Conference commissioner. "The problem is we 
don't know what people are thinking. Everyone has different agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, the agenda is clear. Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said the 
school has attempted to become a Big West member on an annual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had an official moratorium on expansion the last two years; that's 
been their position," Hiegert said. "But they've been very open with us. They 
know our strengths. As soon as they can define what the Big West is and where 
the conference is going, they can move from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Conference officials are unlikely to take immediate action. Instead, they 
probably will consider the pros and cons of several scenarios, McRoberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert met informally with Rob Halvaks, another Big West assistant 
commissioner, Tuesday while both attended the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation men's volleyball tournament at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Halvaks was unavailable for comment Wednesday, but Hiegert said "there seems 
to be a fair amount of controversy between the non-football-playing members (of 
the conference) and the I-A football programs left." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West has eight member schools, but half of them -- UC Santa Barbara, 
UC Irvine, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton -- do not play football. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada, New Mexico State, Utah State and Pacific are conference members with 
NCAA Division I-A football teams. Affiliate members of the conference last 
season for football only were Arkansas State, Southwest Louisiana, Northern 
Illinois and Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Northridge's teams are scattered throughout the Western Athletic, 
American West and Pacific Coast conferences and the MPSF. Others compete as 
independents. Northridge's football team plays at the NCAA Division I-AA level 
in the American West and finances fewer than half the scholarships of schools 
in the Big West. However, Northridge's broad athletics program otherwise fits 
well within the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picking up our athletic program could save them a lot of money in travel and 
other expenses," Hiegert said. "It makes a lot of sense for us. We think it 
makes a lot of sense for everybody, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has not been invited to Sunday's discussions.

STEUSSIE FITS THE MINNESOTA MOLD; PRO FOOTBALL: BUNYANESQUE NO. 1 DRAFT CHOICE 
FROM AGOURA HIGH AND CAL HAS THE LOOK OF A VIKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Steussie was dazed when he returned to his Berkeley apartment Tuesday 
night. He had just returned from a whirlwind two days in Minneapolis, where he 
faced instant fame and impending wealth after being selected in the first round 
of the NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6, 305-pound All-American tackle felt just like all those Pacific 
10 Conference pass rushers he had stonewalled for 47 Saturdays: wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head's spinning," he said. "It's still kind of a shock to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Several NFL teams on Sunday jockeyed for position to draft Steussie, once a 
virtually overlooked defensive lineman at Agoura High, before the Vikings 
grabbed him with the 19th pick. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, tells him that he 
will be wealthy. Steinberg also mentioned that quarterback Warren Moon, who 
came to the Vikings in a trade from Houston two weeks ago, is excited to be his 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is what really flattens Steussie like a pancake block: Checking in 
for his flight home Tuesday, an airline attendant asked him for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I had a chance to hand my ticket to the lady at the counter, she asked 
me for it," he said. "As an offensive lineman, you don't get much face 
recognition. But the people in the Twin Cities already know who I am. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, this is something I've never experienced before." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's all happening fast. He already has seen the Viking playbook. 
Mini-camp starts next week. He's been fitted for his uniform and has a new 
number: 73. He wore 75 at California, where he started a school-record 47 
consecutive games after redshirting as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good number, a big number," Steussie said. "The ones and twos make you 
look skinnier. The threes and fives make you look bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie would look big in any jersey. He bench-presses 500 pounds and squats 
665. His weight-lifting display at the NFL Combine in March brought a broad 
smile to the face of Minnesota Coach Dennis Green. Now Steussie is the hulking 
giant who could anchor the right side of the Viking offensive line as early as 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd Steussie is a great, big, strong, right offensive tackle," Green said. 
"He fits our idea of a physical player, comes off the ball hard, very physical 
run blocker, loves the weight room, and one we think will play for us for a 
long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, agent to famous quarterbacks (Joe Montana, Troy Aikman, Moon), 
represents Steussie and said, "Even with the salary cap, Todd will be a wealthy 
young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie, having digested all this, arrived home, plopped in a chair and 
glanced at his telephone answering machine. The little red light was blinking 
nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got about 20 messages here," he said. "I haven't been able to return 
many phone calls. I haven't got the chance to talk to my parents since I got 
drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie is a man in demand. Green Bay wanted him. So did Detroit, San 
Francisco and Miami. "Nineteenth is exactly the place we had him projected," 
Steinberg said. "Green Bay told him if he was available on the 20th pick, they 
would take him. Detroit called during the draft and said, 'If he gets to 21, 
get ready. We're taking him.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out later that San Francisco was trying to trade up to get him. 
(49er General Manager) Carmen Policy told me they were aggressively trying to 
move up. They really, really loved Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was certain he was going somewhere in the Black and Blue division. I 
told Todd before the draft to get his long johns ready." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers, who fared best among the 28 teams according to many draft 
experts, could have taken Steussie with the seventh pick, which they used to 
get Notre Dame defensive tackle Bryant Young. The Rams could have claimed 
Steussie with the 15th choice but wanted Auburn tackle Wayne Gandy instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie was interested in the 49ers and the Rams -- his friends and family 
would have been season-ticket holders at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to a team that's winning," he said. "The 49ers have two All-Pro 
tackles. . . . The position is open at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Green has known Steussie since his days as coach at Stanford. But the wheels 
really began to turn one week before the draft when he met Steinberg and Moon, 
who signed a as a free agent with the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Green) told me during lunch how much he liked Todd," Steinberg said. "Warren 
was sitting there at the table and he was excited. Warren's going to call Todd 
and they're going to get to know each other. He's excited about the concept of 
Steussie." 
</P>
<P>
 That concept overwhelms Steussie. "He's been a pro for 17 years, I think," 
Steussie said. "And for him to say that he wants me to block for him . . . 
that's an honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, getting drafted wasn't close to being in my imagination. I 
was just really happy for the chance to play college football." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Greminger, Steussie's coach at Agoura, also had doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he had the temperament to go that far," Greminger said. "But 
after his sophomore year I saw he had a chance because of his size, his agility 
and the fact he was stopping guys from teams like Miami." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie went to Cal at 6-5, 245 pounds and began his transformation when he 
made the Bear weight room his home away from home. He gravitated to the senior 
linemen on the 1989 team, absorbing their work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears were 30-17-1 and played in three bowl games during Steussie's four 
seasons. He was named first-team Kodak All-American and was on the Associated 
Press' second team last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 While Steussie was changing, so was the tackle position in the NFL. Steinberg 
said tackles as well as quarterbacks, pass rushers and defensive backs have 
become key positions in the modern passing game. That and the advent of free 
agency are making tackles rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie is more concerned with making a sudden impact for a team that 
finished 9-7 and qualified for the playoffs last season.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year layoff, Huntington Beach's John (The Fighting Lifeguard) Armijo 
is returning to the ring in tonight's 10-round main event at the Irvine 
Marriott Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo's last fight, in May, 1993, was a loss to super-welterweight Kenny 
Lopez in a 12-round decision.Since then, Armijo (14-7 with six knockouts) has 
dropped 11 pounds, and he will fight Chuck Goossen of North Hollywood at 143 
pounds, three pounds over the lightweight limit. Goossen, a cousin of promoter 
Dan Goossen, is 6-1 with five knockouts and is 10 years younger than Armijo, 
32. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-fight undercard features middleweight Rodney Toney (11-0 with five 
knockouts) of Campo against Irvine's Luis Mejia (6-5) in a six-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
 In another undercard fight, Los Angeles junior lightweight Leonard Fiqueirof 
is taking on San Diego's Bryan Cimicata, who is making his pro debut. Tickets 
for the 7:30 p.m. show are priced at $25, $30 and $35 and can be purchased at 
the ballroom. DAVE McKIBBEN

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: AMAZED RACERS RECALL NIXON'S CAR KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Automobile racing lost a friend and fan when former President Richard Nixon 
died last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, the President invited 125 representatives from the racing industry -- 
drivers, crew chiefs, promoters, car owners, sponsors and officials -- to a 
White House reception. The idea, he said, stemmed from having flown over 
Ontario Motor Speedway on its opening day a year earlier and being impressed by 
seeing the more than 125,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "You men are like politicians -- the tougher the competition, the faster you 
run," he told the group. "You have the courage and determination to press on, 
to keep improving, to find new methods of going faster and safer." 
</P>
<P>
 The late J.C. Agajanian introduced each of the 125 to Nixon and the President 
responded with comments pertinent to each individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe what he knew about what I had done," Richard Petty said at 
the time. "He's one smart cat, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
 Four racing machines, an Indy car, NASCAR stock car, top fuel dragster and 
Can-Am sports car, were lined up in front of the White House steps. Nixon 
inspected each one, asking questions about their capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised how much he seemed to know about our cars," Mario Andretti 
said. "He asked a lot of sharp questions, about the tires and horsepower and 
things like that. He was really impressed when we warmed up my (Indy) car at 
5,500 r.p.m. He knew that max on a passenger car is 3,000 or 3,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Les Richter, then president of Riverside International Raceway, also expressed 
surprise at Nixon's knowledge of the Riverside track and its ownership. Others 
at the reception included Dan Gurney, Parnelli Jones, Andy Granatelli, Al and 
Bobby Unser, Don Garlits and Jackie Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never forgot that day," Garlits said recently. "It meant a lot to me. I 
think it helped influence me in what I'm doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Garlits announced he would seek a seat as a Republican congressman 
from Florida's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Twenty-four years ago, Fred Belair produced the first El Trial de Espana in 
Orange County to raise money for the U.S. observed trials team to compete in 
the Trial des Nations -- the Olympics of trials motorcycle competition. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first recipients was Bernie Schreiber of La Crescenta, who became 
the United States' only world trials champion in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's El Trial de Espana will be held Sunday at Perris Raceway with 
money still going to finance the U.S. team at the Trial des Nations in Andorra 
in September. Martin Belair, the event founder's son and a former nationally 
ranked trials rider, will manage the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of speed, riders strive for balance, poise and control. Competitors 
are required to ride over extremely rough sections of terrain without putting 
their feet on the ground to aid balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a foot dabs the ground, or a rider goes outside the boundary line, 
it counts against him. The winner is the rider with the least number of points. 
</P>

attack after vacationing in the Mojave desert. Cagle, 60, was driving home to 
Bellflower when he stopped alongside I-15, between Victorville and Barstow, 
where he apparently was stricken. Cagle was a member of the Bonneville 200 MPH 
Club and was the first driver to exceed 180 m.p.h. on the old Famoso drag strip 
near Bakersfield. A memorial service is scheduled at 7 tonight at White Funeral 
Home in Bellflower. He is survived by a son, Troy. 
</P>
<P>

RAMS EXPECT TO SIGN 10 ROOKIE FREE AGENTS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington defensive lineman D'Marco Farr, Miami defensive lineman Kevin 
Patrick and Purdue wide receiver Jermaine Ross are among 10 rookie free agents 
expected to sign with the Rams today, said Jay Zygmunt, Rams' senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to sign are Notre Dame quarterback Kevin McDougal and New Mexico 
wide receiver Turhon O'Bannon, who came to terms with the team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, the half-brother of UCLA basketball stars Ed and Charles O'Bannon, 
had 47 catches last season and scored seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal has said he will play in the Canadian Football League if he cannot 
catch on in the NFL. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers own the rights to McDougal and 
Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward, who is considering pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Charlie and I didn't do enough to prove ourselves," McDougal told the 
Associated Press Wednesday. "All we did was take our teams to No. 1 and No. 2 
in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, whom the Raiders cut last week, worked out Wednesday for 
the Rams.

FUNERAL BRINGS DAUGHTERS BACK TO THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the nation heard Richard Nixon eulogized Wednesday, television cameras 
focused repeatedly during the 85-minute service on the resolute faces of the 
fallen President's daughters. For what sometimes seemed like anguishing 
minutes, TV seemed to get closer and closer, painfully close. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie and Tricia Nixon were the kids parents told their children to be like. 
Supporters of the Vietnam War viewed them as models of American youth; while 
opponents heaped them with scorn. And they are perhaps the only sisters who can 
play Trivial Pursuit and realize that they are one of the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the children of the former President and First Lady Pat Nixon, Julie 
Eisenhower and Patricia (Tricia) Cox were two of the most recognizable siblings 
in the United States during Nixon's six years in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Eisenhower's book writing and occasional guest speaking, the Nixon 
women, especially Tricia, have largely faded from public view. But on 
Wednesday, both stood firm before the world, along with their husbands and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the memorial service and eulogies, they displayed the same patriotism 
and pride their father exhibited on formal occasions. At the same moment, they 
evoked the image of their mother, standing by their father no matter what, 
insistent on being the backdrop and not the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon has a beautiful family, and he was devoted to them," Gov. Pete 
Wilson told the audience. "Anyone who ever saw them together knew that his 
beloved Pat and his girls, Tricia and Julie, were everything to him. He was so 
proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the final moments, when the ceremony moved graveside, did emotion 
surface. As a major general presented each with a flag that draped the coffin 
of their father, Tricia -- the oldest -- choked back tears, then Julie caught 
her breath, dabbed at her upper lip with a handkerchief and cried. The Rev. 
Billy Graham was there for comfort. Julie gave him a hug as the family headed 
into the library for a private reception. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the media paid so much attention to them, Julie and Tricia were 
standing next to their father during his farewell speech to the White House 
staff in August, 1974. Privately, they had urged him not to resign the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In much better times, the media covered Julie's pre-inaugural wedding in New 
York City, and Tricia's wedding in 1971, the last to be held at the White 
House. The reception was in the East Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie's engagement to David Eisenhower was on the cover of Life magazine. And 
it was the eldest daughter who pulled the family together, locked arm in arm, 
for a final White House news photograph as Watergate descended. 
</P>
<P>
 At the private reception after the service Wednesday evening, Tricia and Julie 
warmly welcomed more than 500 guests and tried to be upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are two beautiful girls," said Carl N. Karcher, the owner of the Carl's 
Jr. hamburger chain and a longtime friend of the Nixons. "Their spirits were 
great. I told them their father was a great leader and they had great parents. 
They agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of their lives, Nixon and his wife visited frequently with 
their daughters' families, usually at the Nixon home in Park Ridge, N.J. 
Together, they worked hard creating the Nixon library that opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nixon's death there has been speculation whether any of his family will 
run for office. Neither David nor Julie have ruled it out. Regardless, Nixon 
biographer Stephen Ambrose told New York's Newsday that they will remain 
"fierce defenders" of their father. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Nixon lawyers said the family also will continue their father's 
20-year fight to control thousands of hours of White House tapes and more than 
150,000 pages of presidential papers. Only 63 hours of the famous tapes, the 
portion provided to a federal grand jury during the Watergate investigation, 
have been released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say there were only three people in this world that Nixon ever 
loved -- Pat and his daughters," Ambrose said. "And they felt that way about 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 For several years after Nixon's resignation, Julie maintained a high profile 
as her father's most respected defender. "The most credible Nixon," she was 
once called. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Julie is the author of three books -- two about her family -- and has 
been working on a fourth about the 1968 presidential election with her husband 
David, the grandson of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. They live in 
Berwyn, Pa., a woodsy suburb of Philadelphia, with their three children, 
Jennie, Melanie and Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 The elusive Tricia, who was dubbed the "the mystery princess" by the White 
House press, now lives quietly in New York City. Her husband, Edward Finch Cox, 
one of the original seven "raiders," who worked for consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader, practices law. They have a son, Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 During their youth, the girls appeared regularly in their father's campaigns. 
Widely disseminated photos of Julie and Tricia sitting on their parents' laps 
appealed to the public, and they contributed to their father's political 
success in other, more subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1952 presidential election as Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate, 
Nixon defended himself on television against charges that he was the 
beneficiary of a generous slush fund set up by rich California Republicans. In 
the famous "Checkers Speech," he referred to the one gift he had received from 
a wealthy Texan, a black and white cocker spaniel the girls named Checkers. The 
girls loved the dog, he said, and under no circumstances would the family 
return it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both daughters became the object of adulation and scorn while living in the 
White House at the peak of the nation's most tumultuous and divisive time since 
the Civil War. Race riots and student demonstrations were widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, now 45, went to Smith College, an all-women's school that was in the 
vanguard of campus radicalism in the late 1960s. Some of her classmates 
regarded her as a traitor to her generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest chants vilified her and her husband. David was lampooned as a 
good-natured "Howdy Doody," and the media used words like "jug-eared," "gangly" 
and "awkward" to describe him. Threats of protests at Smith kept Julie from 
attending her graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia, now 48, was probably more insulated than her sister from direct, 
personal attack. She attended Finch College, a private school, in Manhattan. 
She tutored low-income children. Quiet and shy, she rarely revealed her inner 
feelings to anyone, even her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 When a teen-age visitor to the White House once asked about Tricia's 
whereabouts, the First Lady said: "If you can find out, you are better than I 
am." Her personal life remains largely private. 
</P>
<P>
 Once their father resigned the presidency, both women seemed to welcome 
private life. Though they had advised their father not to resign, they were 
weary of the scandal and the coverage. Both had found the lack of privacy and 
intrusions that accompany the presidency almost unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 The years out of the limelight, Julie once told the Washington Post, "have 
been some of the happiest years I've known. I'm so grateful for this time 
leading a normal life. I wouldn't trade it for anything." She once joked their 
lives were so all-American she and her husband could be "Dave and Julie Smith."

FOR GIRL, LINE INTO LIBRARY COMES UP SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fair? No, it wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 But with some 42,000 people lining up to file past Richard Nixon's closed 
casket to pay their respects, someone had to be the last in line. 
</P>
<P>
 And someone had to be the first locked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The last person let into the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace Wednesday was 
Bill Gormley, 43, a Coast Guard veteran who rode 170 chilly miles on his 
motorcycle and waited in line for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlucky one -- the person standing just behind Gormley -- was 10-year-old 
Stephanie Rivers of Lakewood. She had written her fifth-grade history report on 
Nixon and had begged her mother to take her to the Nixon library so she could 
witness history. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Stephanie became sort of a historical footnote herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really would have liked to get in, but it was kind of exciting having the 
line cut off right there," said her mother, Susan Rivers, 34. "It was pretty 
crazy. It's kind of a neat feeling. We're glad we went. It was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie wasn't too disappointed, either. Someone gave her a funeral program 
and she hurried off to school for show-and-tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a part of history, and I felt like I should be there and be a part of 
it," Stephanie explained later at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Stephanie begged her mother to take her to the Nixon library to 
wait in line overnight. Rivers thought that was impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Stephanie woke up early and clicked on the TV to watch the news, 
then rushed to tell her mother that the line in front of the library seemed 
shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 They left the house about 8:30 a.m. and arrived about 9:15. It wasn't a long 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 10:30 a.m., police began counting the number of people waiting 
to get into the library. They stopped at Gormley and told those behind him -- 
several thousand at least -- to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly woman dressed in black shook her finger wildly at a tall officer, 
lecturing him on the injustice of his chosen cutoff point. 
</P>
<P>
 A triumphant Gormley said moments after a police guard drew the line behind 
him, "I came thinking I would (get in). All night long I dreamed I would get 
in. He was my commander in chief when I was in the service and I wanted to pay 
my respects to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gormley said it was all worth it -- worth getting up at 5 a.m. in Ridgecrest, 
Calif., worth freezing on the motorcycle ride to Yorba Linda, and worth 
listening for hours to dubious security guards saying he would never make it 
into the library. 
</P>
<P>
 An understated man wearing jeans, a yellow golf shirt and a red-and-black 
checked lumberjack shirt with a hole in the back, Gormley entered the lobby of 
the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace at 10:40 a.m. He removed his National 
Rifle Assn. cap and gazed at the flag-draped coffin of the man he had so 
admired, then looked at the hundreds of floral sprays well-wishers had sent 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was his turn to walk past the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was overwhelming. I'm overwhelmed by all this. I don't know what to say," 
Gormley told a crush of reporters later. "I did stop and pause and said a 
little prayer. But that's between him and I." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gormley nor the Riverses planned well enough or came early enough to 
be sure they would get in. Others more determined or with more flexible 
schedules came to the Nixon library on Tuesday -- when the viewing began. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the thousands who preceded them and followed in the seemingly endless 
line that snaked through the normally quiet neighborhood surrounding the 
library, Gormley and Susan Rivers chatted to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were right across the street from the (library) fountain," Rivers 
recalled. "They let the rest of the people in front of us go, and then they 
said that was it. They weren't letting anybody else in." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers said she does not care much about politics. She was in high school 
during the Nixon era and does not remember much. 
</P>
<P>
 But a couple of months ago, Stephanie came home with an assignment. She had to 
write a report about Nixon, so they took a family trip to the Nixon library and 
surveyed the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie fell in love with the history of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to debate, and I do too in class," Stephanie explained as she 
watched the funeral on television Wednesday afternoon. "His life was really 
neat to read about and write a report on." 
</P>
<P>
 She got a B.

FOES AGREE ON PLAN TO CLEAN BAY OFF SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $67-million plan to clean up and protect Santa Monica Bay, one of the 
nation's most troubled coastal resources, was unveiled Wednesday by an unusual 
coalition of elected officials, government experts, scientists, industries and 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark program borne of consensus and billed as politically practical, 
73 steps to heal the bay are recommended by 1999 -- from stemming pollution 
flowing through storm drains and creating a citizen "gutter patrol" to 
restoration of the Ballona Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning effort, which lasted five years and cost $5 million, sprang from 
an unprecedented alliance between warring factions brought together by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency in 1988. But the real work begins now to ensure 
the "action plan" won't be followed by years of inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we've all seen far too often, you can have the best plan in the world, but 
if there is no teeth in implementation and compliance, the actions won't get 
implemented," said Mark Gold, staff scientist of the environmental group Heal 
the Bay and one of 50 committee members. "Everybody's biggest fear is that we 
have this . . . document that just sits on a shelf and gathers dust." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 250 steps were outlined in the plan, but the 73 were designated 
priorities. If all the steps suggested were followed, the cost would exceed 
$134 million -- a figure the committee did not include in the report released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But achieving even the 73 priorities would cost $67 million and test the 
ingenuity of government, businesses and environmentalists. While $30 million 
can be raised through existing grants and loans and perhaps private fund 
raising, the rest remains a shortfall, according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the $37-million gap will be "very tough" because of the state's 
ongoing recession, acknowledged Catherine Tyrrell, director of the project. She 
said the committee hopes that Congress, as it debates reauthorization of the 
Clean Water Act, or the state Legislature will be generous with grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the economic climate, some group is likely to be very opposed to most 
of these ideas," Tyrrell said. "It's going to take a lot of work and hearing 
from the public on what they think is important and how the plan can be 
implemented. There is no easy fix. It may be that everybody is going to have to 
contribute a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive estuary faces virtually every type of ecological threat 
imaginable. It is one of Southern California's most popular resources for 
swimming, boating and surfing, drawing 4 million visitors a year to its more 
than 50 miles of beaches stretching from Ventura County to the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration plan focuses on cleaning up 19 "pollutants of concern," some 
that threaten swimmers and surfers and others that contaminate fish and other 
aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it may look healthy, the bay's condition is influenced by more than 
just what happens in its waters or along its shores. The bay is also affected 
by what happens in the 414-square-mile watershed that drains into it," the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The brunt of the cleanup proposals focus on an estimated $42 million to 
control pollution -- not from industrial plants or sewage, but from the 
millions of people who live in the vast watershed that drains into the bay. 
Urban runoff, the mix of oil, garden chemicals, grease and other debris that 
flows from neighborhoods, is considered the primary problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Public debate over the 2-inch-thick report will begin tonight at a town hall 
meeting from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Westchester Municipal Building at 7166 W. 
Manchester Ave. Two public hearings will be held June 2, and all comments are 
due June 15 before the plan becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrrell said the plan's strength is that it combines "the collective wisdom" 
of all types of key players involved with the bay, from politicians to 
scientists to business representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When folks first got together they were sort of staring each other down 
around the table and most people thought it certainly couldn't work," she said. 
"But over time, people realized it ultimately is less costly, and action 
happens a lot sooner than if we wait 20 years for a lawsuit to get settled." 
</P>
<P>
 David Kay, who represents Southern California Edison on the committee, said in 
a statement that the power company "will continue to support (the plan) through 
its implementation," saying "it makes sense" from an environmental as well as a 
business standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a longtime supporter of cleaning the 
bay, said he is skeptical because Chevron USA, Edison and sewage treatment 
plant operators played a major role in choosing the priorities. He has asked 
for a Senate committee hearing to analyze the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been concerned about whether we're spending a lot of money for a rather 
ineffectual plan, but I am willing to be convinced otherwise," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold, of Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay, said he is pleased with the 
proposals, but noted they are voluntary, so success hinges on whether local and 
state government develop aggressive programs to tackle urban runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's authors said the priorities were based on real risk rather than 
those the public may perceive as important. For example, proposals to spend $3 
million to build two rehabilitation centers for marine mammals and birds harmed 
by oil spills did not make the top list. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot of money out there, so we wanted to be very practical about 
choosing the absolutely essential things," Tyrrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the proposals outlined in the plan will be funded through existing 
resources, so they are not counted in the cost estimates. After 15 years of 
opposition, Los Angeles County recently agreed to spend $400 million to enhance 
treatment at its Carson sewage plant, which goes a long way toward reducing 
bacteria that threatens swimmers. Los Angeles' Hyperion sewage treatment plant 
also is undergoing a $1.1-billion renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems, however, are more insidious, particularly ocean sediments 
laced with 200 tons of the pesticide DDT, which still is contaminating fish and 
the rest of the bay's food chain two decades after it was banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show much of the public believes swimming at the bay's 22 public 
beaches is unsafe. However, many health experts say the threat comes only after 
rains, when large volumes of runoff elevate bacteria levels. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary aim of the plan is to find and remove sources of those human 
pathogens from storm drains before they reach the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, it proposes to divert runoff that flows into the bay during dry 
weather into treatment plants. Another priority proposal includes boosting the 
state's inspection program to search for illegal sewage connections into storm 
drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is to develop a better scientific way to measure the health risk of 
swimming in the surf zone and revise public health standards to "accurately 
inform the public of where it may be safe to swim, and where it may be not, and 
why," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also proposes measures to protect the aquatic plants and wildlife 
that depend on the bay. Priority proposals include restoring 260 acres of 
Ballona Wetlands -- one of the last and largest marshes remaining in Los 
Angeles County -- and hiring additional wildlife wardens at the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to fish consumption, panel members contended that current 
research is good and that the threat poses less risk than swimming and loss of 
wetlands. Informing fishermen of health advisories was the only proposal rated 
a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking what pollution sources to target was the most controversial part of 
the planning. Months of debate centered on how much to focus on high-profile 
sources of pollution, including Chevron's El Segundo refinery, the two sewage 
treatment plants and a now-defunct Montrose chemical plant in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority finally agreed that much of the pollution from those sources 
already is being controlled by regulations and lawsuits. "Those other fights 
have already been won," said Gold. "What has been really lax is control of 
urban and storm runoff." Fixing Santa Monica Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Bay, one of the nation's most coastal areas, faces myriad 
problems. Urban runoff, industrial pollution, sewage and other sources of 
contamination pose a health risk to swimmers and harm marine life. A coalition 
of government, scientists, industries and environmentalists unveiled a 
five-year plan that includes 250 steps -- 73 considered priorities. The 
estimated cost of just those steps is $67 million. Some key proposals are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring and training city and county workers to manage a program to control 
urban runoff. Cost: $8.9 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Educating people in how to prevent polluted runoff from their own homes and 
neighborhoods. Cost: $6.2 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing ways to determine the risk to swimmers and revise public health 
standards. Cost: $1.8 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing an inspection system to catch illegal sewage connections into 
storm drains. Cost: $1 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Adopting and enforcing local ordinances to address storm water and urban 
runoff, control of erosion and limit pollution from businesses. Cost: $8.9 
million 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring more wildlife protection officers along the bay. Cost: $1.6 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Restoring Ballona wetlands and providing long-term management. Cost: $5 
million 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a restoration plan for Malibu Lagoon primarily to protect 
wildlife habitats from runoff. Cost: $2 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Enhancing efforts to restore El Segundo Dunes and create a habitat preserve. 
Cost: $500,000

<P>
 Triumphant at the pinnacle of his political life and scorned in exile, Richard 
Nixon was given the farewell of an American hero Wednesday and buried at the 
edge of a rose garden here. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who had worked to deny Nixon a second term, and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had joined the legal team that later tried to 
impeach him, led Republicans and Democrats -- officials at the center of power 
and those, once familiar, who have lived in the political shadows for two 
decades -- in mourning his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of a grateful nation, we bid farewell to Richard Milhous Nixon," 
Clinton said, with the flag-covered coffin and the white clapboard bungalow 
where the late President had lived until he was 9 years old serving as a 
backdrop.

 "A great man has fallen," said the Rev. Billy Graham, minister of Presidents, 
who officiated at the funeral. "The world has lost a great citizen and America 
has lost a great statesman, and those of us that knew him have lost a great 
personal friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The 85-minute ceremony in a parking lot covered with green outdoor carpeting 
closed the circle on one of the most remarkable and complex public lives of the 
20th Century, granting to the 37th President of the United States the 
acceptance, even adulation, he sought so longingly from the Washington 
Establishment that he, paradoxically, so despised. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly one-quarter of the life of the republic, Nixon was a force who 
could not be ignored, a galvanizing presence whose image -- a ski-slope nose, 
shoulders hunched awkwardly forward, the loose jowls and the waves of curls 
thinning into a widow's peak -- inspired a range of gut emotions from 
unshakable loyalty and deep respect, sometimes induced by fear, to unalloyed 
loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 His funeral, broadcast live across the country, restored to Nixon in death the 
mantle of the presidency that he had shed on Aug. 9, 1974, when he resigned in 
the face of certain impeachment in the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, until he died last Friday of a stroke at the age of 81, 
he worked assiduously, first to rehabilitate his image and then to assume his 
place among a pantheon of elder statesmen, with his books on foreign policy and 
his quiet, private -- and, they said, appreciated -- advice to his White House 
successors. 
</P>
<P>
 With the funeral staged across the continent from the nation's capital, which 
Nixon shunned when funeral plans were made before his death, the trappings of 
the White House were delivered to him: the flag-draped coffin as well as 
"Ruffles and Flourishes," "Hail to the Chief" and a 21-gun salute that boomed 
across what had been the lemon groves of his youth. Four Air Force jets flew 
over, in the traditional "missing man" formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, in a somber graveside ceremony behind the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace, Graham intoned the 23rd Psalm: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall 
not want. . . ." He also recited the Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two flags that had covered the coffin were neatly folded by the eight military 
pallbearers and handed to Nixon's daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon 
Eisenhower, whose composure was breaking as they choked back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Nixon, 63, stood at the graveside as the service concluded, tears 
streaming down his cheeks, before he walked away from the final resting place 
of his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, with most of the guests gone and the sun setting, the 
mahogany coffin was placed in a grave beside that of Pat Nixon, just a few 
steps from the house where Nixon was born on Jan. 9, 1913. Mrs. Nixon died last 
June, 10 months to the day before her husband. A dozen men began filling in the 
grave, halting their work after five minutes as the Nixon family returned for 
another visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since January, 1973, when former President Lyndon B. Johnson died, has the 
nation witnessed a spectacle like that on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated in the front row, on white folding chairs, were Clinton, the 42nd 
President, and his living predecessors, each of whose lives had intersected 
with Nixon's: Gerald R. Ford, who declared to an anxious nation that "our long 
national nightmare is over," as Nixon's resignation took effect, and then 
pardoned Nixon of any crimes committed during the Watergate scandal; Jimmy 
Carter, who many believe owed his election to the unpopularity of that pardon; 
Ronald Reagan, who tried in 1968 to deny Nixon the Republican presidential 
nomination, and George Bush, who was the Republican Party chairman during the 
most trying days of Watergate. Each was accompanied by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Just behind them sat three of those who spoke at the funeral: Henry A. 
Kissinger, Nixon's first national security adviser and second secretary of 
state; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and California Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind them were arrayed 4,000 guests, faces familiar yet aged, some still 
players on the Washington stage, others hoping to return there, indeed to the 
White House itself. Others had long been in retirement. Among the guests were 
Spiro T. Agnew, who was Nixon's first vice president until revelations about 
past corruption in Maryland forced him to resign; Dan Quayle, the most recent 
former vice president; entertainer Bob Hope; Alexander M. Haig Jr., Nixon's 
last chief of staff and Reagan's first secretary of state; members of the Nixon 
Cabinet, and one-fifth of the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces and names first made familiar from the Watergate years were here: 
Rosemary Woods, Nixon's secretary, on whom blame was placed for creating the 18 
1/2-minute gap in a tape of a crucial meeting at which the Watergate cover-up 
was discussed; Howard H. Baker Jr., the ranking Republican member of the Senate 
Watergate Committee, and G. Gordon Liddy, a key link in the chain between the 
Nixon White House in 1972 and the men who broke into the Democratic National 
Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Baker and Liddy 
rode together on a shuttle bus from a nearby parking lot to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Also there was former Sen. George S. McGovern (D-S.D.). He flew to California 
aboard Air Force One, a member of the presidential party paying his respects to 
the man who swamped him in the 1972 presidential race even as the cold winds of 
Watergate were starting to stir in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Across an aisle from the presidents, in the front row, were Nixon's daughters; 
their husbands, Edward Cox and David Eisenhower, and Nixon's four 
grandchildren, Christopher Cox and Melanie, Alexander and Jennie Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon was a man who showed little emotion in public, shy and jealous 
of his privacy, the service prompted unusual displays of emotion -- and deeply 
personal remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who developed a relationship with Nixon only in the last year as he 
received what he called "his wise counsel, especially with regard to Russia," 
offered the briefest and least personal remarks, saying of Nixon: 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave of himself with intelligence and energy and devotion to duty, and his 
entire country owes him a debt of gratitude for that service." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Clinton who made the most direct, albeit still oblique, reference 
to Watergate. And it was Clinton who called for an end to judging Nixon through 
that one prism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, he knew great controversy amid defeat as well as victory. He made 
mistakes and they, like his accomplishments, are part of his life and record," 
the 42nd President said. "But the enduring lesson of Richard Nixon is that he 
never gave up being part of the action and passion of his times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a day for his family, his friends and his nation to remember 
President Nixon's life in totality. To them let us say, may the day of judging 
President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a 
close. May we heed his call to maintain the will and the wisdom to build on 
America's greatest gift, its freedom, to lead a world full of difficulty to the 
just and lasting peace he dreamed of." 
</P>
<P>
 Remarking on the august assemblage that took part in the funeral, Kissinger 
said: "Richard Nixon would be so proud that President Clinton and all living 
former Presidents of the United States are here, symbolizing that his long and 
sometimes bitter journey had concluded in reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger, the eminen c e gris e behind the foreign policy that formed the 
backbone of the Nixon presidency, said that 550,000 Americans were engaged in 
combat in Vietnam when Nixon took office on Jan. 20, 1969, and that "America 
had no contact with China, the world's most populous nation, no negotiations 
with the Soviet Union, the other nuclear superpower." 
</P>
<P>
 In his deep, rumbling voice, still bearing its trademark German accent, he 
continued: 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Muslim countries had broken diplomatic relations with the United States 
and Middle East diplomacy was stalemated. All of this in the midst of the most 
anguishing domestic crisis since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Richard Nixon left office, an agreement to end the war in Vietnam had 
been concluded and the main lines of all subsequent policy were established -- 
permanent dialogue with China; readiness without illusion to ease tension with 
the Soviet Union; a peace process in the Middle East; the beginning, via the 
European Security Conference, of establishing human rights as an international 
issue; weakening the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kissinger who once described Nixon as "a strong mixture of calculation, 
deviousness, idealism, tenderness, tawdriness, courage and daring." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he said that Nixon was "one of the seminal Presidents" in the 
conduct of foreign policy. But, he said, "Richard Nixon's greatest 
accomplishment was as much moral as it was political: to lead from strength at 
a moment of apparent weakness, to husband a nation's resilience and thus to lay 
the basis for victory in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "So let us now say goodby to our gallant friend. He stood on pinnacles that 
dissolved into precipice. He achieved greatly and he suffered deeply but he 
never gave up. Richard Nixon ended a war and he advanced the vision of peace of 
his Quaker youth. He was devoted to his family. He loved his country. And he 
considered service his honor. It was a privilege to have been allowed to help 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, who began his climb up the ladder of Republican leadership during the 
Nixon White House years, saluted Nixon's domestic policy and put Nixon's roots 
firmly in the Americana to which candidate Nixon appealed so effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Nixon, the senator said, who launched a war on cancer, and "leapfrogged 
the conventional wisdom and proposed revolutionary solutions to health care and 
welfare reform, anticipating by a full generation the debates now raging on 
Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the grocer's son who got ahead by working harder and longer than 
everyone else. How American," the senator said. "He was a student who met 
expenses by doing research at the law library for 35 cents an hour while 
sharing a rundown farmhouse without water or electricity. How American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong, brave, unafraid of controversy, unyielding in his convictions, living 
every day of his life to the hilt, the largest figure of our time whose 
influence will be timeless -- that was Richard Nixon. How American." 
</P>
<P>
 It all took place on a day of lowering clouds scudding overhead while the wind 
sent strong tremors through the palm fronds and the leaves of the towering oak 
that shadows Nixon's first home. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests already were seated when the four former Presidents arrived, to 
brief applause as each walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely at 4 p.m., the program began to the repeated strains of "America," 
played by a U.S. Marine Corps band. A color guard, in the measured cadence 
reserved for such occasions, preceded the coffin, led by Graham and carried by 
the pallbearers from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffin was placed on a plain wood platform; the pallbearers withdrew, and 
Graham led the first prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hours earlier, the last of the visiting public walked through the lobby 
of the Nixon library, where the coffin had been displayed overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hour after hour, thousands of visitors had streamed past. All night the line, 
three miles long at times, snaked through the placid streets of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the public mourning period, library officials estimated, the 
total of those who had passed the coffin reached 42,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The day, which Clinton had declared a national day of mourning, brought to 
Yorba Linda a panoply of onetime enemies, as well as those who remained loyal 
to Nixon throughout his post-Watergate years. 
</P>
<P>
 And it brought back to the public eye, for just brief moments, some who had 
for all intents and purposes had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew, for one, had the most terse of comments: "I'm here to pay my respects 
for his accomplishments. It's time to put aside 20 years of resentment, which 
is what I'm doing at this moment. . . . He was the greatest statesman of our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, there were two brief receptions at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the First Lady were hosts at one, for 200 members of the 
diplomatic delegation that represented nearly 90 countries, although no head of 
state other than Clinton attended the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, 400 friends of the Nixon family gathered in the lobby for 
another reception, which the Clintons and the past presidents and their wives 
eventually joined. More on Nixon

PRIDE MARKS PEACEFUL S. AFRICAN VOTING

 Nelson Mandela and millions of other South Africans voted for the first time 
in their lives Wednesday, a day that seemed to miraculously turn violence and 
fear into pride and hope across this long-divided land. 
</P>
<P>
 From squatter camp to rich suburb, from white town to black township, voters 
of all races lined up together to embrace democracy and destroy apartheid in a 
rare display of racial harmony. More important, they came in such swarms on the 
second day of the three-day elections as to overwhelm an obviously inadequate 
voting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays of six hours or longer were common, worsened because of a breakdown of 
the system used to deliver voting materials to the polls. Numerous voting 
stations opened hours late when ballots, ink or boxes failed to arrive. And 
other stations never opened at all. As a result, officials said one in five 
voters was unable to vote or gave up and went home in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the Independent Electoral Commission said voting would go on as 
late into the night as necessary. More than 9 million extra ballots were also 
being printed for when polls reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a day of historic firsts, perhaps the most remarkable was this: Not a 
single election-related death, and not a single case of intimidation or 
violence at the nearly 10,000 polls, was reported in a nation where political 
murder and mayhem often seem a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, police said the only known problems were in several rural areas where 
frustrated blacks broke down the doors of closed polling stations to try to 
vote. The police, who once battled township residents opposed to white rule, 
guarded each polling booth with automatic weapons to protect the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even an argument was heard in visits to 10 packed polling stations in the 
Johannesburg area. They ranged from the war-torn township of Thokoza to the 
leafy white neighborhoods of Sandton. And every single station had queues that 
snaked outside for up to a mile in the broiling sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience and optimism was the order of the day. Some obviously grumbled, but 
many more smiled. The mood was festive, with hawkers selling cold drinks and 
families camped on lawn chairs. Some voters even argued that the endless wait 
demonstrated the country's new commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have waited their whole lives to vote," said a grinning Trish Burrus, 
who waited five hours to cast her ballot in Illovo. "What's one more day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they could not say how many of the 22.7 million eligible 
voters, including up to 18 million first-time black voters, had actually gone 
to the polls to elect the first post-apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began with news of an early explosion outside the international 
arrivals hall at Jan Smuts International Airport here. The third car bomb in 
four days injured 18 people and caused heavy damage to the terminal. But even 
that bad news was overshadowed. Police announced the arrests of 31 white 
extremists on charges of planting terrorist bombs that killed 21 people Sunday 
and Monday in downtown Johannesburg, Germiston and Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Johan van der Merwe, the police commissioner, said the suspects, who 
include members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement, hoped to 
intimidate voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose was to derail the election process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It obviously did not work. Mandela, the lionized leader of black resistance to 
white rule, cast his ballot at a school in Inanda outside Durban. Almost sure 
to become the country's first black president, the head of the African National 
Congress said voting was the fulfillment of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the beginning of a new era," Mandela told reporters. "It is a 
realization of our hopes and dreams -- the dreams of a South Africa that 
represents all South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
 First-time black voters began lining up, huddled under blankets, as early as 3 
a.m. at churches, community halls, schools and other polling stations in 
Soweto, the township that symbolized the anti-apartheid movement after the 1976 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand or so people were already in line at 7 a.m., the scheduled start of 
voting, at the Union Congregational Church in Soweto's Orlando East area. They 
circled the huge church compound when the polls actually opened 45 minutes 
late. They soon stretched far down the dusty road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I am free!" cried one of the first voters, Selina Pelo, 65, clapping her 
hands with delight. She folded her ballot neatly, held it in two hands like a 
sacrament and stuffed it into the tin box. "I thank God he let me live long 
enough to see this day! This is the day the children of Israel are going to the 
promised land!" 
</P>
<P>
 Few seemed to disagree. One gray, grizzled man applauded after he voted. A 
toothless older woman wiped tears from her eyes. A young woman with an infant 
strapped on her back raised her fists in triumph. Many wore their Sunday finest 
for this finest of all days. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road at Klipspruit, thousands of other first-time voters stood as the 
hot sun burned off the morning chill. But election workers sat idly in a huge 
tent in a weed-filled field, and in a hall at a fortress-like all-male workers 
hostel flanked with razor wire. Voting finally began 2 1/2 hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Mncube, supervisor of the hostel poll, blamed the distribution 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was we didn't have ballot papers," she said. "We had to go to 
another station and borrow some." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mbe Mankayi, 37, a high school teacher wearing a torn ski jacket, was 
angry only at the people already leaving the line in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll wait here to the year 2000 to vote," he said. "I'm voting for my 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was much the same in Pioneer Park, a working-class white area south 
of Johannesburg. Gavin Bitter, a polling agent from the National Party, shook 
his head in amazement at the multiracial line that stretched three blocks. He 
said it was the shortest line he had seen all morning. "I've been doing 
elections for 20 years, and I've never seen anything like this," he said. "It's 
stupendous." 
</P>
<P>
 The line was nearly half a mile at the Portuguese Community Center, and even 
longer at the Rossettenville Community Center. It stretched almost a mile at 
nearby Glenvista High School, a modern brick structure in a newly built 
middle-class suburb on scrubby hills south of the city. Down the long line, 
Elena and Andrew Theodosiou had already waited five hours in the hot sun, and 
reckoned they were still an hour or so away. But neither was impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth it, it's bloody well worth it," he said with a smile. "It's our 
first year to vote as a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of the changes, his wife brought their black maid. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't want to come," said Elena Theodosiou. "She was afraid of violence, 
of being killed. But I insisted. I said she must come to vote for the new South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Katlehong, one of the most strife-torn of the country's townships, 
thousands of black voters inched quietly forward in winding lines at the D. H. 
Williams Community Center after the polls inside opened 4 1/2 hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," sighed Pinky Vilakazi, an election worker, as voters filed by 
with their ballots. "We didn't have any of the proper materials. But people 
have been very patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Meisburger, an official U.S. election observer, was openly critical of 
the Independent Electoral Commission, the nonpartisan South African group in 
charge of running the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to run it out of their office," he complained at the Alexsan 
Resource Centre in Alexandra township. "They had this hubris. They started 
late, and they never took it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the commission, admitted later at a news 
conference that Wednesday had even more problems than the first day of voting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said up to 30% of polls in the Johannesburg-Pretoria region and in Natal 
province had not functioned properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What went wrong today is the IEC's fault," he said  
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of every party had complained to him of shortages of ballot papers, 
marking ink and ballot boxes to replace those that "got overstuffed from the 
overwhelming turnout," Kriegler said. He said police would investigate if any 
ballots were found to be missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha Freedom Party, 
charged widespread rigging of polls in Natal province, including failure to 
provide enough ballot stickers with Inkatha's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot rule out the possibility of us withdrawing from the election," he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kriegler said the election would proceed regardless and appealed to 
Buthelezi not to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a great pity to spoil it now," he said.

COLUMN ONE; HIGH-TECH HOUSE CALLS CATCHING ON; FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC TO RURAL 
KANSAS, DOCTORS FIND LONG-DISTANCE TELEMEDICINE CAN SAVE LIVES AND MONEY.

<P>
 Dr. Jim Troxell unwinds the bandage from his patient's foot to reveal 
gangrene, which has eaten away much of the heel. A consulting orthopedist takes 
a close look, and after a few questions endorses Troxell's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of consultation that takes place in medicine all the time. But 
in this case, Troxell and his patient are in Kwajalein, an atoll in the South 
Pacific. The orthopedist is 2,200 miles away at Honolulu's Tripler Army Medical 
Center. The doctors communicate on television screens linked by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is called telemedicine. Amid all the bluster about the potential 
of the information superhighway, physicians around the country already are 
using high-speed communications networks to provide crucial care. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance medicine is already saving lives as well as money. Residents of 
remote areas who never had easy access to advanced medical know-how find it 
increasingly available thanks to satellite and other links. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics fear the technology could dehumanize medicine and boost costs if 
there is sudden access to expensive care for those previously content with 
local solutions. But advocates are convinced that more and earlier medical care 
will prevent costlier illnesses later, and that medical resources can be used 
more efficiently when high-priced specialists can make diagnoses for patients 
around the country without leaving their big city hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, the United States could even cut its trade deficit by selling 
medical services abroad. Experts at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Mayo 
Clinic in Minnesota are using video teleconferencing systems to advise patients 
in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemedicine has been around since the mid-1960s, when doctors used microwave 
transmission to exchange medical opinions and observe groundbreaking operations 
over two-way TV systems. But high costs kept the technology from catching on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, falling prices and advances in data compression, which allow images to be 
more easily transmitted, have combined with a new federal and state eagerness 
to experiment with the information superhighway. The result: Telemedicine 
projects are breaking out everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hawaii, West Virginia and eastern Montana built networks to connect 
remote hospitals and clinics to large medical centers. In the next year, 20 
more projects will go on-line in various parts of the country. Telemedicine 
could soon be used to extend medical services to underserved inner- city 
clinics and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Carolina and Georgia, prison inmates who once were transported in 
chains long distances for medical treatment can now be examined by specialists 
from leading medical centers many miles away. They use electronic stethoscopes 
and other remote instruments to make diagnoses and advise prison doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical College of Georgia will break ground this fall when it begins 
using special cable TV lines to offer care to 25 households in Augusta where 
patients have chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing back the house call," said Jay Sanders, director of the 
school's Telemedicine Center. "We will create an electronic umbilical cord to 
the home." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential savings are huge. Regular monitoring of asthma and high-blood 
pressure patients at home could catch problems before they reach the critical 
stage that requires emergency hospitalization. "You can save an average $15,000 
to $20,000 for every hospitalization you avoid," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state agencies have strongly endorsed the trend. The National 
Telecommunications and Information Agency will spend $100 million next year to 
sponsor use of communication networks for health education. The National 
Institute of Standards and Technology recently budgeted $185 million over five 
years to help set standards for such things as patient medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts could provide big savings. The National Health Foundation, a 
nonprofit group in Los Angeles, is working on an ambitious project to 
electronically connect hospitals with laboratories, suppliers and health 
agencies, a move that could save as much as $3 billion annually in California 
by reducing paperwork and avoiding duplicate tests, says Rita Moya, president 
of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents envision a day when all this information would be automatically fed 
into a giant database that would help doctors make diagnoses, recommend 
treatment and spot new diseases. If a doctor prescribes a drug that is 
incompatible with a drug already prescribed by another doctor, the computer 
would flash a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telemedicine is necessary to have the kind of health reform that (the Clinton 
Administration) has planned," said Dr. C. Everett Koop, former U.S. surgeon 
general. He is building a consortium of private health care companies, at Vice 
President Al Gore's request, to promote the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Since managed-care operators are paid a fixed fee per patient, they have a 
strong incentive to keep patients out of high-technology medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big hospitals used to rate their success based on high occupancy," said 
George Conklin, vice president of information systems at Oklahoma Healthcare 
Corp. With managed care, he said, "we will be rated successful the lower our 
occupancy is." 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation has begun to build a network that will enable specialists at 
its prestigious Baptist Medical Center to offer consultations to patients in 50 
rural hospitals in Oklahoma so they can be treated locally for most ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bulk of problems of patients who enter the medical system do not 
require a doctor's care, new ways of answering patient questions could sharply 
reduce the burden on hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation is backing a San Francisco Public 
Library project that could one day help keep cars off the road and people out 
of hospitals by providing health care information over phones and computer 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics say there is still little documented evidence to prove telemedicine 
saves money. The technology could result in even higher medical costs, for 
example, if rural patients learned of new options for care and demanded 
expensive treatment available only in cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But rural America, where about 64 million people live scattered in small 
towns, is already embracing technology as a matter of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural hospitals are closing down and also cutting services as they lose 
patients to larger medical centers. Since the hospitals are typically the 
largest employers in town, their losses can be devastating to local economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that in most cases we had to transfer patients (to city medical 
centers) because we couldn't make a diagnosis," said Robert Cox, a physician in 
Hays, Kan., population 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox was an early telemedicine enthusiast. In 1990, he persuaded his hospital, 
the Hays Medical Center, to install a system equipped with a video camera, a 
large TV monitor and a codec, a machine that compresses images from the camera 
so they can be transferred more cheaply over high-speed phone lines. The system 
is connected to similar systems at the University of Kansas Medical Center and 
in other rural hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, an 8-year-old boy came to the Hays hospital with headaches 
and his left side paralyzed. He was given a CAT scan and taken to the video 
room. A pediatric neurologist at the University of Kansas looked at the CAT 
scan over the video screen, talked to the boy and his doctor about the symptoms 
and quickly concluded that the only treatments required were painkillers and 
time. Insurers saved the several thousand dollars it would have cost to airlift 
the boy and care for him at an expensive medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 With telemedicine, rural hospitals find they can keep 50% to 80% of the 
patients they once sent away to large hospitals that charge twice as much. The 
systems also help keep rural doctors up to date on modern medical advances and 
enable them to obtain credits for license renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 But though telemedicine networks are being installed at a rapid pace, many are 
not used fully. Last year, the top 10 telemedicine projects in America 
conducted 750 consultations of more than a few minutes, said Ace Allen, an 
oncologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center and editor of 
Telemedicine Today, a newsletter. In Norway, by contrast, one clinic conducted 
603 consultations last year, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons for the slower pace. Some doctors are uncomfortable 
making diagnoses without being able to touch patients. Patients also express 
some discomfort. "It was kind of awkward because you are on the television," 
said Vicky Nesmith, an employee at Dodge County Hospital in Georgia who 
recently had her ear examined remotely by a specialist in Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hospitals say telephone companies will have to lower rates, which can 
cost tens of thousands of dollars a month for a network of dedicated high-speed 
lines, before telemedicine is broadly practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main obstacle to broader use remains reimbursement. Most doctors and 
specialists using telemedicine today are not reimbursed for their time. Private 
cardiologists in Oklahoma still fly around in their own private planes visiting 
patients because they are not paid for examinations they give over two-way 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Perednia, director of the Advanced Telemedicine Research Group at 
Oregon Health Science University, says insurers are right to be skeptical. 
Hospitals could use grant money to rush into expensive purchases of new 
equipment only to find it inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Perednia believes, for example, that dermatology can be practiced most cheaply 
and conveniently using a system he designed that consists of a cheap personal 
computer, a store-bought video camera to take pictures of the skin and a 
regular phone line to transfer the pictures to a specialist. His plan's 
equipment and communication costs are a fraction of an interactive video 
system's and it offers a dermatologist the flexibility to study the pictures on 
an office computer rather than at a scheduled time in a special room. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrokh Alemi, an associate professor in Cleveland State University's health 
administration program, is also seeking low-cost approaches to telemedicine. He 
has developed a range of programs for the underserved, including one computer 
registry of drug-abusing mothers and their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer checks to see if the mother has had her baby immunized. If not, the 
computer telephones the mother and then the doctor. If the mother still has not 
seen the doctor after three weeks, the computer calls an outreach worker who 
goes to the mother's home and brings her to the clinic. Of the 150 mothers 
participating in the pilot program, 85% had their babies immunized. The rate is 
45% among clinic patients not in the special program. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with lower semiconductor prices and better techniques for squeezing 
images through phone lines, the cost of interactive television systems has 
plunged. A system that cost more than $500,000 per site a decade ago, costs as 
little as $14,000. Vtel Corp., a leading manufacturer, says its entry-level 
system will cost just $5,000 by year's end. At those prices, the system pays 
for itself quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most promising applications for telemedicine is in the area of 
mental health. When a 6-year-old boy in eastern Oregon grew disruptive at 
school, he was taken to a video studio established at a nearby high school with 
his teacher, his parents, his doctor and the mental health caseworker. A 
psychiatrist in Portland used an interactive video system to interview the boy 
and the others and prescribed medication that resolved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the network, said Cathy Britain, director of the Rodeonet project, the 
boy's mother would have had to drive him 600 miles to Portland and put him in a 
private hospital, where he would have had to stay a week. Adult mental health 
patients can often have their medication adjusted over the network, avoiding 
police custody in rural communities with little mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemedicine could eventually turn America's sophisticated but expensive 
medical system into a successful export. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason the U.S. shouldn't become the medical center for the 
world," said Betsy Blakeslee, director of the recently established Telemedicine 
Institute at the Center for the New West in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's King Hussein, who underwent heart surgery at the Mayo Clinic, backed 
a soon-to-be-completed $18-million hospital in Amman that will use a satellite 
to consult with specialists at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere. Renowned heart 
surgeon Michael DeBakey says he has received requests from Turkey and other 
nations to buy a commercial telemedicine package for which he has acted as 
medical adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 If research funded by the Department of Defense is successful, America may 
export more than just consulting services. Advanced Research Projects Agency is 
financing research that may one day permit surgery from remote locations, 
enabling surgeons to conduct battlefield operations at a safe distance. And 
doctors at the University of Washington are working on pressure-sensitive 
gloves that give the wearer a sense of touch linked to what a robot hand at a 
remote location is touching. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kwajalein, which has the size and population of a small aircraft carrier, 
the Army spends $800,000 a year sending dependents and their families to 
Honolulu for treatment. Now, dependents are increasingly taking a short walk to 
the video room. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent stormy afternoon in Honolulu, a small group gathered in a room at 
Tripler packed with video equipment and three large display monitors. An 
orthopedist sat behind a conference table. The television was turned on and 
Troxell appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his image was bounced off a satellite, picked up at a receiving 
station in Washington, D.C., and sent across land lines and submarine cable to 
Honolulu, the doctor and his patient came across loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cross-Pacific consultation, Troxell was grateful. "We're operating 
by the seat of our pants here," he said later. Without the ability to refer the 
patient to experts, he said, "the option might have been to cut off his foot."

S. AFRICA RIGHT WING FACES CHOICE: BALLOT OR BOYCOTT; ELECTIONS: SOME BELIEVE 
THEY CAN GUARD THEIR INTERESTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. OTHERS ARE BENT ON VIOLENT 
OPPOSITION.

 The debate in the Dutton household here Wednesday, as in so many right-wing 
white homes in this mining town, was not who to vote for, but whether to vote 
at all. Frank and Myra Dutton wanted to vote. Their 26-year-old son did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the son gave his father the keys to his car. "Go ahead and vote," he 
said. "But not me." 
</P>
<P>
 And his parents waited two hours, avoiding being sandwiched between new black 
voters, to cast their ballots for the rightist Freedom Front. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were saying we shouldn't vote, as a protest against the coming of 
a black government," Myra Dutton said. But for whites, old habits die hard. "I 
just think it's a person's right to vote, and his duty to vote," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first full day of countrywide voting for a new South Africa, with a new 
flag flying from the masts of city halls, courthouses and police stations 
across the nation, the decision facing many whites in conservative communities 
such as Carletonville was the same one that select black voters opposed to 
apartheid once faced in rare situations -- whether to participate or boycott 
elections they were permitted to participate in. 
</P>
<P>
 The right wing is sharply split over how to achieve its goal of autonomous 
homelands for whites inside South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side is the Freedom Front, which is participating in the contest. It 
argues that the best way to protect white rights is within the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 The party has also won an unusual concession from Nelson Mandela, the African 
National Congress leader who is expected to become South Africa's next 
president. Under this deal, the elections have become a kind of referendum on 
white sentiment. In regions where the right-wing party wins substantial 
support, Mandela has agreed, the new government will discuss some form of 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side is the Conservative Party, for a decade now the white 
opposition in Parliament, and a vast array of white militants using harsh talk 
and bent on violence. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend that the elections -- in the words of the right-wing Radio 
Pretoria, which has defied a government ban on it -- are "a macabre circus" 
that could never achieve a white homeland for the Afrikaner descendants of 
South Africa's original white settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to reinforce the boycotters' call, a car bomb exploded at Johannesburg's 
international airport Wednesday; 18 people were injured in the blast, the third 
major car bomb attack in the last four days. 
</P>
<P>
 But police reported a breakthrough Wednesday in their probe of the bombings, 
which killed 21 people and injured several hundred. Gen. Johan van der Merwe, 
commissioner of police, said that 31 members of the armed wing of the far-right 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement had been arrested. Among the suspects were two 
white policemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good reason to believe that the people we have arrested are the 
brains behind these terror blasts," he said. "But obviously there may be some 
other groups committing terror of this nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing violence did not scare many voters away. In fact, it was one 
thing that drove the Duttons and many others to the polls on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things don't gain them anything," Frank Dutton said. "We can't support 
actions like that. I think most South Africans want peace, and they'll do 
anything for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Carletonville, a mining community 60 miles west of Johannesburg, is one of 
South Africa's most notorious right-wing cities. Down in the mines here, the 
deepest in the world, blacks and whites work peacefully, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 But above ground, police here for years tortured black suspects, resulting in 
at least eight deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those officers have been retired or transferred, but the city is still 
run by 10 right-wing city councilmen who have fought orders from Pretoria that 
they merge administrations with the next-door black township of Khutsong. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday in Carletonville, and in Khutsong, the elections went smoothly. 
Many of the region's 130,000 voters, about 80% of whom are black, stood in 
lines together, rarely speaking and avoiding eye contact. The quiet queues made 
clear that many whites had decided to accept the tide of change and use their 
vote against what is expected to be a black-controlled government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of how you feel, it's more a question of what you must 
do," said Steve Gouws, 25, a mine shift foreman who came with his wife, Ria, to 
vote. "We'll have to see what happens after this. You've got to hope for the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Some whites and blacks in Carletonville said they already noticed a slight 
easing of racial tension. About 400 blacks have moved, without incident, into 
the formerly whites-only town of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't worry you," said Myrtle Viljoen, a white 45-year-old who waited 
more than two hours to vote. "Their gardens are nice. They look after their 
houses. We are all friends, even your blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Conservative Party wants blacks on one side and whites on the other," she 
added. "But that's when you get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Duttons, who voted against reform in the 1992 whites-only referendum, 
the voting day marked a change in their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've ever stood in a line this long to vote in South 
Africa," Frank Dutton said. "It's really quite amazing. But I guess blacks and 
whites both realize the importance of this vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in line near the Duttons was Abey Kitime, a 39-year-old black man who 
works as a nurse in the local mine company's hospital. "It's quite unusual for 
them," he said, lowering his voice so the Duttons didn't hear. "But, as time 
goes by, they'll get used to it."

FROM YELTSIN, PROFILES IN COURAGE, DOUBT, DESPAIR; RUSSIA: THE PRESIDENT 
STRESSES HIS SENSITIVE SIDE IN A VOLUME OF MEMOIRS. ITS CANDOR ASTOUNDS INITIAL 
READERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the strains of a pianist in gold lame, diplomatic applause and the clink of 
champagne glasses, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Wednesday formally 
presented to the world a cry from the heart for understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Much maligned by his compatriots and with his popularity at a new low, Yeltsin 
chose this moment to bring out "Notes of a President" -- known in its American 
edition as "The Struggle for Russia" -- in an initial Russian print run of 
100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many facts, many examples and decisions in this period . . . were known only 
to the president," Yeltsin, solemn but bright-eyed, told an exclusive reception 
in his honor. "No one else could ever write or remember them." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the 63-year-old Russian president, during sleepless nights or long 
plane rides, dictated and wrote what he called "the live truth, written today 
when all this happened and is still happening." 
</P>
<P>
 It may or may not contain the whole truth, but the book astounded its first 
Russian readers with the level of its candor -- including on Yeltsin's 
continuing uncertainty as to whether many of his actions have been correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is not just a president but a person with all his sufferings and 
problems, which he brings onto the page without trying to hide anything," said 
Omsk Gov. Leonid K. Polezhayev. "What in some eyes would seem weakness actually 
makes people empathize." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent theater director Mark A. Zakharov said he had stayed up until 3 a.m. 
the night before devouring the book. He said he had decided that "this is the 
truth -- and that, today, is a very valuable item." 
</P>
<P>
 From his family life and Kremlin infighting to his depressions and agonizing, 
the Russian president bares much of his internal life to his readers in a 
seeming attempt to do away in one blow with his image as remote, ailing and ill 
advised. He wanted in part, he writes, "to destroy the stereotype of the 
hard-boiled, rigid leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the book's more sensational revelations had already been leaked, 
particularly tales of how the Russian government hung by a thread during the 
October fight for the White House in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Russian readers who are likely to enjoy the simple style that Zakharov 
compared to Leo Tolstoy's, the book offers one jaw-dropper after another, from 
Yeltsin's assessment of who his real friends are to his description of how his 
aides cheer him up when he sinks into gloomy passivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The millions who have been baffled by many of their president's moves are 
likely to feel, after digesting his writings, that they at least have a solid 
sense of him as a person far more multidimensional than the Russian muzhik , or 
macho peasant, he often portrays himself to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin lingers in detail on his emotions, describing the "agonizing process 
of decision-making" when he contemplated dissolving Parliament last September, 
or how he hates "public beating, when everyone gangs up on you and pounds you 
from every side." 
</P>
<P>
 His account of the harrowing trials of office could fail to win sympathy only 
from the most disillusioned of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debilitating bouts of depression," he writes, "the grave second thoughts, 
the insomnia and headaches in the middle of the night, the tears and despair, 
the sadness at the appearance of Moscow and other Russian cities, the flood of 
criticism from the newspapers and television every day, the harassment campaign 
at the Congress sessions, the entire burden of the decisions made, the hurt 
from people close to me who did not support me at the last minute, who didn't 
hold up, who deceived me -- I have had to bear all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also writes openly on a wide range of Kremlin tangles and snafus, 
doing little to dispel the impression that his government suffers from a 
chronic lack of coordination and professionalism. He even mentions how the 
TelePrompTer broke down when he was taping his critical speech last September 
dissolving the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks about his car accident, his plane accident, former Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi's criticism of his poor clothes style, a minister's 
attempts to link him to a Western businessman suspected of corrupting Russian 
officials. He admits to a great many mistakes but sounds convincing when he 
attributes them to circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 On government disorder, for example, he writes: "We had to figure out 
everything from the start. What was a vice president? How should a Russian 
constitutional court look? There was nothing but blank space because no such 
institution had previously existed in Russia. . . . We had to proceed not from 
how people did things somewhere else, but from our own experience. But we 
didn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
 Kremlinologists will have a field day with Yeltsin's detailed descriptions of 
how his close aide Viktor Ilyushin plans the president's days and overburdens 
his schedule. And history will surely make much of Yeltsin's description of the 
political intuition that moved him to sign the Russian-Ukrainian-Belarussian 
treaty that effectively dissolved the Soviet Union in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps I didn't completely fathom the prospects opening up before me, but I 
felt in my heart that such major decisions had to be taken easily, " he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 His candor includes leaks from KGB documents he inherited in the Kremlin, 
including a report alleging that three Texas oil tycoons ordered the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin acknowledges that he does not always take care of himself, but he 
offers no confirmation at all of widespread reports that he is ailing. "The 
main problem with being president is the constant sense that you are inside a 
glass bowl for everyone to see, or in a kind of barometric chamber with an 
artificial atmosphere where you must stay all the time," he notes. "Soon you 
have the sensation that you are swathed in cotton." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Yeltsin says as he ends the opus, "the chief goal of this restless 
president is Russia's tranquillity." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest push for peace has come in the form of his campaign for all of 
Russia's parties and social groups to sign a political truce, agreeing to 
refrain from strikes, violent protests and demands for early presidential 
elections for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact's signing was scheduled for today, but the going looked rocky after 
the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, demanded Wednesday that Yeltsin fire 
his interior minister in the wake of the apparently mob-related slaying of a 
36-year-old Duma deputy who had published a list of top crime leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some factions asked for the truce signing to be postponed because of the 
murder or rejected it altogether. Deputies also demanded a decisive crackdown 
by Yeltsin on crime. Yeltsin expressed his condolences and promised an 
investigation but appeared unlikely to fire his loyal interior minister.

MURDER COUNT AGAINST GIRL IS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Wednesday dismissed a murder charge against a Fremont teen-ager who 
wrote in her diary, "I killed my little sister!" 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was 14 when her 4-year-old half-sister died in August, 1992, was 
convicted of murder last year. But her conviction was overturned when a judge 
ruled that her first set of lawyers had represented her incompetently. 
</P>
<P>
 At her second trial, the 16-year-old had a new lawyer and a new judge, retired 
Siskiyou County Superior Court Judge James E. Kleaver. After the prosecution 
rested its case, Kleaver ruled Wednesday that the evidence failed to prove the 
girl's guilt of murder and ordered the charge dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," said Douglas Horngrad, the teen-ager's new lawyer. "For (the 
teen-ager), it's the end of a very long and awful nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's strongest evidence was the girl's diary entry which reads, in 
part: "Dear Diary, I have to get something off my back! I killed my little 
sister!" But in another diary entry, the girl wrote that she went into her 
sister's room, found the little girl unconscious and fetched her mother, 
Horngrad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's first lawyers, who included famed attorney Melvin Belli, did not 
offer evidence of that other diary entry at the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified that she had fabricated the apparent confession so her 
mother could have an answer to the puzzling death. Lawyers on both sides agreed 
that the teen-ager is deeply troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not surprised (by Kleaver's ruling) in that it was the right verdict 
and we felt from the beginning of the proceedings that we had a judge that was 
listening very carefully," Horngrad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Golde said he was disappointed by 
the judge's ruling Wednesday and believes that the teen-ager is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe that there's a secret in that house," Golde said. "The truth 
is hidden there. This girl was killed. . . . The truth is locked up between 
(the family)."

 A teen-ager accused of masterminding the 1992 New Year's Eve slaying of a high 
school honors student testified Wednesday that he helped four other youths 
bludgeon and bury the victim, but said he was only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, told an Orange County Superior Court jury that he joined in 
the slaying because he believed that his home might have been rigged with 
explosives by the victim, Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to kill him because of the bombs," said Chan, looking boyish in a pale 
yellow pullover sweater and gray slacks. "I had to participate in killing him 
because that was the only way to stop him, prevent him from blowing me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was the ringleader in the plot and thought Tay was about to double-cross 
him in a planned robbery of a computer salesman, the prosecution alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the defense, Chan is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who 
killed Tay because he believed that he must kill or be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, 17, of Orange, first contacted Chan in October, 1992, bragging about his 
access to high-powered explosives and other weaponry, Chan testified. Tay used 
an alias and portrayed himself as a 19-year-old crime figure who had more than 
100 loyal followers and the ability to pirate computer programs and counterfeit 
$100 bills, driver's licenses and credit cards, Chan told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said Tay had spies at his high school who reported back with personal 
information, including Chan's address, details about his clothing, even 
information about a cheerleader Chan had a crush on. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay claimed he was handpicking Chan as an associate he could trust, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed pretty powerful. . . . Obviously, he had the ability to find out 
information about me," Chan explained to jurors, adding that he felt he could 
not refuse to participate in the robbery. "I didn't want to upset him by saying 
no." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan testified that he tried to avoid contact with Tay, but said Tay 
threatened him with a "nasty" surprise. Chan said he later became convinced 
that his home had been rigged with powerful explosives by Tay and that Tay 
could kill him at the touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Mun 
Bong Kang, 19, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, both of Fullerton, are scheduled to go 
on trial after Chan's case concludes. The defendants attended Sunny Hills High 
School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was beaten before rubbing 
alcohol was forced down his throat and his mouth and nose were taped shut. He 
was buried in Acosta's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was a fifth assailant, Charles Choe, 18, of 
Fullerton, who testified that Chan plotted the murder and personally 
administered the alcohol and taped Tay's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Chan told jurors that it was Kang's idea to kill Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery scheme began to unravel, Chan said, when he began to fear a 
double-cross. When he told the others about his suspicions, he said, Kang 
suggested killing Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan told jurors that Acosta planned the attack and that Acosta and Kang 
landed the first blows. Chan said he only struck Tay twice and taped his mouth 
shut at Acosta's order. He insisted that he did not pour the alcohol down the 
victim's throat.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; CRUSADERS MOBILIZE TO SAVE SACRAMENTO'S SHADY CHARACTER; THE 
ENEMY OF THEIR PRIZED ELM TREES IS A DEADLY DISEASE BROUGHT INTO NEIGHBORHOODS 
BY A TINY BEETLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are times when the heat is unbearable here, when the brisk march of life 
slows to a woozy crawl. During those times, the people give thanks to the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them, Sacramento would be a pitiful place, just another flat, dreary 
smudge on California's dun-colored plain. With them, the locals can survive the 
broiling days of August -- and regale visitors with the dubious boast that 
their town is second only to Paris in per capita trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not well in the urban forest. Its beloved giant -- the elm -- is in 
peril, plagued by a beetle that threatens to turn the so-called City of Trees 
into the City of Stumps. 
</P>
<P>
 No bigger than a matchstick tip, the beetle infects its defenseless hosts with 
Dutch elm disease, a scourge that has decimated tree populations throughout the 
East and Midwest. If it continues to spread unchecked, the disease could wipe 
out half of Sacramento's 25,000 elms in the next 10 years. Already, 122 have 
succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the trees, our city would become a heat sink, another version of 
Bakersfield," said Marguerite Crouse, an elm-addicted retiree. "Imagine long 
blocks with the summer sun just pouring in. We'd be exposed, baked." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouse intends to ensure that this dreadful fate does not come to pass. When a 
state program that combatted Dutch elm disease was abolished last year, she got 
busy, mobilizing Sacramentans into a unique save-the-elms army. 
</P>
<P>
 Their intentions are noble, but their success is by no means assured. Dutch 
elm disease is a wily old beast, one that has confounded arborists since 1922, 
leaving 100 million ravaged tree corpses in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Pskowski is making his morning rounds, doing a few root inspections and 
examining some "suspect" elms for wilting or other signs of distress. Pskowski 
is Sacramento's municipal arborist. The health of 100,000 city-owned trees 
rests on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The elms are easy to spot, with girths bigger than a bear hug and towering 
lime-green crowns that soften the city's hard edges and bland walls. Aside from 
its beauty, the elm is a trooper among trees. Hardy, fast-growing and 
long-lived, it stands up well to the myriad abuses of city life. Cramped 
growing conditions, pollution, trunk wounds inflicted by careless drivers -- 
nothing fazes the mighty elm. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such traits, the trees were planted abundantly up through the 
1920s. Downtown, elms line block after block, their branches often arching to 
touch over the street. The leafy tunnels are aesthetically striking, but 
horticulturally hazardous: Dutch elm disease can spread from tree to tree 
through interwoven roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Pskowski has stopped his truck in a glaring patch of sun. "See that blank 
spot?" he says sadly, pointing to a pathetic strip of brownish grass that marks 
a break in a long row of cooling elms. "We lost two right there. Without them, 
the sun just beats right in. The whole picture is changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus carried on the feet of a beetle that 
burrows beneath a tree's bark to feed. Once infected, an elm releases a gooey 
gel, trying to block the fungus' spread. Instead, the goo merely clogs the 
tree's water-conducting vessels. Starved of liquid and nutrients, it dies 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
 First identified in the Netherlands in 1922, the disease made its U.S. debut 
in 1930, after crossing the sea with shipments of infested European elm logs. 
As the logs moved by rail from Atlantic ports to inland veneer mills, the 
fungus spread, eventually killing half the elms in the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 California was spared until 1975, when an ailing tree was found in Sonoma 
County. Since then, Dutch elm disease has made a steady march south as far as 
Gilroy, near Monterey. (So far, Southern California has escaped its blight. A 
single Beverly Hills elm tested positive in 1977, but no additional victims 
have been found.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Sacramento got hit, and tree deaths have increased exponentially here 
in the years since. Things are almost certain to get worse; a state program 
that deployed field crews to detect diseased elms was killed by budget cuts 
last summer, leaving cash-strapped cities and ill-trained homeowners to cope on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Rios, a pest specialist with the California Department of Forestry, is 
not optimistic: "Unless some miracle happens," he warns, "tree mortality will 
quickly increase and the disease will spread throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from Marguerite Crouse's home is a park, where a lively 
basketball game is under way almost every spring afternoon. Sixteen stately 
elms form a lush fringe around the grassy square. Crouse inspects the 
100-foot-tall trees several times each week. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired state budget analyst, she has reason to fear the Dutch elm plague. 
As a child in New Jersey, and later in Wisconsin, she watched as entire forests 
of urban elms were mowed down after the beetle moved in. "It was devastating," 
she recalled. "Elms are such noble, dignified trees. When they go, the place is 
never the same." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Crouse has launched a crusade to do what most American cities have 
failed to do -- save the elms. In a program reminiscent of the crime-fighting 
concept of Neighborhood Watch, she is training homeowners to identify at-risk 
elms so they can be speedily removed before the fungus spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also will hire crews -- perhaps youths from the California 
Conservation Corps -- to survey trees between May and September, when the 
beetles are most active. Though the disease can never be eliminated, Crouse 
hopes losses can be kept to 1% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The major hitch is money. The local utility, recognizing the energy-saving 
value of trees, has pitched in heartily, and the Sacramento Tree Foundation is 
helping out as well. But Crouse is still well short of her $150,000-a-year 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another danger is community inertia. Though Sacramentans love their trees, 
Crouse says, the elms "look so large and dependable, people just assume they 
will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Shaw-Connelly, for one, is already on board. She lives in a neighborhood 
called Elmhurst, on a boulevard where elms lock limbs to form a dense canopy a 
mile long. A Presbyterian minister, Shaw-Connelly believes trees are more than 
an attractive piece of landscape, more than an energy-conserving tool, more 
than a welcome friend in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trees," she says, "are a catalyst to form community. In places that have 
no trees, people stay in their air-conditioned houses. But here, we come out 
and mingle under this graceful canopy of shade. The trees allow us to get to 
know one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch elm disease struck Elmhurst in 1992, and two old giants on 
Shaw-Connelly's street have already died. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is grieving," she said, "real grieving, when a tree comes down. You 
know, it's just like losing a neighbor."

FIRM SAYS IT TRIED TO SAVE DMV COMPUTER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key contractor in a failed $44-million effort to upgrade the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles' computer systems said Wednesday that it met all 
the obligations of its contract and went out of its way to try to salvage the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spokesmen for Tandem Computer Corp. could not say why the six-year 
undertaking failed after such a large investment of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV said this week that it had shelved the project because it will not 
work. A legislative subcommittee has asked for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state office of the legislative analyst said the modernization project may 
have met with failure because it was too big for the DMV to manage properly. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV Director Frank Zolin said some computer parts might be salvageable and 
thus the public loss could be reduced to about $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblymen Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said it 
appears that DMV contracts with Tandem and another vendor, the accounting firm 
of Ernst & Young, failed to include strict performance standards and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Tandem said his company fulfilled its contract and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met those contractual obligations and worked with (DMV) to try to solve 
issues that were not part of our contractual obligations," said Tom Waldrop, an 
executive at Cupertino-based Tandem. "We were in fact accountable and did meet 
standards of performance." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Mort Meyerson, an executive of Ernst & Young, said his company 
and the DMV mutually terminated their contract four years ago. He said his 
company completed less than one year of a five-year agreement for computer 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not agree with the DMV on the future direction of the project. . . . 
We have no knowledge of what has happened since then," Meyerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldrop said Tandem was charged chiefly with providing basic hardware and 
certain software to enable the linking of driver's license information to motor 
vehicle registration data. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Nossoff, a DMV spokesman, said the Ernst & Young contract was jointly 
terminated when it "became evident that they seriously underestimated the work 
that needed to be done to complete the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked who is to blame for the expenditure of $44 million on a project that has 
no hope of working, Nossoff said the department "is not playing the blame 
game." But, he said, "if Tandem made any error it was in being too optimistic 
in 1991 that this project could be rescued. That's when it was supposed to be 
up and running."

PRODUCTION OF HUMAN ANTIBODIES IN MICE REPORTED; SCIENCE: TWO CALIFORNIA 
COMPANIES ACHIEVE A GENETIC ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGH. IT MAY ALLOW ADVANCES IN 
TREATMENT OF A WIDE VARIETY OF DISEASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development that could lead to major improvements in the treatment of 
autoimmune diseases, cancer, AIDS and organ rejection in humans, two California 
companies report today that they have been able to genetically engineer mice so 
that they produce human antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouse cells that produce these antibodies can then be grown in laboratory vats 
to produce large amounts of so-called monoclonal antibodies that, when given to 
patients, can attack and destroy diseased cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Monoclonal antibodies have shown great promise in treating many diseases in 
humans, but they suffer a major drawback: Existing monoclonals have all been 
produced in mice or other rodents, and the body quickly develops an immune 
reaction to them, limiting their use to only one or two treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The human antibodies, whose development is reported today in the British 
journals Nature and Nature Genetics, represent a major advance because they 
should not provoke an immune response in people, allowing long-term therapy 
with the biotechnology drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two companies have more studies to conduct in animals, they 
predict that trials in humans could begin as early as next year, probably for 
use in transplants and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a significant breakthrough," said UCLA immunologist Sherie L. 
Morrison. "They have really established the feasibility of a new way of making 
human antibodies." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really excited because this is a tremendous opportunity for new 
therapeutic agents," added molecular biologist Robert M. Kay, vice president 
for research and development at GenPharm International of Mountain View, one of 
the two companies. "We hope we will be able to treat diseases that we have not 
been able to adequately address in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The second company is Cell Genesys Inc. of Foster City. 
</P>
<P>
 Monoclonal antibodies were first produced 20 years ago, a feat that earned 
their creators a Nobel Prize. They are produced by fusing a single 
antibody-producing mouse spleen cell with a mouse tumor cell to produce a new 
cell known as a hybridoma. Hybridomas can be grown in vats to produce large 
quantities of the antibody and, because of their heritage from the cancer 
cells, are effectively immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 Human hybridomas cannot be readily produced, however, because it would be 
necessary to inject a human volunteer with the disease-related chemical or cell 
that researchers desire to produce an antibody against; then they would have to 
remove the spleen to isolate the few cells that produce antibodies against that 
specific substance. Neither act is ethically defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 GenPharm and Cell Genesys achieved their feats in a similar fashion. In both 
cases, they disabled the mouse genes that produce antibodies and replaced them 
with comparable human genes. The human antibodies thus become a functioning 
part of the mouse's own immune system. The process involves sophisticated 
genetic engineering techniques that have not been available until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new developments are substantially different from earlier feats in which 
intact human immune systems were produced in mice by injecting human bone 
marrow and other tissue into mice with no immune system of their own. Although 
those mice are valuable in their own right, they cannot be used to produce 
monoclonal antibodies. The production of monoclonal antibodies is viewed as one 
of the areas of greatest growth potential in the biotechnology industry. 
According to a recent estimate by Frost & Sullivan Market Intelligence of 
Mountain View, sales of the proteins totaled $740 million in 1993 and are 
expected to grow to $3.8 billion by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those commercial monoclonal antibodies are used for medical imaging. 
When injected into a cancer patient, for example, the appropriate monoclonal 
antibody will bind to the tumor cells, showing them up more clearly on X-rays. 
The proteins are also widely used in laboratory diagnostic tests to help 
physicians determine the concentration of important chemicals in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 But their use in therapy has been limited so far. The most successful product 
is an antibody called OKT3 that is used to suppress rejection episodes in organ 
transplant recipients. Although it is very successful, OKT3 can generally be 
used only once in a given patient because of the immune response against it. 
Transplant surgeons hope the development of human monoclonal antibodies will 
allow a comparable drug to be used repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many different monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer are also in 
various stages of testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay said his company has already used the genetically engineered mice to 
produce human monoclonal antibodies against CD4, an immune cell that plays a 
crucial role in autoimmune diseases; against immunoglobulin E, which mediates 
allergic reactions; and against carcinoembryonic antigen, a distinctive marker 
found on the surfaces of colon and ovarian cancer cells. GenPharm plans to 
begin animal studies with the antibodies as soon as possible, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cell Genesys said it is now immunizing its mice in an attempt to produce 
antibodies against a variety of human proteins.

JAPAN JET CRASH INVESTIGATORS HUNT FOR CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators combed the wreckage of a Taiwanese jetliner, questioned air 
traffic controllers and confiscated airline documents Wednesday in a search for 
clues to the cause of a crash at Nagoya airport that killed 262 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the Tuesday night crash of a China Airlines A300-600R Airbus 
focused on two issues: Why did the pilot try to abort his landing? And once he 
decided to make a second approach, why did the airplane lose power and crash 
about 200 yards short of the runway? 
</P>
<P>
 Two witnesses quoted on NHK television Wednesday said the aircraft's approach 
was higher than usual, which could mean the pilot feared that he would 
overshoot the correct landing spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But control tower staff were quoted saying the height of the approach was 
normal. About 30 seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic control 
that he was aborting the landing and would circle around for a second try. That 
was his final communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt at a sudden climb apparently caused engine trouble -- either 
engine failure or explosions or both, according to witnesses and investigators. 
Speculation by Transportation Ministry officials and outside experts focused on 
the possibility that the jetliner's sudden climb prevented at least one engine 
from getting enough air to keep running. 
</P>
<P>
 The airplane's voice and flight recorders, which should shed further light on 
these questions, were recovered from the tangled wreckage, officials said. But 
analysis of that information will take days. 
</P>
<P>
 A young woman who had been pulled from the wreckage alive died in a hospital 
Wednesday afternoon, reducing the survivors to nine. Several other survivors 
remained in critical condition. The crash was the 10th-worst disaster in world 
commercial aviation history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which resigned en 
masse Monday to make way for the election of new Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata, 
is continuing to function in order to deal with the Airbus tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito said that among the questions the 
government wants answered is, "Why did the plane end up in such a disintegrated 
state?" One large section of fuselage remained intact, but the rest of the 
aircraft shattered into pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine survivors had all been seated in the front of the cabin, said Hiroshi 
Fujiwara, former head of the Transportation Ministry's Aircraft Accident 
Investigation Committee. This indicated that the tail of the airplane suffered 
the greater impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the jetliner's manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, said three 
engineers had left France for Nagoya to join the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survivors were Yuji Nakayama, 6, and his brother Seiji, 3, both 
hospitalized in serious condition. Their mother and uncle died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nothing but a miracle," Sadashige Kikuyama, a firefighter who pulled 
one of the boys from the burning wreck, told reporters. "He was caught under 
the plane's tires. I just happened to hear this faint call of a boy saying, 
'Mama, Mama. It hurts.' "

MOTHER OF TEEN WHO FACES CANING HOPES FOR REPRIEVE, FEELS 'BETRAYED'; ASIA: 
RANDY CHAN INSISTS HER SON IS INNOCENT. HER 'BIGGEST MISTAKE' WAS KEEPING QUIET 
ABOUT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As in those melodramatic prison movies of the 1930s, Randy Chan hovers close 
to a telephone, hoping against hope that she will receive the call informing 
her that her son, Michael P. Fay, has miraculously won a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings almost constantly in the Chans' comfortable condominium here. 
But it is not the Singapore government calling. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls -- from everywhere from Dayton, Ohio, to New Delhi -- are mostly 
reporters phoning to discuss the interest stirred up after Fay, 18, was 
sentenced to a flogging for vandalism. He was one of five foreign teen-agers 
charged with spray-painting cars, throwing eggs and possessing stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a puzzle from day one," Chan, a St. Louis native, said in an 
interview. "I think they decided to make an example of not just Michael but 
this group. The Singaporeans are trying to make a point that Western crime is 
rampant and 'Look what happens if you do this here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Fay case has become an anomaly of the day, a media "feeding frenzy" fueled 
in large measure, according to opinion polls, by widespread anger with the 
crime rate in the United States. Whatever the cause, a crime so minor that had 
it been committed in the United States it would hardly merit a paragraph in a 
local newspaper has become the subject of editorials, talk shows and furious 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very frustrated," Chan added. "It's difficult to tell the whole 
story in a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, a lot of people are looking 
at it as a severe spanking. I don't think most people know what is involved." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, most newspapers have carried graphic descriptions of the punishment to 
which Fay has been sentenced: six strokes of a half-inch rattan cane, moistened 
in water to prevent it from splitting and wielded by a hefty prison officer. 
According to Singapore newspaper accounts, the caning flays the buttocks, often 
sends prisoners into shock and leaves permanent scarring. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of the sentence prompted President Clinton to describe the 
punishment as extreme; he has written to President Ong Teng Cheong in support 
of Fay's clemency appeal, his last chance to escape the cane. Ong is expected 
to give his formal reply in the next day or two, but the government has left no 
doubt that the sentence will be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her son pleaded guilty to the charges, Chan insisted that Michael is 
innocent of vandalism and that he was compelled to sign a confession by police 
after nine days of questioning and mistreatment last October. The Singapore 
police have vehemently denied abusing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, the family was led to believe that a guilty plea would result 
in a short jail sentence without caning, and they took what they assumed to be 
the easy option. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we were going to be betrayed by anybody, and we were," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was "one of the greatest mistakes I ever made" that she remained 
silent after her son's arrest and mistreatment, but she had been warned not to 
make the Singapore authorities lose face or they would be hard on her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was charged with two counts of vandalism, which carry a mandatory caning 
sentence in Singapore. According to research by the State Department, the 
vandalism laws have never before been used in cases involving private property. 
The Singapore government insists that Fay has not been singled out for special 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan returned to the United States after the sentencing and went on the 
talk-show circuit to drum up support for her son. She became an overnight 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who separated from Michael's father in 1983, moved to Singapore three 
years ago with her current husband, Marco Chan, an executive with Federal 
Express, the U.S. courier company. After visiting the couple during his 
sophomore year, Michael decided to finish high school in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael was never a distinguished student, she acknowledged, because of what 
was diagnosed as attention deficit disorder, a neurological ailment that can 
cause bright youngsters to be impulsive and have trouble adapting to the 
discipline of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said that after Michael was sentenced to be caned, "the stress was 
getting unbearable," and she and her husband placed him in a hospital. His 
psychiatrist expressed concern about suicidal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Government-controlled Singapore newspapers have been gleefully reporting 
expressions of support for the Singapore government, especially from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not going to get me down. They are not going to get Michael down 
either," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that after Michael serves his sentence, the family will leave 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be over when it's over," Chan said. "I never want to see 
this happen again. I'm not going to forget what they did."

ENVIRONMENT; EPA CHIEF AIMING TO BRING URBAN WATERWAYS BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anacostia River was once a proud urban waterway that flowed through the 
nation's capital and boasted a deep-water tobacco port and a rich diversity of 
fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency recently gazed into this 
smelly brown river and, surrounded by excited sixth-graders, pronounced it a 
symbol of the nation's dying waters and its moldering urban environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rivers like this used to be cities' cultural centers, but now they're just 
dead," EPA Administrator Carol Browner said. "Our cities can no longer make use 
of these rivers. People can't swim in them; they can't fish from them; they 
can't come down and spend an afternoon on their banks. The nation's urban 
communities deserve to have their lakes and rivers back." 
</P>
<P>
 Browner's field trip to the blighted Anacostia River, which runs for 20 miles 
through a string of minority communities, was designed to dramatize the Clinton 
Administration's new commitment to cleaning up the nation's degraded waterways 
and to lessening the burden of pollution on urban populations and people of 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ability of rivers to provide water, ease transportation and carry 
away waste, cities historically sprang up beside them. Today, however, most 
urban rivers are muddied by silt and agricultural chemicals from pastures 
upstream, befouled by the runoff of city street grime and burdened by 
industrial density along their banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, like the Los Angeles River -- which an environmental group recently 
designated as threatened -- have been muscled into concrete channels by the 
Army Corps of Engineers, frequently in an effort to control floods. And 
virtually all urban rivers have been stripped of what Browner called "their 
kidneys," as adjoining wetlands, which help purify river water, have been 
filled in to make way for housing developments and industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes not only have transformed the appearance of urban rivers -- 
which often look more like wall-edged channels than meandering waterways -- but 
also have changed the way they flow and operate as living, self-cleansing 
organisms. The Anacostia, like many urban rivers, is so muddy from silt and so 
polluted that its bottom has virtually no vegetation. Without vegetation, fish 
have no place to live and feed. Waterfowl who feed on fish disappear. Rivers 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, industries on city rivers frequently dump toxic 
chemicals into the water during heavy rains or flooding. The EPA's inventory of 
toxic releases showed that 273 million pounds of dangerous chemical waste were 
discharged into rivers and streams in 1992 -- an increase of 12% over 1991. 
That increase is attributed to runoff releases from four fertilizer facilities 
in Louisiana and Texas during heavy rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner said she understands how children from the district's northeast 
quarter could grow up believing that all rivers are like the Anacostia River 
they see within the city's limits. Browner grew up in Miami, where the Army 
Corps of Engineers has put most water flows within concrete walls, and said she 
was 10 years old before she learned that rivers were not all encased in 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Browner, the EPA and several other federal agencies have proposed to use 
the Anacostia River to launch a model program of "watershed management" in 
urban areas. With a proposed federal budget of $2.3 million and additional 
funding from Maryland and D.C. city governments, the EPA plans to help clean 
the Anacostia by restoring wetlands along the river's banks to their natural 
state and developing more effective ways to ensure that the runoff from city 
streets and local industries does not flow untreated into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, two bills that the 
Administration is pressing for Congress to approve this session, also would 
have a dramatic effect on urban rivers, officials said. The Clean Water Act 
would make between $2.5 billion and $7 billion available as loans to state and 
local governments to build pipes and treatment plants capable of handling the 
trash-strewn sewage overflow that many cities suffer during heavy rains.

CULTURE; ALASKA TV SHOW PLUGS INTO LIFE IN NATIVE VILLAGES; 'HEARTBEAT ALASKA' 
ATTRACTS A HUGE AUDIENCE WITH A HOMESPUN MIX OF NEWS AND AMATEUR VIDEOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HULEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 6:30 on Sunday night, and in more than 200 villages across Alaska, people 
are settling in to watch the most popular TV program in the bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture shows indigenous hunters getting ready for their spring pursuit of 
bowhead whales in the Arctic Ocean. A middle-aged Inupiat man talks to the 
camera as he helps stretch rubbery seal hide over a wooden boat frame. 
</P>
<P>
 The next segment reports on the only Eskimo dog-musher to run in this year's 
1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. That's followed by news from Toksook 
Bay -- homemade video from a meeting of Yupik-speaking elders talking about how 
to keep their traditional culture alive in the age of computers and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a typical edition of "Heartbeat Alaska" -- part home movies, part news 
magazine, part community meeting for a community twice the size of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only statewide TV program owned and produced by indigenous Alaskans, 
and viewers tune in by the tens of thousands every week. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's homespun look at everyday village life has begun attracting an 
audience outside Alaska as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has been around village Alaska for 20 years or so, ever since the 
state government used part of its newfound oil wealth in the 1970s to set up a 
satellite channel to beam everything from "Dallas" to "Sesame Street" to the 
state's tiny communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, people in many native villages -- places with names like Klawock and 
Kaktovik and Kwigillingok -- pass the winters watching HBO, CNN and ESPN. 
Village children are as likely to know the latest Mariah Carey hit as the 
traditional songs of their grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 While TV has become a link to the modern world, many villagers say they think 
that it has contributed to the erosion of native languages and cultures. Until 
now, native children turning on the TV had not been able to see their own world 
-- or anything even resembling it. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which explains why the friendly, non-show biz feel of "Heartbeat 
Alaska" has struck a chord with a lot of people in the villages. The home 
videos might be shaky and the sound muffled. The hosts have been known to sit 
behind their desk munching on wild berries, dried seal meat and smoked salmon 
sent in by viewers. It's all part of the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to be sexy or hot or trendy," said Jeanie Greene, the 
program's creator, producer and main host. "We don't have to sit here and be 
the final authority or look a certain way. We're just showing what it's like 
out there and listening to people and allowing native people to get their own 
stories on television. It's interesting. No one's ever done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute, weekly program is the vision of Greene, a 41-year-old Inupiat 
with a degree in theater who spent 10 years working in local television. 
</P>
<P>
 It started as a twice-a-week segment on an Anchorage newscast. About two years 
ago, Greene decided to break away and form her own production company. Using 
secondhand equipment in the living room of her apartment, she and a cousin -- 
her engineer/cameraman -- started putting together "Heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 The state satellite channel picked it up, and the show took off. Today, it 
also airs on commercial stations in Anchorage and Fairbanks, across five time 
zones on the Television Northern Canada network, on a station in Nuuk, 
Greenland, and on the Navajo Nation channel in Window Rock, Ariz. The program 
has fans in the Russian Far East, who pick it up from the Alaska satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical episode features a story by Greene on, say, proposed cuts in funding 
for rural Alaska college campuses or the difficulty native dog-mushers have 
finding sponsors for competitive races. There's a weekly roundup of native news 
from across North America and reports sent in by professional TV studios in two 
of the larger Alaska villages. The show tackles tough topics, such as village 
alcoholism, suicide and the lack of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's heart and soul are the videos sent in by viewers, whom Greene uses 
like an army of correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what's on TV is pretty ridiculous," said Shirley Goldy, a Inupiat 
social worker from the village of Kotzebue. "This program shows people, kids 
especially, it shows them it's OK to be native. . . . I think it's helping 
people get their respect back."

<P>
 Dozens of orphans, some maimed in machete attacks, were evacuated from Rwanda 
on Wednesday, and fighting raged between army and rebel forces in the capital, 
U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations took 44 orphans to Uganda, including 20 who were seriously 
wounded.Many of the children's arms and legs were cut off in attacks on an 
orphanage in Muhura, about 22 miles northeast of Kigali, the Rwandan capital, 
officials with the U.N. World Food Program said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children range in age from a few weeks to 11 years, said Trevor Page, 
World Food Program coordinator in Kampala, Uganda. Sixteen nuns, nurses and 
workers at the orphanage were also evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the attackers was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers estimate that the violence between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups 
has killed 100,000 people and forced 1.3 million to flee their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloodletting began after the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi -- both 
Hutus -- were killed in a plane crash April 6.

U.S. SEEKS TO HOLD LINE ON IRAQ EMBARGO; MIDEAST: CHRISTOPHER, GULF STATES 
PRESENT UNITED FRONT AGAINST PRESSURE TO EASE SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and six Persian Gulf monarchies launched a counteroffensive 
Wednesday against growing international pressure to ease economic sanctions 
against Iraq, just one day after Baghdad agreed to accelerate steps required to 
lift the three-year embargo against it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first stop of his Middle East swing, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher held talks with six foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council to "unanimously and strongly express our common resolve to maintain the 
sanctions until Iraq complies fully with all U.N. resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
 But three of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, 
Russia and China -- are either pushing for a schedule to lift the oil embargo 
as the first step in ending the broader sanctions or are neutral on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 France and Russia are reportedly interested in exploring lucrative trade deals 
with Baghdad after the oil embargo is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey, which borders Iraq and was a key member of the U.S.-led coalition in 
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, has also been pressuring the United States to ease 
the embargo. Use of Turkey's oil pipeline from Iraq to the Mediterranean has 
been frozen for three years, costing more than $100 million and further 
crippling Ankara's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, which is reviewed every 60 days, is due for discussion at the 
United Nations again early next month. U.S. officials have been concerned that 
the push to end the oil embargo could lead to a phased plan that would ease the 
political and economic squeeze on the regime of President Saddam Hussein. "Once 
you start talking about deadlines or ways to end the embargo, then the game is 
up," one senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among many ongoing violations, Christopher specifically cited Iraq's 
suppression of its own citizens; its refusal to recognize Kuwait's independence 
or borders, and its promotion of terrorism, most recently in the assassination 
this month of a leading Iraqi dissident in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our resolve to defend this interest against aggression from any quarter is as 
strong today as it was when the United States led the coalition effort to 
liberate Kuwait from Iraq's aggression," Christopher said at a news conference 
here. "We remain vigilant and determined. We are conscious that the region is 
far from free of threats." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks in Riyadh came a day before a report is due at the Security Council 
from Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq, on Baghdad's 
progress in complying with various U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 After talks in Iraq on Tuesday, Ekeus and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik 
Aziz agreed to expedite efforts to create an arms-monitoring program to prevent 
Baghdad from developing weapons of mass destruction, a key condition for 
lifting sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint statement expressed appreciation from the Special Commission and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency "for Iraq's expeditious and positive 
responses to their requests for assistance and support." 
</P>
<P>
 Ekeus has also said recently that Iraq is cooperating with U.N. monitors, in 
contrast to its obstruction of the inspectors in the early days of their work. 
In recent weeks, the United Nations has increased the number of monitors 
inspecting Iraqi installations and has begun installing equipment, including 
cameras and sensors, at critical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials say they are very skeptical about Iraq's compliance and 
intentions. Baghdad "retains the desire to threaten its neighbors and U.S. 
interests (and) has no apparent intention of actually giving up its 
determination to retain its weapons of mass destruction," Ronald Neumann, the 
State Department's director of Gulf affairs, said recently in a speech in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe the next 18 to 24 months will be critical in 
determining if the Hussein regime can survive economically -- and therefore 
politically. At the time of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was estimated to 
have between $5 billion and $7 billion in foreign exchange reserves. But 
because of the sanctions, Baghdad is now believed to have gone through much of 
its reserves. Its oil-based economy is deteriorating seriously, with widespread 
shortages of basic goods.

GIRL GETS $3,730 IN KIDDIE BANK HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old girl stole $3,730 from a bank by simply grabbing bagfuls of 
money from the counter, court officials in Dundee, Scotland, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was not about to share the loot with her 12-year-old male accomplice 
-- she gave him just one pound ($1.50) to buy candy. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the girl admitted stealing the money last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found a rucksack containing about a third of the stolen money in the 
girl's house, the court was told Tuesday. The girl told police she had spent 
some of her haul and buried the rest. It was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who pleaded guilty to a charge of receiving $3,730, was given one bag 
of money by the girl outside the bank. But on the way home, she retrieved it 
and gave him a one-pound coin to buy candy, the court heard. The two will be 
sentenced in three weeks.

NATO SATISFIED WITH SERBIAN COMPLIANCE IN GORAZDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meeting for the first time since they issued a series of ultimatums to Bosnian 
Serb forces last week to loosen their grip on the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, 
NATO ambassadors here Wednesday pronounced themselves basically satisfied with 
the rebels' response. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is general compliance with the deadline set by the alliance . . . for 
the removal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons from a 20-kilometer (12-mile) 
exclusion zone around Gorazde" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said an official for the 
16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "This development gives hope for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambassadors convened at NATO headquarters Wednesday morning about eight 
hours after the expiration of the second of two alliance deadlines that were 
contained in an ultimatum issued to Bosnian Serb forces last Friday under the 
threat of air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first deadline, which expired Sunday morning, required Serbian forces to 
withdraw to a distance of at least 1.9 miles from the city center. The second 
deadline, which came Wednesday morning, demanded that the Bosnian Serbs 
withdraw to a distance of 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO official said the ambassadors' assessment was based on information 
gathered by U.N. forces in Bosnia and by NATO's Southern Command, which is 
based in Naples, Italy, and responsible for alliance military operations in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between NATO and the United Nations on the extent of Bosnian 
compliance with the ultimatum stood in sharp contrast to major differences 
between the two that surfaced Saturday when the United Nations first delayed 
and then refused a NATO request to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb guns 
that had continued to pound Gorazde in defiance of alliance demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday that a newly 
formed group on the Balkans -- which brings together the United States, the 
United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- could meet at the foreign 
minister level in Geneva as early as next week to discuss steps to achieve a 
permanent cease-fire and a political settlement in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Christopher said group 
representatives were exploring options for peace and are scheduled to begin 
talks today in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a particular moment when we may have an opportunity to make some real 
progress against the background of the apparent success of the NATO ultimatum 
in Gorazde," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gorazde on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that aid workers were 
struggling to restore a semblance of normal life to the battered city. The 
three-week Serbian pounding of the enclave destroyed its water plant, wrecked 
its hospital and stranded thousands of hungry refugees whose villages were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where to accommodate 12,000 people is the key question in Gorazde these 
days," Fahrudin Becic, a ham radio operator, said in a broadcast monitored in 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde is the center of a 130-square-mile U.N.-declared haven holding about 
65,000 people. A worker in Gorazde for the U.N. Children's Fund estimated that 
35,000 to 50,000 people are in the city, up to half of them refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Becic and another local ham radio operator, Enes Musovic, disputed U.N. 
contentions that Serbs had all but left the exclusion zone, the AP said. 
Musovic said Serbian forces shelled the village of Osanica, seven miles 
southwest of central Gorazde, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations on Wednesday, the Security Council approved the 
deployment of 6,550 more peacekeeping troops to protect the U.N.-designated 
safe areas in Bosnia after the United States dropped objections to an expanded 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall reported from Brussels and Wright from Riyadh.

 "I really feel like I've lost an old friend even though we were bitter 
political enemies through the years. . . . Richard Nixon has been around so 
long, and in my case at least for a time my own career has been intertwined 
with his. I made my peace with him long ago. I really have the feeling that an 
old friend has left the scene. . . . I watched him on television three or four 
weeks ago when he was in Moscow. He was walking with great difficulty and was 
stooped over, and I must say it touched me to see this old man, 81 years of 
age, still trying to figure out what these Russians are all about."

 "This occasion is a very sad one because of my long and very close personal 
friendship with President Nixon. (Pardoning him) was the right thing to do at 
the time. History will show it was the right thing for the country. I'm very 
pleased I took that affirmative action."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; EXCERPTS: 'HE STOOD ON PINNACLES THAT DISSOLVED INTO 
PRECIPICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Here are excerpts from the eulogies delivered Wednesday at the funeral of 
former President Richard Nixon: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Billy Graham 
</P>
<P>
 The great king of ancient Israel, David, said on the death of Saul who had 
been a bitter enemy, "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen 
this day in Israel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Today we remember that, with the death of Richard Nixon, a great man has 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 We've heard that the world has lost a great citizen and America has lost a 
great statesman, and those of us that knew him have lost a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, few events touch the heart of every American as profoundly as the 
death of a President. For the President is our leader, and every American feels 
he knows him in a very special way, because he hears his voice so often, sees 
him on television, reads about him in the press. And so we all mourn his loss 
and feel that our world is a bit lonelier without him. 
</P>
<P>
 But to you who were close to him, this grief is an added pain, because you 
wept when he wept and you laughed when he laughed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, he had had a brilliant young cardiologist as his doctor by the 
name of Jeffrey Borer. And last Tuesday, the day after the President suffered 
his stroke, the doctor came by the New York hospital to examine him. He was 
partially paralyzed and could not speak, but he was still alert. And as the 
doctor talked, the President reached out and grabbed his arm with an unusual 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Then as the doctor turned to leave, something made him turn around and look 
back to the bed where Richard Nixon was laying. At just at that moment, the 
President waved and gave his trademark thumbs-up signal and smiled. That took 
determination, which he had and we've heard about already today. It was an 
example of fighting on and never giving up that Jeffrey Borer will never 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, President Nixon's great voice, his warm, intelligent eyes, his generous 
smile are missed as we gather here again just 10 months after we were here when 
his beloved Pat went to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, he was asked in a television interview, "How would you like 
to be remembered?" He thought a moment, and then he replied, "I'd like to be 
remembered as one who made a difference." And he did make a difference in our 
world. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No one could ever understand Richard Nixon unless they understood the family 
from which he came, the Quaker church that he attended, Whittier College where 
he studied, and the land and the people in this area where you are sitting 
today. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But there is still another side to him that was his strong and growing faith 
in God. He never wore his religious faith on his sleeves, but was rather 
reticent to speak about it in public. He could have had more reasons than most 
for not attending church while he occupied the White House when there were so 
many demonstrations and threats going on, but he wanted to set an example, and 
he decided to have services most Sundays in the White House -- a small 
congregation, a clergyman from various denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 And I remember before one of the first services that President Nixon had at 
the White House, Ruth and I and two of our friends were in the private quarters 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll never forget the President sitting down on the spur of the moment at an 
old, battered Steinway that they had there, playing the old hymn, "He will hold 
me fast, for my Savior loves me so. He will hold me fast." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And so we say farewell to Richard Nixon today with hope in our hearts, for our 
hope is in the eternal promises of Almighty God. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is hope beyond the grave, because Jesus Christ has opened the door to 
heaven for us by his death and resurrection. Richard Nixon had that hope, and 
today that can be our hope as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the children and the grandchildren, I would say to you, you have that 
hope within your hearts. I had the privilege of knowing them when they were 
little girls, and I've seen them as they've come to know Christ and to know God 
in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And we look forward to seeing Dick and Pat some day in the future again. Henry 
A. Kissinger 
</P>
<P>
 During the final week of Richard Nixon's life, I often imagined how he would 
have reacted to the tide of concern, respect, admiration and affection evoked 
by his last great battle. His gruff pose of never paying attention to media 
comment would have been contradicted by a warm glow and the ever-so-subtle hint 
that another recital of the commentary would not be unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 And without quite saying so, he would have conveyed that it would mean a lot 
to him if Julie and Tricia, David and Ed were told of his friends' pride in 
this culmination to an astonishing life. 
</P>
<P>
 When I learned the final news, by then so expected yet so hard to accept, I 
felt a profound void. In the words of Shakespeare: "He was man. Take him, for 
all in all, I shall not look upon his like again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the conduct of foreign policy, Richard Nixon was one of the seminal 
presidents. He came into office when the forces of history were moving America 
from a position of dominance to one of leadership. Dominance reflects strength; 
leadership must be earned. And Richard Nixon earned that leadership role for 
his country with courage, dedication and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard Nixon took his oath of office, 550,000 Americans were engaged in 
combat in a place as far away from the United States as it was possible to be. 
America had no contact with China, the world's most populous nation, no 
negotiations with the Soviet Union, the other nuclear superpower. Most Muslim 
countries had broken diplomatic relations with the United States, and Middle 
East diplomacy was stalemated. All of this in the midst of the most anguishing 
domestic crisis since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard Nixon left office, an agreement to end the war in Vietnam had 
been concluded, and the main lines of all subsequent policy were established -- 
permanent dialogue with China; readiness without illusion to ease tension with 
the Soviet Union; a peace process in the Middle East; the beginning, via the 
European Security Conference, of establishing human rights as an international 
issue, weakening Soviet hold on Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon's foreign policy goals were long-range, and he pursued them 
without regard to domestic political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 When he considered our nation's interest at stake, he dared confrontations 
despite the imminence of elections and also in the midst of the worst crisis of 
his life. And he bore, if with some pain, the disapproval of longtime friends 
and allies over relaxing tensions with China and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 He drew strength from a conviction he often expressed to me: "The price for 
doing things halfway is no less than for doing it completely, so we might as 
well do them properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Richard Nixon's greatest accomplishment was as much moral as it was 
political: to lead from strength at a moment of apparent weakness, to husband a 
nation's resilience and thus to lay the basis for victory in the Cold War. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 So let us now say goodby to our gallant friend. He stood on pinnacles that 
dissolved into precipice. He achieved greatly, and he suffered deeply, but he 
never gave up. In his solitude, he envisaged a new international order that 
would reduce lingering enmities, strengthen historic friendships, and give new 
hope to mankind -- a vision where dreams and possibilities conjoined. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon ended a war, and advanced the vision of peace of his Quaker 
youth. He was devoted to his family. He loved his country. And he considered 
service his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a privilege to have been allowed to help him. Sen. Bob Dole 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the second half of the 20th Century will be known as the age of 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was he the most durable public figure of our time? Not because he gave the 
most eloquent speeches, but because he provided the most effective leadership. 
Not because he won every battle, but because he always embodied the deepest 
feelings of the people he led. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his biographers said that Richard Nixon was "one of us." And so he was. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a boy who heard the train whistle in the night and dreamed of all the 
distant places that lay at the end of the track. How American. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the grocer's son who got ahead by working harder and longer than 
everyone else. How American. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a student who met expenses by doing research at the law library for 35 
cents an hour while sharing a run-down farmhouse without water or electricity. 
How American. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the husband and father who said that the best memorial to his wife was 
her children. How American. 
</P>
<P>
 To tens of millions of his countrymen, Richard Nixon was an American hero, a 
hero who shared and honored their belief in working hard, worshiping God, 
loving their families and saluting the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 He called them the Silent Majority. Like them, they valued accomplishment more 
than ideology. They wanted their government to do the decent thing, but not to 
bankrupt them in the process. They wanted his protection in a dangerous world, 
but they also wanted creative statesmanship in achieving a genuine peace with 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the people from whom he had come and who have come to Yorba Linda 
these past few days by the tens of thousands, no longer silent in their grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The American people love a fighter, and in Dick Nixon they found a gallant 
one. In her marvelous biography of her mother, Julie recalls an occasion where 
Pat Nixon expressed amazement at her husband's ability to persevere in the face 
of criticism -- to which the President replied, "I just get up every morning to 
confound my enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 It was what Richard Nixon did after he got up every morning that not just 
confounded his enemies, but turned them into admirers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Today our grief is shared by millions of people the world over, but it is also 
mingled with intense pride in a great patriot who never gave up and who never 
gave in. To know the secret of Richard Nixon's relationship with the American 
people, you need only to listen to his own words. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must never be satisfied with success," he told us, "and you should never 
be discouraged by failure. Failure can be sad, but the greatest sadness is not 
to try and fail, but to fail to try. In the end what matters is that you have 
always lived life to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong, brave, unafraid of controversy, unyielding in his convictions, living 
every day of his life to the hilt, the largest figure of our time whose 
influence will be timeless -- that was Richard Nixon. How American. . . . 
President Clinton 
</P>
<P>
 President Nixon opened his memoirs with a simple sentence: I was born in a 
house my father built. Today we can look back at this little house and still 
imagine a young boy sitting by the window of the attic he shared with his three 
brothers, looking out to a world he could then, himself, only imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 From those humble roots, as from so many humble beginnings in this country, 
grew the force of a driving dream, a dream that led to the remarkable journey 
that ends here today where it all began -- beside the same tiny home 
mail-ordered from back East, near this towering oak tree which back then was a 
mere seedling. 
</P>
<P>
 President Nixon's journey across the American landscape mirrored that of his 
entire nation in this remarkable century. His life was bound up with the 
striving of our whole people, with our crises and our triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became President, he took on challenges here at home on matters from 
cancer research to environmental protection, putting the power of the federal 
government where Republicans and Democrats had neglected to put it in the past, 
in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to the presidency at a time in our history when Americans were tempted 
to say we had had enough of the world. Instead, he knew we had to reach out to 
old friends and old enemies alike. He would not allow America to quit the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, he wrote nine of his 10 books after he left the presidency, 
working his way back into the arena he so loved by writing and thinking and 
engaging us in his dialogue for the past year. Even in the final weeks of his 
life, he gave me his wise counsel, especially with regard to Russia. One thing 
in particular left a profound impression on me. Though this man was in his 
ninth decade, he had an incredibly sharp and vigorous and rigorous mind. 
</P>
<P>
 As a public man, he always seemed to believe the greatest sin was remaining 
passive in the face of challenges, and he never stopped living by that creed. 
He gave of himself with intelligence and energy and devotion to duty, and his 
entire country owes him a debt of gratitude for that service. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, he knew great controversy amid defeat as well as victory. He made 
mistakes, and they, like his accomplishments, are part of his life and record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the enduring lesson of Richard Nixon is that he never gave up being part 
of the action and passion of his times. He said many times that unless a person 
has a goal, a new mountain to climb, his spirit will die. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, based on our last phone conversation and the letter he wrote me just a 
month ago, I can say that his spirit was very much alive to the very end. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Today is a day for his family, his friends and his nation to remember 
President Nixon's life in totality. To them let us say: May the day of judging 
President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a 
close. May we heed his call to maintain the will and the wisdom to build on 
America's greatest gift, its freedom, to lead a world full of difficulty to the 
just and lasting peace he dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is written in the words of a hymn I heard in my church last Sunday, 
"Grant that I may realize that the trifling of life creates differences, but 
that in the higher things, we are all one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the twilight of his life, President Nixon knew that lesson well. It is, I 
feel certain, a faith he would want us all to keep. . . . Gov. Pete Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 . . . I was one of the many young men and women in whom he (Nixon) inspired 
the same fierce loyalty that he gave to us. From the first, I was struck by the 
quality of his personal generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 When we met in 1962, he'd already debated Khrushchev and President Kennedy, 
he'd already run for President. He'd been a major political figure on the world 
stage. But still he had time to talk to and to help an eager young advance man 
who could offer him little but energy and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the fall of 1965, when I was 32, he honored me by asking me to come 
to work with him on his potential bid for the presidency in 1968. But he'd 
heard from Bob Finch and Herb Klein that I was thinking about running for 
office myself. I told him it was true, and he grinned. He grinned and he said, 
in that deep, rich voice of his, "Is it a good district? Can you win?" And then 
he said, "Because if you can, then, Pete, you've got to try or you'll never 
forgive yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 I was just another young lawyer trying to find his way in the world, and he 
was a former vice president preparing a bid for the highest office in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, that day he was as concerned with my future as he was with his own. 
Time and again -- not just with me, but with many others -- he was always 
there, willing to share his insight and his experience, and no American in this 
century had more of either to share. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine a world without Richard Nixon. For half a century, he 
played a leading role in shaping the events that have shaped our lives. It's 
not just that he served for three decades in high office, it's not just that he 
garnered more votes than any candidate in American history. It was because his 
intellect, his insight and his indomitable will could not be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved on the world stage. He voiced bold ideas, and he left global 
footprints. But for all his world grasp and mastery of global strategy, it was 
right here in this small house, in this little town in Orange County, that 
Richard Nixon learned and never forgot the values that shaped him and helped 
him shape our world. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned the value of hard work. He learned that to make important change, 
you must take risks. And he learned the Quaker virtue that, if you were born 
with a good mind and good health, you were obliged to help others, to give back 
to your community. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had something more, much more. When most people think of Richard Nixon, 
they think of his towering intellect, the incisive quality of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 I will always remember him for another quality. It's the quality that great 
fighters have. They call it heart. Heart is what let Richard Nixon climb back 
into the ring time and again when almost anyone else would have thrown in the 
towel. It was his heart that taught us the great lesson of Richard Nixon's life 
to never, ever give up. To him, it was no disgrace to fight and be beaten. The 
only disgrace was to quit. And he never did. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dick Nixon's heart, shaped by the grit and mores of this small town, never 
left California, and now we return it to the soil that bred him. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended his own eulogy to Everett Dirksen with a favorite quotation from the 
poet Sophocles: "One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day 
has been." 
</P>
<P>
 In Richard Nixon's evening, his light burned bright with hope and wise 
prescriptions for America and for the world. Today, as we take him to rest, as 
we seek to measure the greatness of the man and his legacy, it is clear how 
truly splendid Richard Nixon's day has been.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; 400 VIEW BIG EVENT ON CATHEDRAL'S BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They solemnly filed into Orange County's most famous church on Wednesday 
wearing business suits and T-shirts, high-heeled shoes and sneakers to watch 
the funeral of former President Richard Nixon on large-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 people turned out at the Crystal Cathedral, including Howard and 
Janet Richards, of Sierra Vista, Ariz. They were vacationing in the area in 
their recreational vehicle when they heard that the church would air the 
funeral live on its massive Sony Jumbotron screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Richardses, who are 62 and both voted for Nixon, said they decided to stay 
over in Orange County another day and watch the services at the Garden Grove 
church, instead of viewing it in their RV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a sad day in U.S. history for the President to allow himself 
to be entangled in that type of affair," Howard Richards said of the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people would have withdrawn from society, but he didn't do 
that," he said, adding that Nixon may have contributed even more to the world 
after he left office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be remembered more for his contribution to foreign affairs" than 
Watergate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Schmock, 47, of Garden Grove chose to come to the Crystal Cathedral rather 
than view the funeral at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The screen's bigger," Schmock said, "and I wanted to be able to come here by 
myself so I can reminisce. And I think a religious setting is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmock, who as a Long Beach police officer 20 years ago met Nixon when the 
President was hospitalized for phlebitis, also had viewed the casket on public 
display at the Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took about seven hours, but it was worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Summers, 30, of Anaheim was about the age her daughter is now when Nixon 
resigned. Summers grew up in Yorba Linda and her daughter, Nicole, now 10, 
attended a preschool on the site where the Nixon library now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she brought Nicole to the church to see the funeral on television 
because it was a historic event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to see anybody down that far fight their way back and die with 
dignity," Laura Summers said of Nixon. "I'm a nurse and I just have a lot of 
respect for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Amber Sterbling of Garden Grove was one of about 30 youngsters 
from the Crystal Cathedral's after-school day-care program watching the 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber knew Nixon had died "of a stroke" and had been the 37th President; that 
he was 81 years old and "had two kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Did she know anything about Watergate? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Amber said with a shake of the head.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; WILSON TRIES A LITTLE ELECTIONEERING ALONG WITH HIS 
EULOGIZING; POLITICS: GOVERNOR, FACING NOVEMBER VOTE, MAKES THE MOST OF 
SPOTLIGHT IN A TRIBUTE TO HIS MENTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharing the stage with a cast out of history, Gov. Pete Wilson delivered a 
personal tribute Wednesday to Richard Nixon, calling the former President a 
political mentor who preached a valuable lesson -- never give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a friend of Nixon's for more than three decades, joined President 
Clinton, the Rev. Billy Graham, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in eulogizing the former President before 
a crowd of dignitaries at the Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine a world without Richard Nixon. For half a century, he 
played a leading role in shaping the events that shaped our lives," Wilson 
said, adding that Nixon's "intellect, insight and indomitable will could not be 
ignored. . . . He voiced bold ideas, and he left global footprints." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Republican governor, the five-minute eulogy was more than a chance to 
voice a very public goodby to an old friend. It also gave Wilson -- who cut his 
political teeth as a campaign aide during Nixon's failed 1962 gubernatorial run 
in California -- an opportunity to step into the spotlight at a critical 
juncture in his own political career. 
</P>
<P>
 With the November general election on the horizon, Wilson is trailing in the 
polls. The nationally televised address allowed the governor to show California 
voters a softer, more personal side. It also could potentially give a 
much-needed boost to his reelection efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The eulogy -- sandwiched between the words of Dole and President Clinton -- 
was one of several acts by Wilson to associate himself with the Nixon funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilson was one of only a handful of dignitaries who waded into the 
masses as they flocked to the presidential library to pay tribute to Nixon. 
Wilson and his wife, Gayle, laid a wreath of yellow roses near Nixon's coffin 
and stood briefly in silent prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the funeral services, Wilson and his wife served as official greeters, 
ushering in former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush as well as longtime 
Nixon chums, such as Bob Hope. Each handshake was captured by the television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 During his eulogy, Wilson told of being part of Nixon's "extended family" of 
political workers who benefited from the former President's time and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always there willing to share his insight and experience," Wilson 
recalled, "and no American in this century had more of either." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's greatest strength was an unparalleled perseverance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the quality the greatest fighters have," Wilson said. "They call it 
heart. Heart is what let Richard Nixon climb back into the ring time and again 
when almost anyone else would have thrown in the towel. . . . It was his heart 
that taught us the great lesson of Richard Nixon's life -- never give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Wilson said, it was Nixon's willingness not to fight when he lost the 
disputed presidential race of 1960 against John F. Kennedy that might be his 
greatest legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would not go to court. He refused to fight it and urged others not to on 
his behalf," Wilson said. "He would relinquish the prize that was his life's 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? For a simple, but these days, remarkable reason -- it was because he so 
loved his country . . . that he refused to risk it being torn apart by the 
constitutional crisis that might ensue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who along with other speakers made no mention of the Watergate scandal 
that toppled the President, said Nixon learned his values in Yorba Linda and 
"never forgot" those small-town truths. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President also had wisdom for California when it began facing tough 
economic times in recent years, said Wilson. If the state keeps fighting, 
Wilson recalled Nixon telling him, "you'll come back, better than before." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Nixon's heart -- shaped by the grit and mores of this small town -- 
never left California, and now we return it to the soil that bred him," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Richard Nixon's evening, his light burned bright," the governor concluded. 
"Today, as we take him to rest, as we seek to measure just how great is the 
legacy he has left us, it is clear how truly splendid Richard Nixon's day has 
been."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; O.C. SCHOOLS DRAW LESSONS FROM HISTORIC CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the day former President Richard Nixon was buried in a state funeral a few 
miles away, teacher Kathy DeBie discussed the 37th President with her class at 
Raymond Elementary School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned that while her first-through third-graders know nothing about the 
Watergate burglary or Nixon's role in the cover-up, the children realize that 
his presidency was troubled, and they are saddened by his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got no response on Watergate," she said. "But they know some people didn't 
like Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Orange County, school officials said students expressed sorrow, 
even tears, on the funeral day of a man whose political career preceded their 
births but who they had heard about from parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Joliet, a fourth-grade teacher at Truman Benedict Elementary School in San 
Clemente, said that more than half the students in his current events class 
chose Nixon's stroke and funeral as their topic Wednesday. Many were 
teary-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed it was a reflection of what their parents felt at home," Joliet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One girl brought with her a photograph of her mother as a child standing next 
to Nixon at the Western White House in San Clemente in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The class was also aware of Nixon's historic departure from the presidency, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew what it was to be impeached and that he resigned," Joliet said, 
"but they used the word fired. One student said he got fired and another 
corrected him, saying 'No, he quit before they fired him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some students skipped school Wednesday or arrived late, school officials said, 
because their parents took them to the public viewing of the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 "One father called and said his children went to the Nixon library at 9:30 
last night and didn't get to the coffin until 10 or 10:30 this morning," said 
Marsha Rodriguez, office manager at Ladera Vista Junior High School in 
Fullerton. The children "are not coming in at all because they are sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 When classes were over at the school, Richard Nam, 14, said he too would be 
making a pilgrimage to Yorba Linda, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ceremony 
from the rooftop of a friend's apartment building. "I like Richard Nixon a 
lot," Nam said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a lot of warm sentiment for Nixon at Fullerton High School, 
where he was a student from 1926 to 1928. On Wednesday morning, Principal 
Edward Shaw read over the loudspeaker part of a letter Nixon sent in October 
for the school's centennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with great respect that we pay tribute," said Shaw, adding that the 
students also marked the day with a half-staff ceremony at the school's 
flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fullerton High is a conservative, Republican high school, reflecting the 
students' parents," said Mark Henderson, a history teacher and student 
government adviser. Some seniors here are familiar with Nixon's record on 
Southeast Asia, he said, because "we spent six to seven weeks discussing 
Vietnam and we ended with Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 And he noted that even sophomores, who have not studied the Nixon presidency, 
were excited by the state funeral. "Sophomores have no understanding of 
Watergate and very little of Vietnam. They are more into the pomp and 
circumstance of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was not the central topic, however, in Carroll Smith's fifth-grade 
history discussion at Ladera Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "I concentrated on the election in South Africa because I felt that was more 
important," Smith said. "Because we are studying the growth of democracy in the 
U.S., I wanted them to know what was happening in other countries."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; VOICES; FROM ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I think since his passing, all of Orange County has been making preparations 
for the last rally. In the next hour, we can all have a good cry, can break 
down and express the emotions that are appropriate to this event." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas Fuentes, chairman of the O.C. Republican Party 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a very warm group of people (at the reception) who have worked 
together, campaigned against each other, and who all came out of a tremendous 
respect and affection for Richard Nixon. It is especially sad for me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newport Beach resident Mary Roosevelt, widow of James Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very grateful to God for the respect that's been shown (Nixon) this last 
week. Society does not forgive. People tend to hold on to their hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rev. Robert Schuller 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a feeling of togetherness about (the funeral). It stepped across 
party lines, and it was a beautiful happening. We need that to get together, 
all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Actor Buddy Ebsen, former Newport Beach resident 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He proved you're never down and out." 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dignified, sentimental and memorable. I think it was Kissinger who 
said that when you look at the quality of a person and whether they lived well, 
you look at the entirety of the life. That's how I remember Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supervisor Harriet M. Wieder 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was overpowering. I've never been in a room with so many world leaders. 
There were 42 U.S. senators and 105 congressmen. Even Bob Hope was there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supervisor William G. Steiner 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Later in life, they're going to think back on this, and how they actually got 
to see the President. (Cory) says he's going to be President when he gets 
older." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Denise Thomas, a teacher in Santa Ana, who took children Cory, 6, and 
Shannon, 5, to see President Clinton's arrival 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's some kind of an honor and a moment in history, and you make a small 
contribution to that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brea Police Officer John Poole, one of hundreds of security personnel on 
duty during the funeral 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been awfully sad all week. This is a wonderful outpouring for him. We 
graduated from Whittier College together in 1934. The neat thing he did when he 
became President of the United States was to invite all of his classmates to 
come to the White House for a three-day visit which included tea, lunch at the 
Blair House and a tour of Air Force One -- from the ground of course." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Virginia Knott-Bender, whose family founded Knott's Berry Farm 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Nixon taught me never to give up. I ran for Congress three times and lost 
three times. But, I guess, I learned from (Nixon) that defeat isn't the end." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Glenn R. Stine, who drove from Des Moines, Iowa, in a station wagon to view 
Nixon's body Wednesday

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; THE LINES AND MEMORIES WERE BOTH LONG; MOURNERS: MORE 
THAN 42,000, SOME WAITING EIGHT HOURS, BRAVED THE NIGHT'S CHILL TO VIEW THE 
CLOSED CASKET. 'WE JUST PRAYED FOR HIM TO HAVE A PEACEFUL REST,' ONE SAID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES LEE ROMNEY and MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Richard Nixon's funeral featured the dignitaries, the night before 
belonged to people like Diana Acompo, who stood in line for more than five 
hours in the darkness, bundled against the chill to view the former President's 
casket. 
</P>
<P>
 Acompo, 20, had flown from Hayward late Tuesday and got in line just after 2 
a.m. outside the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. She had a Nixon medallion 
around her neck and carried a Nixon pin tied with a black ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've idolized him since I was a little girl, since I was 10 or 11 years old," 
she said. "It was his spirit. He never gave up. In September I got his 
autograph. It was the highlight of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 She joined more than 42,000 mourners who came to pay respects to Nixon in a 
steady marathon from 3 p.m. Tuesday to late Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners were black, white, Latino, Asian, old and even those born after 
Nixon left office. And they stood in lines that snaked along Yorba Linda's 
streets for three miles and weaved into three cul de sacs that the crowd dubbed 
"The Twilight Zone," "The black hole" and the "cul de sac from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people waited for more than eight hours, singing songs, and making new 
friends as they inched toward the library under cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the early arrivals Wednesday were David and Lily Kuoch, of Anaheim. They 
both had to be at work at hotel jobs by 5:45 a.m. But the couple, who fled 
war-ravaged Cambodia in 1975, were determined to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just prayed for him to have a peaceful rest," said Lily Kuoch, 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it was a peaceable gathering, except for an incident at 6 
a.m. when officers detained an unidentified 45-year-old man who acted strangely 
and told Brea police, he came to "save President (Clinton)." 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, a bevy of entrepreneurs sprung up, giving the suburban neighborhood 
a carnival flair. Hot chocolate was going for $1. Using a bathroom, $2. And 
"Day of Mourning" T-shirts were selling for $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a block from where food and beverage sales were booming, Bill Zavala 
gave out free hot chocolate and cookies from his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing about this is to respect the President," said Zavala, a 
39-year-old graphic designer. "We live around here, and we just want people to 
be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Brando, 24, had left a Hollywood movie party that she said Madonna 
attended, and raced to Yorba Linda. But Brando, no relation to Marlon, turned 
back after hearing the casket was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to wait six hours to see a box," said Brando, who added that, 
other than a high school term paper about "Watergate," he knew nothing about 
Nixon. "How do we know he's even in it?" 
</P>

 Ray Hunnicutt, 54, of San Clemente, a third cousin of Nixon's, met the former 
President at a family reunion when Hunnicutt was 10. At 4 a.m. Wednesday, 
Hunnicutt and his son, Josh, 19, were waiting to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to play golf right in front of our house. I'd never gotten to talk to 
him, and this gives me one last time to say goodby," said Josh Hunnicutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Others joked in line, quoting and misquoting the former President to keep 
their spirits up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never look back. Always look forward. That's what Nixon said," shouted one 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never give up. That's what he said," another countered. 
</P>
<P>
 But some mourners had no choice. They were turned away just before 10:30 a.m. 
Wednesday when the viewing was ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from San Bernardino," said Norma Bollacker, 49. "I got up way before nine 
in the morning. I ate breakfast and I got gas in the car. But I didn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel Cisneros of Norwalk had spent an hour just trying to park her car early 
Wednesday. Then she waited in line more than two hours, only to be turned away 
by Orange County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so disappointed," Cisneros said. "My sister's father-in-law owns a barber 
shop in Quito, Ecuador, where I'm from. They said that Nixon visited the shop 
when he was President. After that, her father-in-law renamed it, 'Nixon Barber 
Shop."' 
</P>
<P>
 Many people were fervent in their determination to honor Nixon. Diana Acompo 
had quit her job over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either loved him or you hated him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She loved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her co-workers at an Office Depot store in the Bay Area hated him. In 
the heat of an argument Monday over Nixon's role in the Vietnam War, Acompo 
stormed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just quit," she said. "I always knew what kinds of mixed emotions people 
had, but I thought they should at least have some respect now." 
</P>
<P>
 Was the wait worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Stephens, 42, of Chino Hills thought so, when she left the viewing 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really an honor to go in and be in the presence of him," Stephens 
said. "He was such a good President. I remember him helping in China, and his 
foreign policy was excellent. I think he was a great man."

 As the nation heard Richard Nixon eulogized Wednesday, television cameras 
focused repeatedly during the 85-minute service on the resolute faces of the 
fallen President's daughters. For what sometimes seemed like anguishing 
minutes, TV seemed to get closer and closer, painfully close. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox were the kids parents told their 
children to be like. Supporters of the Vietnam War viewed them as models of 
American youth, while opponents heaped them with scorn. And they are perhaps 
the only sisters who can play Trivial Pursuit and realize that they are one of 
the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the children of the former President and First Lady Pat Nixon, Julie 
Eisenhower and Tricia Cox were two of the most recognizable siblings in America 
during Nixon's six years in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Eisenhower's book writing and occasional guest speaking, the Nixon 
women, especially Tricia, have largely retreated from the public stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both stood firm, along with their husbands and children, through the 
memorial service and the eulogies. At once, they seemed to stand tall with the 
same patriotism and pride their father exhibited on formal occasions. At the 
same moment, they evoked the image of their mother, standing by their father no 
matter what, insistent on being the backdrop and not the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon has a beautiful family, and he was devoted to them," Gov. Pete 
Wilson told the audience. "Anyone who ever saw them together knew that his 
beloved Pat and his girls, Tricia and Julie, were everything to him. He was so 
proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the final moments, when the ceremony moved graveside, did emotion 
surface. As a major general presented each with a flag that draped the coffin 
of their father, Tricia -- the older -- choked back tears, then Julie caught 
her breath, dabbed at her upper lip with a handkerchief and cried. The Rev. 
Billy Graham was there for comfort. Julie gave him a hug as the family headed 
into the library for a private reception. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the media paid so much attention to them, Julie and Tricia were 
standing next to their father during his farewell speech to the White House 
staff in August, 1974. Privately, they had urged him not to resign the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In much better times, the media covered Julie's pre-inaugural wedding in New 
York City, and Tricia's wedding in 1971, the last to be held at the White 
House. The reception was in the East Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie's engagement to David Eisenhower was on the cover of Life magazine. And 
it was the eldest daughter who pulled the family together, locked arm in arm, 
for a final White House news photograph as Watergate descended. 
</P>
<P>
 The elusive Tricia, who was dubbed the "the mystery princess" by the White 
House press, now lives quietly in New York City. Her husband, Edward Finch Cox, 
one of the original seven "raiders" who worked with consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader, practices law. They have a son, Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 For awhile, Julie maintained a high profile as her father's most respected 
defender. "The most credible Nixon," Julie was once called. 
</P>
<P>
 She is an author of three books -- two about her family -- and has been 
working on a fourth about the 1968 presidential election with her husband, 
David, the grandson of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. They live in 
Berwyn, Pa., a woodsy suburb of Philadelphia, with their three children, 
Jennie, Melanie and Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 During their youth, the girls appeared regularly in their father's campaigns. 
Widely disseminated photos of Julie and Tricia sitting on their parents' laps 
appealed to the public, and they contributed to their father's political 
success in more subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1952 presidential election, Nixon, who was Dwight D. Eisenhower's 
running mate, defended himself on television against charges that he was the 
beneficiary of a generous slush fund set up by wealthy California Republicans. 
That televised defense came to be known as the "Checkers" speech, so labeled 
because it invoked the name of a black-and-white cocker spaniel given to his 
daughters by a supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women became the object of adulation and scorn while living in the White 
House at the peak of the nation's most tumultuous and divisive time since the 
Civil War. Race riots and student demonstrations were widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, now 45, went to Smith College, an all-women's school that was in the 
vanguard of campus radicalism in the late 1960s. Some of her classmates 
regarded her as a traitor to her generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest chants vilified her and her husband. David was lampooned as a 
good-natured Howdy Doody, and the media used words like "jug-eared," "gangly" 
and "awkward" to describe him. Threats of protests at Smith kept Julie from 
attending her graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia, now 48, was probably more removed than her sister from direct, 
personal attack. She attended Finch College, a private school, in Manhattan. 
She tutored poor children. Quiet and shy, she rarely revealed her inner 
feelings to anyone, even her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Her personal life has remained largely private. When a young visitor to the 
White House once asked about Tricia's whereabouts, the First Lady said: "If you 
can find out, you are better than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Once their father resigned the presidency, both women seemed to welcome 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
 The years out of the limelight, Julie once told the Washington Post, "have 
been some of the happiest years I've known. I'm so grateful for this time 
leading a normal life. I wouldn't trade it for anything." She once joked their 
lives were so all-American she and her husband could be "Dave and Julie Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of their lives, Nixon and his wife visited frequently with 
their daughters' families, usually at the Nixon home in Park Ridge, N.J. As a 
family, they worked hard creating the Nixon library that opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nixon's death there has been speculation whether anyone in his family 
will run for office. Neither David nor Julie has ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose told New York's Newsday that they 
will remain "fierce defenders" of their father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say there were only three people in this world that Nixon ever 
loved -- Pat and his daughters," Ambrose said. "And they felt that way about 
him."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; DATELINE: YORBA LINDA; DARKNESS DESCENDS ON 
PRESIDENTIAL LIGHT

 Lights Out: As Richard Nixon's funeral began, the Secret Service 
communications frequency was punctuated with word of Eagle, Timberwolf, 
Rawhide, Deacon and Passkey, the respective code names of Presidents Clinton, 
Bush, Reagan, Carter and Ford. The one Presidential moniker not heard Wednesday 
was Nixon's: Searchlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Feed Me: Yorba Linda's Community Center was planned as a showcase facility for 
the city to hold its biggest functions. On Wednesday, it served as a check-in 
point where dignitaries picked up parking passes, transportation tickets and 
pins that identified them as invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's lunchroom was set aside for the scores of police officers from 
various jurisdictions helping with the round-the-clock security. From time to 
time, the turkey sandwiches ran short, but there was always plenty of macaroni 
salad. A caterer misunderstood the city's order and delivered 640 pounds of the 
stuff instead of the 40 pounds requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Potties: Like a number of other amenities, the deluxe mobile portable 
restrooms behind the media grandstands at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace were reserved for congressmen and other dignitaries, security 
personnel sternly warned anyone who approached. 
</P>
<P>
 No Scoop: Brian Singer, editor of the newspaper at Fullerton High School, 
where Richard Nixon spent his freshman and sophomore years, tried every tactic 
he could think of to get a press pass to cover the funeral. The 18-year-old, 
Stanford-bound senior thought he had a chance. After all, "it would be history 
for the high school, history for the paper and history for me to attend such an 
event," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer was attending a high school journalism convention in Portland on 
Saturday when he read about the funeral and called long distance to the 
military to find out how to get invited. He learned that at 9:30 a.m. Monday 
morning passes would be handed out "first come, first serve" at the El Toro 
Marine Base. 
</P>
<P>
 A serious student, Singer wouldn't cut class, so he didn't reach the base 
until 11:30. "I was turned away. They were already out of passes," he said. 
Local politicians also were unable to intervene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Excused Absences: United Nations Under-Secretary General Ji Chaozhu, who 
represented the international body at the funeral, first met Nixon in 1972 in 
China when he served as an interpreter. Ji acknowledged that few actual heads 
of state had attended the funeral, explaining diplomatically that "the timing 
was so rushed. To get world leaders together, you can't do it overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck Up: Not everyone in town was caught up in the presidential funeral 
Wednesday. A Great Western Bank three miles up Yorba Linda Boulevard from the 
Nixon library was robbed just after 1 p.m. A man wearing a motorcycle helmet, 
black gloves and a blue coat simulated a weapon and escaped with an unknown 
amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a majority of Brea's police force was working security at the Nixon 
burial, several officers arrived at the scene of the robbery "a minute and a 
half" after a police dispatcher was alerted, according to Lt. Cliff Trimble. 
The department was "able to provide services to the community just as if this 
(burial) was not occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Mater: On the campus of Duke University in Durham, N.C., where Nixon 
graduated law school in 1937, opinion on Wednesday about the former President 
ran the same ambivalent spectrum as elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservatives think he was a great American," said Justin Dillon, 
editorial page editor of the Chronicle, the campus daily. "The liberals are 
saying, 'He's dead, but let's not lionize him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not much chance of that at Duke. After a contentious, campuswide debate in 
1981, university officials rejected an opportunity to be the home of the Nixon 
library if they had to accept a museum as well. A Nixon portrait, commissioned 
by his law school classmates, remained in a secure vault Wednesday. Whenever it 
is hung, a school official confided, "people do things to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dope: While some Yorba Linda residents sold parking spots and trips to their 
bathrooms in the name of commerce, at least one visitor to the Nixon library 
used the opportunity for politics. Moreno Valley resident James Acosta spent 
the early morning hours garnering signatures for a petition advocating the 
legalization of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitution was written on marijuana," said a fervent Acosta, as his 
impromptu petition drive drew icy glares from mourners. "The first flag made by 
Betsy Ross was (also) made from hemp paper." 
</P>
<P>
 The End: About 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, a team of a dozen men roared up in five 
trucks loaded with wheelbarrows and shovels and headed off to the library's 
rose garden. Most of the guests had already left and the chairs were being 
loaded up. Five minutes later they started filling in the grave, but then 
stopped because the Nixon family wanted to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The hole into which the casket had been lowered was dug 65 to 75 inches deep 
by 40 inches wide, according to Jeff Kidwiler, a vice president with United 
Park Service, which oversaw the filling of the grave. The vault, which weighs 
2,800 pounds, compared to the standard weight of 1,200 pounds, was made by 
United Park Service. The vault is 86 inches long and the top is golden-white 
marble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really an honor," Kidwiler said. "All the guys have volunteered for 
this. It's really special because I grew up in Yorba Linda."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; GUEST LIST COVERED WIDE SPECTRUM; AUDIENCE: LONGTIME 
ALLIES, A FEW EX-ENEMIES AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM 86 NATIONS ATTENDED.

<P>
 Not all the President's men were there, but enough to make a strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Cabinet members Henry A. Kissinger and Richard G. Kleindienst were in 
attendance. So were Watergate figures Maurice Stans, once finance chairman for 
Nixon's re-election committee, and G. Gordon Liddy, the convicted mastermind of 
the bungled burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Nixon spokesman Ron Ziegler and Counsel Chuck Colson also paid their 
respects. Jo Horton Haldeman, the widow of Nixon's chief of staff, H. R. 
Haldeman, was in the audience. And so was Rose Mary Woods, the secretary who 
took responsibility for creating the infamous 18 1/2-minute gap on a critical 
Watergate tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But so was George McGovern, who was among the first named on Nixon's infamous 
"enemies list," and whose presence on the funeral's exclusive guest list spoke 
more eloquently of reconciliation than some who eulogized the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a reconciling day for me and, I think, for a lot of other 
people," said McGovern, who as the Democratic nominee waged an acrimonious 
political fight against Nixon for the presidency in 1972 and was buried in a 
electoral landslide. "I kind of really feel like I've lost an old friend, even 
though we were bitter political enemies through the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Colson, who spent seven months in prison for obstructing justice during the 
Watergate conspiracy, also spoke of healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he achieved in death something he never quite achieved in life -- to 
bring the nation together," said Colson. "Maybe the wounds of Watergate are 
now, twenty-some years later, finally healed." 
</P>
<P>
 The guest list for the funeral cut across a broad spectrum of Nixon's 
political and private life: Republicans and Democrats, friends and former 
enemies, family members, entertainers, sports figures, religious leaders and 
many, many longtime staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Yorba Linda Community Center, where many of the guests had gathered 
before the funeral, the Nixon faithful -- wearing either purple or yellow "RN" 
badges that were their tickets to the funeral -- embraced like long-lost 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Liddy and Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Tennessee senator and ranking 
minority member of the Judiciary Committee that held televised hearings on 
Watergate, rode over to the funeral site together on a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Finch, who served under Nixon as secretary of health, education and 
welfare, smiled and shook hands with Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of 
defense under President Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Nixon family can feel very, very good about what he accomplished, 
and who all is here," Rumsfeld said. "A broad cross-section of the world is 
recognizing him for what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 From across the Nixon years came Alexander M. Haig Jr., Haldeman's replacement 
as chief of staff, and Caspar W. Weinberger, former secretary of health, 
education and welfare who became Ronald Reagan's defense secretary. James R. 
Schlesinger, Nixon's defense secretary, and William P. Rogers, his secretary of 
state, joined a few dozen others from the Nixon presidency, including political 
columnist and presidential aspirant Patrick J. Buchanan, security adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and former Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 Even former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who before Nixon's resignation left 
office himself in disgrace under a criminal indictment, and his wife, Judy, 
attended the funeral. Agnew had asked Julie Nixon Eisenhower if he would be 
welcome at the funeral and was assured that his presence was important. On 
Wednesday, he was greeted warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to pay my respects for (Nixon's) accomplishments," said Nixon's vice 
president, who resigned in 1973 after pleading no contest to tax evasion. "It's 
time to put aside 20 years of resentment, which is what I'm doing at this 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 members of Congress were on the guest list, including 47 U.S. 
senators, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), Senate Democratic Leader George 
Mitchell of Maine and the California congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from across the globe, from Angola to Argentina and Singapore 
to Seychelles, also were in force. In all, 86 countries sent dignitaries to pay 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon had other admirers, too, who had little if anything to do with 
politics. Comedians Bob Hope and Red Skelton and actor Buddy Ebsen attended 
with their wives. Former Rams star Roosevelt Grier also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good send-off to Richard Nixon and his future life," said Ebsen, who 
also attended Pat Nixon's funeral last summer. "There was a feeling of 
togetherness. It stepped across party lines and it was a beautiful happening. 
We need that to get all of us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hope: "He was a hell of a guy. Playing golf, you learn a lot about a 
guy's character. His was a great character." 
</P>
<P>
 The guest list was indeed impressive, with names like Walter Annenberg, George 
Argyros, Jesse Helms, William Lyon, Ashraf Pahlavi, Bebe Rebozo, Nelson 
Rockefeller, Henry Segerstrom, Mary Roosevelt and James B. Stockdale sprinkled 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County also had a large contingent, including a gathering of state 
senators and assemblymen. All five Orange County supervisors were also invited. 
The local Republican Central Committee distributed 100 tickets to elected 
officials, volunteers and others affiliated with the local party, chairman 
Thomas A. Fuentes said, and just about everyone who wanted in got in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dignified, sentimental and memorable," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
said. "I think it was Kissinger who said that when you look at the quality of a 
person and whether they lived well, you look at the entirety of the life. 
That's how I remember Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourners spoke about healing and the inevitability that Nixon, in death, may 
finally have been absolved of his perceived sins. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle joked that Kissinger had captured it 
perfectly when he predicted that Nixon "would've liked to have read and reread 
all the favorable reviews that he's had this last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Robert Schuller said he was pleased to see those reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very grateful to God for the respect that's been shown (Nixon) this last 
week," said Schuller. "Society does not forgive. People tend to hold on to 
their hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 But since Nixon's death, Schuller said, the public is beginning to "recognize 
Nixon's greatness." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Alicia DiRado, Doreen Carvajal and Eric Lichtblau

 "Nixon remains the most fascinating figure I've ever met in politics . . . 
endlessly complex . . . large weaknesses but a man that shaped our public life 
for nearly five decades. I never met anyone who climbed so many mountains and 
landed in so many valleys."

</P>
<P>

 "Kissinger had it right. (Nixon) would've liked to have read and reread all 
the favorable reviews that he's had this last week."

<P>

</P>

 "He was a hell of a guy. Playing golf you learn a lot about a guy's character. 
His was a great character."

</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come out to say goodby. I called his office when I heard he 
became ill, and I said we needed him in the fourth quarter. I called and asked 
if I could come over and pray for him. But the Secret Service said I couldn't. 
I prayed for him and others prayed for him anyway. . . . He always had a way of 
bouncing back."

 "It was a very moving and wonderful tribute, something he would have enjoyed. 
He was a man who had a strong following. A lot of people forget that there were 
a lot of people willing to work for him. He was very deeply admired. He was a 
representative of the people. He was a strong man and he admired strength. I 
think he had faults as any man or woman does, but he rose above them."

<P>
 -- Caspar Weinberger, defense secretary in the Reagan Administration 
</P>

 "I don't think today's the day to mention Watergate. Today's the day to talk 
about Nixon's durability, his indomitability, the things that made Richard 
Nixon what he is. You don't forget your friends. Richard Nixon and I had been 
friends for 30 years. . . . Everybody has their ups and downs. He never stayed 
down for the count. You never counted him out."

man who shared the same bond and love with me for the game of baseball. No 
matter the events or circumstances surrounding his life, he always knew not 
only where all of the teams were in the standings, but he could talk to you at 
length about the history of the game, players, statistics and the nuances. He 
was a true student of the game, as well as a fan, and I always felt he would 
have been an outstanding commissioner of baseball. I will miss him very much."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; FAREWELLS BADE FROM THE OUTSIDE; CROWDS: ONLY 
INVITEES COULD ENTER NIXON LIBRARY GROUNDS, BUT MANY OTHERS GOT AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE.

 Inside the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace: President Clinton, Bob Hope and 
hundreds of other celebrities and dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside: a man who drove from Iowa because it was his "last chance to say 
goodby." A father who brought his 5-year-old son to witness a "history lesson." 
And a woman who didn't so much think Richard Nixon deserved respect as that as 
he needed compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a canopy of steel-gray clouds and amid a hand-numbing chill, they were 
among hundreds of people lined up outside the site of Wednesday's funeral 
service for former President Nixon. None was included on the dignitary-studded 
guest list, but they weren't about to miss it. 
</P>
<P>
 If they couldn't be inside, outside was the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was decidedly Middle America: children clutching tiny American 
flags. People eating Cracker Jacks and ice cream. Horses bearing mounted 
security officers clip-clopping along Yorba Linda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 As the service began, they huddled around television monitors set up in the 
middle of the street. Contrary to the festive atmosphere an hour before, most 
sat quietly, riveted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some came to honor Nixon because they felt he deserved it. Some came to honor 
him, they said, because it was the right thing to do. Some came to experience 
history. On the whole, they proved a forgiving lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, they symbolized what seemed to be the theme for the day: One 
man, two views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this all happened the only thing people could remember about him was 
Watergate," said Dean Bouldin, who brought his 5-year-old son, Henry, in a red 
wagon. "I'm glad. Now they're remembering the good stuff, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouldin took the opportunity to give a mini-history lesson to his son. "I told 
him about President Nixon's foreign policy, how he made friends with other 
countries, and how he had a major impact on the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
 And? 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I told him he made a mistake and he got caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Stine, 42, drove 2,000 miles from Des Moines, Iowa, to pay his respects 
to his political idol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say goodby to him even though it's from a distance," said 
Stine, who clutched a stack of Nixon commemorative newspapers. "These are 
souvenirs. I'll hand these out back home. A lot of people know he was a great 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Others sat on curbs, on their parents' shoulders and on lawn chairs, hoping to 
get a better view. As the Rev. Billy Graham quoted Scripture, children and 
adults alike dabbed tears from their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a doe-eyed boy in a yellow rain slicker strayed away from his 
family and wandered across Yorba Linda Boulevard, as if in a trance, to within 
five feet of a giant TV monitor. A police officer gently escorted him back to 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 More curious than solemn, three Cal State Fullerton students with cameras 
tried to improve their vantage point by hopping over a back-yard fence to sneak 
past police roadblocks. Security officers quickly collared them and forced them 
behind the yellow tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to get as close as we could and see what was going on," said 
Greg Morris, 23, of Fullerton. "We aren't old enough to have really known much 
about him, but we know this is a significant, historical day." 
</P>
<P>
 When the solemn service was finished, much of the crowd lingered for more than 
an hour, converging on big-name celebrities as they emerged from the library. 
Most dignitaries brushed away the autograph seekers and climbed into waiting 
limousines. 
</P>
<P>
 One who obliged the crowd was former President George Bush, who halted for a 
few minutes to sign about half a dozen autographs. Bush smiled when one 
well-wisher told him how much he had done for the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Sprigg of Hollywood obtained a few autographs, but he never got what he 
most sought: an official program from the funeral. Sprigg even offered to buy 
one from guests, but none would part with what is sure to be a collector's 
item.

STATE LEGISLATORS RAISE $33.4 MILLION IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State legislators collected a record $33.4 million in campaign contributions 
for a non-election year in 1993, with freshman Assembly members collecting just 
as much as their veteran colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1993 campaign contribution harvest was indeed a bountiful one for state 
legislators," said Ruth Holton, executive director of Common Cause, the 
grass-roots political group that on Wednesday issued a report on last year's 
campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The $33.4 million raised in 1993 was almost double the $19.5 million raised by 
state legislators in 1991. The previous record of $27.4 million for a 
non-election year was set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Holton said lawmakers who were not involved in special elections collected 
$26.7 million and those involved in special elections raised $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was the top individual 
fund-raiser with $2.2 million, according to the report. Assemblyman Rusty 
Areias (D-San Jose), who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state 
controller, was second with $831,186. Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) was third with $731,649. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 10 Assembly freshmen and their respective campaign contribution 
amounts were Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead), $262,252; Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), 
$262,128; Bernie Richter (R-Chico), $185,019; Ray Haynes (R-Murrieta), 
$160,965; Fred Aguiar (R-Chino), $155,163; Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), $140,324; 
Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson), $135,744; Ted Weggeland (R-Riverside), 
$134,074; Larry Bowler (R-Elk Grove), $133,428, and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), 
$131,859. 
</P>
<P>
 After they were the first group to be elected under term limits in 1992, 
members of the Assembly freshman class vowed to be more independent than their 
peers and rely less on campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Common Cause report showed that the median amount raised by Assembly 
newcomers last year was $100,783, nearly identical to the median amount raised 
by veteran Assembly Democrats. They were behind only the median for Assembly 
Republicans, which was $134,074. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Holton, "The freshmen are just like the veterans in terms of their 
fund-raising activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Some freshman said that, although they have accomplished much of what they set 
out to do, they still must contend with getting reelected and that takes lots 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Assembly freshman class has done things differently in 
Sacramento," Aguiar said. "That is obvious in how we played a major role in 
accomplishing workers' compensation reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am running my 1994 campaign to win reelection. One of the unfortunate 
things about running for office is it takes money to run a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said he still has a $50,000 debt from his 1992 election, which 
consists of a personal loan to himself. He has no June primary opposition, but 
said he needs about $150,000 to $200,000 "to run a decent campaign" against his 
Democratic opponent in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Senate passed a major campaign finance reform bill 
authored by Lockyer and sent it to the Assembly.

VIRGINIA SERIAL KILLER CONVICTED BY DNA EVIDENCE IS EXECUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serial killer Timothy W. Spencer, the first person convicted of murder on the 
basis of DNA evidence, was executed late Wednesday after a last flurry of 
appeals failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, known as the "Southside Strangler," consistently maintained his 
innocence. He had no last words before being put to death in the electric chair 
for the first of four rape-murders he was convicted of committing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead at 11:13 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer arranged for his immediate family to visit him before the execution, 
said Wayne Brown, a spokesman for the prison in Jarratt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals denied his lawyers' 
request for a stay so new DNA tests could be run on Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:45 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court turned down his lawyers' request to halt 
the execution. A court spokesman said Justice Harry A. Blackmun cast the lone 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyers did not seek clemency from Gov. George F. Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first scheduled execution for which a doctor declined to be present 
since the American Medical Assn. decided March 23 that doctors' participation 
in executions violates medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Balvir L. Kapil, a prison doctor who regularly pronounces inmates dead, 
said he was taking a vacation day. State officials arranged for a private 
physician, Dr. Alvin Harris, to be present. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer was condemned for the murder of Debbie Dudley Davis, the first of 
three people from the south section of Richmond, Va., murdered in a series of 
break-ins during three months in 1987. The female victims were bound with 
clothing and household items, then raped and strangled or hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, three criminal laboratories concluded that semen found at 
all the crime scenes came from Spencer. Scientists said the chance the semen 
could match someone else was one in 705 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, genetic testing had been tried in a few criminal and paternity 
cases, but never in a murder trial.

COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY PUT $50 MILLION IN POLITICS; DONATIONS: CANDIDATES, 
PARTIES GOT THE MONEY IN THE LAST DECADE FROM COMPANIES WITH A STAKE IN 
'INFORMATION HIGHWAY,' COMMON CAUSE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The communications industry, which has a big stake in government decisions 
about the "information superhighway," gave more than $50 million in political 
action committee and "soft money" contributions to congressional candidates and 
political party units during the last decade, a Common Cause study showed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T donated $5.6 million in PAC money to candidates, nearly twice as much as 
any other entity in the industry, which includes telephone, entertainment, 
computer, broadcasting, cable and publishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The top soft money donors, whose contributions -- unlike PAC gifts -- are 
unrestricted and funneled to political party committees, were concentrated in 
the entertainment world. MCA Inc. led with $574,000. Most of that was 
contributed by Chairman Lew Wasserman, $357,000, and President Sidney 
Sheinberg, $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Top recipients of PAC largess from 1984 through 1993 were congressional barons 
who run committees with prime jurisdiction over communications issues. Rep. 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
collected $336,000, and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the 
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, took in $329,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading California recipients were Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), vice 
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, $191,000; Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento), an influential member of the Ways and Means Committee, 
$154,000, and Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), ranking Republican on 
Energy and Commerce, $149,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The communications industry has made great use of the preferred method of 
communicating in Washington these days -- millions of dollars in 
special-interest political money," Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The huge amounts of political money given by the communications industry is 
of particular concern today as the issue of telecommunications and the 
information superhighway moves to center stage on the national agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause and other advocates of campaign finance reform have said they 
believe that such contributions unduly influence legislation. Donors and 
recipients play down the huge money flow, insisting that, although the dollars 
may help gain access to lawmakers, it does not buy votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides AT&T, the top PAC contributors were GTE Corp., $2.9 million; Bellsouth 
Corp., $2.5 million; National Cable Television Assn., $2 million; US West Inc., 
$1.3 million; National Assn. of Broadcasters, $1.3 million; Pacific Telesis 
Group, $1.2 million; Hughes Communications, $1.1 million, and Sprint Corp., 
$1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to MCA, the leading soft money donors were Time Warner Inc., 
$568,333; Bell Atlantic Corp., $439,000; Marvin Davis, president of Davis Cos., 
$410,000; MCI Communications Corp., $391,000; the late Thomas Watson Jr., 
chairman emeritus of IBM Corp., $384,000; NYNEX Corp., $375,000; Sony Corp. of 
America, $371,000, and Pacific Telesis, $337,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With the entertainment industry concentrated in Southern California, it is not 
surprising that some of the primary recipients of its $6.8 million in 
contributions during the last decade were Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City), $52,000; Fazio, $38,000; Moorhead, $33,000; Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.), $32,000, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), $32,000.

BOREN WILL LEAVE SENATE TO RUN UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA; POLITICS: HE'S THE SIXTH 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TO ANNOUNCE HIS RETIREMENT THIS YEAR. MOVE BOOSTS THE 
REPUBLICANS' ODDS OF SCORING ELECTORAL GAINS. 
</P>

 Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) announced Wednesday that he will resign his seat 
at the end of this session of Congress, raising Republican hopes of ending 
Democratic control of the Senate and checking President Clinton's ambitious 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boren, 53, who once had presidential ambitions, announced in Norman, Okla., 
that he will resign in November from the seat he has held for 16 years to 
become president of the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "The revitalization of our country will come from the grass roots, through the 
strengthening of local communities and the rebuilding of our great 
institutions, especially our schools and universities," said Boren, a former 
Oklahoma governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Boren, a conservative Democrat who played a key role in defeating Clinton's 
proposed wide-based energy tax last year, eventually voted against Clinton's 
budget proposal even though the tax he had opposed no longer was in the plan. 
Boren was chairman of a joint committee on the organization of Congress and 
formerly headed the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With his decision, Boren became the sixth Democratic senator to announce his 
retirement this year. Three Republicans have said that they will step down. The 
large number of Democratic seats without incumbents will increase GOP chances 
of scoring gains over the next year, political observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hold a 56-44 edge in the Senate and were expected to suffer a net 
loss of three or four seats this year. The odds are still in favor of a 
Democratic majority after the elections but Republican advances could set up a 
major showdown in 1996, when Clinton is expected to seek reelection at the top 
of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a very challenging, tough cycle," said Ken Klein, spokesman for the 
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "If history is a guide, we can expect 
to dip a few. . . . Our goal is to maintain a working majority." 
</P>
<P>
 A special election will be called in March or April next year to fill out the 
remaining two years of Boren's term. At this point the race is regarded as a 
tossup, with both parties expected to wage tough primary election fights. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the wide-open contests -- those without incumbents -- more 
Democrats than Republicans appear to be in trouble in reelection contests. Of 
the 34 Senate seats at stake this fall, 21 are now held by Democrats and 13 by 
Republicans, an advantage for GOP challengers at a time when the public seems 
to be in an anti-incumbent mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although congressional races often are decided on the basis of personalities 
or local issues rather than any over-arching national trend, Charles E. Cook 
Jr., editor of the highly respected Cook Political Report, said in his latest 
appraisal of 1994 races that the trend now seems to favor Republican contenders 
for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Democratic) party's odds of incurring rather significant losses in the 
Senate have increased in recent months," Cook wrote. "We are estimating a 
likely Republican gain of three or four seats. . . . A six-seat gain is 
unlikely, and a seven-seat gain, which would give Senate Republicans a majority 
for the first time in eight years, would be highly unlikely but not 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Koops, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee, said that Boren's departure would give the GOP an unexpected 
opportunity. "For Republicans to take control is certainly an uphill 
operation," Koops said, "but opening up the Oklahoma seat does nothing to 
discourage our aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 In Maine, where Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell was considered 
unbeatable, his surprise decision to leave the Senate at the end of the year 
gives Republicans another solid chance to capture a Democratic seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The other retiring Democratic senators are Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Harlan 
Mathews of Tennessee, Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of 
Michigan. Departing Republicans are John C. Danforth of Missouri, Dave 
Durenberger of Minnesota and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic prospects for defeating incumbent Republicans appear greatest in 
Washington state, Delaware and Montana, while GOP chances for knocking off 
sitting Democrats are thought to be strongest in New Jersey and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Boren's departure, Klein said that it underscores the importance of the 
'94 elections, particularly since special elections like that to be held in 
Oklahoma often have a low voter turnout, which tends to favor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 One twist in Boren's new job: He will be supervising a faculty that includes 
law professor Anita Faye Hill, who claimed in 1991 Senate testimony that she 
had been sexually harassed years before by Supreme Court nominee Clarence 
Thomas. Boren voted to confirm Thomas, who is now on the court, but said later 
that the vote might have been a mistake.

ALEX HALEY'S WIDOW WINS ESTATE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Haley's widow has won a share of his estate and the right to complete his 
two unfinished books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a glorious day, is what it is," Myran Haley said after the verdict 
Tuesday.The completion of both works would be "a dream come true," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "Roots: The Saga of an American 
Family," died in 1992 at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 He left three books unfinished: "Queen," which was later published and turned 
into a TV miniseries; "Henning," an autobiography; and "Madame C. J. Walker," 
about the first African American woman to become a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Haley, his literary collaborator, argued that a 1991 contract gave her a 
third of Haley's estate and the right to conclude the books' unfinished 
chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 The executors of Haley's estate, led by his brother, George Haley, argued that 
the contract was unenforceable because Haley signed it under duress. The 
contract was signed after Mrs. Haley sued for divorce, but the couple were 
still married when Haley died. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chancery Court jury decided Haley was under duress when he signed the 
agreement, but that it did not make any difference. The jury said he would have 
signed it anyway.

TORNADO TOUCHES DOWN IN INDIANA, KILLING 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Lannan was watching TV early Wednesday when the storm outside suddenly 
grew ominously quiet. The next thing he knew, his mobile home was in the air 
and he felt himself in a free fall, thinking he would never see daylight again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'Oh God, this is it,' " he said. "All I remember was rolling. 
It was like, one one-thousand, two one-thousand and it was over. I started 
digging myself out of the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 Lannan was caught up in a tornado that swept through northwestern Tippecanoe 
County, two miles north of Purdue University, killing two people and injuring 
more than 60 others. 
</P>
<P>
 It ripped through the Lafayette Venetian Blind Factory, killing an employee 
who was working at a loading dock. Most workers already were out of the 
building when the tornado hit because the factory's electricity had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The twister picked up a car, tumbling it end over end several times and 
dumping it in a nearby field, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five homes were destroyed at the Prairie View Farms subdivision, where a 
second body was found buried in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70 trailers were destroyed at the Sagamore Village Estates mobile 
home park before the tornado skipped over U.S. 52, struck two buildings and 
went airborne, said Tippecanoe County sheriff's Capt. Dave Murtaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, funnel clouds were spotted Wednesday in Oklahoma, Arkansas and 
Tennessee, but there were no immediate reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those injured by the West Lafayette tornado were in the trailer park. 
One person was in critical condition at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 people were evacuated immediately after the twister struck. 
Rescuers with dogs combed the trailer park for most of the day, looking for 
anyone who might still be buried under the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaking gas from ruptured lines fueled a blaze that destroyed at least four 
trailer homes, said Dave Beaty, Wabash Township's fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't homes by the time they caught fire," Beaty said. "They'd already 
been destroyed by the tornado." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross operated shelters at the Lafayette National Guard Armory and at 
a Purdue gym, which was not damaged.

A SUCCESS IN HER FIELDS; ANAHEIM STADIUM SECRETARY HAS JUGGLED OFFICE, HOME 
DUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade as secretary to the manager of Anaheim Stadium, Priscilla 
Nielsen has become a coach of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 To younger, less-experienced secretaries in the office, Priscilla, 58, offers 
advice, and she leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very tactful," said Pam Harding, one of the other secretaries who gets 
an occasional word of counsel from Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 As a secretary from the old school, Nielsen learned shorthand and speed typing 
in the conventional way. But she attributes most of her success on the job to 
common sense and the practical experience she gained from bringing up her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "After managing a household, a long-term marriage and raising four children, I 
could run General Motors," Nielsen said. "There may be women out there who 
don't think they are accomplishing something, but they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen also credits her boss, stadium Manager Greg Smith, for having a 
leadership style that encourages her to take the initiative. She adheres, 
though, to the secretarial credo of always making the boss look good. "He is 
the one out in the limelight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the office, Nielsen is known as a stickler for correct spelling and good 
grammar in an age when language skills are often de-emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't trust that spell checker all the time," she said, a firm believer that 
the computer program that automatically flags misspelled words will never quite 
replace a dictionary. And her advice to those who need to polish their language 
skills? Read more books. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the stadium -- home to the Rams professional football team and the 
Angels major league baseball team -- brings Smith in contact with everyone from 
concert promoters to team owners. Having to juggle all the details flowing into 
the manager of a 64,593-seat stadium makes for a difficult job. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has definite advantages too. For one, the staff can occasionally sneak 
out to watch bits of a close game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen said she hardly leaves the office, though. She prefers to watch the 
big plays during day games on the TV monitor in her office -- where she can 
stay with her team.

CLINTON ASKS SAUDIS TO AWARD $4-BILLION PHONE PROJECT TO AT&T; POLICY: LETTER 
TO KING FAHD MARKS HIS SECOND INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF A U.S. FIRM SEEKING 
WORK IN THE DESERT KINGDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, again trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to buy U.S. products, 
called on its government to award a telecommunications contract to AT&T valued 
at up to $4 billion, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert kingdom plans to update and expand its aging telephone system, and 
AT&T is vying with telecommunications suppliers from Europe, Japan and Canada 
for the lucrative contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope AT&T, which has long been a market leader, will receive every 
opportunity to establish itself as Saudi Arabia's preferred partner, both for 
quality and cost, in this project," Clinton wrote in a letter to Saudi King 
Fahd. The letter was released here by Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Clinton has tried to use his persuasive powers to 
bolster U.S. industry. Thanks to his lobbying of King Fahd last year, the 
Saudis in February said they would buy commercial jetliners worth $6 billion 
from McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. rather than from Europe's Airbus 
Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Clinton gave U.S. cellular phone giant Motorola Inc. a big boost earlier 
this year when he pushed the Japanese government to help clear the way for 
Motorola to compete on an equal footing in the Tokyo cellular market. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said Clinton's intervention on behalf of U.S. companies in Saudi 
Arabia reflects Administration attempts to leverage the U.S.-led victory in the 
1991 Persian Gulf War, which protected Saudi Arabia and its massive oil 
reserves from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said Clinton's appeals on behalf of Motorola and others elsewhere in 
the world are part of a broader effort to help U.S. companies better compete 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly connected to the Gulf War, but it's more than that," said 
Robert Paulson, aerospace director with the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in 
Los Angeles. Clinton is "playing a post-Cold War game of economic influence" 
and attempting to "level the playing field in international commerce," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Clinton is risking going to the well once too often. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit dangerous in the long run, because I think the Saudi people 
are not terribly enthused about this picture of the Saudi king bowing to 
American pressure," said James E. Akins, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi 
Arabia and now a consultant in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Akins noted, however, that Clinton is simply making the same personal effort 
that many government leaders in Europe and elsewhere routinely make on behalf 
of their industries when big contracts are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Clinton's request, King Fahd discussed the pending telecommunications 
purchase with Christopher during the secretary's one-day stop in Saudi Arabia. 
Christopher said afterward that New York-based AT&T was being given "serious 
consideration." He is mainly in the region to discuss the Mideast peace process 
and other regional security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At AT&T, spokeswoman Suzanne Berman said the company is "pleased to have any 
effort by the Administration on our behalf," but she declined to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia's telecommunications contract would involve adding more than 
500,000 telephone lines to the overloaded Saudi system and converting the 
system to a newer digital format. 
</P>
<P>
 The other competitors for the contract are Northern Telecom of Canada, Siemens 
of Germany, Alcatel-Alsthom of France and a joint venture of Ericsson of Sweden 
and NEC of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi officials in the United States were unavailable for comment Wednesday, 
as the Saudi Embassy and consulate offices were closed in observance of former 
President Richard Nixon's funeral.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: FEDERAL RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT IN NEED OF SOME 
SPINOFF CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps you thought the end of the Cold War had zapped the multibillion-dollar 
"Star Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative smack out of budgetary existence. 
Hardly. A leaner, meaner SDI now lives on as BMDO -- the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization -- and as the most blatant example of how Cold War 
technologists are pushing economic competitiveness as a reason to keep 
themselves in business. 
</P>
<P>
 While BMDO has yet to produce any effective ballistic missile defense 
capability to protect the United States, it has produced a beautifully 
illustrated report summarizing its manifold contributions to enhancing 
America's commercial technologies. BMDO's latest Technology Applications Report 
proffers a colorful array of technical innovations, ranging from niobium 
superconducting RFQs (never mind the acronym) for producing better particle 
beams to silicon carbide dynamic random access memory chips to optical 
scatterometers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization recognizes that one of the most 
efficient ways to incorporate innovation into the nation's economy is to 
transfer federal technology -- developed by matchless expertise -- into 
American business," proclaims the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the "spinoffification" of America's federal research establishment. 
From Lawrence Livermore to Los Alamos to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to 
Brookhaven, national laboratories that once prided themselves on their missions 
and world-class research capabilities have desperately been scrambling to 
promote themselves as vital sources of commercial spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, spinoffs have become central to how the labs now try to define 
themselves; they've gone from welcome byproduct to essential goal. Every lab 
wants its own Tang. Economic relevance has become the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what they think is their route to survival in an era of diminishing 
federal funds, and they're promoting themselves accordingly," observes Michael 
Odza, editor of Technology Access, which tracks technology transfer in the 
commercial, academic and governmental worlds. "The publicity machine is the 
first thing to get cranked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Odza estimates that the Cold War-funded federal labs have been sending out "10 
times more material . . . an order of magnitude more" than they did during the 
1980s to sell themselves to Congress and the business community as wellsprings 
of commercial innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 This should hardly come as a surprise. For many of the nation's labs, 
contributing to economic competitiveness or helping clean up the environmental 
messes they helped make is probably the best shot they have at justifying their 
existence. Publicizing and celebrating their expertise -- and inviting 
partnership and support from the private sector -- are all reasonable things to 
do when you're worried about survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, does it really make sense for taxpayers -- and for the labs 
themselves -- to spend billions to re-engineer these 30-year-old-plus 
institutions around the promises of commercialism? Should they be America's 
National Labs or primarily National Science & Technology Subcontractors for 
Private Industry? Precisely which industries should be defining science and 
technology goals for the labs? 
</P>
<P>
 The spinoffification of the labs has blurred what should be an important 
debate about the role of government in funding America's innovation 
infrastructure. Too much time, money and effort is being spent on trying to 
turn the National Labs into engines of commercialism, and not enough thought is 
going into what kind of science and technology the federal government should be 
supporting. Whatever industry wants? Whatever Japan or Europe might be beating 
us in? Spinoffification has unfortunately kept the focus on transforming 
existing institutions rather than creating new opportunities.

 Take the Department of Energy, for example, which oversees $30 billion worth 
of national labs. Living up to its name, DOE has been very energetic recently 
in promoting its labs as partners for industry. "We really were behind the 
learning curve of other agencies in this," acknowledges Roger A. Lewis, who 
directs DOE's Office of Technology Utilization. "We very much recognize that we 
need to change the culture of the labs so they can be better partners." 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, DOE has been quite aggressive in soliciting feedback from 
industry on its cooperative research and development agreements. Unfortunately, 
most of that feedback reveals that the labs are not very good at being partners 
with industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The labs collectively have a long way to go. Some labs do better than others, 
but what DOE really has is a portfolio of diverse institutions that never had 
technology transfer as a core value. Many of the people who joined the National 
Labs did so precisely to avoid having to deal with the constraints of 
commercial enterprise. These Labs simply weren't designed to be transformed 
into quasi-commercial endeavors. How long do we give them to deliver the goods? 
</P>
<P>
 This push toward spinoffification isn't "a sham or a cover," asserts Jerome A. 
Moch, an executive with Motorola University, the high-tech company's education 
unit, who works closely with the labs. "The directors and people I have 
interfaced with understand what they need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Moch acknowledges that there is but "a moderate chance of success with 
selected labs" in achieving a fundamental transformation. Indeed, reorienting 
DOE's Labs has proven such a thorny issue that Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary 
effectively punted the challenge over to a commission headed by Motorola 
Chairman Robert Galvin. Galvin's commission will make its recommendations next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever those recommendations may be, there should be no doubt that 
spinoffification will continue to be the most public justification for funding 
the labs at their current multibillion-dollar levels. Fulfilling the 
expectations of spinoffification may be the riskiest challenge the labs have 
undertaken.

 The final bill has been tallied for the Hoover vacuum cleaner company's 
disastrous free-flights promotion -- and it's a whopper.Hoover, overwhelmed by 
the response to an offer of free international tickets to English and Irish 
purchasers of appliances, spent $72 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When the promotion ends, Hoover will have flown more than 220,000 people for 
free. Consumers realized the obvious: that vacuum cleaners are cheaper than 
international air fares. So they bought Hoovers by the thousands and demanded 
tickets.

A PATCH OF PROMISE; STUDENT GARDEN PROVIDED THE SEEDS FOR A BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hopes of 40 enterprising South Los Angeles high school students will today 
be in the hands of grocery shoppers across the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight Out 'the Garden salad dressing -- a concoction created and marketed 
by students at Crenshaw High School -- will begin to hit 2,000 supermarket 
shelves throughout Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 What began two years ago as a simple vegetable garden behind Crenshaw High's 
football field has evolved into the first student-run natural foods company in 
the country. Far beyond that, it is a clear example of how cooperation among 
people from all parts of the city -- rich and poor, minority and white -- can 
coax positive things to rise from the ashes of the riots that nearly ripped Los 
Angeles apart two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Every major grocery chain -- including Vons, Lucky, Ralphs, Albertsons and 
Alpha Beta -- will carry the group's all-natural dressing, whose proceeds will 
be plowed back into college scholarships for students at the predominantly 
African American and Latino high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, student-run business behind the venture, Food From the 'Hood, 
hopes to raise up to $200,000 in scholarship money this year, mostly through 
sales of the salad dressing at supermarkets. If the creamy Italian dressing 
proves to be profitable at $2.59 a jar, it could help lay the groundwork for 
even more central city projects that not only create jobs, but real-world 
business ownership opportunities for inner-city youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inner-city kids can do a lot more than loot and riot," said Jaynell Grayson, 
16, an 11th-grader at the school whose passionate presentation helped persuade 
Lucky Stores to carry the brand. "It is one thing to shout and complain about 
things that go on. But we can do much more than that. This is all about 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarket executives insist that the decisions to stock the salad dressing 
were neither public relations ploys nor acts of charitable kindness from the 
big chains -- some of which have been criticized for not doing enough to help 
rebuild Los Angeles since the riots.  
</P>
<P>
 "The product is a good product, and that's the bottom line for us," said Kevin 
Davis, senior vice president of Ralphs Grocery Co., which is stocking the 
dressing at all 166 of its Southern California stores. "It looks good. It 
tastes good. And we expect to see repeat sales," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At rival Lucky Stores, buyer Debra Levin said that after tasting the dressing, 
her decision to stock it was simple. "If I was served it in a restaurant, I'd 
be very happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ingredients for the salad dressing do not come directly from the 
student garden, the idea for the dressing -- which has no preservatives and no 
cholesterol -- was inspired by the herbs grown there. 
</P>
<P>
 The dressing, which can be purchased at stores in Beverly Hills or Baldwin 
Hills, is the direct result of dozens of individuals -- each uniquely affected 
by the riots -- banding together with the shared goal of creating jobs and 
business ownership opportunities for minority youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key players: 
</P>
<P>
 Forty minority high school students -- all eager to learn about business. A 
teacher who turned a patch of earth into a thriving garden. A public relations 
executive whose idea it was to convert that garden into a business. A minority 
investment banker who helped the group draw up a business plan. A food packer 
who took the project seriously. A food broker who helped persuade supermarkets 
to carry the unconventional brand. A West Coast salad dressing king who loaned 
the group his strategic counsel and his name. And critical grants from several 
groups, including RLA and the city of Los Angeles, which together exceeded 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the school's participating students has an "ownership" stake in Food 
From the 'Hood. Based on academic achievement, college prep work and volunteer 
work in the garden or office, students accumulate "points" that convert 
directly into college scholarship money when they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work in the garden -- after school, during their free periods and 
occasionally on weekends. Other students help by answering phones or filing 
papers in the group's office at the school, which until recently was a science 
lab. And students participated in every step -- from the creation to the 
marketing of the salad dressing. Some of them will soon be handing out samples 
of the dressing at neighborhood stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is constant adult supervision by a teacher or full-time 
volunteer, students are calling most of the shots. The group has intentionally 
not formalized its management structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Students refer to themselves as student owners because the proceeds will go 
toward their college educations. What's more, virtually all of the decisions on 
the salad dressing -- from its ingredients to the look of the label -- were 
made by students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Osborne, 16, helped design the label on the bottles. The colorful image 
shows a blossoming vegetable garden in the middle of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show that beauty can exist in the inner city," Osborne said. "And 
if you look closely, you see pink, purple, green and red people in the middle 
of the garden. Everyone is welcome here." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most welcome, however, is Melinda McMullen, a Los Angeles public 
relations professional who left her executive job nearly a year ago to work 
full time on the project. After watching the riots on television, she called a 
friend at the Los Angeles Conservation Corp., who linked her up with a project 
under way at Crenshaw High, where students were attempting to develop a 
vegetable garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has no agriculture teacher, but the garden started coming to life 
under the auspices of Tammy Bird, a biology teacher who quit coaching the 
school's male and female volleyball teams to devote all of her spare time to 
the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen, who had never even been to the inner city, saw the garden for the 
first time and recalls thinking to herself: "The riots weren't about gardening. 
They were about business."  
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that they try selling the garden's produce. The object: to 
empower the students by giving them a stake in the results of the project. But 
the income was limited, and the vegetables spoiled quickly. That's when the 
group decided on the next logical extension. Since their garden was full of 
lettuce and herbs, why not also make the stuff that gets poured on top of it? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if actor Paul Newman could successfully sell a salad dressing that 
helps more than 400 charities worldwide, why couldn't Food From the 'Hood sell 
a dressing that helps students help themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the group started linking up with professionals for guidance. 
Among the most important: Norris Bernstein, whose family ran a successful 
restaurant and salad dressing business in Long Beach for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein is a volunteer consultant who shows up at most of the student's 
weekly planning sessions. Among other things, he advised them to try to get the 
dressing placed at major grocery chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who sold his salad dressing business 20 years ago and is now a 
management consultant, read about the group in a newspaper article. "Most 
people have six or seven bottles of salad dressing in their refrigerators," he 
said. "There's a pretty good shot at getting people to try a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the students concoct the recipe was Paula Savett, president of 
Hawthorne-based Sweet Adelaide Enterprises, a large salad dressing packer. Her 
company manufactures the dressing in large vats and packs it into 12-ounce 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles minority-owned investment banking firm, Luther Smith & Small, 
helped the students write a business plan. And the students even paid a 
professional food broker, Orange-based Bromar of Southern California, to help 
them get the dressing on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Landreth, president of Bromar, paved the way for the students to make 
their pitches to supermarket buyers. He's optimistic about the students' chance 
of success, saying that new products don't need huge sales to be considered 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They only have to sell nine bottles per store per week to be a big success," 
Landreth said. "That doesn't sound like much, does it?"

MOTHER-DAUGHTER BUSINESSES NEED A WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO SUCCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 On this second annual "Take Our Daughters to Work Day," Rachel Salinas will be 
able to glance across the office and see her daughter, Terie, busy at a variety 
of tasks. But then, she can do that any day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Terie, 32, is the boss at Superior Powertrain, an automotive 
transmission remanufacturer in Huntington Park, which the two women co-own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt about it, she's in charge," said Rachel, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we make all the decisions together," Terie added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers and daughters working together has become the hot new trend in small 
business, largely because more women are starting companies than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 While their ranks are still small, their successes have been visible: Working 
Women magazine cited among the nation's top women-owed companies 
Minnesota-based Smead Manufacturing, built by a mother-daughter team into a 
$200-million operation with 2,600 employees. In Los Angeles, one of the biggest 
women-owned businesses is Frieda's Inc., which wholesaled more than $23 million 
in exotic produce under the guidance of Frieda Caplan and her daughters, Karen 
and Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fathers and sons seem to be sort of standard," said Jon Goodman, director of 
USC's entrepreneur program. "That reflects how few women in the previous 
generation opted for the work world, and that has changed radically." 
</P>
<P>
 But women are opening companies at a rate more than twice that of men, and 
they now own slightly more than a third of the businesses in the United States, 
said Julie Weeks, director of research for the National Assn. of Women Business 
Owners. An estimated 6.5 million women-owned companies collectively employ more 
people than all of the Fortune 500 firms combined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among more than 600 family-owned companies surveyed last year by the Gallup 
Organization for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., 46% reported that a 
son was actively involved in the business and 19% said a daughter was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 But while working with your family can be rewarding, it can also be very 
challenging, experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Family businesses can be fragile, and only an estimated 30% survive a year 
after the second generation takes over, said Jacqueline Freiberg, director of 
the University of San Diego Family Business Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 She said avoiding mother-daughter conflicts in the workplace can be 
accomplished through communication, flexibility and forbearance when it comes 
to those special torments that only family members know how to inflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Freiberg also recommends that the children first gain experience outside the 
family business and that all involved formally assess their strengths and 
weaknesses. Weekly meetings, perhaps led by a neutral third party, are helpful, 
as are outside confidants and mentors for both mother and daughter, she said. 
Formal job descriptions and compensation plans are also a good idea, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important for both parties to be mature and to know what buttons 
to push and what not to push," Freiberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Pepys admits that she had concerns four years ago when she invited her 
daughter, Renee, now 29, to join NoJo Inc., a Rancho Santa Margarita-based baby 
clothing and accessories company she founded with a neighbor 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still do," Pepys said. She wants to avoid a situation she encountered where 
a company's brother and sister co-owners alternated claiming the president's 
title and duties because that was the only way they could work out their power 
struggle. If any of her three other children join NoJo, Pepys said, she will 
insist on counseling for everyone to resolve family rivalries and help them 
work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the business in the world isn't worth risking your family 
relationships," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the skills Renee brought to NoJo have been partly responsible for the 
company's rapid growth during the last two years, and she was recently 
appointed chief operating officer, Pepys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is much more of a manager, a better one than I am," Pepys said. "I'm more 
creative and marketing-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Caplan, president and chief executive of Frieda's Inc., which her mother 
founded 32 years ago, credits family members' complementary skills for helping 
catapult the business to new sales heights. But she also remembers a 
particularly vocal argument with her mother several years ago conducted in the 
middle of the produce wholesaler's Downtown Los Angeles operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees thought, 'Oh my God. A) How could Karen talk to her mother like 
that? and B) What's going to happen with the company?' " Caplan said. But 
honest discussion, divorced from family feelings, is one of the secrets behind 
running a successful family business, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't let our family relationships hinder how we honestly feel," said 
Caplan, who admits that she and her mother, now company chairman, are both 
"very outspoken." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked there since I was 10 years old," she said. "My mother had a rule: 
You don't get any preferential treatment if you're a member of the family at 
the office." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, working with family means there is an unspoken trust and 
sense of values, Caplan said. In recent negotiations for a new site, the other 
family members relied on her to scout out locations and sign the lease before 
they went to visit the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot different than just having someone work for you," said Caplan, 
whose husband also works at Frieda's (and has instituted a talking-about-work 
moratorium at home). "I wouldn't have it any other way. . . . Every day we draw 
from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 At Superior Powertrain, which the two bought five years ago, Terie Salinas 
handles sales, marketing and administration while mother Rachel oversees the 
production end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be more than a mom-and-pop operation," said Terie, who hopes 
to expand the five-employee firm with capital recently received from the RLA 
(formerly Rebuild L.A.) minority business loan fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're growing, so there are growing pains," she said. "It hasn't been easy." 
</P>
<P>
 "But she has a pretty level head on her shoulders," Rachel said. "I let her 
run it the way she thinks is best."

CARTER HAWLEY TO CHANGE NAME TO BROADWAY; RETAIL: COMPANY WILL ASK SHAREHOLDERS 
TO APPROVE THE MOVE TO HELP ESTABLISH A MORE POSITIVE IDENTITY FOR THE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to create a more positive identity, Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. on 
Wednesday said it will change its corporate name to Broadway Stores Inc., 
pending shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would allow the Los Angeles-based retailer to link its corporate 
identity more closely to its store operations, said David Dworkin, the 
company's president and chief executive.The Broadway is Carter Hawley's largest 
chain, accounting for 52 of its 83 stores. The names of the company's other two 
chains, Emporium and Weinstocks, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The new name would "accompany the new sense of revitalization" at the company, 
Dworkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley has changed some of the Broadway's merchandise mix and is 
remodeling many of its stores in a bid to boost sales and sustain a recovery 
that began when the corporation emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization in 1992. Burdened by debt and hobbled by weak industrywide 
sales, Carter Hawley -- then led by Philip Hawley -- filed for bankruptcy 
protection in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley retired as chairman and chief executive in October, 1992, after 20 
years in top positions at the company. The corporation's name was changed from 
Broadway-Hale Stores to Carter Hawley Hale in 1974 to reflect the leadership 
roles of then-Chairman Edward W. Carter and then-President Hawley. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Hawley was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name Carter Hawley Hale does not have a very positive reputation because 
of the company's downhill ride during the last few years of Phil Hawley's 
stewardship," said Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail economist. "Dworkin is 
trying to cast out the debris of the past and set the company on a new road." 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders will vote on the proposal at the company's June 17 annual 
meeting.

LATEST DEADLINE NEAR, TACO BELL STILL WAITING TO MAKE ITS MOVE; CORPORATIONS: 
COMPANY'S HESITATION KEEPS HEADQUARTERS EMPLOYEES, ALONG WITH O.C., STATE AND 
TEXAS OFFICIALS, ON EDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Executives at Taco Bell Corp. moved decisively in the first quarter to cut 
losses and record healthy financial gains, but they couldn't make up their 
minds about where to put their corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive search team, at work since last summer, has narrowed the choices 
to sites in Orange County and Texas. But the company has missed two 
self-imposed deadlines and is sliding through a third. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the Mexican-style fast-food chain said it would announce "a final 
decision in the next few weeks." But on Wednesday, a day after announcing a 22% 
increase in revenue for the first quarter and an 8% rise in operating profit, 
the company still would not say when it will announce whether it is staying or 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has drawn statewide attention because Taco Bell typifies the type 
of company California would like to attract and keep: a service corporation 
with hundreds of white-collar jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has asked the company to stay, and Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) has not only made a personal appeal but has said he 
will introduce an amendment to a pending bill that would give all large 
corporate offices -- those with at least 200 employees -- tax credits for 
building a new headquarters or expanding operations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Local government officials and business organizations have been involved too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell's is a pivotal decision," Terry Hartman, president of the Irvine 
Chamber of Commerce, said recently. "If they leave, we've lost a major effort 
to retain somebody. If they stay, we've got a major win that we could use to 
anchor down others." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times last month, Taco Bell Chief Executive John E. 
Martin said the company was "this close" to moving to Texas when local and 
state officials "got religion" and began to offer incentives and inducements 
that could help to sway his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, with its less expensive land and lower-cost work force, is offering the 
company a package that includes $10 million in tax credits and other incentives 
to relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the 1,000 employees and full-time contract workers at Taco Bell's 
12-story headquarters in Irvine are anxiously waiting for a decision on where 
the new corporate office will be when the lease on its current quarters expires 
in November, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the announcement so we can plan our lives," one employee said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half of the employees are likely to be moved should the company 
decide to leave for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where it is looking at a site 
in the Dallas suburb of Plano. A sister company, Frito-Lay Inc., is based 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 While it has been weighing the decision, Taco Bell's first-quarter earnings 
have added to its allure. Sales at stores open a year earlier -- a key 
measurement of a retail chain's financial health -- grew for the 22nd 
consecutive quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, part of the PepsiCo Inc. conglomerate, said its first-quarter 
operating profit rose to $33.7 million from $31.1 million for the same period 
last year. Revenue climbed to $673.7 million from $551 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a drag on its earnings from its Hot 'n Now hamburger affiliate, Taco 
Bell outperformed PepsiCo's two other restaurant units, Pizza Hut and KFC, both 
of which reported significant declines in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Its earnings were hurt by higher costs from new efficiency efforts and 
additional hiring for anticipated growth. Earnings also suffered from a shift 
in product mix to items with lower profit margins and from losses at its 
low-priced Hot 'n Now, primarily a small Michigan and Southeast operation that 
closed an undisclosed number of stores last year as major hamburger chains 
started lowering their prices. Taco Bell intends to reopen those Hot 'n Now 
stores at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's effort helped PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., post a 9% rise in 
first-quarter profit to $282.8 million, or 35 cents a share, and a 13% increase 
in revenue to $5.7 billion.

 Judge Orders Keating to Pay Another $4.3 Billion: The former head of Lincoln 
Savings & Loan -- already serving a 12 1/2-year prison sentence and under 
orders to pay $2.5 billion in damages stemming from the thrift's collapse -- 
faces the latest judgment in a case brought by the Resolution Trust Corp. The 
RTC accused Charles Keating Jr. of converting Lincoln and its parent, 
Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., into a gigantic racketeering 
conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby entered the judgment in Tucson, 
Ariz., last week. Keating's lawyer said the sum was uncollectable.

Allis-Chalmers, is based in the Atlanta suburb of Duluth. It had 1993 sales of 
$596 million and now operates primarily in North America.

 20th Century Ratings Downgraded: Swamped by an estimated $475 million in 
insurance claims costs from the Northridge earthquake, Woodland Hills-based 
20th Century Industries had its financial strength rating downgraded Wednesday 
by A.M. Best Co. to A- ("excellent") from A+ ("superior"). The Best downgrade 
followed similar action last week by Standard & Poor's, which dropped 20th 
Century from AA ("excellent") to BBB+ ("adequate"). Both rating agencies cited 
20th Century's record $256-million first-quarter loss, which reduced the 
company's surplus -- or cushion against losses -- by 42%.

ADVENTURES IN MAGAZINELAND; AS A PUBLISHER, DISNEY EXCELS AT MARKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of Walt Disney Co. and theme parks, and Mickey Mouse and box office hits 
come to mind. But the Burbank-based entertainment powerhouse is also a budding 
magazine publisher, and though the odds against new publications are long, 
Disney is using its marketing savvy and financial muscle to expand its 
4-year-old magazine group. 
</P>
<P>
 In two start-up publications, Disney has tapped themes it knows how to exploit 
perhaps better than anyone: children and families. Its first magazine, the 
digest-sized, youth-oriented Disney Adventures, made its debut in 1990, and its 
circulation has soared to nearly 1 million. Family Fun, acquired by Disney in 
1991, has 615,000 readers, mostly baby boomer parents. The company's third 
magazine, Discover, is a slick science publication acquired in 1991 from 
now-defunct Family Media Inc.; it has a circulation of 1.03 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Disney is planning a fourth publication, Family PC, in a joint venture 
with New York-based Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., a major publisher of computer 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Magazines are still a minuscule part of Disney's $8.5 billion in revenue. The 
company doesn't publicize revenue and profit figures for the 130-employee 
division, but based on total circulation added to subscription and advertising 
rates, annual magazine revenue probably doesn't exceed $90 million. That's 
about as much as one hit movie from Disney might reap in domestic ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of Disney, we're a gnat," said John Skipper, former publisher of US 
magazine and president of Spin magazine, who was recruited in 1990 as a Disney 
vice president and head of the magazine group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," he added with a laugh, "we might be a fly by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gnat or fly, it's becoming clear that Disney has found in magazines yet 
another way to cash in on its franchise. The monthly Disney Adventures 
unabashedly plugs Disney movies and TV shows, and one cover was themed around 
Disney's NHL hockey team, the Mighty Ducks. Family Fun runs ads for Disney 
resorts next to features on hiking in Glacier National Park and other family 
getaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Such self-promotion has provoked harsh words from critics -- but even they 
acknowledge that Disney does it no more blatantly than some others in the 
cutthroat magazine business. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Adventures "a little bit crosses the line" because it's hard to 
distinguish editorial from ads, said Samir Husni, head of the magazine program 
at the University of Mississippi and publisher of the Guide to New Consumer 
Magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't go as far as magazines based on GI Joe and Barbie dolls, and 
Disney Adventures also mixes education with the entertainment, Husni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney doesn't view its magazines as mere promotional tools. It aims to make 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 After Disney acquired Discover from Family Media for an undisclosed price, 
Skipper overhauled its design, hired a new business staff, banned tobacco 
advertising and limited direct-mail ads -- previously Discover's mainstay. The 
result: Discover now attracts big national advertisers such as computer chip 
maker Intel Corp., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. The 
magazine's 1993 ad revenue zoomed 42% to $13.1 million, from $9.2 million in 
1992, according to Publishers Information Bureau Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 More problematic in terms of ads is Disney Adventures. Skipper said he's still 
having a hard time convincing potential advertisers that they can reach 
children through a medium other than television. Nonetheless, he expects the 
magazine to be in the black this year, which would be a rare feat for such a 
young publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Adventures was conceived more than four years ago when Michael Lynton, 
then director of business development for Disney's consumer products division, 
took note of Topolino, a children's magazine in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Topolino (Italy's translation of "Mickey Mouse") consisted mostly of comics 
and was a raging success. It had been put out by an Italian publisher for many 
years under license from Disney, and Disney had just taken the license back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton proposed starting a similar publication here but with fewer comics and 
more features. At first, it was seen as a way to promote the Disney Channel's 
afternoon cable TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept quickly broadened to encompass sports, celebrities and films 
-- even those from other movie studios. Similar to strategies employed at 
Sports Illustrated for Kids and the new Nickelodeon magazine, Lynton's bet was 
that children would forsake video games and pick up a magazine if it had 
ready-made brand identification and didn't read like a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The editor of Disney Adventures, Tommi Lewis, said she stays in touch with her 
young readers by "talking" to some of them on the America Online computer 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Fun, published 10 times a year by Disney, is also expected to become 
profitable later this year and is "our best ad success," Skipper said. Some 
issues have had an impressive 100 pages and more of ads from companies such as 
Quaker Oats, consumer products maker Procter & Gamble and Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Started by former U.S. News & World Report executive Jake Winebaum and sold to 
Disney after its second issue, Family Fun veers from the old formula of 
articles for new mothers by emphasizing activities for families with children 
ages 3 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "That magazine talks to me in a way that publications like Parenting and 
Parents do not," said Tony Silber, executive editor at Folio, a Stamford, 
Conn.-based magazine for the magazine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, survival is no easy task. With so many magazines competing in a soft ad 
market, publishers must increasingly rely on subscriptions and newsstand sales. 
To try to boost the latter, Skipper said, Disney pays a premium to place Disney 
Adventures in the "expensive real estate" of magazine racks next to supermarket 
checkout counters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton, now head of the Disney publishing division, which also includes books 
and art publishing, argued that most new magazines fail because they are 
"underfinanced, not terribly well thought out, or don't build on an existing 
franchise. With Disney, we had those things pretty well licked." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has "a good circulation story," said Jacqueline Leo, editor in chief of 
Family Circle magazine, published by New York Times Co. "The question is always 
renewals. It takes about five years to see if they've really got something 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Disney is forging ahead with plans to start Family PC in 
September. The new magazine, with Winebaum as publisher, will be aimed at the 
15 million families with both children and home computers. Skipper said the 
idea is generating interest from potential advertisers, including computer and 
software firms.

NEW YORK SUES RENTAL CAR COMPANIES OVER AGE LIMITS; CONSUMERS: LAW GUARANTEES 
DRIVERS 21 AND OLDER THE RIGHT TO RENT. FIVE FIRMS SAY INSURANCE IS THE 
PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state of New York on Wednesday sued five car rental companies for refusing 
to rent vehicles to licensed New York drivers between ages 18 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The car rental companies say they cannot rent to the young drivers because no 
insurance is available -- a claim the state disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, names Hertz, National 
Car Rental System, Budget Rent A Car, Alamo Rent-A-Car and Ameri-Car. The 
companies impose the age restrictions nationwide, but New York law requires 
that they rent to drivers 21 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks ago, in letters to these companies and four others, I warned that 
they were violating New York law by refusing to rent to young drivers. I 
demanded that they cease this practice or face lawsuits brought by my office," 
Atty. Gen. G. Oliver Koppell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These five companies, by their responses to my letters, made it clear that 
there was no choice but to sue. New York will not tolerate illegal age 
discrimination in the rental of automobiles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New York contends that insurance is available to cover rentals under New 
York's Assigned Risk Plan, an insurance pool. The state has said the companies 
could pass on the cost of the insurance to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Hertz, Budget and Alamo said no insurance is available in the 
voluntary insurance market if they rent to younger drivers. They also said the 
Assigned Risk Plan would not adequately protect either drivers or rental 
companies and would not provide the type of insurance coverage that is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Most car companies are self-insured. Those who do rent to drivers under 26 in 
New York pass the extra costs on to customers through a surcharge -- a practice 
the state wants the defendant companies to adopt. The surcharge varies from $8 
a day to $20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other companies have yet to take a position on the matter and are in 
talks with the state. They are Avis Rent A Car System, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, 
Thrifty Car Rental and Dollar Systems.

FLAGSTAR TO SELL CANTEEN TO BRITISH CATERER; MERGERS: COMPASS GROUP WILL PAY 
$450 MILLION FOR THE FOOD SERVICES AND VENDING BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second takeover of a U.S. firm by a British company in as many days, 
restaurant operator Flagstar Cos. said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell the 
Canteen food service and vending machine business to British caterer Compass 
Group for $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Canteen provides food service and vending for a wide range of clients, from 
major business and industry locations to hospitals, retirement centers and 
correctional institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar, the third-largest food services company in the United States, said 
it decided to sell Canteen so it could focus on its core restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sale of our Canteen food and vending business will enable us to begin to 
reduce debt and focus our growth capital on our Denny's, Hardee's, Quincy's and 
El Pollo Loco brands," Flagstar Chairman and Chief Executive Jerome Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar, with revenue of $4 billion last year, is 47%-controlled by Wall 
Street investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal follows the announcement Tuesday by consumer products giant American 
Brands Inc. that it is selling its American Tobacco unit to Britain's BAT 
industries for $1 billion and adds to the already-huge British investment in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Another British food and beverage giant, Grand Metropolitan, owns 
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, the Burger King restaurant chain and ice cream 
maker Haagen Daz. 
</P>
<P>
 Compass said the chance to buy Canteen was too good to pass up. "We see this 
as a onetime opportunity to buy into the world's biggest food services market," 
Mike Bailey, who will head the business for the British company, told a news 
conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that Compass had been aiming for more gradual expansion, mainly 
targeting Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Compass will gain franchise rights to Flagstar's Los 
Angeles-based Mexican-style chicken chain El Pollo Loco and Denny's in some 
U.S. markets, as well as exclusive use of the Denny's and Quincy's steakhouse 
brands in Britain and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar said Canteen's Volume Services and TW Recreational Services 
businesses are not included in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Canteen had sales of more than $1 billion in 1993 and operating profit of $38 
million, down from $49 million in 1992. It has 20,000 employees serving 12,000 
food service accounts and more than 100,000 vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Compass, formed by a group of former managers at Grand Metropolitan in 1987, 
said it expects the acquisition to enhance its earnings immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The British company, which also announced a 28% gain in pretax profit for the 
half year of $34.77 million, said it will fund the purchase with a stock rights 
issue, to raise $217.7 million, and bank borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant industry analysts in London said Compass might be setting too fast 
a pace for growth. It has expanded nearly fourfold since it sold stock in 1988, 
and last June it bought airport catering business Scandinavian Service Partner 
for $107.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possibly a little premature after their last acquisition," one analyst 
said. "But on the other hand, when these opportunities come up, you have to 
take them."

 GE Won't Raise Bid for Kemper: John Welch, chairman of Fairfield, Conn.-based 
General Electric Co., said after the annual shareholders meeting that the 
company has no immediate plans to raise its $55-a-share bid for the Long Grove, 
Ill.-based mutual fund and asset management firm. Last month, when the 
$2.35-billion, all-cash bid was announced, the GE Capital subsidiary said it 
might increase its offer if "it seemed appropriate" after a review of Kemper's 
real estate portfolio. But Welch said Kemper has not allowed GE to examine its 
real estate portfolio, which has been a major drain on Kemper's profit over 
several years. Kemper's management has twice rejected GE's overtures.

 Prosecutors Say Former GM Exec Had Documents: They confirmed that secret 
General Motors Corp. papers were found at a residence of Jose Ignacio Lopez de 
Arriortua after the cost-cutting executive quit GM to join Volkswagen.While 
strengthening the case against GM's former head of worldwide purchasing, the 
Darmstadt, Germany, prosecutor's office did not say explicitly that Lopez 
illegally took secrets to VW. Nor would it confirm press reports that Lopez 
would soon be indicted. Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, accused Lopez of 
industrial espionage after he moved to Volkswagen in March, 1993.

 Sega, MGM to Collaborate on Products: Executives said the two companies will

 Xerox Corp., in the midst of a major restructuring, reported a sharp drop in 
its first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earned $129 million, or $1.05 a share, in the first quarter, a 32% 
drop from the $189 million, or $1.77 a share, it earned a year earlier.Revenue 
rose a modest 1.4% to $3.27 billion from $3.23 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The document processing company's earnings dropped because it had a 
$77-million gain last year from an asset management business that was sold. It 
has been divesting from financial services and focusing on document processing. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent quarter was also hurt by $61 million in foreign currency losses 
(compared with $23 million in losses the year-earlier quarter), from rising 
inflation and devaluation in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings from the core document processing business rose 5% to $131 million.

THE TIMES ECONOMIC INDEX

 Americans are feeling better about the economy -- a shift that could be 
self-fulfilling if it translates into more consumer spending, economists say. 
Indeed, the number who believe that the nation is not in a recession has jumped 
dramatically since late last year, according to the Los Angeles Times Poll. (In 
fact, official minders of such things say the last national recession ended in 
March, 1991.) 
</P>
<P>
 April polling highlighted one unpleasant prospect that has rattled financial 
markets this year: Interest rates are widely expected to go up in the next few 
months. Only 10% of those surveyed expect a more favorable interest rate 
climate in three months, while 52% expect rates to be higher. Still, people 
feel moderately better about major purchases and the job outlook than they did 
in most of 1993. The National Outlook Do you think we are in a recession?

 HOW THE INDEX IS COMPILED: The Times Economic Index is based on a set of 
questions asked regularly by the Los Angeles Times Poll to measure Americans' 
feelings about the strength of the economy. The questions include measures 
designed to gauge the current situation plus predictor questions that seek the 
public's assessment of conditions three months in the future. The latest survey 
was conducted April 16-19 among 1,682 adults nationwide. The margin of sampling 
error is plus or minus three percentage points. JONATHAN PETERSON

GREENBACK'S STABILITY IS PUZZLER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE; CURRENCY: DEALERS SEE 
MANY REASONS FOR THE DOLLAR'S VALUE TO FLUCTUATE. INSTEAD THEY ARE FACED WITH 
SLUGGISHNESS. 
</P>

 These are nervous times for foreign exchange dealers Chris Manno and Stephen 
Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting before blinking computer screens amid the trading room cacophony, the 
two PaineWebber currency traders say they are perplexed by the dollar's 
sluggishness, given the volatility of the stock and bond markets in the last 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the only ones scratching our heads over why the dollar hasn't 
reacted lately," said Flanagan, who joined PaineWebber last fall and has been a 
currency trader for 11 years. "It has become apparent that the dollar has 
become completely divorced from fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average has slumped 7% since it reached an all-time 
high on Jan. 31, although it has rallied in recent sessions. Bond prices have 
been pummeled the last few months, and the yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond 
has risen to the highest level of the Clinton Administration. But bonds have 
also recovered recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the dollar has languished, trading in narrow ranges against the Japanese 
yen and German mark, although events in those nations might have moved the 
foreign exchange markets at other times. 
</P>
<P>
 Manno, like Flanagan, specializes in dollar-yen trading. He said the dollar 
should also be reacting to trends in other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many factors that can affect currency trading," said Manno, who 
is chief spot dealer at PaineWebber. " . . . political news, economic news, 
foreign, rumors and sentiment -- any one of them can move the market, but 
lately none of them have been." 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, political gridlock has stalled efforts to reconvene trade talks with 
the United States. Hata faces the prospect of ruling without a majority in 
Parliament, yet the dollar has hovered between 102.5 and 105 yen since Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Win Thin, an international economist with MCM Currencywatch Inc., said the 
market's perception of a lack of progress on U.S.-Japanese trade issues will 
continue to hamper the dollar. "Market sentiment isn't easy to change," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, meanwhile, the central bank has lowered interest rates, an action 
that usually bolsters the dollar because lower foreign rates make U.S. 
investments more attractive. The dollar has been stalled between 1.67 and 1.72 
marks for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very frustrating market, so it's hard to make money right now," said 
Margaret Koudaraskas, foreign exchange technical analyst at Technical Data, a 
financial research firm in Boston. "Any rise in the dollar relative to other 
currencies brings immediate selling, to lock in profits. And investors remain 
timid on dollar buying, because of a lingering concern over stock market 
corrections and bond interest rates moving higher." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every rally is undermined before it really gets going," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Sterling, manager of international economics at Merrill Lynch & Co., 
said negative publicity about hedge funds and derivatives has also affected 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are investments tied to the performances of underlying stocks, 
bonds and currencies. They are a way of hedging, or offsetting, sharp market 
fluctuations. Also, hedge funds can borrow large amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies and fund managers took big losses when their currency or bond 
holdings dropped in value relative to the interest they were paying on debt. 
They were forced to sell, further eroding their holdings and the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as regulators pressure banks and brokerages to divulge details about 
their holdings in derivatives and hedge funds, there is less speculative cash 
flowing into the currency markets, Sterling said. "Many traders have been 
sitting on the sidelines waiting for the market to sort itself out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. interest rates have been rising. Analysts are surprised that 
the dollar has not reacted significantly to the combination of rising U.S. 
rates and falling German rates.

JAPAN'S POLITICAL WOES DRIVE THE DOLLAR DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the German mark Wednesday, as 
German short-term interest rates were cut and political gridlock continued in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Gallopo, chief dealer at Chemical Bank, said the dollar's slump against 
the yen may have to continue before intervention occurs. The U.S. currency has 
been trading at the low end of a narrow range against the yen for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the dollar gets down near the 100-yen level, then I think we'll see the 
G-7 nations coming in to break the dollar's fall," he said, referring to the 
Group of Seven, the world's largest industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was again stymied by Japan's uncertain political situation. 
</P>
<P>
 New Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is facing the prospect of ruling without a 
majority in Parliament. The United States has been pressing Japan to open its 
markets to help narrow the trade gap between the two nations, but talks between 
the two countries are stalled and unlikely to resume until the Japanese 
government is more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 If trade talks fail completely, many traders think the Clinton Administration 
will support a higher yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fell to 102.30 yen, down from Tuesday's 102.83. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also slipped against the German mark after the Bundesbank lowered 
its repurchase rate 0.11 percentage points to 5.47%. The rate is charged to 
banks that borrow from the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed at 1.672 German marks in New York, down from 1.676 on 
Tuesday. Earlier in Europe, the dollar fell to 1.671 marks from 1.680. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop in foreign rates usually strengthens the greenback because it makes 
U.S. investments, which are bought with dollars, more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, foreign stock markets closed generally higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index rallied after Mexican short-term interest rates declined 
for the first time in a month. The IPC index closed up 48.65 points, or 2.13%, 
at 2,332.78. 
</P>
<P>
 German share prices closed off the day's highs but higher than the previous 
day, as DAX futures prices bounced off lows and demand for Daimler and chemical 
stocks propped up the market. The DAX-30 index ended at 2,253.57, up 10.37 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks also ended firmer on index-linked buying by investment trusts 
just before the close, although the rise was exaggerated by very thin volume. 
The Nikkei 225-share average closed up 100.22 points at 19,729.15. 
</P>
<P>
 London shares firmed, with the Financial Times 100-share average closing up 
24.7 points at 3,150.0.

 General Motors Corp.'s data processing, defense-electronics and financial 
services subsidiaries announced first-quarter earnings Wednesday as the auto 
maker prepared to report its own financial results. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Acceptance Corp., the auto maker's Detroit-based financial 
services arm, said earnings declined 24% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings for the auto maker's Electronic Data Systems Corp. rose 14% and GM 
Hughes Electronics Corp., based in Los Angeles, said earnings increased by 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 GM itself will report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Acceptance Corp. earnings declined to $217 million, compared 
with $284 million. The first-quarter decline included a $7 million accounting 
charge related to benefit programs for former or inactive employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Robert T. O'Connell said the reduced income was due to lower asset 
levels and lower gains on asset sales, undertaken to maintain adequate cash to 
make loans to dealers and car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Data Systems Corp. earnings rose to $171.7 million from $151.4 
million. Earnings per share of GM Class E common stock were 36 cents, up from 
32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose to $2.24 billion from $2.07 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Lester Alberthal said the Dallas-based data processing unit added new 
customers and penetrated new world markets during the period. He cited new 
contracts with companies that included Xerox Corp., Video Lottery Technologies 
and apparel manufacturer London Fog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GM Hughes Electronics Corp. said its earnings rose to $251.1 million from 
$158.3 million. First-quarter earnings included a $30.4 million accounting 
charge related to future benefits to former employees. Earnings per share of GM 
Class H common stock were 70 cents, up from 47 cents. Revenue rose to $3.6 
billion from $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense and electronics contractor showed gains in its three major 
operating areas: automotive electronics, telecommunications and space, and 
defense electronics.

 Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a Los Angeles-based health maintenance 
organization, said its first-quarter earnings fell 23% primarily because of 
lower enrollment at its Indiana HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxicare said net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $2.3 million, 
or 9 cents a share, from $3 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue was down 2% to $106.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxicare said total membership fell 1.7% from the year-ago quarter. It 
attributed the decrease to an "expected decline" in enrollment in Indiana. It 
said the enrollment decline in Indiana was partly offset by membership gains in 
Illinois and Louisiana.

U.S. FIRMS POISED TO TAP NEW MARKETS AFTER S. AFRICA VOTE; POLITICS: SOCIAL 
CHANGES ARE LIKELY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT, MORE DEMAND 
FOR CONSUMER GOODS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American makers of computers, telephones, clothing, drugs and other consumer 
products are beating a path to a democratic South Africa to tap a market long 
deprived of full access to the world's latest technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street companies are also set to launch global bond offerings to fund 
massive growth projects for the new government and private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's first all-race election has inspired talk of nation building 
that involves massive investments from local and foreign governments and 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa is now playing catch-up" after years of being severed from U.S. 
business, said Meg Voorhes, an analyst at the Investor Responsibility Research 
Center, a Washington-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Policies to redress past social inequities are clearly going to be a central 
feature of economic policy," said Geoffrey Brooks, assistant professor of 
management at the Wharton School in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building housing and electrification are going to create all sorts of 
opportunities for investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 152 American companies have offices in South Africa, 45 of them 
opened since July, 1991, when President George Bush lifted the 1986 ban on new 
U.S. investment in the country, according to the IRRC. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are moving in even faster now that apartheid has crumbled and they 
are spared the sanctions by American states, cities, investment funds, colleges 
and consumers that caused an exodus from South Africa in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. this week announced plans to enter South 
Africa, while companies such as Bristol Myers Squibb, Colgate-Palmolive Co. and 
WordPerfect are expanding existing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Sara Lee Corp., the largest U.S. employer in South Africa, pumped 
new capital into its shoe polish, hosiery, intimate apparel and sales network 
there, hoping to boost its annual revenue base of $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 American companies wary of making direct investments are testing the market 
through local distributors. Such firms have quadrupled to about 400 since July, 
1991, according to an IRRC survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies making lower-priced consumer products are looking at the black 
consumer market," Voorhes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning customers is expected to be easy since many U.S. products found their 
way to South Africa through third-party distributors before sanctions were 
lifted. American brands are also well-known through television and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "So there's a ready market, and it's easy to get up and running and become 
profitable," Voorhes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, U.S. companies, which looked to Eastern Europe for greener 
pastures when South Africa was blackballed, are now setting their sights on the 
world's latest democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "On my first trip to South Africa, people were already consuming software," 
said Corey Freebairn, WordPerfect's regional director for Africa. "In Eastern 
Europe, they were wondering whether to computerize or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also English-speaking, so the software is already available in the 
language they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, South Africa's developed infrastructure and banking system make 
doing business there a breeze compared to former communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country still lags in telecommunications and banking technologies that 
Americans now take for granted. And despite a wide gap between the rich and 
poor, its growing economy and per-capita income are whetting an appetite for a 
better lifestyle, companies believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see significant demand for telephones and pagers," said a spokesman for 
Motorola Inc., which plans to reopen a sales office in Johannesburg, which it 
left in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate growth will require bank funding, and Citicorp will reopen its South 
African office by year's end, initially to serve commercial customers, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 More ambitious projects by the new government and private companies will be 
funded through capital market borrowings, and Wall Street firms such as Salomon 
Bros. Inc. are already gearing up for global bond offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 "By next week, things will get clearer," Salomon managing director John 
Purcell said of an imminent offering. "We're thinking of starting with a bond 
issue and then moving quickly to mergers and acquisitions and various kinds of 
deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent violence in South Africa has not deterred American plans to move into 
the country, according to a survey of eight companies by IRRC. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all told us they had been expecting violence to increase in the short 
term and are not fazed by it," Voorhes said. "South Africa still looks like an 
exciting long-term possibility."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: AMERICA WEST SLASHING FARES FOR CERTAIN FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America West Airlines began a round of fare cuts Wednesday on certain flights, 
including some at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The price reductions began as a round of deeper discounts initiated by 
Northwest Airlines and matched by other major carriers expired.Unlike those, 
America West's low fares do not cover all markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fares, for travel through Nov. 16, shave a third off so-called leisure 
fares -- those that require a 14-day advance purchase -- on some of the 
airline's longer routes. 
</P>
<P>
 America West offers 16 daily round-trip flights from John Wayne Airport. With 
the discount, the price of a round-trip ticket to New York will be $448 instead 
of the regular $623; to Chicago, $418, down from $569, and to Dallas, $358 
instead of $485. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare discounts do not cover America West flights to two popular 
destinations from Orange County: Las Vegas and Phoenix, where the carrier is 
based.

KEATING TOLD TO PAY ADDED $4.3 BILLION; COURTS: LINCOLN S&L HEAD IS DENIED A 
TRIAL BY FEDERAL JUDGE, WHO ENTERS SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN CASE BROUGHT BY THE RTC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn. boss Charles H. Keating Jr. has been 
ordered to pay an additional $4.3 billion by a judge who refused to hold what 
Keating says would have been his first full trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, previously ordered to pay $2.5 billion in the collapse of 
Irvine-based Lincoln, disclosed last week's judgment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest judgment was entered against the 71-year-old, imprisoned Keating by 
Richard Bilby, a Tucson, Ariz.-based federal judge. The case was brought by the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that disposes of the assets of 
failed S&Ls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilby granted the RTC's request for a summary judgment against Keating. 
Keating had asked for a full trial, saying he wanted to call more than 300 
witnesses to show that he had been made a scapegoat for the nation's S&L mess 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued through his lawyer, Keating attacked the "multiple, 
duplicative proceedings brought by numerous offices of the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 Keating contends that he is broke and has been denied a full forum by 
government pressure on potentially favorable witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government continues to spend vast amounts of taxpayer money to obtain 
uncollectible judgments against Mr. Keating in amounts far exceeding the 
fanciful amounts even the government contends were lost at Lincoln Savings," 
said a statement issued by Keating's lawyer, Stephen C. Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a spokesperson, Keating said he will appeal Bilby's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating is serving a 12 1/2-year prison sentence. He was convicted on 
California and federal charges of defrauding investors in his empire and 
looting Lincoln so that his family could live royally. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit brought by investors had resulted in huge judgments against Keating 
and phalanxes of lawyers, accountants and other financial professionals who 
worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating had previously estimated the total judgments against him at $2.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest case, the RTC had accused Keating of converting Lincoln and its 
parent, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., into a gigantic racketeering 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilby had split off the RTC's lawsuit from the one brought by the investors, 
which contained many of the same allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln was seized by regulators in April, 1989. The government says the 
bailout cost taxpayers more than $3 billion, making the thrift's collapse the 
nation's costliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating maintains that those figures were overstated by bureaucrats he had 
angered and by the government's mismanagement of his land, hotel and securities 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Formalizing a previously reported agreement, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission reported Tuesday that Keating has agreed to be banned from acting as 
an officer or director of any publicly held company. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting or denying liability, Keating settled the civil SEC charges 
accusing him of insider trading, filing false financial statements and issuing 
a false press release while chairman of American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges included an allegation that on seven occasions in 1986 and 1987, 
Keating sold American Continental stock after the company released inflated 
financial statements that presumably allowed him to get a better price for his 
shares. The sales totaled $7.5 million.

 Brimming With Knowledge: After he was laid off from his job as an aerospace 
engineer two years ago, Lee Sutherland signed up for a business ownership class 
at Coastline Community College in Fountain Valley. Armed with information he 
picked up in the course, Sutherland opened Balboa Island Coffee Co. last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffeehouse quickly became a hit with the islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had almost 100,000 customers since we opened our doors," Sutherland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of my success stories," said Peter Vander Haeghen, who teaches the 
ongoing nine-week course, in which students learn such essentials as how to 
write business plans, find creative financing and target customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, getting laid off from a job he'd had for years was frightening -- 
especially with two children in college, Sutherland said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that he has experienced business ownership, Sutherland said he could 
never go back to working for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had so much fun in my life," said Sutherland, 52. "Even with all 
the headaches of meeting payroll and working lots of hours, I would do it again 
in a second." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland said he picked up tips in the class that he has put into action in 
the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It taught me the fundamentals -- fill a consumer need, find a good location, 
hire good employees," Sutherland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Haeghen's course offers extensive planning for both start-up and 
existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many small-business owners get too involved in the details of daily 
operations and begin to lose sight of the long-range plan," he said. "Keeping 
one's nose to the grindstone can have its short-sighted disadvantages." 
</P>
<P>
 The class costs about $150, including books. Information: Coastline Community 
College at (714) 546-7600.

 The country's long-ailing economy is on the mend due to productivity gains, 
increased foreign investment, reduced inflation -- from 7,000% in 1990 -- and 
the winding down of the long guerrilla war. One trouble spot is the mining 
industry, where production is down because of low world prices.

BRIEFING BOOK / WILLIAM R. LONG: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; TELECOM SALE GIVES 
BOOST TO PERU'S PRIVATIZATION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Peru's government recently accepted a bid by Spain's Telefonica 
Internacional to buy control of the state-owned telephone and 
telecommunications monopolies for a surprisingly high $2 billion. That 
mega-sale has buoyed official spirits as the government prepares to sell 80 
more enterprises in an effort to complete a broad privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: President Alberto Fujimori put privatization into high gear late 
in 1992, as Peru's investment climate improved with a decline in terrorism and 
the end of a long economic depression. So far, investors have bought control of 
about 30 government-run companies. They include the Hierro Peru iron mine sold 
to China's Shougang Corp. for $120 million; the Aeroperu airline to a 
consortium headed by Aerovias de Mexico for $54 million; the Cerro Verde copper 
mine to Cyprus Minerals of the United States for $37 million, and, last week, 
the Ilo copper refinery to Southern Peru Copper Corp., controlled by New 
York-based Asarco, for $68.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Telefonica Internacional de Espana bid more than twice as high as its American 
competitors -- Southwestern Bell and GTE -- for a package that included 35% 
stakes in the telephone company and the telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price is magnificent," said Carlos Montoya, head of the government's 
privatization agency. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The telephone deal is not only a landmark in Peruvian privatization, 
it is a major step toward consolidating Telefonica's predominance in the South 
American communications market. The company, partly owned by the Spanish 
government, already controls privatized telephone companies in Argentina and 
Chile and owns a minority interest in Venezuela. Analysts say Telefonica needed 
the Peruvian monopoly to maximize regional administrative efficiency and for 
economies of scale. Peru is by far the least developed country in Telefonica's 
fold, with only 2.4 telephone lines per 100 people, but that means big growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peruvian government has earned a total of $2 billion from privatizations 
so far. In addition to government earnings from the sale of the 
telecommunications and telephone companies, buyers will invest an added $2.75 
billion over the next few years, including an estimated $1.5 billion by 
Telefonica to triple Peruvian phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80 companies being prepared for privatization include Petroperu (oil) 
Electroperu and Electrolima (electricity), Minero Peru subsidiaries and 
Centromin (mining), Siderperu (steel), ENAFER (railroads), FERTISA 
(fertilizers), Interbanc and Banco Continental (banks). Experts estimate that 
Petroperu alone could sell for more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The government says proceeds from privatizations are going into needed social 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: The billions of dollars that foreign investors have paid for state 
assets has provided persuasive evidence that Peru has something to offer 
foreign investors. Analysts say many of the undercapitalized and neglected 
companies yet to be sold have nowhere to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful sales have also added to the optimism in Peru that 
privatization will improve the overall economy. "Peru is categorized as the 
rising star of Latin America," said business professor Alejandro Indacochea.  
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts , however, still see risk factors that could dampen 
investor enthusiasm. Terrorism by the Maoist rebels of Sendero Luminoso 
(Shining Path) has been reduced but not eliminated. Widespread poverty suggests 
a threat of social unrest. And although military support seems to bolster the 
stability of President Fujimori's administration for now, Peru's democracy 
remains imperfect and its politics hard to predict.

NEWSLETTER IN LAGUNA BEACH: WHERE COMPANY LOVES MISERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ed Mauss isn't ashamed to say he's a bumbler, and he wants fellow sufferers to 
know they're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauss began publishing the Hard Luck Gazette newsletter last August and has 
since regaled its 100-odd subscribers with tales of hapless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like knowing they're not the only ones," Mauss said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pages of the Gazette are any indication, they have plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the man who, while traveling on the Australian outback, hit a kangaroo 
with his Jeep. After overcoming his initial shock, he dressed the animal in his 
leather jacket and sunglasses for a photograph, only to gape as the animal came 
to and hopped away with his wallet and passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the woman whose dress stuck to the toilet seat at a party and who ended 
up dragging a sanitized toilet cover back into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the woman who was vacuuming her parakeet's cage when the phone rang and 
she wedged the vacuum between the bars of the cage to answer it. By now, you 
can probably guess what happened. (The parakeet was fine, though a little 
dusty.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mauss compiles the stories from readers' letters, publishing the four-page 
periodical once a month. He also awards $15 to the best story in each issue. 
The one requirement, he says, is that they must all be true. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives the newsletter credibility, but it doesn't do much for the hapless 
many who send in their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Dave Smith of Fountain Valley. He isn't likely to forget the day his wife 
summoned him from the shower to fix the garbage disposal. To express his lack 
of enthusiasm for the task, Smith marched through the house without drying off 
-- or putting anything on. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just climbed under the sink when the family's new kitten attacked. 
Smith jumped and knocked himself out on a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way paramedics found him," Mauss said. "Wet and naked, half of him 
under the sink. The paramedics couldn't keep from laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mauss doesn't just play hard-luck stories for laughs, though. After wildfires 
gutted whole neighborhoods in Laguna Beach last fall, the Hard Luck Gazette 
donated $50 to the local fire relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lucky that we can laugh at ourselves now," he said. "There are some 
people who have suffered hard luck through no fault of their own."

 Marion Merrell Dow Inc. said its first-quarter profit rose 16%, led by 
increased sales of its Cardizem heart drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City, Mo., company earned $85 million, or 31 cents per share, in 
the three months ended March 31, compared to $73 million, or 26 cents per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 15% to $708 million from 
$617 million. 
</P>
<P>

STUDY FINDS BIG DRAWBACKS TO LAYOFFS OF MIDDLE MANAGERS; MANAGEMENT: SURVEY 
SAYS PINK SLIPS CREATE WORKPLACE TRAUMA, HAMPER GROWTH. TRANSFERS MAY BE 
PREFERABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Companies seeking to slash the ranks of middle management will get better 
results by transferring people rather than laying them off, according to a 
consultant who has studied companies extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have been rushing to get rid of middle managers to speed up 
decision-making, reducing the amount of time it takes to get a product to the 
market and cutting back on red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "delayering" is better achieved by redesigning the way business is 
handled rather than just laying off middle-management employees, said Craig 
Schneier, a management consultant based in Pennington, N.J., and co-author of a 
recent study on the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because layoffs create trauma in the workplace, and it is difficult to 
then shift more responsibility to the remaining employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make delayering work, you've got to have a work force that is willing to 
take added responsibility, innovate and take some risks," said Schneier, "and 
after you've downsized, we know morale goes down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey about delayering was co-authored by Douglas Shaw, a management 
consultant from Newtown, Pa., and will be published in the journal of the Human 
Resource Planning Society of New York, a professional association of human 
resources executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In examining a group of companies largely chosen from the Fortune 500, 
Schneier found that 85% of the firms delayered between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had eight layers, they cut three," Schneier said, largely from 
management "rather than revenue-producing employees." 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for cutting out layers was to speed up decision-making, the 
researchers found, cited by 96% of the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 50% said they had largely achieved this goal simply by cutting back 
layers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-nine percent of the companies said they had cut costs, 86% improved 
productivity, 81% reduced time needed for decision-making and 69% improved the 
time it takes to make new products. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that despite the aim of cutting the ranks of 
bureaucrats, only 61% said they had achieved that goal. Communications improved 
for 60%, and increased autonomy of workers for 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical company surveyed had 1992 revenues of nearly $4 billion and more 
than 24,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those examined were Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co., Bethlehem 
Steel, Colgate-Palmolive Co., Eastman Kodak Co., General Mills, Motorola Inc., 
Philip Morris Inc., Scott Paper Co., Southern California Edison Co., Standard & 
Poor's Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. 
</P>
<P>
 More delayering was found in the corporate headquarters (85%) than anywhere 
else, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneier believes large corporations can't go on cutting indefinitely without 
stunting their growth and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they're reducing," he pointed out, "but the other side. Where's 
growth? Where's innovation? They've got to ask, 'Where should we be expanding? 
Where's the next new idea coming from?' "

BOOK LOOKS: UNDERSTANDING SKIN-CARE PRODUCTS; "TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN" AUTHOR: 
ELAINE BRUMBERG. INFO: HARPERPERENNIAL, 1990 EDITION. $11 PAPERBACK (ALSO 
AVAILABLE IN HARDCOVER FROM HARPER & ROWE). 262 PAGES PLUS AN INDEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brumberg divides her book into four sections, first discussing the psychology 
of how skin-care products are pitched to us and how we make the choices of what 
products we buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Next she describes how to become your own beauty expert and understand your 
particular skin type.Then she guides you through choosing and using the best 
cleansers, moisturizers, anti-aging agents and sunscreens. The final section 
combines all this information into a routine suited to you for managing skin 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is gray graphically but written in a manner easy to understand. It's 
OK for skimming, but there would be a lot gained by reading it cover to cover, 
just skipping the few sections that don't apply to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether the information might not be that much different from the 
superficial skin-care evaluations that in-store demonstrators profess to offer 
for free, except that (1) Brumberg is not trying to sell you a lot of things 
you will forget how to use as soon as you get home and (2) if you do forget 
something, you can always go back and check the book. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brumberg also is the author of "Save Your Money, Save Your Face." These books 
are available at Barnes & Noble, Costa Mesa, and other area bookstores. MARIA

PASSION BUBBLES OVER IN A RAREFIED WORLD; BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; AS MAX SAW IT BY 
LOUIS BEGLEY ALFRED A. KNOPF: $21, 146 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGIA JONES-DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Begley writes with intimate knowledge about patrician America -- Eastern 
Old Money, Auchincloss country -- but with a good deal less politeness or the 
submerged emotions of his literary upper-crust counterparts. This was true in 
his second novel, "The Man Who Was Late," as well as in his newest, "As Max Saw 
It." 
</P>
<P>
 There are terrors lurking in the paradise he evokes: Auschwitz, with its 
legacy of death and tormented souls; sex as a battlefield and harbinger of 
disaster; aching loneliness, suicide and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley first hands us a passport to the peaceable kingdom of Town & Country, 
where we find the not-so-beautiful but elegantly maintained women, with 
champagne-colored hair pulled back into short ponytails, and their consorts -- 
the investment bankers, Wall Street lawyers, gray-haired handsome men 
timelessly fashionable in their cashmere and worn, white linen. The Town & 
Country features endlessly alternate between Deauville, Caribbean hideaways, 
the Hamptons and Italian villas. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel opens in that typical T&C tone: "La Rumorosa, for that was the name 
of the . . . villa on the promontory just below Bellagio, where Lake Como 
divides to form a pair of clown's pantaloons, blue and green, gold-speckled and 
shimmering, was one of those places where, sooner or later, everyone stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Max, our narrator, a Harvard law professor from solid, if not exactly 
moneyed, stock, admits he wouldn't have been invited on his own into this 
rarefied world. He's neither rich nor socially ambitious enough. He's arrived 
at La Rumorosa on the coattails of an old college pal with connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley's characters will soon find heartlessness, madness, cruelty and death 
ready to invade their privileged world. No barroom brawls here. People who know 
how to dress and use language well are less likely to resort to blows. But they 
are masters at destroying one another all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Another guest at La Rumorosa is Charlie Swan, whom Max knew at college. 
Charlie, a world-famous architect, is a man of "extraordinary height and 
tightly curled hair very short, so that his head reminded one of a Roman bust." 
Charlie proves quite the Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks at human relationships in terms of pure politics -- those who are 
loyal, those who betray. One night Charlie corners Max and verbally assaults 
him. Max "betrayed" him in the past when he "took so little time to know 
(him)." Charlie commands friendship as Caesar might have: "Henceforth, you are 
one of my intimates -- they are very few! . . . Do not betray me again!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fate will have a way of forcing Max to take the trouble to know Charlie. He 
will also take the trouble to know a beautiful young man -- "Eros himself" -- 
called Toby, whom Max first spots by the pool at the villa. The young American, 
barely out of his teens, is Charlie's lover, protege and ultimate source of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Max confesses that he is someone to whom "relationships don't stick." What he 
doesn't recognize is that he hasn't taken much trouble to know people in 
general. He has lived both financially and emotionally close to the bone, the 
nice, vague guy moving cautiously through life. He couldn't be more different 
from arrogant, commanding, misogynistic Charlie -- the man of grand passions, 
career, friendship, the seeker of love and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then mild Max inherits a fortune from a remote relative. The "right people" 
suddenly stick to him. He receives his very own invitation to La Rumorosa. 
"Vespasian was nuts to say that money has no smell," Max observes, wryly. He 
sees through it all, but he's never had such a good time either. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next decade Max continues to observe the relationship with Charlie 
and Toby from an intimate point of view. Toby proves only adequate as an 
architectural protege. He doesn't share Charlie's friends or love of culture. 
He's bisexual and promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is between Charlie and Toby? It's not always clear, but at one 
point Begley introduces a metaphor that, in a handful of words, sums it up. 
Describing the Saudi passion for birds of prey, Max says to Toby: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Training hawks is a very cruel process. The eyelids of the young birds are 
stitched closed, to make them blind, and therefore dependent on their owner. 
Then when the bird's dependency is judged sufficient, they cut the stitches and 
real instruction begins.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Stop,' (Toby) said. 'I don't want to think of these things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "As Max Saw It," without ever mentioning the word, confronts AIDS and the 
bravery, sacrifice, commitment and horror it engenders. It's the early '80s by 
the end of the story, and it is clear that something is seriously wrong with 
Toby. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby, intellectually and morally weak, fights dying. Charlie, ever the Roman, 
encourages him to embrace his mortality. His own willingness to do this brings 
the novel to a shocking close. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley is not the clearest of writers. There are confusing passages, 
characters who appear and disappear without much explanation, strangely 
clinical digressions. But he continues to face the unanswerable, fundamental 
issues in fiction that is elegantly wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have heard the music of the spheres?" Charlie, a little drunk, asks Max. 
"It is the upgathered howl of pain, rising from every corner of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Pain there may be, but such sublime writing as this can make us cry as well.

NIBBLES AND BITS: MOVIE-GOING LEGIONS STAND BEHIND KERNEL 
</P>

 How did local moviegoers react to Tuesday's news that popcorn coated with 
coconut oil can be hazardous to your heart? 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rhett Butler, answered James Edwards Sr., founder of Edwards Theatres 
Circuit Inc., Orange County's largest movie chain.Several of his patrons, 
Edwards said, assumed Butler's cavalier attitude of "Frankly, my dear, I don't 
give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Edwards reported that despite the new study ranking coconut oil high 
in artery-clogging saturated fat, popcorn sales were up at his theaters on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop that.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Edwards said, his theaters will begin using lower-fat corn oil on 
their popcorn by next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he'll continue the practice if, and only if, customers like the 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven heart-disease authorities have joined the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, which conducted the study, in urging theater owners to make a 
jiffy switch to healthier air-popped corn. Forget it, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a taste somewhat like delicious Styrofoam." ZAN DUBIN

POP REVIEWS; JOYRIDE ROARS DOWN TWO-WAY ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A book on how to become a rock star in the 1990s would be incomplete without a 
few helpful chapters about cultivating the right assortment of frowns and 
scowls and dread-filled howls. 
</P>
<P>
 Get on stage and act as if you were channeling every bad experience that ever 
befell you. Roar as if you were spitting up every insult you ever had to 
swallow. Summon hidden rage. Show 'em some stomach bile. Quiet, intimate 
moments are OK, but only if they can be taken as glimpses into a psyche about 
to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked for Kurt Cobain, whose depression proved all too real and all too 
deep. It has worked for Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell, Trent Reznor, Layne 
Staley, Billy Corgan and others who adhere fervently to the displeasure 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, un-hip burg that it is, even the best home-grown rockers 
just don't seem to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 What were the members of Joyride doing, exchanging all manner of spontaneous 
smiles and looks of mutual enjoyment Saturday night at Fullerton's Club 369? If 
alienation is in, how can they possibly get anywhere with displays of 
fellowship and good feeling? Joyride even had fans flocking down front to dance 
(not slam) and smile back at them. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the second-billed band, One Hit Wonder, front man Dan Root probably 
cost himself any chance of becoming a '90s rock star by leaping to the 
microphone at the start, yelling, "Let's have fun!" and proceeding to spend the 
next 40 minutes bounding about, tossing out humorous commentary, and treating 
his guitar more like a favorite toy than an implement for translating rage into 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Root acted like some kind of natural-born entertainer. But this is the '90s, 
Danny boy, and if it's entertaining, it can't be rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting sarcasm aside, it's time we looked to another set of '90s -- the 1790s 
-- to regain some perspective, some balance in our vision of what art, 
including rock 'n' roll, should be. This year is the 200th anniversary of the 
completion of William Blake's poetic diptych, "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs 
of Experience."  
</P>
<P>
 To my mind, those poems -- which Blake meant to be sung -- mark the spiritual 
birth of rock 'n' roll, lacking only blues progressions and back beats. Blake 
had a romantic spirit -- he was, in fact, the father of the romantic spirit. He 
was a visionary and a rebellious firebrand, an extreme individualist who railed 
against corrupt power and calcified artistic authority. His work, like rock, 
was suffused with an enthusiastic, liberating sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With "Innocence" and "Experience," the greatest sets of lyrics in the English 
language (Bob Dylan, by comparison, might as well be scribbling for Hallmark), 
Blake insisted that one mind set would not do. Cut yourself off from joy and 
comfort, from the innocent notion that we can dwell in the light of goodness, 
and you end with a vision that is shriveled and juiceless. But deny that life 
is also rife with bleakness, cruelty, injustice and pain, and you ignore the 
simple reality that experience demands you acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, Blake argued, must encompass both Innocence and Experience, the 
two contrary conditions of the human soul. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether Joyride's two singer-songwriters, Steve Soto and Greg 
Antista, have read much Blake, but the band's music is a glorious swirl of 
contrary elements. Almost every song conveys both the rich pleasure we can take 
from life, and the burdens of failure and frustration that we have to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 At Club 369, Soto sang of suicidal lovers ("I Was Just Thinking About You"), 
of a wallflower's prom-night humiliation ("Heaven Sighed") and of a man who 
habitually flees intimacy ("Running Away"). Antista's songs included 
"Daydreaming on the Frontline," a desperate account of life lived in the cross 
hairs that could apply to Bosnia or to gang-ridden streets of Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joyride clearly isn't ignoring experience or posing easy answers. But each 
song was in some fashion lifted up by a vision that life is more than its 
bleakest realities. 
</P>
<P>
 The gruff-voiced Antista has a gift for using humor as a bulwark against 
despair. As dejected as he might sound in "Month of Mondays," the song of a guy 
whose life simply isn't working out, another emotional strand is woven into the 
song's fabric. As he laughs to crowd out tears, we sense that the wounded soul 
singing the lament has the resiliency to hang in there and keep on pushing. The 
surging, single-minded momentum of Sandy Hansen's drumbeat, and the pealing, 
bittersweet commentary of Mike McKnight's lead guitar riffs drove home those 
admirable complexities. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto does justice to the pain in his lyrics with a voice that can muster raw 
bursts of anguish. But he also salves wounds with a massive application of 
sympathy and heart expressed in clear, pure-pop tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of Joyride's winning duality is its combination of melodic lift 
and careening, punk-inspired delivery. Everything the band played Saturday 
night had melodies and vocal harmonies that in themselves seemed like 
affirmations, rewarding the listener as nothing but a catchy, evocative melody 
can (the same is true for virtually everything on the band's two Doctor Dream 
albums, "Johnny Bravo" and "Another Month of Mondays"). But with a drummer who 
crashes ahead, threatening to spin out of control at every turn, and a lead 
guitarist who favors noisy, razor-edged tones, Joyride lived up to its name. 
Its songs became thrilling, if somewhat heedless flings. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyride leaned a bit too heavily, however, on racing tempos. More variety 
overall, and a tad more control in certain songs, would be in order. It is a 
big league band and should be playing the 70-minute sets expected of 
big-leaguers instead of the 45 or 50 minutes that are the mark of a local band. 
 
</P>
<P>
 There was no good reason to omit Antista's memorable ballad, "Sleep a Little 
Longer," or his witty but heartbreaking lament, "Lonely Shepherd's Club," the 
best Orange County rock song ever to devote a verse to local icon John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the evening's nicest surprise was Root's newfound authority as a 
showman fronting One Hit Wonder. When the band started in 1992, the former 
Tender Fury guitarist was new to singing and relied on partner Robbie Allen for 
load-sharing and moral support. Allen split last fall to join Rob Rule, which 
is about to release its Mercury Records debut album. Far from foundering 
without his old sidekick, Root has blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance expressed delight in rocking while also mocking the 
pretensions and cliches of rock heroism. Root was animated in every way. He was 
chatty enough to let fly irreverent barbs about Richard Nixon, Kurt Cobain and 
his own band mates. He was playful enough to invent a silly new 
mock-guitar-hero move that involved hammering the top of his instrument as if 
it were a spike, and getting a chord sequence out of the maneuver by keeping 
his left hand on the fret board. 
</P>
<P>
 The music -- much of it written since Allen's departure -- was a raucous 
combination of anxiety, defiance and humor. Bassist Randy Bradbury and drummer 
Christopher Webb form one of the hardest-hitting rhythm sections around, and 
Bradbury has stepped forward as a capable backing singer, cushioning Root's 
go-for-it bark. In a mostly stormy set, One Hit Wonder inserted a fetching 
pop-rocker called "I Can Break Your Heart" that even Joyride would be proud to 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which is scheduled to issue a debut EP this summer on the Sony/Rock 
World label, opens for the Cadillac Tramps on Friday at the Foothill in Long 
Beach, and plays Sunday afternoon at Beach Fest in Long Beach's Shoreline Park. 
Joyride plays Beach Fest on Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
 The Club 369 bill also featured a strong under card. Lidsville played crunchy, 
heavy stuff, but did it crisply and with a sense of dynamics in its better 
material. Singer Doc Johnson has the Vedder-like chesty roar down pat -- too 
pat. If he can find a higher register, or some different vocal approaches to 
explore, the band might expand its sound and its emotional reach.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, Lidsville does heavy-crunch well, but that alone won't bring those 
Blakean contrarieties within its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening band Burnin' Groove has tightened its sound and seems ready to build 
upon such appealing elements as catchy, punk-rock sing-along choruses, cleanly 
etched lead guitar work and whiskey-voiced singer Daren Carlson's synthesis of 
George Thorogood's raunch-blues mannerisms with Mike Ness's punker attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 With its slicked-back '50s look and blues-punk sources, Burnin' Groove rides 
in Cadillac Tramps' tire tracks, but the band has a chance to make an impact of 
its own with such solid, high-octane songs as "Misery and Pain" and "Anybody 
See." 
</P>
<P>
 The four bands played to an enthusiastic crowd of about 300 fans, and 
benefited from a good rented sound system provided by promoter Jim Knight. With 
its excellent sight lines, decent ventilation and ample (for a small club) 
capacity of 369, Club 369 has a better setup than Bogart's or any of the 
would-be successor clubs that have sprung up since Bogart's closed in December. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Gregory Howell says he plans to continue relying on outside promoters 
rather than creating a steady, in-house booking operation. Without that, it is 
unlikely Club 369 will be able to assume the hub status Bogart's enjoyed as a 
haven for good touring bands and local talent alike. But at least the potential 
is there.

THEATRE REVIEW; PAST, FUTURE CONNECT IN 'ANTIGONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Antigone, daughter of Oedipus, may seem a bit distant to modern 
audiences. So French playwright Jean Anouilh created his own, updated version 
of the play (the third in Sophocles' Oedipus trilogy) using idiomatic 20th 
Century language and sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fullerton College's Bronwyn Dodson Theatre, director Robert Jensen has 
taken the conceit one step further: His version, called "Antigone 3000," is set 
on the Planet Thebes in the year 3000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like looking at the tragedy through both ends of a telescope at 
once, and it puts a very tight focus on the drama's insights and values. 
Jensen's simplistic future society -- at the end of a dynastic era and just 
before rebirth into a Golden Age -- echoes the same societal and political woes 
as existed four millennia before. 
</P>
<P>
 The forces are the same: the battle between political expediency, and moral 
law and human dignity. But the lesson of the staging is that the human race 
rarely learns anything because it rarely pays much attention to its history. 
</P>
<P>
 On entering the theater, one is asked by a guard of this future world to "step 
to the red line and prepare to be scanned." Once it is ascertained that the 
audience members pose no threat, they are led into Emperor Creon's arena, where 
other guards are posted about the space. One suddenly finds oneself in a 
different time frame, looking through a time-mirror that is wavy and contorted, 
like those in a fun house. 
</P>
<P>
 When the images settle, and the Chorus (Bidalia E. Albanese, Gregory Gateley) 
begins to bring the viewer into the action, the past and the future softly and 
quietly become the present. These are people of our own time, though their 
story has its roots in a dim past. 
</P>
<P>
 Antigone (Jenni-Lynn McMillin) must bury the body of her brother, whom her 
uncle Creon (Kyle Jones) has defeated during an uprising. Unburied, the 
brother's spirit will be doomed to wander the Earth forever. But burial of the 
body is against Creon's edict and would mean death for Antigone. 
</P>
<P>
 The director has woven the three threads of time neatly and effectively and 
has kept the performances naturalistic, to the advantage of both Anouilh's 
intent and the success of this further mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McMillin is a feisty Antigone, a daughter of emperors with a powerful will to 
stake her life on the right of individual morality. Her big confrontation scene 
with her uncle is moving, honest and theatrical. Jones' Creon matches her spark 
for spark, and his poetic emperor has just enough of a soft edge to temper his 
steel-like center. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officious nurse, Diana Green pointedly manages a flat vocal delivery 
that is interesting and gives a truthful reality to the characterization. 
Patrick Goddard is a Romeo-like Haemon, Antigone's betrothed, with a sudden 
flame of passion in his final defiance of his father, Creon. Darri Kristin 
plays Antigone's sister Ismene properly and effectively as beautiful but dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast is just fine. As Creon's android Page, Joel Gladwell's 
mechanistic movement and attitude are well-oiled and calibrated. Also 
particularly notable is Carl Lund's Soldier No. 1, both ingratiating and funny 
when apologizing to Creon for not noticing the body's first burial, and 
empathetic when calming Antigone just before her doom.  
</P>
<P>
 The technical work on this show is impressive, too, especially Scott B. 
Cavin's complex setting, Sam Brezarich's intricate, flawless lighting, Mela 
Hoyt-Heydon's futuristic costuming and Jim Book's big-brother sound design.

 NOT WORTH IT? The Newport Harbor Art Museum has declined to apply for a 
California Arts Council grant this year for the same reason it didn't apply 
last year: According to museum director Michael Botwinick, the cost in staff 
hours required to submit an application "is not worth" the expected return of 
roughly $10,500, the amount the museum received from the state for 1992-93.

DANCE / CHRIS PASLES; MAKING THE ABSTRACT CONCRETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To talk for even a short time to Beth Burns, founding director of the Santa 
Ana-based St. Joseph Ballet, is to realize that for her, no dance is really 
abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the works on the inner-city company's annual spring concert, for 
instance, Burns shuttles back and forth between talking about the works and 
talking about their connections to the kids' lives. The program, titled "Your 
Neighbor as Yourself," will be presented through Saturday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Take her "Moving, Remembering, Arriving," set to Copland's "Three Latin 
American Sketches," one of two new works to be danced on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to put anything on the music that wasn't already there," Burns 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first section of the music, there is an impatience, a kind of feeling 
of needing, of having to go from where you are. I think about how humans need 
to move, to leave certain places, whether it's geographic or emotional or 
spiritual," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she had a specific leave-taking in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two of my dancers -- Flor de Liz Alzate and Odette Molero -- are going to the 
North Carolina School of the Arts," Burns said. "The second section of the 
music is very tender, and I spent time thinking that when you leave a place, 
you need to reflect on where you've been and where you've come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "So this piece is for those two dancers. It's abstract, but while it can have 
these abstract references to looking back -- they walk backward and all kinds 
of things like that -- for them, it's really looking back on their time with 
St. Joseph Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrival in North Carolina is celebrated in the third and final section, 
which is "exuberant . . . what it feels like to arrive in a new place." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not pure enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This section ends on a quiet, reverent note, with all 130 children in the 
dance kneeling," Burns said. The music is Bobby McFerrin's "Mother Me," which 
the composer dedicated to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The other new work on the program is "HomeFree," which will be danced to live 
accompaniment by Samite of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Samite is a person and a group," explained Burns, "an individual from Uganda 
and two other members of his group performing with him, all under the name of 
Samite of Uganda. We were looking for wonderful musicians, exploring for a 
while, and found him." 
</P>
<P>
 The group consists of a flute, guitar and percussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is made up of four sections and draws on a cast of three groups of 
dancers. The opening, "Nakku," uses 31 dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 To explain the connections she made with her kids, Burns read from the album 
liner notes: "My mother, Nakku, came to me one night in a dream," she read, 
"and taught me a song about a young girl who saved herself from the famine by 
telling stories in exchange for food. 'Come, Nakku, tell us your stories and 
you shall eat with us.' The African flute tells the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Burns: "I think of all the friendships that happen between all the 
children and the Orange County community, by these children dancing from their 
hearts -- people from different neighborhoods from Orange County who normally 
don't have the chance to befriend Santa Ana youth find that bridges are built 
through the children dancing from their hearts. They tell their stories, and 
then friendships can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The second section is "Kasambajiro." Said Burns: "When I listened to the drum 
in it, I got all kinds of images about how fatigued women can be not only in 
our society but also in the Third World by the burdens they carry in taking 
care of people. There are movement references to women carrying burdens." 
</P>
<P>
 The third section is called "Wagongolo." 
</P>
<P>
 "A wagongolo is actually a millipede," said Burns, "but the boys don't really 
dance about millipedes. The piece is about the boys' energy, and it has a few 
witty little things between boys and girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The finale, "Ntunze," reflects "the inherent dignity of the dancers," she 
said. "It's just really a celebration of this very poignant quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Burns in 1983, the St. Joseph Ballet is one of the grass-roots 
success stories in the county. Enrollment at the school now is about 300 
students a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to increase it because we want to continue to devote ourselves 
to nurturing each child individually," Burns said. "There are a lot more 
children that would like our services, but the board of directors wants to 
maintain the quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The school operates on a budget of about $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "But 96% of our children are on complete scholarship," she said. "Individuals 
in the county underwrite one dancer's scholarship each year. About 150 of our 
dancers are sponsored by such individuals, through our 'Adopt-a-Dancer' 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 To help the two dancers who are heading to North Carolina, the board of 
directors has established an advanced-training scholarship fund, which will pay 
one-third of their tuition at the arts school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of the mission is really focusing on the needs of the children," 
Burns said. "It's pretty tough growing up in tough neighborhoods. It's easy to 
get tough in that environment. We have to mentor them and change that . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about the needs of inner-city children and the basic human 
experience, we need as much as anything security and freedom, and if you only 
have one, it doesn't work. Whether you're thinking personally, interpersonally 
or even politically, to fulfill those dreams together is not only basic to us 
living a fulfilled life, but also represents some of our highest aspirations. I 
think the inner-city children of Santa Ana deserve these as much as anyone in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Joseph Ballet will dance "Your Neighbor as Yourself," today and Friday 
at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 
Campus Drive, Irvine. $8. (714) 854-4646.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PARAMOUNT; DEPUTY CITY MANAGER NAMED TO TOP POSITION

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager William A. Holt announced his resignation last week, and the City 
Council named Deputy City Manager Patrick West to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt will depart Friday to become executive director of the Southern 
California Joint Powers Insurance Authority, a La Palma-based organization that 
provides insurance, such as workers' compensation, to 76 small and mid-sized 
cities in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 West, 40, who will earn $102,000 a year as the new city manager, began working 
for Paramount as superintendent of parks and recreation in 1980, and has been a 
deputy city manager since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who studied law and passed the bar exam while serving as city manager, 
will continue to work part time as a city prosecutor on code enforcement cases 
against negligent property owners, said Mayor Gerald A. Mulrooney. Mulrooney 
called Holt an "outstanding talent" and credited him with turning the city away 
from an economic and educational decline of the late 1970s. Holt extensively 
restructured city departments such as redevelopment, accounting and personnel 
to make them more efficient, Mulrooney said. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; TASK FORCE ON RACE IS REVIVED AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynwood officials have reactivated a race-relations task force and have set up 
a telephone hot line in the wake of a recent incident in which a Korean 
American grocer shot a Latino youth after an alleged shoplifting incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, which has about 50 members, has passed out green "peace" 
ribbons and said it will soon hold public hearings on improving race 
relations.Also planned are seminars in which Korean merchants and other ethnic 
groups can learn more about their cultural differences and lessen the chance of 
confrontations based on misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Richards and City Councilman Louis Heine are among the task force 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees will field calls on the hot line at (310) 886-0432 and compile 
comments for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert Henning criticized the task force, accusing Richards and 
Heine of seeking publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Heine said the task force represents "a positive approach to stem the tide of 
violence" in Lynwood and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was revived after grocery store owner Michael Kim shot a 
14-year-old Latino youth in the chest April 2 after an alleged shoplifting. Kim 
said that either the youth or a companion took a 49-cent bag of cookies from 
the store on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Kim gave chase. He said he fired 
his gun after the youth reached into his waistband, as if for a weapon, and as 
the other boy drew a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said they found no evidence that the wounded youth was 
armed. He was released recently from Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LA MIRADA; THEATER GROUP TO STOP FREE CAMPAIGN TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whittier-La Mirada Musical Theatre Assn. will no longer give free tickets 
to political candidates, board members decided recently after learning that 
such contributions are improper. 
</P>
<P>
 The association gave six tickets worth $120 to the campaign of La Mirada City 
Councilman Wayne Rew, who was elected April 12 to his fifth term.The tickets, 
which had been requested by one of Rew's campaign workers, were used as a door 
prize at a campaign fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax-exempt groups such as the theatre association are not permitted to make 
political contributions, said Jim Shepherd, a spokesman for the state Franchise 
Tax Board. Shepherd said continued violation of the law could lead to removal 
of the association's tax-exempt status, but he added that "one incident would 
not typically jeopardize it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just totally oblivious to the fact that you couldn't do it," said 
Paul Garman, executive director of the association. "Obviously, we won't do it 
any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater association organizes three musical productions each year at the 
La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. Garman said the group receives as 
many as 30 requests a month for tickets. GREG MILLER

BLACK, LATINO TENSION TO BE SUMMIT TOPIC; DIVERSITY: ORGANIZERS HOPE MEETING AT 
COMPTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL FOSTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN ETHNIC GROUPS. HIGH 
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY TROUBLED.

 Brawling in the schools. Gangs fighting over turf in Compton. Unemployed 
workers complaining that jobs are going to members of another race. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of racial tension between blacks and Latinos are everywhere these 
days, Royce Esters says. And he is nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do something now, it's going to be a very hot summer," said 
Esters, president of the Compton branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to this tension, the NAACP has joined with the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) to set up a unity summit expected to 
draw up to 500 people Saturday at Compton Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Esters and Samano said they had heard repeated complaints from those they 
represent about advantages the other group is perceived to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting a number of phone calls from Latinos, mostly about the 
education system and racial tensions," said Marta Samano, leadership 
development director for MALDEF. "They feel shut out." 
</P>
<P>
 Esters gets calls from people who say they were turned down for a job because 
they can't speak Spanish. As the Latino population continues to grow, blacks 
are beginning to feel crowded out of a city they consider an enclave of African 
American pride, Esters said. Blacks constituted just under 53% of Compton's 
population, according to the 1990 census. The Latino population was about 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summit's workshops and speeches, participants will discuss conflict in 
the schools, youth violence, affirmative action and employment discrimination, 
and conflict resolution. The conference is scheduled from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 
Spanish, Samoan and Korean translators will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care will be offered. Children will be given lessons on the history and 
culture of various races. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers will include U.S. Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), Mayor Omar 
Bradley and Ignacio Pena, president of the Compton College Board of Trustees. 
Organizers also expect representatives from the district attorney's office, and 
state and county government to attend.

COFFEEHOUSES GET A REPRIEVE ON MUSIC BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sign hanging above the croissants and espresso-maker in the Habitat 
coffeehouse was like a slap in the face to City Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal. 
</P>
<P>
 With a reference to fascist policies in Long Beach city government, the sign 
announced that entertainment at the coffeehouse had been shut down by the city 
and that the place was in danger of closing. 
</P>
<P>
 A coffeehouse without acoustic guitars or poetry readings accompanied by 
music? Unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal got to work, and Tuesday persuaded the council to instruct the city 
attorney to write an emergency ordinance waiving the city's strict 
entertainment licensing laws for coffeehouses for 90 days until a new law can 
be written. 
</P>
<P>
 Current entertainment licensing, written for restaurants and bars that want 
music or dancing, requires the establishment to have a full kitchen. Applicants 
also must submit to an investigation by the police vice squad before receiving 
a license. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 coffeehouses that have sprung up in Long Beach within the last four 
years or so would still be required to obtain some kind of entertainment 
license, Lowenthal said. But new regulations would be tailored for their 
businesses. Full kitchens and vice-squad checks probably will not be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the smaller coffeehouses, such as Habitat, Daniel Pinn's 
520-square-foot storefront on 7th Street, don't have room for a kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I serve is coffee, croissants and art," said Pinn, who put up the sign 
that attracted Lowenthal's attention after police shut down his live music 
April 12. Police went to Habitat after a neighbor complained about the noise 
from a band of tribal drums at the coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members, Douglas Drummond and Jeffrey A. Kellogg, said they feared 
the issue was being rushed and opposed the 90-day moratorium on the law 
governing coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a few of those places in my district, and we've had problems . . . 
with people smoking dope in there," Drummond said. "And there's noise 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the council sided with Lowenthal, however, and voted 7 to 2 
for the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to discourage these businesses," said Councilwoman Doris 
Topsy-Elvord. 
</P>
<P>
 Without live music or readings to attract customers, Pinn's brightly painted 
store became nearly empty, he said. When a band was playing, Pinn could count 
on 30 to 40 customers, he said. On nights with no band, maybe five people 
ventured in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've been out of business in a month without music," Pinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing laws allow anyone to circumvent entertainment licensing if they have 
one performer at a time. But owners can quickly run out of one-man bands, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Christmastime, I couldn't have five kindergartners come in and sing carols 
because of this law," said Robert Aikens, general manager of the Upstart Crow 
bookstore and coffeehouse in Shoreline Village. "I want to start a Sunday 
brunch with chamber music, but I can't do that without an expensive permit." 
</P>
<P>
 An entertainment license, which requires that business owners also get a 
conditional-use permit if they aren't in a zone that specifically allows 
entertainment, can cost $2,500, Lowenthal said.

DANCERS BANNED AT HIGH SCHOOL FIND AN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age choreographer will finally get the chance to present in public a 
dance that a high school principal banned from a school dance concert, sparking 
a controversy over free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographer Desiree Roble, 17, and three other students from the California 
Academy of Mathematics and Science in Carson will perform Roble's piece this 
weekend during a dance concert at El Camino College in Torrance. The students 
had been looking for a venue since their number was dropped from a March 25 
performance at the high school before parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Kathleen Clark ordered the piece canceled after seeing the dance for 
the first time earlier in the day during a performance for students and several 
guests. She said later that the dance was "inflammatory and totally 
inappropriate" and that it violated students' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-minute piece, titled "In Search . . . My Journey," combines narration 
with movements expressing isolation and rage. The dancers are accompanied by a 
montage of modern instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble, an 11th-grader from Hawthorne, said the piece draws from many 
experiences that have left her afraid and angry. "I can't see justification for 
this dance to be censored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble's dance teacher at the high school, Ming Ng, also said the principal's 
decision amounted to censorship. She said a work of art should not be banned 
just because someone disagrees with an artist's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance is performed by two boys and two girls, who interact through 
movement, much of it confrontational. At several points, a boy makes thrusting 
and striking gestures over one of the girls, who falls to the floor and 
resists. 
</P>
<P>
 The narration includes cries of protest and calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cold and shaking and trembling, trembling," the narrator says at one 
point. "I said, 'No, no, no.' " Then later: "I yelled, then I screamed. I said, 
'No, please, no, please!' No one heard me, so I screamed a little bit louder: 
'No!' But not a sound. I was paralyzed . . . too weak to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students laughed, cheered or whooped during the morning performance at 
the high school. The audience applauded warmly at the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Clark summoned the performers to her office and told them that the 
piece would not be performed before parents at the annual public recital for 
the high school's dance program. 
</P>
<P>
 She said in an interview that she objected to the dance because it alluded to 
a violent act that may have actually taken place involving students. As a 
result, some parents might become angry or upset if they saw it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble, five other students and a dancer's parent then complained to the Long 
Beach school board, which oversees the Carson academy. The school draws 
students from Long Beach and seven other area school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal's "decision to omit this piece not only gives new meaning to the 
words hysteria and paranoia, but also clearly violates Desiree's 1st Amendment 
rights," said Gail Murray, the parent of Jamal Story, one of the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members referred the issue to staff, which is still trying to sort out 
the matter, said Helen Z. Hansen, superintendent of the district's high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, the students won a reprieve from an unexpected source. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Collins-Heads, a dance instructor at Los Angeles Southwest College, 
invited the students to fill in for another group at this weekend's "Dance Jam 
'94," a concert featuring dancers from five area community colleges. The 
concert is at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the South Bay Center for the Arts 
on the El Camino campus, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins-Heads was a guest of one of the dancers at the original performance of 
Roble's work. To her, the work represented a girl's numbing expression of 
outrage and pain over being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has given the students her blessing to perform at El Camino -- as long 
as they don't mention the high school. The students have agreed. Off campus, 
Clark said, the dance "becomes more or less a generic statement about an issue 
-- a social issue." 
</P>
<P>
 That's all the piece ever was, said Roble, who wants to become a professional 
dancer and choreographer. She added that she choreographed the piece "basically 
to make me and my dancers look good and to show the audience that a lot of 
creativity was involved."

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK; NO HEALTH RISKS SEEN FROM FUEL VALVE LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A faulty valve is being blamed for a fuel leak that released an unknown 
quantity of gasoline into the soil, possibly under several homes, near the 
Defense Department fuel depot in Norwalk, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak, which was discovered last Thursday and repaired by Sunday, has not 
contaminated any drinking water nor posed other health risks, said Daniel E. 
Keen, deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the leak is a fuel line owned by Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline 
Partners, a Los Angeles-based company that ships fuel through underground 
pipelines from refineries in Wilmington to destinations as far away as Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lambert, a spokesman for the company, said the leak was so slow that it 
did not trigger an alarm system connected to sensors that monitor pressure in 
the pipeline. The line carried 112 million barrels of fuel last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The underground valve that failed is outside the eastern boundary of the 
Defense Department's 50-acre jet fuel storage facility at Norwalk Boulevard and 
Excelsior Drive. Santa Fe Pacific leases a pump station at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak was detected by Defense Department consultants examining ground water 
samples from a test well 40 yards away, inside the fence of the so-called tank 
farm. The test well is one of many installed at the facility in recent years to 
monitor the migration of larger, previous spills from Defense Department tanks, 
Keen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants found a five-foot layer of gasoline 30 feet below ground 
level, Keen said. Drinking water is not likely to be threatened, he said, 
because it is drawn from depths greater than 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis of the water sample showed that it was contaminated by gasoline 
rather than jet fuel stored in Defense Department tanks, Keen said. A sample 
taken from the same well six months ago was not contaminated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak occurred near Holifield Park, Keen said, and fuel may have seeped 
into soil under as many as 10 nearby homes. Residents of the homes will be 
notified by Santa Fe Pacific, Keen said, and the Regional Water Quality Control 
Board will monitor the cleanup. GREG MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS: ABC SCHOOLS; DISTRICT SEEKS TO EVICT COUNTY FISCAL ADVISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The embattled ABC school district is fighting to evict a team of 
county-appointed fiscal advisers who have authority over district spending 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials said they want acting state schools Supt.William D. Dawson to 
remove the fiscal advisers, who were appointed by the Los Angeles County Office 
of Education. ABC officials sent a letter to Dawson requesting a hearing on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the school district contend that the imposition of the fiscal 
advisers is unnecessary and improper. The county did not conduct a thorough 
analysis of ABC's spending plan to determine whether the advisers are needed, 
the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they appointed the advisers because the district was 
unable to approve needed budget cuts. County analysts have estimated that ABC 
Unified will have a $2.8 million budget deficit next year, depleting virtually 
all of its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first action, the county advisers last week rescinded the ABC school 
board's decision to approve a teachers' contract that includes a 1% salary 
bonus and reduced class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The county education office will present a detailed analysis of the district's 
budget to the ABC school board at Tuesday's meeting, said Deborah L. Simon, the 
county's business advisory services director. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Unified has 21,000 students and serves Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens 
and parts of Lakewood and Norwalk. PSYCHE PASCUAL

FALSE STORY OF GIRL'S DEATH LEADS TO SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria J. Gonzalez says she is still haunted by the phone call that is every 
parent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't seen her daughter in several months. Maria Elena, 17, ran away 
after a family dispute last spring and had avoided contact with her mother. 
Then Gonzalez left for Mexico to nurse her sick father, and when she returned 
three weeks later, her daughter's best friend called, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Why didn't you tell me (Maria Elena) was dead?' " Gonzalez, 37, 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the report of Maria Elena's premature death was itself 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend explained that the Jordan High School newspaper, the Bulldog City 
Chronicle, had published an obituary with Maria Elena's photo in the final 1993 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There, on Page 6 with two other obituaries, was her daughter's freshman 
identification picture with the brief words about her "death": "Maria J. (sic) 
Gonzalez, born in Mexico on May 16, 1976, at the age of 16." The obituary did 
not say when the girl died but said she was a victim of street violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez panicked when she couldn't immediately reach relatives who could 
confirm the information. She said she was in such shock that she didn't 
recognize her three other children or the relatives who gathered at the house 
when they heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Then young Maria Elena walked in the door of their South Gate home. Gonzalez 
said she thought she was seeing a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her hands got all tangled up and she couldn't move," Maria Elena, now 18, 
said of her mother. "She kept saying, 'It's not her. It's not her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The school newspaper staff had made a mistake. A female student had died, but 
it wasn't Maria Elena, who attended South Gate High School after she ran away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District on 
March 30, alleging that the school was negligent in its supervision of the 
newspaper and caused "infliction of emotional distress." Gonzalez's attorney, 
John Watson, has asked the district to pay $300,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan High School administrators wouldn't comment on the case.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE/DOWNEY; SCHOOL AIMS TO QUIET SOCCER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pius X High School officials say they have devised a plan that may quiet the 
controversy surrounding adult soccer tournaments at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic high school of 510 students has come under fire from South Gate 
residents who say California Soccer Assn. tournaments there have drawn rowdy 
crowds who park cars in their driveways and dump beer cans and dirty diapers on 
their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pius X is at 7851 E. Gardendale St. in Downey, but the athletic field faces a 
residential South Gate neighborhood. The school has leased its field for small 
adult soccer tournaments over the past four years with relatively few 
complaints, said Principal Michael Parmer. But within the last six months, the 
school has hosted two tournaments that attracted large corporate sponsors, 
purses of up to $15,000 and nearly 3,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors recently submitted a 37-signature petition to South Gate police that 
criticized the events. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, school officials met with the police chiefs of South Gate and 
Downey, campus staff and a California Soccer Assn. representative last week to 
devise a plan that will be discussed at a community forum. The meeting will be 
scheduled before the next game on May 14, said Parmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes banning parking along Gardendale Street, adding off-duty 
police officers for security during the games, prohibiting alcohol and 
providing extra bleachers and bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported receiving few complaints until the school recently began 
hosting larger tournaments. Some residents say they have been accused of 
opposing the games because of the almost exclusively Latino crowd that they 
attract. But Elisabeth Bowman, an outspoken critic of the games who helped 
circulate the petition, said the issue "is not racial."

COVER STORY; A BUILDING CONSENSUS; PRESERVATIONISTS SUCCEED IN LIMITING 
DEVELOPMENT IN WHITTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Sullens didn't rate a call from the mayor of Whittier in 1987 when 
city leaders frowned on his plans to demonstrate against the demolition of 
local historic buildings. The carpet store owner got a call, instead, from the 
sister-in-law of an ex-City Council member, who told him that protests were 
unacceptable because they made the city look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen McKenna-Rahder, a homemaker, was accorded even less respect when she 
complained to the City Council that officials were approving development 
projects that were ruining neighborhoods. On at least one occasion, city 
officials told her to be quiet and sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Sullens nor McKenna-Rahder backed away. 
</P>
<P>
 They marched in the streets, studied redevelopment and zoning laws, and poured 
over meeting agendas. They vowed to preserve Whittier as a village-like town of 
historic buildings, tree-lined streets, wood-framed bungalows, and stretches of 
undeveloped ridges and canyons in the hills nearby. They and like-minded 
residents came to be called preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they fought City Hall and lost. Ultimately they gained control of 
the City Council and changed its direction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna-Rahder and ally Bob Henderson, who runs an insurance company, won 
election to the five-member City Council in 1990. Two years later they were 
joined by preservationists Sullens and Allan P. Zolnekoff, a utility company 
planner. Shortly after, retired school board member Janet Henke -- who 
frequently, though not always, sides with the other council preservationists -- 
replaced Larry Haendiges, who resigned because of personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years the council turned over 100%, shed 20 years from its average age 
and installed a new philosophy in City Hall. The "good old boys," as 
McKenna-Rahder called them, were out. Last week, Sullens, at 39, became the 
youngest mayor in memory. Henke, at 61, is currently the oldest council member. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council members have worked to preserve old buildings and turn away 
developers seeking to erect apartments in hundred-year-old neighborhoods. They 
kept new houses off undeveloped hillsides and purchased land to create a 
wilderness park. Developers who wanted to build strip malls with scant parking 
and no landscaping were told to go back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationist-controlled council challenged an established Southern 
California orthodoxy: that new is good, bigger is better, and development is 
inevitable, unalterable and right. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for this change in perspective, "there wouldn't be any wildlife habitat 
up in the hills," said Zolnekoff, who is 40. "There would be more apartments 
with transient populations and more crime and gangs, more mini-malls with 
stop-and-rob stores on every corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Some skeptics, however, aren't sure the city is particularly better off. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have referred to the preservationists as business haters, tree 
huggers, and even communists. The council has been accused of chasing away 
needed business development and infringing upon the rights of property owners. 
Critics say the council has focused too narrowly on preservation issues such as 
opposing development in the Whittier Hills, an area that is largely privately 
owned and outside city limits and jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the criticism has taken root. Although voters returned two incumbents 
to office earlier this month, McKenna-Rahder, 42, lost her bid for reelection 
to challenger Greg Nordbak, who had accused the council of being anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without McKenna-Rahder, the preservationists remain firmly in control 
and dedicated to causes born in the rubble of the devastating earthquake that 
struck Whittier on the morning of Oct. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor, measuring at magnitude 5.9 on the Richter scale, destroyed 34 
buildings and damaged 23 others, affecting about 140 businesses in the central 
business district, known as Uptown. In all, more than 5,000 Whittier homes and 
businesses suffered an estimated $90 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit especially hard were the neighborhoods on the perimeter of Uptown and 
neighboring Whittier College. Residents consider these areas some of the most 
charming in this town of 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 These tree-lined streets were home to the first white settlers of Whittier, a 
Quaker settlement founded in 1887. A handful of farmhouses date from the 
late-1800s. The neighborhoods also include Victorian-style homes, houses based 
on designs by renowned architects Greene and Greene, and rows of 
Craftsman-style one- and two-story wooden bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 Change swept down upon these quiet streets in the aftermath of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners lacked adequate insurance or savings to pay for repairs, and 
some ultimately sold their damaged houses to investors who razed the properties 
to make way for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, apartment houses were rising in some of these areas 
because such construction was allowed under city zoning regulations. The 
earthquake accelerated the process. In 1986, before the quake, developers 
received city permits to build 33 apartment complexes with a total of 169 
rental units. By 1989, those numbers had risen to 45 complexes and 323 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, though not all, of these units replaced houses. From 1984 to 1986, 99 
homes were demolished. Over the next three years, 188 homes were demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees Jack C. and Helen N. Lowe, who live on Dorland Street west of Uptown, 
watched with alarm as neighbors across the street and behind their house sold 
their damaged homes to apartment developers. They envisioned their two-bedroom 
wooden bungalow being gradually hemmed in by apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake destroyed so many beautiful homes," Jack Lowe said. "The developers 
said, 'We'll give you $50,000 for your busted-up house,' and a lot of people 
didn't have the money to fix their homes, so they took it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowes already were living next to an apartment house that had been erected 
before the earthquake but years after the Lowes bought their 68-year-old home 
in the mid-1960s. The apartment house, a rectangular, two-story stucco box with 
bare aluminum window frames, runs from one side of its lot to the other, towers 
over the Lowes' back yard and blocks the sunlight that used to stream through 
their large kitchen window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have to turn on the light in the kitchen if I want to see anything," 
Helen Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowes also were troubled by changes beyond their street, such as the 
demolition of the historic Whittier Theater. A former dancer, Helen had 
performed on the stage of the once-grand movie house, which was built in 1929 
and featured live acts between the silent films. She felt that city officials, 
overzealous to rebuild, were scrapping the city's heritage, erasing the charm 
and history that set Whittier apart from newer, blander communities nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, the Lowes met McKenna-Rahder, and found that she shared their 
concerns. McKenna-Rahder said she learned that investors had bought or planned 
to buy many of the single-family homes on Dorland Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to put 56 rental units on that small street," McKenna-Rahder 
said. "Two cars can't even fit by each other on that street. I couldn't stand 
the injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna-Rahder joined with Sullens, who had recently co-founded the Whittier 
Conservancy, a group dedicated to saving historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 They took their complaints directly to City Hall -- and were pretty much 
ignored at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think (the city staff and council) treated that whole conservancy 
group as though they were a lunatic fringe," said Bea Comini, a community 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council at that time consisted of older, accomplished, well-connected 
local businessmen. For them, serving on the council was an ultimate form of 
community service, achieved after years of belonging to the Chamber of Commerce 
and the boards of local charities and service organizations. They interfered 
little in day-to-day city business, which they left in the hands of no-nonsense 
City Manager Tom Mauk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to the podium and saying, 'Excuse me, I think we have a 
little problem with the zoning,' " McKenna-Rahder said in her farewell remarks 
before leaving the council this month. "I think Tom said something like, 'It's 
OK, she'll go away.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back the next week with 200 people and Tom said, 'I don't think she's 
going away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The group gained a significant ally in Bob Henderson. He has most of the 
traditional credentials for leadership in Whittier, a town that boasts of being 
the boyhood home of Richard Nixon. Five generations of Hendersons have lived or 
worked in Whittier. His insurance agency is based in town. Henderson, who just 
turned 54, had served two council terms previously before temporarily retiring 
from local government. 
</P>
<P>
 But there he was, agreeing with McKenna-Rahder. In 1990, both ran successfully 
for the City Council and began to set the city's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The holdover council members were open to compromise. And many preservationist 
initiatives, including stricter development standards, won council approval 
before the preservationist majority took over. 
</P>
<P>
 At new strip malls, for example, compact parking spaces became illegal. 
Developers were directed to install a tree for every six parking spaces, and 
the trees had to be large enough to offer shade. The council also required at 
least 20 feet of landscaping between the street and the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The council limited apartment complexes on the typical city lot to a maximum 
of three rental units. In the early 1970s, by contrast, the city allowed 11 
apartments on the same 50-by-140-foot lots. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, with the arrival of a preservationist majority, the council took on 
the blueprint of the city's future, called the General Plan. The old plan 
represented the best thinking of the early 1960s. It called for a city center 
surrounded and patronized by apartment dwellers. Under this vision, prosperous 
homeowners would move to the planned neighborhoods and wealthy enclaves in east 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationists said the old approach was flawed. They noted that 
longtime residents who lived near the city center liked their neighborhoods and 
enjoyed living within walking distance of a village-like downtown. These 
residents did not want to make way for apartments, and many could not afford 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed city staff to redraw city zoning maps, blocking 
construction of large apartment complexes in neighborhoods of single-family 
homes.

 "We put a halt to cramming five families where there used to be one, placing a 
large shoe-box apartment where there used to be a house, squeezing in 10 cars 
where there used to be two and 10 toilets where there used to be one," 
McKenna-Rahder said. "When you take an existing area, bulldoze it and put in 
five times as much development, you've impacted your sewer, your water supply, 
your streets, your schools and the police department." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Henderson: "The highest density areas, the ones where the city allowed 
the worst of the apartments, are exactly our highest crime areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the preservationist majority, development standards have become even 
more strict and more subjective -- affecting remodeled dwellings as well as new 
construction and governing the treatment of windows, driveways, outdoor 
stairwells and outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody comes in and wants to redo their windows, we require them to show 
us a photograph of the existing windows," said Michael Burnham, Whittier's 
assistant planning director. "If the old windows have individual panes, we 
require that the window that goes in has to be divided in some way too." 
</P>
<P>
 And an owner who wants to stucco his wood-frame bungalow had better think 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Property manager Jerry Morgan had already surrounded his apartment building 
with wire -- the first step in a stucco job -- when he learned that the council 
would not go along. The council ordered Morgan to revert to wood siding, even 
though the two adjacent apartments had been covered with stucco long ago. He 
estimated that problems with the city cost him about $15,000 and delayed his 
project four to five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I would never try to rehabilitate another complex in Whittier 
again. The council has not been business-friendly," said Morgan, who appeared 
in the council chambers last week to cheer the swearing in of council critic 
Nordbak. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordbak, 42, owner of a trophy manufacturing company, has chastised the 
council for, among other things, postponing action on an apartment owner's 
request to erect a six-foot chain-link fence around his property. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner said the fence would help protect his tenants from burglars, gang 
members and drug addicts. But city regulations allow no fences higher than 
3-feet, 6-inches in front yards, and chain-link is prohibited. Council members 
resisted making an exception because they said the fence would make the 
apartment look like a jail. A better solution would be to find ways to solve 
the crime problem, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordbak supporters such as Selma Minerd said the city is turning away from the 
preservationists. "They've put all kinds of restrictions on the business 
community," she said. "Without a healthy business climate, the town is going to 
deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing draws more steam from the preservationist council members than this 
sort of criticism. They point out that Uptown, the city center, has more 
thriving businesses now than before the earthquake. Of the 23 Uptown commercial 
buildings that were badly damaged, 22 have been repaired. Buildings now sit on 
19 of the 34 lots left vacant by the quake. And retail sales exceed 
pre-earthquake levels. New businesses have moved in, including farmers markets, 
sidewalk cafes, coffee shops, bookstores, art galleries, upscale pool-table 
parlors and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment construction, however, has declined dramatically, partly because of 
the recession. Last year, the city issued permits for six apartment buildings 
with 33 units. A handful of commercial lots also sit vacant, including the site 
of the Whittier Theater, where the owner had once intended to build a strip 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's in favor of quality development," said former mayor Lee Strong, a 
critic of the council preservationists. "But there has to be a little 
flexibility. Some of the new standards leave some corner lots practically 
undevelopable." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the council is working to create a 4,000-acre wilderness park in 
the undeveloped hills that stretch to the north and east of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henderson was the driving force behind an agreement that will 
accrue funds to purchase parkland in the Whittier-Puente Hills system. Trash 
haulers must pay $1 into the fund for every ton of trash dumped into the nearby 
Puente Hills Landfill. The arrangement, which took effect earlier this year, is 
expected to generate about $3.75 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council, with the assistance of state Sen. Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier), successfully applied for $17.3 million in park bond money. The 
council recently purchased 76 acres for $600,000. Other purchases are being 
negotiated. Critics said they would prefer to see some of the money used to 
improve existing city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jack and Helen Lowe, however, the preservationists arrived just in time. 
Near their home along narrow Dorland Street are three apartment or condominium 
complexes. Although one development blocks their view of the Whittier Hills, 
quaint Craftsman-style bungalows still stretch along most of their street. And 
the new zoning laws are designed to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lowe scoffed at critics of the preservationists. "I can't see where 
they've taken away property rights at all," he said. "What about my property 
rights? This street would have been a disaster if they hadn't stopped the 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stay here till we get carried out in a box. We see no reason 
to go anyplace else." Major Whittier City Council Initiatives, 1990 to 1994: 
</P>
<P>

loans made to local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 
</P>
<P>
 * Rejected a proposal to build homes in undeveloped Worsham Canyon on the 
northeastern edge of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>

 Jelani Gardner of St. John Bosco and Timicha Kirby of Lynwood were honored as 
The Times' 1994 Southeast Players of the Year at an awards breakfast Sunday at 
the Long Beach Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, a 6-foot-6 senior guard, averaged 26.7 points and 7.1 assists as he 
led the Braves to the Southern Section Division II-A title. St. John Bosco was 
53-6 the past two seasons with the Cal-bound Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Player of the Year award was another in a long list of achievements 
for Kirby. The 5-11 senior, who will attend Iowa, was the Southern Section 
Division I girls' player of the year and named the State Division I player of 
the year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Castillo of St. Paul and Ellis Barfield of Lynwood were selected as the 
Southeast boys' and girls' coaches of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo guided the Swordsmen to the Division IV-AA finals and the Southern 
Regional State Division IV semifinals. Lynwood finished 32-2 under Barfield and 
advanced to the State Division I title game for the second season in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa-bound Jamie Gillin of Dominguez was named the South Coast Player of the 
Year and Ron Palmer of Long Beach Poly was chosen the boys' coach of the year 
after leading their schools to berths in the Southern California State Regional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Loza of Millikan and Ann Dena Sjoerdsma of Cerritos were chosen as the 
South Coast girls' player and coach of the year. MAN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 The accolades keep coming for Michael Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell Gardens High sophomore has been named the boys' Indoor Athlete of the 
Year by Track & Field News magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Granville set a sophomore record of 57.7 seconds in the 500 yards 
at the Sunkist Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, he ran 1 minute 51.11 seconds in the 800 meters in the National 
Scholastic Indoor championships in Syracuse, N.Y., to cut 3.17 seconds off the 
sophomore record to move into third on the all-time high school list. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't lost a step outdoors, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, who ran 47.24 in the 400 meters last year to establish a state 
freshman record, clocked a personal-best 46.67 seconds to win the 400 meters at 
the April 15 Mt. San Antonio College Relays. The mark was the meet's fastest 
time in more than 15 years. KICKING IT 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Castillo, who helped Bell Gardens to the Southern Section Division III 
soccer title, has been selected as the Division III defensive player of the 
year.

 The Compton High baseball team has won only two games this season -- both have 
been no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonso Alfaro and Eddie Varelo teamed to no-hit Centennial in the Tarbabes 
season-opener. Alfaro threw a no-hitter in a 2-0 victory over Jordan on April 
19 for the Tarbabes' first Moore League victory since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning streak was short-lived for Compton (2-10, 1-8). The Tarbabes were 
beaten by Jordan, 11-7, on Friday. DIRT BAG SWEEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team scored three unearned runs to beat UC Santa 
Barbara, 4-2, Sunday at Blair Field and complete a three-game sweep of the 
Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (30-12, 10-5) closed to 1 1/2 games of first-place Cal State 
Fullerton in the Big West Conference standings with six conference games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fontana (8-2) pitched his third shutout of the season, retiring 20 of the 
final 22 batters, to lead Long Beach to a 1-0 victory against Santa Barbara on 
Friday. Center fielder Rolando Avila had two doubles and drove in three runs to 
pace the 49ers to an 11-2 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana and Avila were selected as the Big Wast Conference pitcher and player 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will play host to a three-game series against Grand Canyon starting 
Friday at 7 p.m. The teams will meet Saturday at 7 p.m. and close out the 
series Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who lost to UCLA, 12-2, on Tuesday, visit Pepperdine on Tuesday 
before returning to conference play at Nevada Las Vegas on May 6. ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Moxley, Stacy Pando and Le'Greta Hinds of Long Beach State recorded 
victories in the UC Irvine track and field invitational Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moxley won the 100 meters in 12.31 seconds. Pando and Hinds were victorious in 
the 1,500 and 400 hurdles in 4:36.03 and 59.73, respectively. The 49ers also 
won the 400 relay in 48.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Scott leaped 24-6 1/4 to win the long jump and bounded 49-11 3/4 to 
place second in the triple jump for the 49er men. WINNING CAUSE 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State pitcher Stacy Van Essen was 4-for-5, including a home run, 
and drove in four runs to power the 49er softball team to a 7-6 victory over 
Utah State in the second game of a Big West Conference doubleheader Saturday at 
Mayfair Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (25-21, 10-10), which lost the first game against Utah, 10-2, will 
play host to New Mexico State today. NAMES IN THE NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 Dion Holton of Long Beach Poly has made an unwritten commitment to attend Cal 
State Fullerton. The 6-0 guard chose the Titans over UC Santa Barbara, UC San 
Diego, Montana and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Winston has been selected as boys' basketball coach at Lakewood High. 
Winston, 37, an assistant at Long Beach City College for the past four seasons, 
replaces Michael Jackson. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Pius X High officials have devised a plan to appease neighborhood complaints 
stemming from adult soccer tournaments at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained that California Soccer Assn. tournaments at the 
Catholic school have attracted unruly crowds who park cars in their driveways 
and leave beer cans and used diapers on their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 A 37-signature petition was submitted to South Gate police criticizing the 
events. Pius X is in Downey, but the athletic field on Gardendale Street faces 
a residential South Gate neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, meeting last week with the police chiefs of South Gate and 
Downey, campus staff and a California Soccer Assn. representative, came up with 
a plan to be discussed at a community forum scheduled for May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for banning parking along Gardendale Street, adding off-duty 
police officers, prohibiting alcohol and providing extra bleachers and restroom 
facilities. KIRBY LEE

JAZZ REVIEW; HE'S HITTING THE HIGH NOTES, LOOKING FOR A U.S. GROOVE

<P>
 Karl Denson is one of the fast-rising young stars of the saxophone -- but only 
in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Forest resident, who won the John Coltrane Festival's Young Artist 
Award in 1992, has a pair of fine albums out in Germany on the Minor Music 
label. A third, set for release later this year, includes the distinguished 
rhythm section of drummer Jack DeJohnette and bassist Dave Holland. Denson 
tours Germany on a regular basis and will return there later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at System M in Long Beach, Denson showed why the Europeans are so 
bullish on his music as he wound his way through a set of quirky, 
hard-cornering originals that showcased his writing as well as his playing 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall effect was one of incredulity: Why isn't this man touring this 
country's major clubs? Why hasn't one of the major U. S. jazz labels signed 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because it's hard to get comfortable with Denson's music. Though 
accessible, his tunes have more faces than a Rubik's cube, swinging hard here, 
progressing in considered fashion there and always full of breaks, jumps and 
tempo shifts. Just when you think you've got a handle on one of his numbers, 
the piece, like a chameleon, changes colors. 
</P>
<P>
 After warming up his quintet with the standard "Dear Old Stockholm," Denson 
moved his band into "Honey Lemon Tea" (many of his tunes and all his albums 
carry titles with food references) that had bassist Benjamin May and pianist 
Christian Jacob sounding a unison rhythm line as solid as a heartbeat. Then May 
took the lead, plucking a melodic line on his upright until Denson, on tenor, 
stated a brief anthem in tandem with Ron Stout's fluegelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the first set, Denson showed a childlike innocence in his playing. 
Though he's no happy-face musician, his work does have a playful, joyous 
quality that is at once teasing and inviting. During more raucous passages, he 
showed he's absorbed the lessons of John Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Denson returns to System M Saturday with his groove-oriented acid band, The 
Grey Boy All Stars.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: MARINE CENTER VOLUNTEERS TEACH SEAL PUPS THE FINER POINTS 
OF DINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SEASON FOR SEALS: Being a seal pup is like being an adolescent. Not a baby, 
not quite an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 With nursing over, mothers have taken off, and the pups must forage for food 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick and injured seal pups end up underweight and dehydrated. So leave it to 
the Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro to help. 
</P>
<P>
 This is peak season for the center to aid sick and injured seal pups. This 
week, it was caring for seven California sea lions, 16 northern elephant seals 
and one harbor seal. Volunteers give medicine and food to the pups, some of 
which were injured by nets or boats. After two months, most are released back 
into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are just the weak ones," said Don Zumwalt, director of the center. 
"They come in all different types of situations. They even come in with 
stingrays in their mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Many young pups do not yet recognize fish for what it is: food. So animal-care 
volunteers at the center feed the pups by holding the seal's mouth open and 
guiding a fish down its throat. The seal eventually accepts the food without 
its mouth being held open, and the pup later learns how to follow and eat fish 
tossed into a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the patient load is running about half the level of last year, when 
storms made it tougher for the seals to search for food, Zumwalt said.  
</P>
<P>
 BAHIA DEL SUR: When the Chevron refinery in El Segundo unveiled a new 
advertising campaign last week, it also let out the news that it was changing 
the name of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron El Segundo is now Chevron South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal, except that the city was named for the refinery. It means "The 
Second." City founders chose the name when it incorporated in 1917 to show its 
favor with Chevron's second U.S. refinery, then only six years old. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "not that we are not proud of being in El Segundo," Chevron spokeswoman 
Lani Marshall assured a gathering at the refinery last week, including several 
El Segundo city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The new name, she said, better defines the company's scope in the region. The 
company is promoting its work on cleaner-burning fuels, which the state is 
mandating by 1996 to curb vehicle emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said she will have "some explaining to do" to El Segundo city 
officials, although one said he didn't feel snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis has to be on their needs, not ours," said Councilman Richard 
Switz. "I have to believe that Chevron thinks it will help." 
</P>
<P>
 HOOP GOOF: Avid hoopsters were shocked. The city of Los Angeles didn't even 
know what happened. One of the prized hoops at Angels Gate Park in San Pedro 
was kaput. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a construction firm removed a stone arch that held a basketball 
hoop. Trouble is, they were only supposed to remove the hoop and put on new a 
backboard. The goof will cost the firm $2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't paying attention to the designs we have," said Mary Braunwarth, 
a management analyst for the city's Parks and Recreation Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Most other city parks have basketball poles. But Angels Gate hoopsters seem to 
have an affinity for arches, and are very unhappy, Braunwarth said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The stone arches are very unusual," she said. "It is nothing like other 
parks." 
</P>
<P>
 DINOSAUR DISCOVERY: Longtime patrons of the Malaga Cove Library in Palos 
Verdes Estates remember field trips as kids to the historic building to see a 
mastodon tusk and Indian relics. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are long gone, and so it seemed were the archeological treasures. 
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Library District, in an attempt to diffuse rumors that the 
relics had been thrown out, has been tracking them down. The tusk was 
discovered on the front porch of a retired district staff member, said Library 
Director Linda Elliott. Small Indian tools and bowls and bones from a giant 
sloth turned up in a crawl space at the library, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the relics are in the keep of Rancho de Los Palos Verdes Historical 
Society, as part of a new museum it opened in March at the Malaga Cove School. 
</P>
<P>
 The items are all local artifacts. They were uncovered as homes and businesses 
were built on the peninsula early this century, and eventually ended up in the 
library's hands, said historical society President Mary Roderman.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite wonderful because these artifacts are from the history of the 
peninsula," Roderman said. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, considering our maturity, there's a good chance we might lose one or two 
of us before this thing is over. If somebody snaps the twig over there, he 
better decide right now if he wants us to ship him home or fill his pockets 
with scrap iron and dump him over the side." 
</P>

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: DILLS AND HIS CHALLENGERS GET READY TO FACE THE MUSIC IN 
JUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DILLS' DEBUT: Decked in white slacks, a sport coat and bow tie, State Sen. 
Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) plays a saxophone in a billboard photo. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan: "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 84-year-old lawmaker's opening salvo in his June 7 primary 
campaign, which could be the toughest race in a political career that dates to 
the 1930s. Two of his opponents, Torrance Councilman George Nakano and Venice 
attorney Mike Sidley, say that he has been in Sacramento so long that he has 
lost touch with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of ducking the issue, we made it a positive," said Tim Mock, Dills' 
campaign manager and coordinator. "We've had a very good response." 
</P>
<P>
 The same ad is featured in campaign mailers, which outlines Dills' record and 
features quotes like: "I've played sax a lot longer than Bill Clinton's been 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad "Is an opening line, a 'Hi, how are you?' " said Richard Ross, his 
campaign consultant. "People smile. That's all it's intended to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters may find him a new candidate. Because of redistricting, his 
Gardena-area 30th District was carved up, forcing him to run in the newly 
formed 28th District, which includes the beach cities, Torrance, Carson, 
Compton and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad "is a preemptive strike," said Rick Rosenthal, Sidley's campaign 
manager. "But I'm really wondering if he plays better or worse than Bill 
Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 INCUMBENT ADVANTAGE: When voters ousted incumbents in elections in Manhattan 
Beach and El Segundo earlier this month, some of Dills' opponents took it as a 
signal of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Namely, that voters are willing to oust Dills in the state primary, said 
Nakano campaign manager Debbie Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 In early March, the Nakano campaign conducted a poll that showed Dills leading 
Nakano by five percentage points, 13% to 8%. And the majority of the 400 voters 
surveyed said they were either undecided or had never heard of either 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' campaign, however, said the survey proves only that they have to 
establish name recognition in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano "spent a lot of money to find out something we already know," Mock 
said. "Nobody knows Dills or Nakano in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Sidley? He is a member of the Los Angeles County Environmental 
Crimes Sentencing Task Force, but largely unknown in South Bay political 
circles. The Nakano campaign doubts he will be a serious challenge. Sidley's 
campaign puts everyone on equal ground. "It's a three-person race," Rosenthal 
said.

 SUPERMARKET KICKOFF: State Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Torrance) launched her 
reelection bid last week amid the sound of shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at a podium in the parking lot of Smith's supermarket in Redondo 
Beach, she outlined her agenda on campaign finance reform, crime, education and 
defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen had a reason for holding the event in the lot: She helped Smith's secure 
permits so it could build on the site, which formerly was an aircraft parts 
manufacturing plant. "This is a great example of the good that has been done 
for the business community," she said.

BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKET; DEVELOPMENT: 
CARSON OFFICIALS WERE IMPRESSED BY THOMAS SAFRAN'S TRACK RECORD OF 20 
LOW-INCOME PROJECTS. HE SEEKS DESIGNS THAT ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM 
COMMERCIAL APARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a city known for its heavy industry, a senior citizens' complex is being 
built on the contaminated site of a onetime metal-plating plant in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers had to dig 65 feet to remove soil contaminated by a leaking 
underground fuel tank before ground could be broken for the complex last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a complicated web of financing involving a host of government agencies 
and financial institutions had to be secured before the project on Avalon 
Boulevard could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 It all took five years, but those are the kinds of pitfalls developer Thomas 
Safran is accustomed to facing with affordable housing projects. Safran, 49, 
says the Avalon Courtyard project has gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's second nature to me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood developer has spearheaded 20 developments for senior citizens or 
families in Southern California in as many years. His goal is to create 
low-cost housing indistinguishable from commercial apartments, even though he 
says he could make more money in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to open in early 1995, Avalon Courtyard blends Colonial and 
Mediterranean designs, including balconies, window shutters and red-tile roofs. 
The building will include a community recreation center, an arts and crafts 
room, two courtyards and a subterranean parking garage. It also will feature 
extensive landscaping; utility lines will be buried.  
</P>
<P>
 Safran's philosophy pleased city officials, who selected him after touring 
some of his previous projects and those of six other developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the other applicants' buildings) were long hallways that looked like 
a cheap motel," said Carson Redevelopment Director Adolfo Reyes. "They didn't 
have the personal touch."  
</P>
<P>
 When the project is complete, a resident with an annual income of $20,280 or 
less will be charged $509 a month for a one-bedroom apartment; those making 
$16,900 or less will pay $418 a month. The city will provide additional rent 
subsidies to some Carson residents, although the guidelines have not been 
determined.  
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay about $2.5 million of the $9-million project. The California 
Community Reinvestment Corp. will invest about $2.5 million, and Mission 
Housing Investments, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison, will invest 
about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do these kinds of projects takes a joint effort," Safran said. "You now 
have many more layers of financing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments invest in such projects in part because the state now 
requires cities to have a blueprint to provide low-cost housing. Carson's plan 
includes a goal of providing 10 to 20 new units of affordable housing each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for housing, however, is still tight, and there is no guarantee of a 
payoff when a project is built. Safran will earn a development fee, but the 
exact amount depends on the project coming in on budget. When he manages the 
place, rent increases will be limited to corresponding rises in median incomes 
of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is controlled," said Safran, who manages all but one of the 
projects he has developed. 
</P>
<P>
 So why stay with it?  
</P>
<P>
 "Money isn't the only factor," Safran said. "When you are all done, you have 
created a home for (seniors and families)." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, his Monterey Park complex for low-income residents won two 
awards for architectural design from the Pacific Coast Builders conference, a 
trade group that encompasses 14 Western states and the Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 241-units, called Strathern Park Apartments, are scattered among 18 
buildings that surround four courtyards. Instead of hallways, there are 
staircases or sidewalks to each unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also won praise from Los Angeles officials, who had been trying to 
clean up the site, which included several vacant homes and an encampment for 
vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments "have been a very substantial contribution to the 
neighborhood," said John McCoy, director of housing for the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency. "They are well-managed." 
</P>
<P>
 Safran's projects have not always been welcomed. After a 15-year debate, the 
Los Angeles City Council in March approved his plans to build a 64-unit senior 
citizens project along the Venice boardwalk despite protests from nearby 
residents who complained it was too dense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson project did not encounter such opposition, but it did encounter a 
few delays as workers removed dirt contaminated with gasoline. And Los Angeles 
County health agencies had to approve the work before building could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Safran do not know how many will apply to live in the project, 
although new South Bay affordable housing projects in recent years have 
attracted thousands of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of demand would please many commercial developers, who are 
struggling because of a lack of commercial apartment projects. In fact, they 
now call Safran and take him to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I explain to them how complicated it is -- how much red tape there is -- 
by the time the meal ends, they are not as enthusiastic," he said. "The bill 
just sits there. And they are the ones who took me out to lunch."

THEY'RE DOWN ON THE FARM -- IN CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of spending his money on compact discs or going out on weekends, high 
school junior Carlos Martinez has more than $2,000 invested in livestock: a 
pig, two sheep and three cows. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is among 40 Future Farmers of America based at Carson's Stephen White 
Middle School, smack in the middle of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping piglets, lambs, calves and poultry in an urban area presents Carson 
FFA members with problems their country counterparts probably couldn't imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, someone jumped over the school's fence and injured the group's 
pregnant sow. Two weeks later she went into labor, but even with the students 
caring for her around the clock, she died shortly after giving birth to 13 
piglets. 
</P>
<P>
 The students spend hours every day with their animals, teaching them to wear a 
halter and walk without fussing in competitions. Bolting or wiggling will keep 
the judge from being able to feel the muscle mass and bone length -- keys to 
scoring points. 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for the mini-farm is hard work, requiring extra time on weekends and 
school holidays. But despite the difficult work, fascination with animals draws 
the future farmers to the barns, where they hang over the rails, comparing 
their animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Mark Nower, who runs the FFA program, said the students work together, 
helping each other learn about the animals and the competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Borland, 15, plans to show her lamb, Lilly, and her pig, Lucy, at the 
fair. Borland watches over the program's 18 pigs, making sure the students 
clean the pens and provide food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even come here on the weekends. I'm never home," Borland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, administrators and students credit the vocational agriculture program 
with keeping the youths out of trouble and training them for a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would probably be at home doing nothing," said ninth-grader Luis Rodriguez, 
14, who got his first animal this year, a lamb named "Deadeye" for its 
brooding, dark eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has turned kids around who once were involved in drugs and 
gangs," said Principal Carolyn Bohm  
</P>
<P>
 Nower said students who finish college have a good chance at working in 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominic Diaz,15, expects that after earning a degree in animal science he 
could work for a poultry company in the San Joaquin Valley. Diaz already runs 
an operation of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so many chickens it's almost ridiculous," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He has more than 200 birds, including several varieties he crossbred. Each 
day, Diaz's hens lay 150 to 175 eggs, most of which he sells to teachers or at 
the Torrance Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group don't wear their royal blue FFA jackets around school, 
where they get teased for being farmers, but they slip the jackets on for FFA 
competitions, where they are recognized as tough competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent contest at Cal State Fresno, the team took first place in judging 
butchered chicken parts.  
</P>
<P>
 But even other future farmers sometimes razz them for being city slickers.  
</P>
<P>
 "They think we're no good because we're in the city, but our chapter has won 
some high honors," Diaz said.

OFF-STAGE DRAMA OVER DANCE ENSEMBLE; EDUCATION: A STUDENT WHOSE ORIGINAL PIECE 
WAS BANNED AT HER CARSON HIGH SCHOOL FINDS AN AUDIENCE AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE. 
</P>

<P>
 A teen-age choreographer will finally get the chance to present in public a 
dance that a high school principal banned from a school dance concert, sparking 
a controversy over free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographer Desiree Roble, 17, and three other students from the California 
Academy of Mathematics and Science in Carson will perform Roble's piece this 
weekend during a dance concert at El Camino College in Torrance. The students 
had been looking for a venue since their number was dropped from a March 25 
performance at the high school before parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Kathleen Clark ordered the piece canceled after seeing the dance for 
the first time earlier in the day during a performance for students and several 
guests. She said later that the dance was "inflammatory and totally 
inappropriate" and that it violated students' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-minute piece, titled "In Search . . . My Journey," combines narration 
with movements expressing isolation and rage. The dancers are accompanied by a 
montage of modern instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble, an 11th-grader from Hawthorne, said the piece draws from many 
experiences that have left her afraid and angry. "I can't see justification for 
this dance to be censored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble's dance teacher at the high school, Ming Ng, also said the principal's 
decision amounted to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance is performed by two boys and two girls, who interact through 
movement, much of it confrontational. At several points, a boy makes thrusting 
and striking gestures over one of the girls, who falls to the floor and 
resists.  
</P>
<P>
 The narration includes cries of protest and calls for help.  
</P>
<P>
 Some students laughed, cheered or whooped during the morning performance at 
the high school. The audience applauded warmly at the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Clark summoned the performers to her office and told them that the 
piece would not be performed before parents at the annual public recital for 
the high school's dance program. 
</P>
<P>
 She said in an interview that she objected to the dance because it alluded to 
a violent act that may have actually taken place involving students. As a 
result, some parents might become angry or upset if they saw it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roble, five other students and a dancer's parent then complained to the Long 
Beach school board, which oversees the Carson academy. The school draws 
students from Long Beach and seven other area school systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Board members referred the issue to staff, which is still trying to sort out 
the matter, said Helen Z. Hansen, superintendent of the district's high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, the students won a reprieve from an unexpected source. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Collins-Heads, a dance instructor at Los Angeles Southwest College, 
invited the students to fill in for another group at this weekend's "Dance Jam 
'94," a concert featuring dancers from five area community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert is at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the South Bay Center for the 
Arts on the El Camino campus, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; CITY WILL PAY $199,500 TO SETTLE PENSION SUIT 
</P>

<P>
 Manhattan Beach will pay a former city manager $199,500 to end a legal battle 
over the terms of his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 David J. Thompson retired in 1990 with an annual pension of $139,000 a year -- 
$50,000 a year more than he had been earning on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council initially approved the deal, members later said they 
did not know until after his departure that the agreement allowed him to use 
accrued vacation and sick leave to inflate the base salary on which his pension 
was based.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the council slashed the pension by $60,000 a year, and Thompson sued 
the city and individual council members. He claimed breach of contract and said 
officials had the opportunity to question or change his pension before he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial was to begin April 14 but a tentative settlement was reached. The 
accord was signed Tuesday. Thompson could not be reached for comment. JAMES 
BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARENTS TOLD: TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL

 Spending her Saturday in a classroom didn't sound like much fun to Jacqueline 
Thomas-Nelson of Lawndale. But the mother of four changed her mind when she 
heard it might make her a better parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas-Nelson and about 50 others attended a day of free food, entertainment 
and parenting workshops at Leuzinger High School in Hawthorne. The discussions 
covered topics including prevention of teen-age pregnancy and resolution of 
family conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers presented information in English, Spanish and Vietnamese but said the 
message of the seven-hour event was universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to practice what they preach to their children," said Jackie 
LaBouff, a school psychologist who organized the Together We Can Family 
Celebration Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to come today, but then I thought about what that says to my 
kids," said Thomas-Nelson, 31, who has four sons ages 3 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 But luring a large number of parents to the fair proved difficult. Organizers 
said they distributed thousands of flyers advertising Saturday's fair and ran a 
promotional video on local cable television. But just four dozen people 
attended. Last year, nearly 150 came. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBouff said some parents might not have received the flyers because they were 
given to students to take home. But she said apathy and denial also contributed 
to the low turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 The main thrust of the workshops was that parental behavior is the greatest 
influence on children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, we can't get youth to say no to drugs when the parents are 
saying yes," LaBouff said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, LaBouff won a $550,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education to 
spread that message in Hawthorne, Lawndale and Lennox. The three-year grant 
provides money for educational programs and helped stage last year's conference 
as well. The money also pays for a series of two-hour workshops at 6:30 p.m. on 
Thursdays. The meetings resume May 5 at Roosevelt Elementary School in 
Lawndale.

<P>
 A drive to recall Hermosa Beach Mayor Sam Y. Edgerton and Councilman Robert 
(Bergie) Benz failed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz came under fire for his involvement in last summer's controversial 
"Ironman" competition, in which contestants have to run a mile, paddle a mile 
and then chug a six-pack of beer without vomiting.Both officials have been 
criticized as being juvenile and argumentative at public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz and Edgerton said the drive's organizers had no basis for a recall. 
Edgerton accused them of harassing shoppers in front of a local grocery store 
to gather signatures.  
</P>
<P>
 "They accused me of being everything from a child molester to being 
responsible for putting Marie Callender's (restaurant) out of business," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizers said they collected 2,400 signatures, but the city required 
at least 2,900 by Tuesday (April 26) to hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the council members realize there are a number of unhappy people out 
there," said petition organizer Dick McCurdy. "Maybe they'll try harder to 
behave." JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; HEARING SCHEDULED ON ADULT-BUSINESS LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to residents' concerns about adult businesses in Carson, city 
officials have scheduled a public hearing on an ordinance to limit the location 
of businesses that sell sexually explicit goods. 
</P>
<P>
 A shop that sells novelties and one where lingerie is modeled moved into the 
city in the last year, prompting the council to adopt an emergency 
ordinance.The law requires at least 1,000 feet between two adult businesses or 
between them and elementary schools, parks or the Carson Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also requires any new adult business to get a conditional-use permit. 
The two established businesses have two years to get a permit or close down, 
city planner Sheri Repp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the emergency ordinance was passed quickly, the city wanted to give 
residents a chance to discuss adult businesses in a public hearing. The 
emergency ordinance will be replaced after the hearing, Repp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repp said adult businesses cannot be banned from the city. "The city has to 
provide a reasonable opportunity for these businesses to operate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the council chambers at City Hall.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN PEDRO; CITY ENDS LEASE WITH BASEBALL FIELD BACKER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit corporation hoping to build five state-of-the-art baseball fields 
in San Pedro apparently struck out this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials moved Tuesday to terminate the city's lease with San 
Pedro Baseball, which has leased a 15-acre site in San Pedro for $1 a year 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had been trying to raise more than $1 million to build five 
baseball fields for youths on a city-owned site in the 1900 block of North 
Gaffey Street. According to its most recent report to the city, about $400,000 
had been raised. But the company was $25,000 in debt. The land appears 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the organization told the city last year that it had been 
anticipating a $5.2-million donation from an international trust company based 
in San Diego, but that money never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Miley, the company's president, declined to comment until after receiving 
official notification of the lease's termination from the city. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOMITA; $65,000 CLEANUP SET AT FORMER TRUCK REPAIR SITE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a former truck maintenance yard in Lomita is cleaning up oil and 
gas residue at the site, a spokesman said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 John M. Shubin will pay $65,000 for the cleanup in an area on 242nd Street 
near Eshelman Avenue that is primarily residential, a spokesman said.The 
cleanup is expected to last through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Smith, a specialist in hazardous materials, said oil and gas had 
leaked into the ground from vehicles parked and repaired on the lot. Although 
the site poses only a minor health hazard, county officials said, the soil must 
be cleaned to prevent future problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should tell their children not to play on the property, which is 
fenced and posted with no trespassing signs, Smith said. Shubin is the former 
owner of John M. Shubin Inc., a Torrance-based trash-hauling company that used 
the lot as a maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, complaints from neighbors about noise and other problems forced the 
company to move its operations from the half-acre site. SCOTT SANDELL

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; MOBIL WILL BUILD SHED TO COVER RESIDUE PILE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mountainous pile of coke, or coal residue, on the property of the Mobil 
Oil refinery in Torrance, will disappear from view sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A contractor will build a storage barn to cover the material and then 
landscape the site on Crenshaw Boulevard, north of Del Amo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Enclosing the coke, a residue produced in oil refining, will help confine the 
black dust that blows off the pile and improve the view from nearby homes, 
Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 tons of coke is stored outside the plant while it awaits 
shipment to Europe and Japan, where it is used as heating fuel. Documents filed 
with the city Planning Commission show that the company plans to reduce the 
pile to about 80,000 tons and enclose it in the new 79,300-square-foot barn. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction also will include a truck- and rail-loading station.  
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission unanimously approved the $15-million project April 20. 
Unless a formal appeal is filed within 15 days, the project will go forward. 
Engelberg said construction is expected to begin in July and take about a year.

COVER STORY; SEA WORTHY; A CREW OF SEASONED SAILORS -- SOME IN THEIR 70S -- 
FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS TO FRANCE ABOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Lane Victory sails out of Los Angeles Harbor as scheduled this week, 
bound for England and the Normandy coast of France, it won't be the oldest 
large vessel ever to sail the high seas. But it certainly will have one of the 
oldest crews ever to go down to the sea in a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain is 77; the chief mate is 76. The chief engineer is 72. Of course, 
most of the other crew members are much younger than that. Their average age is 
only 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their age -- or maybe because of it -- the 53 Lane Victory crew 
members are determined to take their restored World War II cargo ship on the 
voyage to France for ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the D-day 
invasion of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of them, it's an 18,000-mile voyage back in time, back to the days 
when they were young sailors in the U.S. Merchant Marine, hauling cargo through 
dangerous waters to far-flung battle fronts around the globe in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of them, too, it will be the last great adventure of their long and 
often adventurous lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all these old boys," Lane Victory Capt. Bill Tilghman, 77, a veteran 
of half a century at sea, said as he waved a weather-beaten hand at the 
congregation of gray-haired men -- and a few women -- who assembled on the ship 
last week for a pre-voyage crew meeting. "Every one of these old sailors is at 
the twilight of his life. How often do you get a chance to do something really 
exciting at the end of your life? Not too damn often. That's why it's worth 
fighting for to make this trip." 
</P>
<P>
 And fight they did. They and other members of the U.S. Merchant Marine 
Veterans of World War II, a national organization with about 4,000 members, 
fought to get the old Lane Victory out of mothballs, and they fought to fix it 
up and turn it into a sea-going museum and memorial. Then they fought to 
collect the prodigious amounts of money, fuel and food they needed to make the 
Normandy voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory and its crew -- most of whom are from Southern California -- 
plan to steam southeast to Panama, through the Panama Canal and then across the 
Caribbean, passing between Cuba and Haiti and into the Atlantic. Depending on 
how long it takes to get there, near Bermuda the Lane Victory may rendezvous 
with two other ships -- the Maine, a training ship from a maritime academy in 
Maine, and the Jeremiah O'Brien, a World War II Liberty ship based in San 
Francisco that also is going to Normandy. (The O'Brien left San Francisco last 
week, but since its cruising speed is less than 10 knots, the faster Lane 
Victory could catch up.) 
</P>
<P>
 Alone or with the other ships, the Lane Victory will head east from Bermuda 
toward the coast of Africa, turning northward near the island of Madeira and 
sailing to Portsmouth, England, for a port visit before the Normandy ceremonies 
on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a 9,000-mile voyage one way, and at a cruising speed of about 15 knots, 
it will take almost a month to get to Europe, and a month back, with some side 
trips in between. All told, the voyage is expected to last about four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip will be arduous; it won't be like a cruise on the Princess Lines. 
There are no shuffleboard courts on deck, no health spa, no floor show at 
night. The crew cabins are at best Spartan. Like any other working ship's crew, 
the Lane Victory crew members, all of them volunteers, will stand bridge, deck 
and engine-room watches 24 hours a day. If they want to get from one deck to 
another they'll use ladders, not elevators.  
</P>
<P>
 And although the Lane Victory is equipped with modern navigational and radio 
gear and is taking the so-called "good weather" route across the Atlantic, any 
professional sailor can tell you that it's a tough ocean. There's always a 
chance the ship could hit rough seas. There will be a doctor on board, and all 
of the crew members had to get letters from their personal physicians saying 
they were able to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a pitching, yawing, rolling ship on the high seas, coupled with the 
inevitable problems of advancing years, could make the trip hazardous for some. 
At the pre-voyage crew meeting, Capt. Tilghman, a sometimes crusty old salt who 
lives in Fallbrook in San Diego County, didn't downplay the actuarial problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, considering our maturity," the captain said, "there's a good chance we 
might lose one or two of us before this thing is over. If somebody snaps the 
twig over there, he better decide right now if he wants us to ship him home or 
fill his pockets with scrap iron and dump him over the side." 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the Lane Victory crew members seemed worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went around the world in a ship just like this one during the war," said 
Ralph (Barney) Starr, 71, a Corona minerals prospector now serving as a galley 
"utility man" aboard the Lane Victory. "It won't be any problem. Everybody's 
looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose we're trying to recapture our youth," said Chief Mate Bill Skinner, 
76, a World War II Merchant Marine veteran who lives in Lakewood. "But I don't 
think we're too old for this trip. Nobody's pooping out. In fact, my blood 
pressure is down since I've been involved with this ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Doubters may shake their heads and say it'll be a miracle if the Lane Victory 
and its crew accomplish what they've set out to do. But as Joe Vernick, 
president of the national Merchant Marine veterans group, puts it, "This whole 
ship is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory's story began in 1945 at the California Shipbuilding 
Corporation (CalShip) yard on Terminal Island. One of 531 Victory ships built 
during the war, the Lane Victory was designed as a seagoing workhorse, an 
unglamorous but tough vessel able to haul cargo and troops wherever they needed 
to go. The Lane Victory is 455 feet long, with a 62-foot beam and five cargo 
holds; powered by steam turbines, like other Victory ships it is larger and 
faster than the Liberty ships built earlier in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Lane Victory began on April 5, 1945; less than three 
months and about $3 million later, the completed ship was delivered to the 
American President Lines shipping company, which operated the ship for the War 
Shipping Administration. The Lane Victory, named after Lane College in Jackson, 
Tenn., which had been founded by a former slave who became an Episcopal 
minister and educator, became part of the U.S. Merchant Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-known and little-publicized part of the war effort, the Merchant 
Marine was a government-contracted civilian organization that hauled about 85% 
of all war-related cargo, everything from tanks to ammunition to oil. Being in 
the Merchant Marine in World War II was dangerous work. Of the 225,000 who 
served, more than 6,000 died when their ships were hit by bombs or torpedoes, a 
battle death rate higher than any of the U.S. armed services except the U.S. 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Merchant Marine ships were equipped with defensive deck- and 
anti-aircraft guns, manned by U.S. Navy "armed guards" assigned to the ship. In 
wartime, the Lane Victory carried a crew of about 55 Merchant Marine seamen, 
plus about 20 Navy men. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II ended during the Lane Victory's first voyage carrying supplies to 
American troops in the Pacific. After the war, the ship was operated by 
American President Lines, carrying cargo around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948 the ship was mothballed, but was recalled to service in the Korean 
War.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory helped evacuate thousands of U.S. troops from the port of 
Hungnam while under Chinese and North Korean shelling and took them to relative 
safety farther south. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953 the Lane Victory went back into mothballs, but in 1966 it was recalled 
yet again to haul war supplies to Vietnam. It was mothballed for the third time 
in 1973, after a total of 31 voyages. Assigned to the National Defense Reserve 
Fleet near San Francisco, it was one of many old ships kept on hand in case of 
another war. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of the ships in the reserve fleet, however, the Lane Victory was 
kept in relatively good shape as a "show ship" for the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II president Vernick and John 
O. Smith, vice president of the organization, persuaded Congress to give the 
group the ship for use as a maritime museum and memorial. In 1989 the Lane 
Victory was towed from San Francisco to the Port of Los Angeles -- to the 
consternation of port authorities, who were reluctant to give the old ship 
valuable berthing space. 
</P>
<P>
 After considerable political maneuvering by the veterans, the Lane Victory was 
finally given temporary space at Berth 53 in San Pedro. Hundreds of Merchant 
Marine veterans and other volunteers spent hundreds of thousands of hours and 
almost $1 million fixing up the old ship. In 1991, the Lane Victory was named a 
National Historic Landmark. In addition to a museum commemorating the U.S. 
Merchant Marine, the ship, which is open to the public, also serves as 
headquarters for the Merchant Marine veterans group. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after passing rigorous Coast Guard inspections, the Lane Victory went 
to sea again under its own power for the first time in almost two decades, 
taking about 700 passengers on a daylong cruise off Catalina Island. Since then 
it has made 10 such cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Merchant Marine veterans started thinking about Normandy, where 
thousands of American veterans will convene on June 6 to commemorate the day in 
1944 when American, British, Canadian and other Allied troops staged the 
largest amphibious landing in history. The Allied landing on the shores of 
occupied France, coupled with advances by forces of the then-Soviet Union on 
Germany's eastern front, was the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler and the 
Nazi German domination of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started talking about this trip about a year and a half ago," said 
Vernick, 80, a North Hollywood resident. "We never had any doubt the ship could 
make the trip. This ship is in as good a shape as it was when it was built. The 
problem was raising the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a ship on an 18,000-mile, four-month voyage is an expensive 
proposition, especially when the ship burns a barrel of fuel -- 42 gallons -- 
per mile. Going through the Panama Canal costs $16,000 each way for a ship the 
Lane Victory's size; food for the crew costs about $100,000. All told, the 
group needed more than $1 million in fuel, equipment, supplies and cash to make 
the Normandy trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, Arco, Exxon, Texaco and Mobil oil companies donated some fuel and cash, 
and the Stouffer company donated some frozen food. The Long Beach Naval 
Shipyard donated about 2,000 tons of concrete ballast needed to stabilize the 
ship. The Port of Los Angeles contributed $16,000 for Panama Canal transit 
fees. Members of the Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II and countless 
other individuals and smaller companies donated money and services. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't enough. As late as last week the Merchant Marine veterans 
weren't sure if they'd be able to go. Then the Kenneth T. and Eileen L. Norris 
Foundation of Long Beach, a philanthropic organization founded by an important 
World War II munitions manufacturer, heard about the Lane Victory's plight and 
stepped in with a $250,000 donation. That put the veterans over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took some luck and some guts, and a little bluffing," Smith, 83, of Seal 
Beach said of raising the money. "But we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who has worked hard to make the Lane Victory ready could make the 
trip. There were more volunteers than there were spaces for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part is deciding who gets to go," said Chief Engineer Peter 
Jacobelly, 72, a Harbor City resident who spent 46 years at sea as a merchant 
seaman before retiring 10 years ago. The ones chosen, he said, were "the guys 
who worked here longest and hardest." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Merchant Marine veterans had health problems that kept them from 
going. Vernick, for example, who still suffers ill effects from the beriberi he 
developed while interned by the Japanese in the Philippines in World War II, 
plans to fly to England and rendezvous with the ship for the D-day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 And not all the spouses of the old sailors are eager to see them go. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is mad as a cat," says Capt. Tilghman, who retired as an oil tanker 
captain just two years ago. "But it's always been like that. Every time I come 
home it's a honeymoon, and every time I go back to sea it's almost a divorce. 
But I wouldn't miss this trip for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wives, on the other hand, won't have to stand on the dock and wave 
goodby. Five women who put in many long hours helping fix up the Lane Victory 
are making the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always bitched about the men having all the fun," said Mary Stahl, 59, 
of San Pedro, whose husband, Ron Stahl, 67, participated in the D-day invasion 
as a young merchant seaman. "Now it's my chance to have some too." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to experience what my husband did," said Mary Anne Struyk, 68, from 
Downey, whose 71-year-old husband John, a former Merchant Marine sailor, also 
is making the voyage. "Besides, we worked our fannies off to get on this trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone on the voyage is an old hand, either. The youngest member of the 
crew is Jim Watson, 32, a part-time hotel clerk from Redondo Beach. Although he 
never served in the Merchant Marine, he spent many hours helping to restore the 
Lane Victory, and subsequently got his seaman's papers. He is assigned as a 
utility man in the galley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor that they're letting me go along," Watson said. "And I think 
this is one of the best crews you could have. I mean, look at all the years of 
experience they have -- and years, and years, and years. I really admire and 
respect these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 So the men -- and women -- of the Lane Victory head to sea again, for what 
Vernick calls "their last hurrah." In a pre-voyage interview, Tilghman probably 
summed up the feelings of most of the Lane Victory crew members when he quoted 
some lines from "The Ship That Never Sailed," a poem he learned in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather feel the sting of strife, where storms are born and tempests roar/ 
Than settle down to an empty life, and rot in dry-dock on the shore." Lane

FREEDOM FLIERS TO JOIN D-DAY CEREMONIES; ANNIVERSARY: AVIATORS WILL PILOT WORLD 
WAR II PLANES DURING TWO-WEEK TRIP TO EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The crew of the cargo ship Lane Victory isn't the only group trying to make a 
sentimental journey from the South Bay to Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four World War II aircraft are scheduled to leave Hawthorne Municipal 
Airport on May 17 to participate in ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of 
D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Flight will take a handful of aviators on a two-week trip to 
Europe with stops in the United States, Canada, Iceland and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the crew of the Lane Victory has struggled to organize its voyage, 
flight planners said they have faced adversity at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers had assembled 16 cargo carriers, bombers and fighters to be flown 
by American civilians over the beaches of Normandy on June 6.  
</P>
<P>
 But late last week, French officials announced plans to ban all civilian 
flights on the Normandy coast June 5 to 7, organizers said. As a result, most 
of the planes have bowed out of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress are protesting France's decision, but organizers hold 
little hope for a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they gave us permission at this point, we wouldn't have enough time 
to put things back together," said Robert Lumbard, a chief organizer of the 
flight.

 The French decision is not the only problem to dog the venture. Organizers 
said they had difficulty scraping together enough money for the trip, which 
they estimated would cost $2 million. They had collected $1.1 million in 
donations, most of which will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disappointing," said Lumbard, 58, a retired teacher who lives in 
Pomona. "The flight was to honor the American veterans and soldiers who died 
for us in World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Lumbard was just a boy when the Allied troops stormed the beaches of France in 
1944. Today, he owns a restored B-25 bomber that was to join the flight. But 
his hopes to participate were dashed last Thursday when the bomber blew an 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the remaining planes will fly on their own power to England. Two 
smaller aircraft will be shipped by cargo plane to reduce stress on the them 
and save time, Lumbard said. A fifth plane may also make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to set up camp at a British air base 50 miles north of London. 
From there, it will fly to D-day ceremonies in the first week of June.

 Zack's is named after a family cat with a big appetite. A pretty sophisticated 
cat, presumably. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the American Culinary Institute, Greg Gevurtz became a 
prominent player in the thriving Venice Beach restaurant scene. He cooked at 
the West Beach Cafe, helped open Rebecca's and became part owner at Hal's Bar 
and Grill. Ten months ago, along with his wife, Leslie, Gevurtz opened Zack's 
in Redondo Beach. In addition to serving contemporary American cuisine, it 
features a changing display of works by local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu at Zack's changes every week, although a few standbys are always 
available. One is an appetizer of duck wontons ($5.25) stuffed with duck confit 
-- pronounced cone-FEE , it's duck slowly cooked in its own fat -- mixed with 
cabbage, ginger, green onions and soy sauce. The resulting fried dumplings are 
served with a peach sauce emboldened with curry and chipotle chiles.  
</P>
<P>
 The soup of the week may be cream of tomato with basil and garlic croutons, or 
perhaps cream of golden squash with red bell peppers and dill ($2.50). 
</P>
<P>
 The two most popular main courses reveal the range of tastes among Zack's 
customers. One is veggie heaven ($9.50), a plate of grilled vegetables, mashed 
potatoes, rigatoni, sauteed spinach and couscous. The other is a meatloaf made 
with New York steak, pork, eggs and bread crumbs, served with tomato gravy, 
mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach ($10.50). The menu recently featured 
pan-roasted duck breast ($12.50), awash in a caramelized honey and prune sauce 
and accompanied by basmati rice with sunflower seeds and zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack's serves a $14 Sunday brunch with unlimited sparkling wine, a carafe of 
orange juice, a basket of breads and a choice of entree, such as smoked salmon 
eggs Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack's is at 800 S. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach. (310) 316-1081 . 
Tuesday through Thursday 5:30 to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday 5:30 to 11 p.m.; 
Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. , 5:30 to 10 p.m.

CELEBRITY PHOTOGRAPHER GETS COMFORTABLE WITH THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For photographer Amy Cantrell, making her subjects comfortable is the best way 
to get them to open up -- especially when the subjects are some of Hollywood's 
biggest celebrities. Cantrell, a free-lance photographer whose work has been 
featured on the covers of more than 75 issues of the magazine "Beverly Hills 
(213)," is showing many of her favorite photographs at the Vis a Vis Gallery in 
Redondo Beach through May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, "Celebrity Portraits," features famous Hollywood names such as Jane 
Wyman, James Earl Jones, George Burns and Dom DeLuise, in serious, 
straightforward portraits and also in some humorous poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell says her calm personality allows her subjects to relax and sometimes 
ham it up. "I let (the stars) do what they want, and they give me themselves," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the formal cover shots are taken, many stars have let Cantrell continue 
to take pictures. In some of the photos on display, Cantrell has captured 
screen and television actor Eddie Albert hanging out on a swing set with his 
family; actor James Coburn in a moment of horror, and actor James Earl Jones 
with his wife, actress Cecilia Hart, in a suggestive pose. "I didn't tell them 
to do that," Cantrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrity Portraits" can be seen at the gallery, 602 N. Pacific Coast 
Highway, Redondo Beach, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. Admission is free. Information: (310) 318-9090. JON

<P>
 The National Drama Company of Korea visits Los Angeles this week for a 
performance of the philosophical play "Pigo-jigo, Pigo-jigo" ("Bloom and 
Fade"). A portion of the proceeds will be donated to an earthquake relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama company, established in 1950, includes some of South Korea's most 
respected actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pigo-jigo, Pigo-jigo," written by Man-hee Lee and directed by Young-keol 
Kang, tells the story of three elderly men who ruminate on their lives, dreams 
and failures while robbing an ancient tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue is in Korean, but an English summary of the story will be 
provided, said Chris Sim, president of Special Educational Tour & Events, the 
organization coordinating the troupe's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The play opens Friday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 514 S. Spring St., 
and runs through Monday. Show times are 7 p.m. Friday and Monday, and 3 and 7 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Tickets, at $10, may be purchased at the door.

HOT LOUISIANA BANDS WILL SPICE UP '94 CAJUN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D. L. Menard, "the Cajun Hank Williams," will headline the 1994 Southern 
California Cajun & Zydeco Festival June 4-5 at the Rainbow Lagoon, next to the 
Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Menard and his band, the Louisiana Aces, top a six-act lineup that includes 
Walter Mouton & the Scott Playboys who, according to the festival promoter, 
have played only one Saturday night concert outside their hometown of Scott, 
La., since the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also from Louisiana, accordionist Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys and Nathan 
& the Zydeco Cha-Chas will be making return appearances. The Poullard Brothers, 
from Texas, and Joe Simien, a Los Angeles transplant, round out the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Franklin Zawacki said he is going ahead with the eighth annual 
festival even though he lost about $40,000 last year because of heavy rain and 
competition from a Troubadours of Folk festival held at UCLA the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 While the odds are against a repeat of last year's unseasonable downpour, the 
Cajun & Zydeco festival will again coincide with the other festival, which has 
been renamed "Troubadours of Music and Crafts Festival." 
</P>
<P>
 Troubadour fest promoter Jim Rissmiller said he decided against changing the 
dates of his festival because he wants to establish it in fans' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the music, the Cajun & Zydeco festival will feature food booths 
from area restaurants plus dance, music and cultural workshops from 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. each day. Ticket prices have not been announced. Information is 
available from Comprehensive Child Development in Long Beach, which helps 
organize various events and receives some proceeds from the festival: (310)

THE MOUTH THAT ROARS; ANGELA JANKLOW HARRINGTON HAS A SUPER LINEAGE AND TALKS 
WITH THE SPEED OF A BULLET TRAIN. IS IT ANY WONDER THE TEEN MAGAZINE SHE 
FOUNDED IS AS HYPER AND IN YOUR FACE AS SHE IS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angela Janklow Harrington arrives for lunch wearing dangerously high 
platforms, clutching her magazine like a baby she's afraid will be snatched 
away. She's 15 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm not late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sense of timing is better than her sense of time. Harrington, 29, is the 
editor and creator of Mouth2Mouth, a new magazine aimed at male and female 
teens that celebrates the power of pop culture. Based in Beverly Hills, it is 
published by Time Inc. Ventures, a division of Time Warner that also puts out 
the hip-hop culture magazine Vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 Its launch comes as the teen and Generation X markets are in the spotlight via 
film ("Reality Bites," "Threesome"), television ("Blossom" and "Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air" and MTV) and music (pick a band, any band). 
</P>
<P>
 Mouth2Mouth is a supercharged mag that takes rap, grunge bands, fashion, 
celebrities and real-life stories and slams them down on every page, with 
cyberpunk-style graphics as busy as a New York City rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere issue, which arrived last month, reports from the set of Ice 
Cube's new video and travels with U2. From prison, Amy Fisher gives advice to 
the love-obsessed ("There is nothing to be gained from being in a rush to grow 
up, yet I know only too well how very much there is to lose"). There's "How to 
Spot Fake Breasts Without Squeezing," Leon Bing reporting on teens shipped off 
to psychiatric hospitals, a profile of actress Olivia d'Abo, and ratings of 
tooth-rottingly sweet breakfast cereals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Crawford and Shaquille O'Neal pose in a clinch on the cover. Inside they 
go one-on-one for a Q&A (Cindy: "How do you chill when you need to get away 
from it all?" Shaq: "I ride around in my truck."). 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling was that there was no magazine that was remotely like this," 
Harrington said at bullet-train speed. "In England, which is a tiny little 
island, there's a score of great, graphically explosive, wild, visual magazines 
that . . . take the kids seriously and there's good writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling was, what's out there for American teen-agers? Why are these smart 
kids, who are making choices and living their own lives, who know so much about 
the world, only being told they can twist their bun in 52 ways? It's just 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington sees this generation as more than dull-eyed Beavis and Butt-head 
almost-bes. She believes in the uniqueness of her product, wanting to pull in 
elements of Vanity Fair, National Lampoon and the late Spy -- that one "without 
the bile." 
</P>
<P>
 She has a commitment from Time Inc. Ventures for a second issue, due in the 
fall, but faces fierce competition for newsstand rack space, ad dollars and 
readers with the market-dominating Seventeen, plus Sassy, YM, Teen, and 
newcomers Quake and Tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the other magazines are not good," Harrington said. "They're just 
different. They're clearly gender-specific. Smiling sirens running in the surf. 
That's the concept. Sassy is very, very good, but it targets a certain kind of 
girl. It's very self-obsessed. I wanted to do an extroverted magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's at least as extroverted as Harrington herself, whose raucous laughter 
used to pierce the otherwise calm halls of Conde Nast. Mouth2Mouth's pumped-up, 
in-your-face style is part frenetically paced youth culture, part MTV, part 
Harrington herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bit wild for the office," she recalled with a grin. "I used to get in 
trouble a lot for fostering amusement. I'd never had a job except in the 
summers . . . and I want to have fun if I'm doing something.. . . I was told, 
'You're talking too loudly, you're running up and down the halls all the time. 
This is an office and you've got to calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's that hint of adolescence that keeps Harrington in touch with a 
generation 10 years her junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Lollapalooza, I saw 'Wayne's World,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But did she really want to go to Lollapalooza? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah! I was dying to go! What do I want to go see, Styx? I felt that kinship 
with this audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Other research included visiting schools, video arcades, batting cages and 
miniature golf courses -- anyplace teen-agers might congregate. This came 
during the three years she devoted to planning and executing the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also try to remember what it was like (when I was that age) because the 
soul of teen-agers doesn't change, really. . . . I think they want to be 
treated like adults, but you have to talk to them on their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every generation assumes that teen-agers are (stupid) because they don't seem 
to have any responsibilities. This generation has more than the others -- they 
do the family shopping because the parents are both working or divorced. But 
this is not a magazine that's going to be oriented toward their problems. You 
can slalom from serious to funny, but not tip over. They're thinking, 'Why 
would I want to be bummed out? I'm already bummed out. I want to be amused.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Launching a magazine is a pretty bold move for anyone, given the dismal 
prognosis for almost any new publication. Her prior magazine experience 
consisted of five years at Vanity Fair (1985 to 1990) and a quick temping stint 
at Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrington's gene pool foreshadowed bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father is Morton Janklow, the heavyweight New York literary agent whose 
clients include Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Taylor Bradford and Danielle Steel. Her 
mother, Linda Janklow, chairman of New York's Lincoln Center Theater, is the 
daughter of famed director/producer Mervyn LeRoy ("The Wizard of Oz" "Quo 
Vadis?" "No Time for Sergeants," "Gypsy," "Little Women"). His father-in-law -- 
Angela's great-grandfather -- was no slouch, either. He was Harry Warner, one 
of the founders of Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 She married Gerry Harrington, a personal manager, in 1991, in a wedding whose 
star-studded guest list included Barbara Walters, Michael Ovitz, Si Newhouse, 
Norman Mailer and Bob Dylan's son, Jesse. 
</P>
<P>
 Princeton educated, she's an accomplished equestrian, was Vanity Fair's 
youngest columnist and worked in development for producer Ray Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 She's aware that some might take her for a dilettante breezing through life on 
a stellar bloodline and a fat trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But she credits her parents with instilling in her a 300-horsepower drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is a family of immigrants," she said. "You must succeed. That's 
part of your DNA if you're from an immigrant family. Everyone else did, and if 
you don't, you're, like, derailing the progress of an entire family. My family 
expected and wanted me to be successful and not in a way that was crushing. My 
father wanted us to be successful because he liked being successful. He thought 
it was better, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are two Angela Janklow Harringtons: the graduate of Princeton, and the 
graduate of bar-tending school. 
</P>
<P>
 The champion equestrian, and the veteran nightclubber who once kept only 
vampire's hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The supremely confident publishing entrepreneur, and the effervescent blonde 
who freaks out when a magazine photo reveals more thigh than she'd like ("Is 
that the worst picture in the history of the world? Is that what I look 
like?"). 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote her college thesis on "The Victory of Civilization in Shakespeare's 
'The Tempest' and the Fiction of Joseph Conrad," yet scrawls in red ink on her 
left hand the names of people she has to call back. 
</P>
<P>
 She's keenly aware of these contrasts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my kind of, ah, noise and lunacy or whatever, people can be misled 
into thinking that I'm (like that)," she said. "I like it because it's 
disarming. It's an alias. Mata Hari is one of my idols. But it's very easy to 
break. I can present that side, and through one word I can change it, so it 
also amuses me. I can change it with one flick of the brush." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one associate: "Underestimate Angela at your own risk." 
</P>
<P>
 To Princeton pal Paul Price, "She was Auntie Mame. She would always drag me 
along to parties and clubs because she always had the better invitation. I'd go 
and stare at the lights at the Palladium and she would just laugh at me. She 
was always very interested in who was behind the club, why they have influence 
over the people who are wrapped up in it, who the photographers were, the 
organizers." 
</P>
<P>
 Price recalled that Harrington revealed her family connections only after they 
had been friends for a couple of years. "It just came out that her grandfather 
was involved with the 'Wizard of Oz.' I said, 'I can't believe you didn't tell 
me that!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vanity Fair contributing editor Bob Colacello plucked Harrington from relative 
obscurity at Princeton and brought her to the attention of then-editor Tina 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was basically very mature and wise for her age, but she has a real 
childish, bubble gum side to her," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was featured in Colacello's "Voices of Princeton" story in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tina said, 'You've got to eliminate the quotes from your agent's daughter.' 
(Janklow has been Colacello's agent since 1982.) But she said, 'I want to meet 
her, I want to hire her. She sounds so intelligent and funny, just right for 
Vanity Fair.' 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Harrington's job there included keeping tabs on night life and pop 
culture, scouting profile candidates and keeping the writers and editors 
plugged in to life on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But after two years, restlessness settled in and she planned a trip 
re-creating writer Conrad's travels through Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to bar-tending school so that if I needed to work I wouldn't have to 
rely on the world's oldest profession or anything," Harrington said. "But it 
was really difficult because I don't drink and I couldn't define the drinks by 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown wasn't too hot on the Asia trip and persuaded her to move to Los 
Angeles instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me to go for a couple of weeks and see what I could dig up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually dug up a new life for herself, enamored of L.A.'s schizo mix of 
glitz and grit. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of Vanity Fairing in Los Angeles, she went to work in 
development for veteran producer Stark (she knew his daughter Wendy Stark 
Morrissey, Vanity Fair's Los Angeles editor). But the slow pace wasn't for 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was around movie people at Vanity Fair, and I thought I should try (the 
business). I thought my strengths would funnel happily into that medium. But 
there was no movie in production while I was there, and I found it not as 
stimulating as I would have hoped. Even if a movie's in hyper-drive it's not 
going to match the momentum of a magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she decided to work on her magazine concept full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazines in L.A. weren't what I wanted to do," she said. "If I was going 
to (work on one), I had to make it mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later she started shopping it to various publishers. A consultant 
she'd hired, John Klingel, also worked in new magazine development for Time 
Inc. and suggested they take a look at her mock-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Would nepotism rear its ugly head now? 
</P>
<P>
 "She made the decision that this was something she wanted to do on her own," 
Morton Janklow said. "I pointed out that I could call somebody at the top who 
as a courtesy would call downstairs, and that would be counterproductive. And 
that was her instinct as well." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled that her precociousness was evident early on. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always full of ideas," he said. "When she was about 15 she wrote an 
outline for a book she wanted to write called 'Split Ends,' which was the story 
of a 15-year-old sophisticated girl, kind of an Eloise in New York, and it was 
hilariously funny and there was a publisher who was (interested in it)." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Inc. Ventures liked the idea and has spent $1 million launching 
Mouth2Mouth, which has earned mixed reactions within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 YM publisher Vicci Lasdon said she admires Harrington "for taking the chance. 
In terms of the marketplace today, it's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 But she's also not sure whether one magazine can appeal to both young men and 
young women and found the premiere issue of Mouth2Mouth heavily skewed to 
males. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much so that there are so many pieces in the magazine that are 
challenging to women," Lasdon said, "and there are some elements that do 
degrade young women. Like the one on how to tell if fake breasts are real. I 
think that most young women wouldn't be so totally engaged by that. The fashion 
(a swimsuit layout done over computer-game graphics) seemed to come from a male 
perspective. I think showing a woman in a black patent leather bikini and 
fishnet stockings is not going to appeal to young women. . . . (The teen years 
are) a period of great exploration, and I don't know that young men and women 
have the same questions or the same perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jon Katz, media critic for New York magazine, finds Mouth2Mouth more 
geared toward hunk-struck young women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll have a lot more luck with girls than with boys," he said. 
"Young men don't read that much about stars, pop culture and fashion. They're 
really into music, and this still feels to me like a magazine for young women. 
But it's very appealing in a lot of ways. It's a little goofier than Sassy and 
more celebrity-driven. It's also funny and inventive and has a lot of attitude 
about it, too, like the story by Amy Fisher. The pop culture stuff is very 
cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mouth2Mouth's offices Harrington is plotting her next issue. For issue two 
she hired two new top editors, a move that "was not unusual" according to 
Gilbert Rogin, editor-at-large for Time Inc. Ventures, since the first test 
issue had a temporary staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Her chocolate Labrador, Bosco, wanders the halls and occasionally saunters 
back in her office to slop up some water. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington is happy that some celebrities have already expressed interest in 
being in the next issue. But she still has to fill out her staff and generate 
stories. 
</P>

PRINTS OF THE CITY; IT'S THE HEAT, BABY. HIGH-TEMPERATURE TECHNOLOGY PLUS NEW 
FIBERS, INKS AND DYES MAKE DESIGNS SUCH AS FLAMES ROAR TO LIFE ON FABRICS THAT

 The moment Jean Paul Gaultier's prints on sheer stretch fabrics arrived this 
spring in local stores, cash registers began to sing the hallelujah chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the leggings and T-shirts that leave the impression of a full body tattoo 
are almost gone. And so are the loose tunics and pants covered in African 
prints by Yohji Yamamoto, and the stretchy tank and slip dresses imbued with 
flames and aspens by Todd Oldham. 
</P>
<P>
 When the latter images first appeared on a New York runway last fall, they 
were powerful -- and uncomfortably timely. Oldham's photo-sharp flames 
coincided with the Malibu wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaultier, who showed his spring collection in Paris, also seemed to have Los 
Angeles in mind. His Ts, ripped and shredded just for the runway show to reveal 
the models' real tattoos, made it hard to distinguish where the shirts ended 
and the skin began. Where bodies are buff, second-skin clothing is second 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But the secret to these garments' selling success is their evocative prints -- 
the result of recent innovations in fabric manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new designs rely on heat-transfer printing, a process in use since the 
'70s to produce flame-resistant children's PJs, among other things. In the past 
few years, that technology has combined with new fibers, new ink and dye 
combinations and computer-generated images to create extremely intricate, 
multicolored printed fabrics, as well as fabrics that look like molten metal. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have been dynamic enough to lure high-end designers back to 
polyester. Yes, the same nasty leisure-suit fiber that gave all synthetics a 
skanky name is behind most of these printed fabrics. But it has been refined, 
rewoven and renamed micro-fiber. DuPont was the first to introduce "micro 
denier polyester" in the United States in 1990. Its brand, Micromattique, now 
has a slew of competitors, says company representative Eleanor Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft, silky and as light as gossamer, micro-fiber takes to prints like Ansel 
Adams. It can be woven into anything from stretchy velvets to translucent 
sheers. New dyes with colorfast pigments, often combined with inks, permeate 
the strands and enable these extremely sheer fabrics, or heavily textured ones, 
to be printed. And only the most sensitive fingers can detect the petrochemical 
slickness that exposes micro-fiber's lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of heat-transfer printing on sheer fabrics, such as French designer 
Gaultier's, is in the way it saturates fibers. "It doesn't crack or disappear 
when the fabric stretches," says Jim Stewart, manager of trend direction for 
Hoechst Celanese, an international fabric manufacturer. In contrast, the 
previous generation of print dyes sat on top of fabric like a scab and worked 
only on a narrow range of fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve his flame print, New York-based Oldham took Polaroids of a campfire 
in his native Texas and sent the photos to his San Francisco-based graphic 
designer, who enhanced them on a computer. The tweaked art was then filmed, and 
the transparency sent to Holt Manufacturing in Burlington, N.C., where it 
became a paper transfer. (A crude form of paper transfers are T-shirt 
iron-ons.) The flames -- in full color on paper transfers -- were then applied 
to pre-cut fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prints can be engineered to a cut piece. If a customer wants a print or a 
stripe to fall on a garment in a certain place, we can engineer the stripes to 
always fall on that particular spot," says Holt representative David Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper-transfer process is also used by Mia Manners and Richard Sharpe, 
transplanted Londoners who have set up shop in San Francisco under the label 
Deep Space Time. The duo has perfected a holographic transfer print, with 
graphic images similar to those on credit cards. Their molten silver fabric 
twinkles with a thousand three-dimensional reflections. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono of the band U2 wore a Deep Space Time holographic suit on tour last year, 
and several British bands have adopted the look for their stage gear.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our fabric is very connected to the dance and techno music scene," says 
Manners, who uses her holographic heat transfers on rayons, velvets, heavy 
fleece and cotton knits. "It works best under bright, bright lights, like disco 
lights or sunlight," she says, "and it would be most spectacular on ski wear 
and swim suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Her vision of silver swimwear is right on. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past week the phone began ringing," says Thadine Haner, a Los 
Angeles-based textile stylist for North Carolina fabric manufacturer Guilford 
Mills. "It was swimwear manufacturers looking for any fabric that has shine and 
silver."  
</P>
<P>
 While such evening-wear fabrics as velvets, silks, satins and metallics are 
scaling down into the sportswear realm, Stewart says, silks are being printed 
to look like tweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat transfers, he adds, "are an easy way for designers to do a fun print." 
</P>
<P>
 The method is being employed at all price levels of fabric manufacturing. But 
graphically innovative designs are just beginning to show up in the high-end 
market, so the trickle-down effect will take awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's job is to predict the future of fashion, and he is willing to gaze 
into his crystal ball to see when moderately priced yet graphically interesting 
prints will arrive. "We'll start to see it by next fall, but it will really 
pick up for fall of '95," he says.

<P>
 I got a letter the other day from my friend Ben Cohen, the Ben of Ben & 
Jerry's Ice Cream. I'm assuming we're friends, since Ben addressed the letter 
"Dear Friend" -- even though we've never met, and even though I prefer 
Haagen-Dazs coffee to his politically correct flavors, such as "Cherry Garcia" 
or "Funky Chunky Donkey Meat," the one made out of free-range mule milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben wrote to solicit clients for Working Assets, a private phone company that 
will give 1% of your long distance charges to "environmental and social change 
groups." The clue that Ben was talking about liberal groups came in the next 
paragraph, which proudly said: "Working Assets is the only phone company that 
prints its bills on unbleached, 100% post-consumer recycled paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Most other phone companies, I gather, print their bills on paper cut from 
trees illegally poached from old-growth forests and use ink made from the blood 
of the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben wrote that if I switched to his company, he'd give me 60 free minutes of 
calls, presumably to the ACLU, and a pint of ice cream. (I'm torn between 
"Anise Joplin," a licorice swirl endorsed by Planned Parenthood, and "Great 
Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts," a nouveau pistachio.) 
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued by the letter's mention of a "Free Speech Day." On Mondays, I 
could make free calls to targeted political and business leaders and chew them 
out for some unspeakable act of theirs -- like putting iceberg lettuce in a 
Caesar salad. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this month's targets is the Florida Citrus Commission for hiring Rush 
Limbaugh to hawk orange juice. I guess things must be real slow in the protest 
movement. I mean, Limbaugh may be a pain in the patootie, but he's not Hitler. 
What is so terrible about him endorsing citrus fruits? Conservatives should get 
scurvy? 
</P>
<P>
 The other target is Pat Schroeder. They want her to sponsor a bill to make 
some guy stop cutting down trees somewhere. I don't care if the call is free, I 
don't want to talk to Pat Schroeder. In fact, I'll go with any long distance 
company that promises I'll never have to talk to Pat Schroeder. Or Pat Boone. 
Or Pat Sajak. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of my friendship with Ben, I thought about switching over. But I 
worried: What if my operator was Che Guevara? What if one day I decided I liked 
school prayer? Would I get all static on my line? 
</P>
<P>
 The point of all this is the politicization of everything.  
</P>
<P>
 You pick a phone company based on ideology? I am so out of it. (I picked 
Sprint because I thought they would help me speed dial.) This started with 
credit cards. Because they were all the same, they needed a gimmick. So one 
offered a minuscule amount of cash back. Another offered frequent flier miles. 
Another offered hotel points. It sort of snowballed. I have a Visa card that 
earns me global points toward a papal indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express introduced the concept of "guilty conscience" to charge 
cards. It promised to make a donation to feed the hungry when you used the 
card. This let you buy a coat made from the skin of gorilla fetuses and feel as 
though you had done something noble. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? If you buy a washer at Sears, could you get them to pledge that 
the silver-beaked Moluccan scoot frog will be saved from extinction? 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, I see myself going into a luncheonette. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like a tuna sandwich on white toast." 
</P>
<P>
 "No tuna. They catch dolphin in those nets. We don't go for that." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, a BLT." 
</P>
<P>
 "No bacon. You should see how they treat the pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, just lettuce and tomato." 
</P>
<P>
 "No lettuce and tomato. Migrant workers are exploited." 
</P>
<P>
 "A cup of coffee then?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope. It's from Colombia. Drug cartel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tea?" 
</P>
<P>
 "China. Human rights violations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have thought of that when you came in here."

 Craig Pylant of Canoga Park says he grew up at a busy intersection in 
Chatsworth. He remembers sitting on his front lawn one summer day: 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer in a patrol car was waiting patiently for the light to turn 
green when a middle-aged woman tried to beat the adjacent yellow light. She 
gunned her motor but upon seeing the cop, slammed on her brakes and slid 
sideways into the intersection, stopping directly in front of the patrol car.  
</P>
<P>
 I could see the terrified look on her face. That changed to relief when the 
officer got out of his car, walked into the intersection and, in the best form 
of a baseball umpire, signaled "safe."  
</P>
<P>
 Then he then got back in his car and drove away.

 G oing, going . . . well, we're not going to the Las Vegas Hilton on June 18 
and 19 when Butterfield & Butterfield presents the largest collection of Elvis 
Presley memorabilia ever to be offered at auction. But we've sure been poring 
over the slick brochure touting its preview May 4 through 8 at the auctioneers' 
Los Angeles showroom. Fascinating. How much would you bid on The King's 
American Express card? His Mercedes Benz 600 limo?  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: OK, let's say I had a mil to spend on Elvis retro stuff. What would I go 
for? The platinum and diamond wedding band from his marriage to Priscilla at 
the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas on May 1, 1967. How sad that Priscilla and Lisa 
Marie let it go. I know -- now it belongs to '50s recording star Jimmy Velvet, 
founder of the Elvis Presley Museum Inc. But I'd give a million for it in a 
minute. (Priscilla and Lisa Marie: Buy it back!) It's my kind of jewelry -- 
perfectly simple and simply studded with diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I agree with your exhortation to Priscilla and Lisa Marie, but for a 
different reason. I just don't see the appeal of wearing jewelry or, 
particularly, clothes that some celebrity or other has worn. Every now and 
then, for instance, a dress that Marilyn Monroe wore on her honeymoon with Joe 
DiMaggio or something goes on the block, and a certain percentage of the 
population goes ga-ga. 
</P>
<P>
 When are we going to quit living vicariously through celebrities? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Hey, lighten up! You're not even tempted to bid on Elvis' royal blue good 
luck jumpsuit and signature concert scarves? Think of how cool you'd look at 
your rehearsals with the Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, I couldn't help but notice how much good luck it brought him. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there is one item in the lot that looks kind of appealing: an Elvis 
tour jacket. It's red and black and looks just like a high school letterman's 
jacket, with leather sleeves and a big script "Elvis In Concert" across the 
left chest. Worn by Elvis roadies. Cooler by far than anything my high school 
ever handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I wouldn't mind seeing his white leather concert belt under my Christmas 
tree. It's medium-wide, shot with gold studs and red stones. Every couple of 
inches there's a small gold medallion framed in gold rings. A double strand of 
gold chains accent the bottom. I'd sling it around a pair of blue jeans, toss 
on boots and a white T-shirt and beg you to take me on the Eagles reunion tour. 
</P>
<P>
 His famous glittered black and white Phoenix belt ain't bad either. Talk about 
a fashionable rise from the ashes! 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Let's see. Your waist is . . . how big? And Elvis' waist was . . . HOW 
BIG? What are you going to do with the 15 yards of belt you're going to have to 
remove to make it fit? Maybe you could convert the extra into a couple of 
shoulder harnesses for your car. 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to remember that these are not exactly daintily wide belts 
either. Elvis favored the kind of belts that could blot out the sun. They made 
those championship belts that prize fighters wear look sleek and tasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing: These belts are heavy. After an evening in one of them you can 
be pretty sure you'll be about three inches shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Never mind the details. I'm dreaming, remember? There's a diamond, gold 
and enamel zodiac pendant that would make a great hood ornament. That's one 
item I can pass on. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a tiny gold pendant I'd love -- the one blazing the initials TCB 
(Taking Care of Business). I want it. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: First of all, I don't think that pendant is tiny. Nothing Elvis wore was 
tiny. And the design is something a bit more than the initials TCB: There's 
also what appears to be a two-inch lightning bolt attached. And it appears to 
be a really sharp lightning bolt. So bid on it if you must (bring lots and lots 
of money), but I don't want to hear you walking around yelping "Ouch!" every 10 
feet when the pendant digs in and takes care of your business. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, all this stuff is new Elvis, as opposed to old Elvis. And you remember 
how that battle came out with the stamp, right? How about selling off one of 
The King's old Army shirts, with "Presley" on the chest? Or one of those cool 
nubby sport coats he wore when he was just starting out? Or a pair of two-toned 
loafers? Or a bottle of '50s-style hair goop? 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla can keep the ring. I'll max out my credit cards for an aloha shirt 
from one of those beach movies. That I'd wear.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The clutter on Dr. Blake Kuwahara's birch desk suggests that he's something of 
a nature lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Delicate eye wear inspired by twigs, pebbles, seashells and leaves litters his 
work space and the surrounding shelves. One pair of frames, its sidepieces 
sculpted out of metal in the form of uneven bamboo, rests on the bridge of the 
creator's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The glasses make up an eco-driven unisex collection called Gaia, named for the 
Greek goddess of nature and sold under the Kata label. Kuwahara, a doctor of 
optometry-turned-designer, developed the artful line in 1992 while working for 
Culver City-based Wilshire Designs, one of the nation's top eye-wear makers. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, he launched a second Kata collection called Evos (evocative and 
evolutionary) that combines precious metals and colored plastics in sensuous 
variations on the oval. While Gaia seeks to call attention to the simplest -- 
and often neglected -- forms of nature, Evos aims to capture the human spirit 
as expressed through movement, the designer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word kata has to do with the old Japanese sense of aesthetics and 
appreciation for real simple lines and forms, and also the greater respect for 
nature," says Kuwahara, 33, who grew up in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton Gaines, manager of the Optical Shop of Aspen on Melrose Avenue and an 
early Kata supporter and vendor, says the label succeeds because the frames are 
unusual yet wearable. "Customers think it's different in the sense that it has 
a nature theme. . . . But it's subtle, not overbearing and flamboyant." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaia and Evos lines are pricey, from $250 to $400, and are sold only 
through such specialty retailers as the Optical Shop of Aspen, Senses in Santa 
Monica, the Eyes Have It in Sherman Oaks and Barneys New York in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwahara says he hopes to keep Kata, a growing $3-million business, small. And 
although he is a nature lover, he's not out to capitalize on concern for the 
environment. More philosopher than philanthropist, Kuwahara says he simply 
wants to illustrate through an inanimate object the relationship between man 
and Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Kata designs incorporate a raw edge or a deliberate and distinguishable 
flaw to illustrate this delicate balance. "Like the human face itself. For 
example, the right temple is not necessarily a mirror image of the left," the 
designer says. And some of his frames change from side to side; on the right 
may be a temple tip, on the left, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is meaning in what some might consider Kuwahara's madness. "I'm trying 
to show the irregularity in nature -- there are no straight lines. The 
collection attempts to show a little bit of that asymmetry by combining 
elements that are very textural, very dimensional but not necessarily 
balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of making eye wear more than a device to improve vision is 
relatively new. In the mid-'70s, Gloria Vanderbilt, Gucci and Christian Dior 
began putting their signatures on thick plastic frames and calling them 
fashion. The $13-billion eye-wear business continued to expand throughout the 
'80s, when such entertainers as Elton John turned frames into a two-ring 
circus. Kuwahara says the current design trend is toward conservative yet 
elegant frames featuring smaller oval and geometric lenses. In the austere 
'90s, quality and value have replaced designer cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now head designer for Wilshire Designs, Kuwahara also creates eye wear under 
such moderately priced labels as Liz Claiborne, Camp Beverly Hills and 
Jordache. He says he never set out to be an eye-wear designer, let alone an 
emerging force in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first year at UCLA was really tracked to be a dentist," he says, adding 
that he enjoyed the research requirements but ultimately winced at the idea of 
"looking down patients' mouths." He toyed with the thought of becoming an 
interior designer -- but worried about the financial rewards. He finally 
settled on optometry because it offered a creative outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really isn't another medical field that has the retail aspects to it, 
like optometry has with selling eye wear. And I really enjoy the fashion 
(part)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, school of 
optometry in 1986, Kuwahara went to work as a junior partner for the Manhattan 
Beach Vision Group, with optometry offices in the South Bay. He quickly 
discovered that he didn't enjoy seeing patients as much as he did working in 
the company's dispensary and overseeing the eye-wear buyers. So when Wilshire 
Designs advertised in the newspaper for an in-house designer and fashion 
forecaster, he mailed off his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't interested at all," he recalls. "They thought, 'What would an 
optometrist want with a position like this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he persuaded company owner Dick Haft to take a chance on him. "I saw a 
certain style in Blake," Haft says. "And his thoughts about what he'd like to 
accomplish really reached me. I know (for him) the job as an optometrist was 
like working in a black hole, and I could see he wanted to emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 On-the-job training started immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was like a fish out of water," Kuwahara says. "I didn't really 
have the tools to do anything." He attended the huge trade show Vision Expo to 
meet vendors and get a feel for the market, manufacturing and importing. Soon 
afterward, he started designing the Liz Claiborne line, then other labels. At 
the end of his second year, he joined other in-house designers and marketers in 
conceiving Kata. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, it was a group effort between my father, my wife and Blake," says 
Russ Haft, Dick Haft's son and president of Eyota, the distribution arm for 
Kata. "But clearly Blake has emerged as the creative force of the product."

 "Decorating your home is like good sex," Susan Ashbrook says. It takes a lot 
of time and patience to get it just right. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled objects throughout her two-bedroom, Craftsman-style bungalow in 
Venice were found over many years -- on routine scouting missions to garage 
sales, thrift shops and flea markets. They add up to the kind of place where 
friends and house guests linger. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ashbrook, a publicist for the Donahue Group in Beverly Hills, was in her 
20s, "Everything was about instant gratification." Now in her 30s, "I have the 
patience to wait for something great." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her most memorable finds are a gaggle of American-made green vases with 
identical glazes from the 1930s, and a vanity plucked from a thrift shop near 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift shopping takes a strong commitment, says Ashbrook, who does "drive-bys" 
of her favorite spots almost daily. But, above all, it requires confidence in 
your personal style. When she left one shop with a bunch of glass grapes 
rendered in the form of a lamp, people laughed, pronouncing it exceptionally 
ugly. If only they could see it now -- wired to illuminate her garden. Sources

BY DESIGN; STYLES FOR THE 'THIRD AGE'; A FASHION EXPERTHIONERT SHOWS THE 
FORGOTTEN 50-PLUS SET HOW TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chic, gray-haired maven was on a mission. "The fashion world hasn't kept 
up with us," she told 75 women seated on white plastic patio chairs. "You open 
any fashion magazine, and where are you?" Nowhere, they all silently agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jacqueline Murray, Minneapolis-based author and international fashion 
consultant, was at the new Target in Pasadena recently to preach change. 
Evangelically cloaked in a black over-blouse piped with a thin white collar, 
she led a lively show-and-tell sermon titled "The Third Age: When the Kids Are 
Gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The "age" covers "people 50 and up," explained Murray, a frequent flier for 
Dayton Hudson, Target's parent company. "And it's not an automatic retirement 
period. It's just rethinking your values, deciding how you're going to live and 
spend your time." With a coquettish shake of her shoulder-length silver hair, 
Murray would admit only to being "between 50 and 80. That's good, don't you 
think? Because there is a need to diffuse this labeling by age." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocating mix-and-match minimalism, she put her arms a yard apart and said 
that is all the closet space she needs. Unfortunately, the sophisticated 
pantsuits, blazers, skirts and day-to-evening dresses she wanted for her 
demonstration were in short supply, thanks to a buying frenzy.  
</P>
<P>
 So she dressed a model in casual clothing: linen-cotton walking shorts 
($11.99) and cotton-polyester drawstring pants ($14.99), short-sleeve silk 
T-shirts ($10.99), multicolored Guatemalan jacket ($19.99) and vest ($12.99), 
long rayon print dress ($34.99), print scarves ($5.99), woven leather belt 
($7.99), straw hat ($4.99), and an incredibly versatile pair of leather 
sling-back sandals ($18.99). 
</P>
<P>
 The peripatetic silk T was at its best worn several sizes too large, so the 
sleeves were longer, combined with two silk broomstick skirts -- black layered 
over khaki. The skirts went through several moves, with the black one ending up 
under the model's arms as a strapless evening dress. 
</P>
<P>
 For 90 minutes, the Third Age women, many of them as chic as Murray, ate plump 
muffins and drank in advice ranging from wearing short skirts ("European women 
of any age do") to contacting company presidents to complain about styles ("It 
works best if 10 women sign the letter") to feeling as self-assured as any 
French female in a strapless dress. "She is out there with her wrinkles and her 
sunspots," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions ran from lukewarm to loving. Ruth Erskine, a youthful 67-year-old in 
a flax-colored pantsuit, dressy beige sweater, gold earrings and a flawless 
complexion, was in the ecstatic camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved being reminded how basic colors can be combined. And I loved that she 
said we could accept our age spots. She validates us," the retired secretary 
said, beaming. After listening to Murray, she was thinking about wearing short 
skirts -- "with opaque tights." 
</P>
<P>
 But former home economics teacher Joann Lynch objected to the short sleeves on 
the silk Ts, which would expose flab, and she wanted better tips. "We've all 
read these things," she complained.  
</P>
<P>
 Several women thought model Barbara Gallagher looked too young and too slim. 
Gallagher, a 57-year-old, Size 8 grandmother from Minneapolis, hotly contested 
the age issue, saying: "This is what 57 looks like."  
</P>
<P>
 Dressing as young as their daughters -- a concern raised by some women -- 
obviously didn't apply to tall, blond Gyl Roland, a 52-year-old image 
consultant without children. Wearing an oversize beige blazer, white T-shirt 
and slim white pants tucked inside high-tops, Roland claimed to be a devoted 
Target shopper.  
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to an "informative refresher course" for Norvell Short, an 
attractive 59-year-old who said she didn't have any trouble finding clothes. 
Unconcerned about flab, she was buying an armful of silk Ts and believed that 
Murray had overlooked the best tip of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise," said Short, lifting an imaginary weight.

FOR BARISH, SHOW TIME!; FASHION / INSIDE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a client list that includes Daryl Hannah, Annabella Sciorra, Cher and 
Laura Dern, designer Pamela Barish is hardly a newcomer to fashion. But she 
waited until the time was right to have her first show. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at Santa Monica's huge supper club Renaissance, the time was right. 
So was the place. And so were the clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 At ringside tables, Barish's celebrity friends and clients watched a 
fast-paced show that offered something for everyone: faux fur-trimmed skating 
dresses, baby-doll dresses that didn't make us want to puke, brocade overalls, 
pin-striped vests and matching pants, and seductive velvet robes. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregnant Rosanna Arquette, in a turquoise brocade dress, and her husband, 
club owner John Sidel, shared a front-row table with Dern, who watched the show 
wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a sapphire-blue velvet coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Terence Trent D'Arby, filmmaker Abel Ferrara, Donovan Leitch, Ted Field and 
actress Lori Petty showed up, as did a lively cross section of beautiful 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the black-clad members of a film crew crept like cats through the 
crowd. Barish's brother Jeff, a commercial director, was making a documentary 
about Barish and her work. Only when several of the models pranced around 
semi-nude backstage did one crew member falter. "I'm used to shooting beer 
commercials," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the show, Barish's 6-year-old son, Jake, wearing a brocade 
jacket, mounted the runway and presented his mom with a bouquet of white roses. 
Asked how she thought her first show went, a visibly relaxed Barish said, "You 
tell me!" Then she and longtime friend Hilary Beane, burst into a screeching, 
girl version of a high-five. 
</P>
<P>
 Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes: "The Hillary Clinton thing was terrific," Randy Kemper said 
before his weekend appearance at the reopened I. Magnin store in Woodland 
Hills. "America got to know me. But you've got to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Step One in the road to Kemper's new image was an expensive print-ad campaign 
featuring model Amber Valetta -- a woman about as un-Hillary as they come. Step 
Two was enticing a Hollywood clientele that now includes "Diane English and 
that crowd." Step Three was staging his first show at the New York collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper may have sent perky young thing Niki Taylor and curvy young thing 
Helena Christiansen down the runway, but he said he's really inspired by such 
women as "Marlene Dietrich and Amelia Earhart . . . really great women who had 
this menswear sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Not-So-Shocking Revelations: Powerful and moneyed friends of Calvin Klein were 
reportedly obsessed with halting the publication of "Obsessed," an unauthorized 
biography of the designer. Well, their worst nightmare arrives in L.A. 
bookstores this week and guess what? Authors Steven Gaines and Sharon Churcher 
suggest that Klein -- married to the former Kelly Rector -- is bisexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein supposedly had an affair with the late designer Perry Ellis, fell in 
love with straight men, summered in the Fire Island Pines on Long Island and 
paid for sex with men. Few people seem stunned by the so-called revelations.  
</P>
<P>
 "How shocking is it to learn that someone who designs dresses, sells cologne 
and plasters a skinny nude white girl and a white boy rapper in his underwear 
on bus shelters all over town may be bisexual?" said Newsday writer Frank 
DeCaro. 
</P>
<P>
 New Boys on the Block?: Speaking of Calvin Klein, the designer appears set to 
open his own Rodeo Drive boutique in the space next to Giorgio Armani. While 
Klein's people -- reeling, no doubt, over the bio -- didn't return calls this 
week, Beverly Hills merchants confirmed the move. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're thrilled by Klein's impending arrival, they're positively swooning 
over reports that Richard Tyler has come looking for a Rodeo Drive address. 
Happy Days are here again. 
</P>
<P>
 An Appetizing Design: During a lip-smacking chat with Isaac Mizrahi the other 
day, the subject was fashion but the subtext was food. Longtime Richard Tyler 
aficionado k.d. lang will switch to a Mizrahi ensemble for her performance at 
the May 5 AIDS Project L.A. benefit honoring the designer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cut-away tuxedo tail coat made from my favorite black wool mousse 
crepe," said Mizrahi by phone from New York. Which differs from a Tyler-style 
tux -- much the way "a chocolate cake your mom makes is completely different 
from a chocolate cake your aunt makes." Got it, Isaac.  
</P>
<P>
 Food, Mizrahi admits, soothes his frazzled nerves. "Last Sunday, I made a 
Syrian lunch for a few friends. It's so nice to just consider some beautiful 
leaves of spinach." But that's all he'll do between now and the big night, he 
vowed. "I have to look fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Your Own Daughters to Work: Because we mostly toil at home, our daughters 
already have front-row seats to that glamorous thing we call work. A workplace 
is a tiny dungeon littered with empty Red Hots boxes and cups of cold coffee. A 
dress code boomerangs between slept-in jeans and a toilette that takes longer 
than most events we attend. A salary , in case you happen to be reading, 
darlings, is an amount high enough to buy Mommy a pair of Stefan Kelian pumps 
but too low for child-size Doc Martens. Which brings us to the most important 
lesson in capitalism: to the worker go the spoils -- or something like that.

 You can't expect a practical-minded person to design workout wear in flowery 
prints or pastels. And, quite frankly, you can't expect a lot of women to break 
a real sweat clad in such froufrou. For women serious about exercise, there is 
Body from Mossimo. "It's aggressive, gritty, with an edge," says designer 
Mossimo Giannulli. His swimwear for her has been hailed for its forward style 
-- even celebrated on the cover and pages of Sports Illustrated. His signature 
Body line, which debuted in the fall, is getting equal acclaim. No wonder. 
"We're taking the great things from swimwear and adapting it to Body," he adds. 
Pictured: top, $25; shorts, $33.

 Blond Ambition 
</P>
<P>
 Attention fashion slaves: Stop fasting and grab that bottle of peroxide. The 
waif is out and full-figured blonds are in demand, says model agent Roger 
Canamar of Marian's in Costa Mesa. Apparently, finicky designers are bored with 
simplicity and going back to glamour. Especially doing well are fair-haired 
males with exotic features. "I have 10 blond men and they're all working," says 
Canamar. But before you reach for the steroids, take note: "It's not the big 
bodybuilder types anymore. (It's the) well-toned, healthy bodies that are in." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bag 
</P>
<P>
 It took the presence of more dads taking an active role in parenting, but 
finally someone has created a diaper bag that isn't covered with bunnies or 
bears. Weebok's nylon bags feature fold-out changing pads, removable plastic 
diaper holders and plenty of pockets. "Parents today are on the move -- both 
professionally and recreationally," says a spokesman. "We've created bags that 
integrate with their lifestyles." There are backpacks, totes, duffels and even 
executive-like attaches, priced from $38 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Acid Head 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of Retin A, without the side effects? The latest rage for 
better-looking skin is also safer: glycolic acid. A mild percentage of it 
"desiccates the bonds of dead cells on the skin surface, working slowly day 
after day exfoliating without irritating," notes Sylvie Hennessy, educational 
director of Pevonia International. "The benefits are a cleaner, smoother, 
healthier skin surface that's going to let every other skin-care product work 
better." Pevonia offers creams for face and hands (also with sunscreen), as 
well as Clarifyl, a line for adult problem skin, in fine salons and spas. ROSE

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: JOINED BY HIS PETIT PAL MADONNA

 The Scene: Tuesday's premiere of Warner Bros.' "With Honors" at the Directors 
Guild. This modest screening/reception was dwarfed by the arrival -- complete 
with obligatory incandescent paparazzi frenzy -- of Madonna. (She's a close 
friend of the director and performs the film's theme.) Perhaps the most 
accurate way to describe the evening would be: There was an appearance by 
Madonna that was accompanied by a movie premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Director Alek Keshishian, whose previous film was Madonna's 
"Truth or Dare" documentary; co-stars Joe Pesci, Brendan Fraser, Patrick 
Dempsey and Moira Kelly; producers Paula Weinstein and Amy Robinson; plus 800 
guests ("600 if the fire marshal is asking," said one organizer) including 
Dennis Hopper, Branford Marsalis, Debi Mazur, Pauly Shore, John Davis, Beth 
Swofford, and studio execs Rob Friedman and Barry Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Many were quite moved by the film. One guest described its theme -- 
Harvard students learning about life from a homeless person -- as "The Fisher 
King" meets "Dead Poets Society." Madonna said it made her cry. "There's 
something about the fragility of human life," she said. "To read an obituary 
and to think that, at the end of all this, it's just a paragraph on a page." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: For most guests it was after-work casual. As would be expected, 
Madonna was the fashion stand out. Her outfit suggested a harem dancer as seen 
by Vogue magazine: thick silver bracelets, a tight-fitting turquoise and 
magenta cropped top, bare-midriff (showing off a recently ring-pierced belly 
button) and a matching diaphanous silk skirt. "It was a Jasmine costume," said 
the mother of a 3-year-old "Aladdin" fan. "Believe me. I just bought one for 
Barbie." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: The reception was held across the street in the DGA's old building. Done 
by Along Came Mary, it included lavish "college food" buffets that evoked rich 
alumni more than starving students. 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: Before the party, DJ Mike Messex said there were two ways to fill 
the dance floor. One was by playing "gimmies," the staples anyone would dance 
to, "the kind of songs," he said. "you'd hear on a cruise ship or a disco in 
Mazatlan." The other was if Madonna got up to dance. The second option worked 
better than the first. When she danced, they followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I think the film's message is fairly universal," said Madonna. "It's 
to believe in yourself. To think for yourself. To not judge people by the way 
they look. It's about prejudices. It's about the irony of being in an 
environment which is supposed to be about learning and broadening your mind, 
but actually is full of a lot of really narrow-minded people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moment: Buried in a scrum of Shawn Eckardt-style no-neck security 
guards and besieged by autograph seekers, Keshishian and Madonna made their way 
across the street to the party. It was a Fellini-esque moment of out-of-control 
fame. Of the experience of traveling with the pop icon, the director said: 
"It's kind of remarkable because she's this petit friend of mine, but then you 
go out and she's something entirely different for everybody else."

RSVP; IN LOVE WITH LERNER AT TAPER SALON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As screenwriter Larry Gelbart put it, "It's time for a love song, a 
celebration of the songs of Alan Jay Lerner."  
</P>
<P>
 Gelbart's wife of 38 years, Pat Marshall, sang "My Love Is a Married Man" from 
the 1945 Lerner and Loewe show "The Day Before Spring," in which she had 
starred. She was one among a stellar cast Monday night -- Michael Feinstein, 
who hosted the show; Lindsay Ridgeway, a veteran performer at 8, and Harold 
Nichols, still dancing like a youth in his 70s. After the show, guests gathered 
for supper at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Restaurant 
</P>
<P>
 The tribute to the life and work of the legendary lyricist was the third 
annual Salon at the Mark Taper Forum, a sold-out, $200-per-person benefit to 
support the creative work of the Center Theatre group and to underwrite its 
ticket discount programs -- Public Rush, Pay What You Can, Operation Discovery 
and special considerations for senior citizens, students and hearing impaired 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salon at the Taper series is dedicated to the memory of the late producer 
Nick Vanoff, a longtime CTG board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick Vanoff used to say to me 'I don't want to see any empty seats in this 
theater. We've got to find a way to make it possible to fill these seats,' " 
said Gordon Davidson, CTG producing director.  
</P>
<P>
 That's how the discount programs came to be called "Nick's Ticket," Davidson 
said. Vanoff's wife, Felisa, and son, Nicholas, with Lew Wasserman, are 
honorary founding co-chairs of the Salons. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's performance was also dedicated to the late Frank Wells, whose 
wife, Luanne, came with family and friends. It was recalled that Wells' 
contagious enthusiasm for the Salons led him to sing along with the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't actually sing, but I was certainly humming," Betty White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eisner did have to singfor his supper when Joanna Gleason picked him 
out of the audience to portray one of the knights in the "Camelot" song, "When 
You May Take Me to the Fair."  
</P>
<P>
 Gleason, pointing out that she was Guinevere, "the queen of England," asked 
his name.  
</P>
<P>
 "Michael" he replied.  
</P>
<P>
 "Michael who?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Eisner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, your magic kingdom is bigger than my magic kingdom," ad-libbed Gleason, 
who apparently hadn't recognized the Disney chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Olson Livingston, who was the third of Lerner's eight wives and mother 
of his daughters, Jenny and Lisa, reminisced for the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Also present were Lerner's fourth wife, Michelene, and her son, Michael, and 
Lerner's grandchildren, Susannah and Jennifer Olch.  
</P>
<P>
 Other guests included Harriett and Armand Deutsch, Mayor Richard Riordan with 
Nancy Daly, Bud and Cynthia Yorkin, Dina Merrill and Ted Hartley, Lew and Edie 
Wasserman, and co-chairs Joan Burns and Phyllis Hennigan.

 A crowd of 500 -- containing plenty of film and music industry heavies -- 
turned out at the AMC Theater on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade Monday 
night for the long-awaited premiere of the controversial film, "Martin Lawrence 
You So Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 This concert film features comedian Lawrence doing his solo performance with a 
kaleidoscopic array of character changes, not to mention very . . . er, adult 
language and situations.  
</P>
<P>
 The release was delayed because Miramax, the original distributor, was 
unwilling to distribute the film when it got an NC-17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to run like hell to make an early date, frantically putting 
posters together and everything," said Tom Rothman, president of production for 
the Samuel Goldwyn Co., which came to the film's rescue by agreeing to 
distribute it unrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "To cut this movie would have been a compromise that nobody wanted to make. 
You can't edit a concert film for content," Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm coming into your house and you invite me and I'm cussin', then you can 
say something because I'm in your house," Lawrence told the crowd in an 
expletive-sprinkled, pre-screening address. "This is my film, this is my art, 
this is what I've seen, this is who I am. Language ain't what kills people." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience -- many clad in gold chains and baggies although the suit-and-tie 
contingent was out in force as well -- came along with little attrition when 
the fete moved a block up the Promenade to Renaissance for a post-screening 
party. Familiar faces in the star-studded turnout included Wesley Snipes, 
Robert Townsend, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Branford Marsalis, James Wilder, Dana Delany 
and the members of the musical groups En Vogue and Boyz II Men. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's missing in black cinema now is relationships," said comedian-director 
Townsend, whose credits include "Hollywood Shuffle." "So watching a comedian 
onstage talking about love, the audience is getting something they're missing 
because there has never been one black love story." 
</P>
<P>
 Few seemed to find "You So Crazy" as vulgar as the ratings board did, because 
the waiters and waitresses cruising Renaissance carrying trays of tomato with 
basil baguettes, spring rolls and quiches had no shortage of takers.

DISNEY'S FILM FORMULA STARTING TO LOSE MAGIC; NEWS ANALYSIS: HIGH CONCEPT, LOW 
BUDGET WAS WORKING, BUT LATELY BOX-OFFICE RECEIPTS HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSINGLY 
LOW. 
</P>

<P>
 The movies all seem to have catchy titles with easy-to-understand themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blank Check": A lonely 11-year-old boy "cashes in" on an opportunity to 
become very popular when an impatient crook runs over his three-speed bike and 
absent-mindedly leaves a blank check to cover the damage. The boy boldly fills 
in the check for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Father the Hero": A vacationing, love-struck 14-year-old girl concocts a 
scheme to pass her father off as her lover in order to impress the boy of her 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Air Up There": A college coach travels to Africa to woo a 7-foot tribal 
member to play American basketball, and then dons tribal paint and takes part 
in a full-court game against other African players in a contest fraught with 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 So high concept. So low budget. So Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Disney has proudly adhered to a philosophy that differs from many 
other Hollywood studios. Make high-concept movies on relatively small budgets, 
keep talent costs down, advertise like crazy, then flood the marketplace with 
product week after week. If it fails, there are always video and other 
ancillary markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" may have stirred audiences with their 
brilliant animation and delightful tunes, reaping hundreds of millions of 
dollars for the Disney empire, but more often than not over the last year the 
Walt Disney Co. in Burbank has continued to churn out a steady stream of 
forgettable movies: "Cabin Boy," "Aspen Extreme," "Life With Mikey," "Father 
Hood," "Born Yesterday," "Swing Kids," "Super Mario Bros.," "Blame It on the 
Bellboy." Critics winced and audiences didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past couple of years, Disney's philosophy has generated handsome 
profits with such live-action films as "Cool Runnings," a film about a Jamaican 
bobsled team at the Olympics that grossed more than $65 million; "The Hand That 
Rocks the Cradle," a 1992 nanny-from-hell movie produced for pittance ($87 
million), and Whoopi Goldberg's comedy "Sister Act" ($140 million). Even some 
of Disney's live-action family films such as "Homeward Bound" ($42 million) 
were very profitable relative to cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But, often Disney's low-ball strategy has backfired at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has this been more apparent than at the studio's Hollywood Pictures 
division, which saw box-office receipts for many of its movies remain 
embarrassingly low. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1988, Hollywood Pictures has long been the source of conjecture in 
the film industry. Until this week, it had been headed by Ricardo Mestres, a 
close friend of studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and his boss, chairman Michael 
Eisner, since the days a decade ago when all three worked at Paramount 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Mestres was forced out after one lackluster film after another. 
Mestres took the fall publicly, even though it is widely known that Katzenberg 
and Eisner sign off on virtually all movies that flow from Hollywood Pictures, 
as well as its sister divisions, Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wondered why Katzenberg had waited so long to act, but sources said his 
Achilles' heel had always been that he liked Mestres too much, was too loyal to 
simply dump him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirm that it was Eisner who last week abruptly mandated the 
resignation of Mestres. Ending months of speculation, Mestres relinquished his 
stripes and accepted a long-term production deal with the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While a successor was not immediately named, the supposed front-runner for the 
job is a non-movie executive from Disney's Hyperion Books named Michael 
Lynnton, a close friend of Touchstone president David Hoberman. Hoberman is 
poised to be appointed head of all three movie divisions under Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of Mestres' departure, questions that have dogged the studio 
for years have resurfaced. Is Disney pursuing profitability above good 
filmmaking? And, has Disney become creatively stifled because of its 
tightfisted cost controls and overbearing management style? 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Disney argue that management has already begun to rethink its 
strategy and make changes. They point to such upcoming products as the Julia 
Roberts/Nick Nolte romantic action movie "I Love Trouble"; Meg Ryan and Andy 
Garcia in "When a Man Loves a Woman"; and the Robert Redford directed "Quiz 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to diversify its product and boost its creative output, Disney 
has brought into the fold some respected moviemakers, including former 20th 
Century Fox chairman Joe Roth, the filmmaking team of Ismail Merchant and James 
Ivory, and bought the independent New York-based Miramax Films, best known for 
releasing such unconventional fare as "The Crying Game" and "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Upset with criticism about primarily making mindless movies, one high-level 
Disney executive said, "Well over a year ago we made adjustments and are doing 
a more balanced program of movies. . . . This event (Mestres' departure) has 
nothing to do with any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say Hollywood Pictures is a good example of why Katzenberg's system 
needed altering. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened is that Disney had an idea to do high-concept, low-budget 
movies," said entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom. "On the whole, that concept 
hasn't performed. The movie business is a business of balance. High-concept has 
its place, but so do other kinds of movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It also hasn't escaped Wall Street's attention that what is driving Disney's 
film studio is its animated product, not live-action films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Profitability, in large measure, is coming out of their animated film 
product," analyst Jeffrey Logsdon said recently. "When you get right down to 
statistics, about 15% of their revenues on film entertainment side come out of 
live-action features, their non-animated product. That gets down to a really 
uninspiring number. But they've always been driven that way. It's not as if 
that's some big revelation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who have worked in the Disney system contend that too many studio 
executives exerting control over projects has stifled creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many cooks to spoil the broth," said one producer who made 
movies for Hollywood Pictures. "Too many executives telling you how to change 
this and that."

NETWORKS STEERING CLEAR OF TV PROJECTS ON THE L.A. RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This weekend, in the midst of remembrances and commemorations of the second 
anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, NBC will air a hastily produced TV movie 
that will uncover the true story behind the explosive headlines of a violent 
event that captured the attention of the world: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story." 
</P>
<P>
 The film arrives less than four months after Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan 
was attacked at the U.S. national figure skating championships in a conspiracy 
that authorities said involved rival Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows by 12 days the Fox movie "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True 
Story of the Menendez Murders," which made it to air only two months after the 
trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, NBC took only months to churn out TV movies about Hurricane Andrew, 
the bombing of the World Trade Center and the fatal clash between federal 
agents and members of the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 But a television movie or miniseries about the riots that ravaged Los Angeles 
has not been put on the fast track -- or even the slow track. 
</P>
<P>
 And viewers hoping to see a dramatic treatment of the civil unrest that 
erupted April 29, 1992, should not hold their breath. None of the major 
networks has such a project in development, even though the subject matter 
contains many of the elements found in "quickie" television movies -- death, 
destruction, turmoil, chaos, heated courtroom confrontations, heroism, courage 
and survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives from CBS, NBC and Fox declined to comment on why they have not 
developed such a movie or miniseries. Judd Parkin, senior vice president in 
charge of motion pictures for television and miniseries at ABC, responded in a 
statement: "The riot was so big, and so all-encompassing, that we felt there 
was no way to distill it down to a single movie. There was no central, 
clear-cut story that could be followed all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Producers of fact-based television movies said they are not surprised that 
there has not been a dramatic movie revolving around the riots. They said the 
subject matter was too painful, too depressing and lacked a compelling point of 
view from which to tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still too close," said producer Michael Jaffe. "It was an event that was 
profoundly unsettling to L.A. residents, even more than the earthquake. It's 
just too violent and too depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Ken Kaufman said, "There's been no movie about the famine in Somalia, 
either. The riot was very complicated and very, very serious. It will take a 
long time before anyone can find a way to say something interesting in a movie, 
and for the audience to be receptive to the images, which they saw over and 
over and over again. It's still too fresh and too painful." 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers outside the TV industry believe there is a deeper and less 
honorable reason behind the dearth of riot projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it has to do with the fact that most of the parties involved were 
black," said Johnnie Cochran Jr., who represented truck driver Reginald O. 
Denny in his civil lawsuit against the city last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, one of the most poignant stories are the four black Good Samaritans 
who came out of their homes when the police fled Florence and Normandie and 
risked their lives to rescue Reginald Denny," Cochran said. "That's a modern 
American hero story. When blacks commit some heinous crime, Hollywood can't 
wait to do a story on that. But when black people are heroes, no one wants to 
do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Dates, co-author of the book "Split Images: African-Americans in the 
Mass Media" and acting dean of the School of Communications at Howard 
University, said, "It's a race issue. The networks and moviemakers are afraid 
to touch it. They would need to talk to the black community about it, because 
it is such a complex issue, and they've always been afraid to talk to the 
community. So rather than being accused of doing a surface job in a movie, they 
just sit back and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Gray, professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz, said that instead of 
dramatic movies or miniseries, there has been an "explosion" of situation 
comedies revolving around blacks since the riots. "That seems to be where the 
networks feel safest, rather than giving it in-depth focus. It's a weak-kneed 
approach to the immediacy and complexity of the social problems that were 
raised." 
</P>
<P>
 The only dramatic treatment of the Los Angeles riots were a few episodes of 
prime-time series such as "Doogie Howser, M.D." and "The Fresh Prince of Bel 
Air" that aired a few months after the disturbance, and a two-part story on 
NBC's defunct "A Different World," which put two of its main characters in the 
middle of the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said that Denny did not receive serious offers for film rights to his 
story -- even though he recovered from his injuries, became friends with the 
four blacks who rescued him and hugged the mother of Damian Williams, the man 
charged with beating him, in a dramatic courtroom scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was ever interested in doing a movie on him -- how he survived and 
recovered, and how he was not bitter," Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Alan-Williams, author of the book "A Gathering of Heroes -- 
Reflections on Rage and Responsibility," about the happenings at Florence and 
Normandie and how he saved a Japanese American man from being beaten to death, 
also has not attracted any serious offers about film rights, said his manager, 
Beverly Muse. 
</P>
<P>
 But some feel the lack of projects may be a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Hill, a TV-movie producer and former executive at ABC and NBC, noted 
that it took 25 years before there was a film about the 1965 Watts riots -- 
"Heatwave," which aired on the TNT cable network in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "A perspective was gained by waiting," Hill said. "These 'Polaroid' films 
don't provide any insight. I think something will eventually be done about the 
riots. I'm grateful that there hasn't been a rush to judgment."

WHY L.A. WAS ON 'FIRE THIS TIME'; MOVIES: RANDY HOLLAND WENT OUT 'TO SEE THINGS 
FOR MYSELF' AS THE CITY BURNED IN 1992, AND HOPES HIS DOCUMENTARY WILL HELP 
OTHERS UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF THE RIOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 1992 riots, when most Angelenos were hunkering down at home, writer 
and filmmaker Randy Holland was out driving around, just trying to fathom all 
the fury and rage behind the fires, looting and destruction that he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to see things for myself," Holland, 46, explains during an interview in 
the Marina del Rey home he shares with his wife, Julia, and their two young 
children. "I was shocked. I was blown away. I wanted to find out why it was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that urge to learn more about the causes of the riots that led Holland 
to make "The Fire This Time," his documentary that premiered at this year's 
Sundance Film Festival and will open Friday at the Monica Laemmle for a 
weeklong run. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rioting ended, Holland drove to South-Central Los Angeles to see what 
was happening in the aftermath. There, he met Lillian Mobley, executive 
director of the South Central Senior Center, and started talking with her about 
the riots. When he went back the next day with donations of clothes and toys, 
Mobley asked him why he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland replied, "I'm really here because I want to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then she took a moment and just looked at me," Holland says. "She said, 
'Somebody needs to tell the truth about what's going on down here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who has written articles on urban issues for L.A. Weekly as well as 
scripts for episodes of "Quantum Leap" and "Murder, She Wrote," had never 
directed a movie, but nonetheless decided he would make a short documentary 
about the underlying causes of the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I'd rent a camera, put it on Mrs. Mobley, she'd tell her truth and 
that would be my duty -- I'd be done," Holland says. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, Holland was invited to a closed community meeting, where he 
met Dr. Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow, and Bobby Lavender, the co-founder of 
the Bloods. As he shot footage of them and others in the community, his 
"weekend movie" gradually turned into an ambitious full-length project: a film 
about social problems in Los Angeles that looks at the riots from a historical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holland wrote, directed and produced "The Fire This Time" and managed to make 
it for less than $300,000 -- most of it borrowed -- because most of the other 
people who worked on the film donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which consists mainly of historical footage -- beginning with the 
arrival of the first blacks in California in the 1850s -- with narration and 
interviews with black community leaders, does not focus on the rioting itself, 
and the Rodney G. King verdicts are barely mentioned. Instead, the film 
concentrates on the social problems that led to the unrest, especially what he 
sees as the failure of the government to improve on the conditions that led to 
the Watts riots of 1965.  
</P>
<P>
 Archival footage, for example, shows the early days of the Black Panthers and 
the Watts Writers Workshop and the services those groups provided to the 
community, as well as Holland's contention that government intervention 
fragmented those groups. And the so-called 25-Year Plan, conceived in the wake 
of the Watts riots, called for parks and libraries to be built throughout 
South-Central L.A., yet the '92 riots -- coming just about on the 25th 
anniversary of the 25-Year Plan, made it clear, Holland believes, that the plan 
never really took hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to look at the total scope of the problem," says 
Holland, who has lived in Los Angeles for most of his adult life. "It's about a 
chain of events that has been building for a long time. It's not about angry 
guys on the street throwing a brick at a trucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is in the minds of those people? What brought them to that? That's 
something we really need to look at as a society."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Holland is clearly on the liberal end of the political spectrum, he 
says he is disillusioned with politics, and the film offers no easy answers. 
Holland says he didn't make the film with a political agenda in mind, only a 
desire to find out more about the riots and a drive to share what he learned 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
 What he concluded is that most of what he sees as the root causes of the Watts 
riots -- underemployment, urban violence, poverty -- were never really 
addressed and that those same problems still aren't getting much attention 
today -- even in the aftermath of the 1992 rioting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I was political, I was naive about all the elements at play," 
Holland says. "I'm no longer the same. Everything I write for the rest of my 
life will be affected by what I went through making this film." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland hopes his film will change other people's perspectives as well, and he 
already has shown it on college campuses, including USC and UCLA. While "The 
Fire This Time" hasn't yet been picked up for distribution, it will be shown on 
Cinemax and on a few public television stations. He is still hoping to get a 
theatrical release for the film in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 While Holland doubts that showing the film will fix the urban problems it 
discusses, he still thinks it's a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important thing, allowing yourself to be sensitized to all these 
issues," Holland says. "I don't have any illusions that I'm going to change the 
world, but it's exciting to get these issues on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Fire This Time" will be shown Friday through May 5 at the Laemmle's 
Monica 4-Plex, 1332 2nd Street, Santa Monica. (310) 394-9741.

 These days, however, he's best known as Frank Costanza, the excitable, TV 
Guide-collecting father of the hapless, womanizing George on "Seinfeld." Frank 
will give George further grief in a one-hour episode tonight and return s for 
the season finale May 19.  
</P>
<P>
 Stiller initially passed up the "Seinfeld" gig for a play, but he was asked 
again after the production ended its run, and no one seems more surprised by 
his latest bout of success than Stiller himself.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Given your character, is it surprising that George turned out the 
way he did? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I keep asking myself that same question. I was very much like George 
when I was his age. I had no balance. When you think about George, this is a 
guy who had a mission; he's not Generation X, he's Generation Why. I'm 
Generation Who Knows? My father probably behaved toward me the same way, he 
gave me the leeway to do what I wanted to do, but nobody wanted me to be an 
actor. . . . My mother wanted me to have the best things in life, but was 
shocked when she saw this kid on a stage -- I did an amateur night when I was 
15, and I bombed. She told me, "You stink!" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the difference in TV's impact now and in Ed Sullivan's day? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is much more explosive, instantaneously. We did 36 of the Sullivan 
shows, and (our success) was a cumulative thing. We started out as steady 
characters. It wasn't just one performance. But here, it's like, boom! People 
started recognizing me immediately as George's dad. Suddenly, just one show has 
it all. When you're on Sullivan, you were maybe one of 10 acts. There's Jimmy 
Durante or Ella Fitzgerald in the real spotlight, and we were always kind of 
sneaking in the side door. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When you're younger, you can feel (the excitement of fame coming on). It's a 
very big excitement, because it's never happened to you before. It's like being 
in love for the first time, when you're on Ed Sullivan. . . . Now, we've had a 
few of these incarnations. And we've disappeared a few times in our career too. 
And now when they pop up again, you're grateful. Because more than anything, 
the desire to be an actor never goes away. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why doesn't there seem to be any new comedy teams anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's always been tough for teams to stay together. Because whatever takes 
place that brings the team together may not have been strong enough to keep it 
alive after success comes. That's the strange thing -- the fight is more 
important than winning the fight. Something usually takes place in one or both 
of the people -- "Well, I really wanted all my life to be up there alone, and 
the partner was there to help me get there." But you don't know that when 
you're starting out, because you're thrown together by circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, teams start when there's such desperation in each person's lives that 
there's nowhere to go. And they cling to each other. They suddenly go out, and 
with that passion and desperation there's an instant identification with an 
audience who has also experienced that, and then when success starts to take 
place, they've achieved that momentary satisfaction, and now they have higher 
aspirations -- "I want to play Hamlet." "I want the spotlight on my face, not 
your face. I don't need you anymore!" It's that umbilical break, and then, 
usually, everything goes downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's even tougher when you're married to your partner. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's complicated, because you ask yourself, "What are we here for? Did we 
get married because we wanted to get onstage, or did we marry because we love 
each other?" When you get visible, you can't talk to your wife like she's one 
of the guys -- "You didn't pause for my laugh" -- and everything comes into 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Anne said, "I want to have kids." And I said, "Kids? What do we 
need kids for?" (laughs) She said, "I'm not waiting for the big break. Either 
we have kids or we don't really have a marriage." And I had to digest this -- I 
was in my 30s and still looking for something to happen in front of an audience 
for myself. Anne saw it in a much different light, and I'm very happy it turned 
out that way, because the idea of having kids pushed us into another way of 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie said, "We're going to get pregnant tonight." We were in Chicago, working 
two shows a night at the Happy Medium. . . . Of course, the sketches quit 
working when she got pregnant -- one was about a guy meeting a girl for the 
first time, and Anne's out to here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were thanked at the end of "Reality Bites." Was that just for being 
Dad? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I still don't know what that was all about. I never asked, to be honest. 
People ask, "Why weren't you in the film?" I think Ben had his own idea of what 
he wanted this to be. I looked through that film and thought, "What could I 
have played?" . . . I saw my son up there, doing his thing, and thought, "You 
can't sit there thinking why he didn't use you -- the level of selfishness! God 
Almighty! What more do you want? Your kid's successful -- now you want to be in 
his movies?" (laughs) 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you try to steer your kids into show biz? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I had no plan, and I know Anne couldn't care less about it. She didn't say, 
"You should study diction" and all of that, except that I said that they should 
take the violin. . . . The only thing I did terrible in my life was when we 
were on the Mike Douglas show, co-hosting, the talent coordinator said, "Would 
you bring the kids on?" And Anne said, "We don't bring kids on the show." And I 
said, "Well, why don't we? They're kids, we're in the business." I convinced 
Anne to let them come on: "They're cute, they're in the business, they're 
around it all day, they might as well be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 So they asked, "Do they do anything?" I said, "Well, they play the violin." 
They had taken about four lessons. They asked, "Can they play on the show?" 
Anne said, "If they play the violin on that show, we got no marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I said, "Let 'em play the violin, they're kids, what's going to 
happen?" So they came out with these little Yamahas, and they played 
"Chopsticks" or "Adeste Fideles," and they were humiliated. The kids at school 
told them they were terrible, I got a letter from a woman who said, "How dare 
you bring your children on the show, exploiting your kids? Who the hell do you 
think you are? A thousand kids could've done better than that." And they never 
forgave us for that, either one of them. . . . After that, they never attended 
any of those sessions again. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you consider yourself an actor or a comedian?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I used to think I was a comedian, and then when I started to think I was 
funny, my wife said, "You're not very funny. You're better off when you don't 
try to be funny." So then I started to be an actor, but I didn't think I was 
that good of an actor. So who knows?

HARD LOOK AT YOUNG, HOMELESS

 Veering sharply from its usual fare of children's classics and fairy tales, 
the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater ventures into hard reality today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lost Children" is an hourlong series of monologues and scenes based on 
experiences of homeless young people. Written, directed and performed by 15 
members of the Repertory, the company's advanced acting troupe, it will be 
presented at 7:30 p.m. at the Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The first original work by Youth Theater students in Playhouse history, 
according to director Joe Lauderdale, this is hardly kiddie fare. Although cast 
members range in age from 10 to 18, Lauderdale recommends the show for high 
school ages and up. Those in their early teens should attend only if they "come 
with parents willing to discuss (the issues presented) with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show directly addresses such topics as drug use, death, child prostitution 
and domestic violence, and though the stories occasionally are tempered by a 
comic moment or a hopeful ending, the language is often rough. 
</P>
<P>
 (Ironically, the set -- a darkly colored backdrop suggestive of a cityscape -- 
is borrowed from the Youth Theater's current production, "The Phantom 
Tollbooth," a fantasy for ages 4 and up.) 
</P>
<P>
 Producing "Lost Children" was an eye-opener for a cast of middle- and 
upper-middle-class people, Lauderdale added. He said he thinks it helped them 
"break down a lot of their personal walls" about homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a speech in the beginning of the play about how people basically 
think of homeless people as adults. They don't realize there are huge groups of 
children out there too. It's a very uncomfortable thing to think about, but 
it's true. I don't know if we could have created in our imaginations some of 
the awful things these kids go through in reality." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lost Children" will be performed tonight at 7:30 at the Moulton Theatre, 
606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Tickets, $10, should be available at the 
door. (714) 494-8021.

 The production of "The Who's Tommy" at the Universal Amphitheatre in July will 
be more lavish than the production next month at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, according to Scott Zeiger, executive producer of the 
"Tommy" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. will be unique unto itself," Zeiger said. Costa Mesa and other cities 
along the route "will have a wonderful production, but L.A. is going to have a 
custom design that is going to be quite spectacular. Universal Amphitheatre is 
such a unique space; it's not a traditional proscenium stage. We are spending a 
great deal of time building a special set design."Diane Haithman

4 DISTRICTS WILL EXEMPT STUDENTS FROM CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY 
CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS REQUEST IT WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAMS. 
BUT SIMI BOARD MEMBERS CONTEND THAT CRITICS ARE MISINFORMED.

<P>
 Skirting state law to appease opponents of the new California assessment 
tests, several Ventura County school districts have agreed to exempt individual 
children from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Simi Valley, school board members say they have reviewed the California 
Learning Assessment System and believe that most of the complaints are based on 
misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four school districts -- Fillmore Unified, Oxnard Elementary, Oxnard 
Union High School and Mesa Union -- are honoring the requests of parents who 
want their children excused from the CLAS exams, despite a state law requiring 
all students to take them. 
</P>
<P>
 And other districts in the county, such as Ventura Unified, are giving 
implicit permission to parents requesting that their children be excused from 
the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school board members agreed Tuesday that they could fulfill their 
legal responsibility by simply placing the test in front of students, without 
forcing them to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley trustees were among the first in the county to review the 
tests themselves and publicly express support for CLAS as a valuable assessment 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found none of the things that were alleged to be in the test by some of the 
groups" opposing CLAS, Simi Valley board member Doug Crosse said. "I found the 
literature to be age-appropriate. I found the literature to have a lot of 
socially redeeming values, to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 All California school districts are legally required to administer the CLAS 
exams this spring to students in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to give it and kids have to take it," said Susie Lange, spokeswoman 
for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials have advised districts across the state that they 
have no legal authority to excuse individual students from the exams, Lange 
said, but the department so far is not considering legal action against 
districts that agree to such exemptions. However, the state issued a letter of 
warning to the Antelope Valley Union School District in the San Fernando Valley 
after officials there recently voted not to administer the test to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School Boards Assn., estimated 
that dozens of the state's roughly 1,000 school districts are agreeing to 
excuse students from the CLAS exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, anti-CLAS groups have fanned opposition to the tests by 
passing out copies of materials, supposedly excerpted from CLAS, that include 
stories some parents consider too dark or disturbing for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lange echoed Crosse that many of the excerpts raising concerns among 
parents are not on the 1994 tests. "They're basing their complaints primarily 
on bad information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Korenstein, assistant superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School 
District, agrees that much of the concern about CLAS is based on 
misinformation. And he hopes that by the time the exams are given next year, 
much of the confusion will be cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, Korenstein said, the district has too little time before the 
scheduled exam dates in May and June to ensure that all parents are comfortable 
with CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that at least this year, parents are dealing with information 
they're getting barraged with" from CLAS opponents, he said. "There's a comfort 
zone, and we want parents to be comfortable with what's going on with their 
child's education." 
</P>
<P>
 So the 12,500-student Oxnard district will excuse children from the tests if 
their parents make such a request in writing, Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Oxnard Union High School District has agreed to exempt 
individual students at its six high schools from the exams. And in Fillmore, 
school officials said students would be excused from the test at parents' 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dennis Convery, superintendent of the Mesa Union School District 
near Camarillo, said he told parents this week that the district would honor 
written requests to excuse students from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have to have that right," said Carol Johnson, president of the Mesa 
Union Parent-Faculty Organization. "There are a lot of controversial issues 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those controversial issues were brought up at a meeting of the Ventura 
school board Tuesday, attended by about 30 parents opposed to the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing out materials that were labeled as practice CLAS tests from this year 
and last, some parents focused their complaints on the purported content of 
this year's exam, particularly short stories that contain violent or disturbing 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents said they are also concerned about the cost of developing and 
administering CLAS -- $25.6 million each year -- plus the air of secrecy 
surrounding the tests and the methods for grading the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Because CLAS tests focus on open-ended questions, such as asking for students' 
responses to particular stories, parents said they worry that the grading is 
too subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm appalled at the content of that test," said Janet George, president of 
the Parent-Teacher Organization at Mound School in Ventura. "I'm also concerned 
about the subjective nature of the test. How do you evaluate a kid's feelings?" 
</P>
<P>
 But state education officials said their scoring guidelines for CLAS allow 
little subjectivity. And while many parents have complained about a shroud of 
secrecy surrounding CLAS that prevents people from seeing the tests, state 
officials said all such assessment exams are kept confidential to protect their 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, state educators said they are heeding the concerns of parents 
about CLAS when the state reviews the tests this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we'll be paying special attention to things that could potentially 
offend," Lange said. "We have work to do to rebuild confidence." 
</P>

CONDOR IN THE WILD TARGETED TO BE RECAPTURED; ENDANGERED: THE VULTURE WILL BE 
RETURNED TO L.A. ZOO TO PREVENT HER FROM DYING OR TEACHING HAZARDOUS HABITS TO 
YOUNGER BIRDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the first two California condors reintroduced into the wild of Ventura 
County backcountry in early 1992 is targeted for capture today to be returned 
to the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old female known as Xewe -- like three other condors captured and 
returned to the zoo two months ago -- had developed dangerous habits, flying 
from her new Santa Barbara County habitat back to populated areas of Ventura 
County and roosting on power lines. The same behavior earlier killed four of 
the endangered vultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the capture of Xewe (pronounced GAY-wee) is necessary to 
prevent her from dying in the wild or teaching the same bad habits to five 
younger birds released late last year in the remote Lion Canyon area of Santa 
Barbara County, 60 miles northwest of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary near Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists hope that Xewe's capture will mark the end of the large curious 
birds' return flights into Ventura County, at least until their population is 
so large and well-established in Santa Barbara County that they come back to 
the Fillmore area only to forage and explore, but not to roost. 
</P>
<P>
 Xewe will now join the other three condors captured from the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary as part of the captive breeding stock at the zoo and will most likely 
never be released into the wild again. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a personal level, we all hate for Xewe's sake to see her brought in," said 
Michael Wallace, curator of conservation and science at the Los Angeles Zoo and 
leader of a team of experts who advise the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service on the 
project. "I raised that bird. But we have to make the decision that is best for 
the overall population and not just for one individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc M. Weitzel, Fish & Wildlife condor recovery project leader, called the 
necessity for the decision unfortunate. But success is not measured with one 
bird, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be measured many years down the road," he said. "Success will be 
establishing a core population in the wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Kiff, who led the condor recovery team for 10 years, said that Xewe's 
pattern of returning to the Sespe site actually is a good sign concerning the 
five younger birds in the wild at Lion Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tells us the earliest experience is important in determining movement in 
later years," he said. "We've seen it happen with several birds now and that 
should bode well for the five at Lion Canyon," which were never in the more 
dangerous Sespe area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Xewe, however, has been captured before and scientists are not at all certain 
that they will be successful today. 
</P>
<P>
 She has steered clear of locations suitable for trapping with nets and roosted 
high above the ground. So biologists will try today to entice her with food 
into the same cave-like structure where she was held before her release two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's extremely trap-shy and leery of us," Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish & Wildlife Service biologists in charge of a program to bring the condor 
back from the edge of extinction had hoped that Xewe would act as mentor to the 
five younger birds released in Lion Canyon last year, showing them how to 
roost, forage and nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Xewe's homing instinct proved too strong, and she returned to the 
Sespe Condor Sanctuary where she was first released more than two years ago. 
She has been seen roosting near Castaic Lake, flying over Fillmore and landing 
on power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest of the free-flyers, with bright red eyes and a 9-foot wingspan, 
Xewe also does not appear to be foraging for food or finding carrion on her 
own, going more than three weeks without food until biologists put out a calf 
carcass for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than leave her to die of accident or starvation, or spend valuable 
hours to keep her alive in a separate location from the main program in Lion 
Canyon, biologists decided to begin trying to trap her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The population of California condors, which once roamed the North American 
continent by the thousands, had dwindled to only 27 birds in April, 1987, when 
the last wild condor was trapped and brought in to the captive breeding 
program. That bird, known as AC-9, fathered Xewe in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15-million, 14-year program has been controversial from the start, 
drawing objections from the National Audubon Society and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program stayed on track, producing new young every year.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1992, Xewe and a male condor, Chocuyens (pronounced Che-KOO-yenz), 
were released into the Sespe, becoming the first two to fly free since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 They carried with them the biologists' hopes for the successful reintroduction 
of the species into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiff said that day that he felt "consummated and vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists had always said they expected deaths in the program, but they were 
surprised when the first one came so soon. Chocuyens became the first casualty 
in the program 10 months later when he died after drinking anti-freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, six more birds were released into the Sespe. But the birds 
could not stay away from populated areas, and over the course of the next 10 
months, three of them died in collisions with power lines or poles. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, scientists decided to recapture the remaining four birds, 
including Xewe, and transfer them to Santa Barbara County in an area surrounded 
by mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In March of this year, however, three of the Sespe birds returned to their 
first home in the Sespe, and scientists feared they would be subject to the 
same dangers that killed the birds the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Sespe birds were captured and returned to the L. A. Zoo, where they 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Including Xewe and the five at Lion Canyon, there are now 85 California 
condors alive, and up to eight more are expected to hatch by the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope to eventually establish at least three populations of 100 
birds each in California, New Mexico and Arizona.

OJAI TO SUE IF VOTE ON LANDFILL MAKES BALLOT

 If a measure asking voters to approve a landfill at Weldon Canyon makes the 
November ballot, Ojai intends to file a lawsuit challenging the proposal, 
council members have decided. 
</P>
<P>
 But time is running out for Taconic Resources, the company seeking voter 
approval for the dump, to collect the 18,753 signatures of Ventura County 
voters needed to place the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be difficult, but it is not an insurmountable task," said 
Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters for Ventura County. "It can be 
done; it just depends on how many people you have (collecting signatures) and 
how much money you want to spend to saturate the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chase, Taconic general partner, said the company plans to spend nearly 
$1 million in its pursuit of a ballot initiative, and will employ 50 or 60 
Ventura County residents to obtain signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5 1/2 weeks to go before the June 6 deadline, Taconic would have to 
collect 506 valid signatures each day if it starts Saturday. Chase said the 
company hopes to begin collecting signatures this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be tight, but it's still do-able," Chase said. "We're 
going to try our best." 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic obtains the signatures by June 6, the Board of Supervisors must 
place the measure on the November ballot, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ojai wants the supervisors to decline placing the initiative on the ballot 
and will file a lawsuit if they don't, the City Council decided in closed 
session Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they decide to place it on the ballot, we will take them to court," City 
Atty. Monte Widders said in an interview after the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai residents have opposed a landfill at Weldon Canyon, which is at the mouth 
of the Ojai Valley, saying it would create health risks and diminish air 
quality. Waste Management Inc. withdrew its application to develop a landfill 
at the site last summer after it became apparent that the Board of Supervisors 
would deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic is negotiating with Waste Management to take over its lease for the 
551-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said Taconic, which is based in San Diego County, still needs to 
publish its petition in Ventura County and have the petitions approved by the 
county registrar before the firm can begin collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said those steps should be completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day or week is critical, of course, but if we don't make the November 
ballot, it would not be the end of the world," Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic is allowed 180 days from the day the petitions are approved to obtain 
signatures from 10% -- or 18,753 -- of the county's voters. But if the company 
wants the measure on the November ballot, it must gather those signatures in 40 
days, Bradley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic cannot meet the June 6 deadline for the November election, it can 
continue to collect signatures for the next countywide election, which is in 
March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the proposal could be pushed back even later to June, 1996, if it 
is not allowed on the ballot for the March presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic could try to obtain signatures from 20% of the county voters over a 
six-month period, in which case the Board of Supervisors would have to call a 
special election, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company would rather present the initiative in a general election, 
Chase said, adding that the company believes that the number of voters opposed 
to the landfill is small and might have more impact in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the 40-day deadline to qualify for the November election may be 
an advantage for Taconic. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal experience has been the petition that hits hard and quickly 
galvanizes people who are thinking about it," he said. "I think you're better 
off concentrating your efforts in a shorter amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Widders, the Ojai city attorney, acknowledged that county attorneys would have 
to determine that the initiative process was unconstitutional for the board not 
to place the measure on the ballot, but said he believed that there were "great 
flaws with the initiative" that could warrant a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say what he believes those flaws are. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Counsel Andrew Gustafson said it is the supervisors' legal 
duty to place the initiative on the ballot if it qualifies, but said they could 
unlawfully refuse to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Case law says if the initiative is properly certified, you must put it on the 
ballot," he said. The board would put itself at risk of being sued by Taconic 
if it refused to place the measure on the ballot, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson added that pre-election legal challenges, such as Ojai's, were 
difficult to win. County Counsel James McBride agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fairly difficult to challenge successfully a pre-election ballot 
measure, but it can be done and it has been done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, city leaders are determined to fight the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be very surprised if we didn't take some action," Councilman James Loebl 
said. "We're not going to let this go by the boards."

NO MARK AGAINST THEM; TATTOOS: DOCTOR WILL OFFER LASER REMOVAL SERVICE AT 
FILLMORE OFFICE ON FRIDAY FOR THOSE YOUTHS WHO WANT TO ERASE PAST REGRETS.

<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Adam can barely remember the night two years ago when he 
stayed up late getting drunk on cheap tequila. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His Simi Valley friends talked him into forever declaring himself a white 
supremacist by carving a homemade tattoo onto his shoulder with a thick needle 
and some India ink. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I woke up in the morning I realized it was stupid," he said the other 
day, in custody at the Ventura County juvenile work-release center and looking 
for a job. "I didn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam and as many as 50 other young people will get an opportunity next week to 
erase some of their past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrianna Scheibner, a Beverly Hills dermatologist who lives in Ojai, will 
remove the wearable art -- free of charge -- from any teen-agers who show up 
Friday at a doctor's office in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children have marked themselves with various tattoos, some of them gang 
signs and some love or hate symbols," Scheibner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for them to get jobs with the tattoos," she said. "But 
this helps them be free from past mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheibner has provided free tattoo treatment for hundreds of teen-agers 
throughout Los Angeles during the 14 years she has practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers grew so large that four years ago she established the Brave 
Hearts Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping troubled young 
people who want to turn their lives around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids are extraordinarily talented, but they were just born into 
an environment where they weren't given a choice," said Scheibner, whose 
professional practice specializes in removing scars and birthmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know any better, so they decide to belong to something and become 
like prisoners in their own skin," she said. "They're like little birds with 
broken wings, and when you mend them, they'll fly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore family practitioner James W. Howatt donated the use of his office at 
852 Ventura St. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had tried to get this going for a couple of the kids in the high school for 
quite some time," Howatt said. Scheibner, he said, "was mainly looking for 
rooms, and we had two that aren't used on Fridays." 
</P>
<P>
 Removing tattoos by laser is nearly as painful as getting the marks in the 
first place, Scheibner said. She numbs the area with a local anesthetic, then 
aims the beam onto the tattoo. The beam creates what she called an 
"earthquake-like blast" that breaks the ink cells into thousands of tiny pieces 
that can then be consumed by the tattoo-wearer's white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unpleasant to do without the anesthetic," she said. "It feels like the 
snapping of a rubber band, and some areas it tends to be somewhat painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Tattoo removal will be made available to any Ventura County teen-agers who 
show up, but they must bring proof of their parents' consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheibner said she plans to return to Fillmore, or another Ventura County 
doctor's office, every two or three months until every young person in the area 
has a chance to erase an unwanted marking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start, you can't stop," she said. "That would be unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The health coordinator at Fillmore High School, where as many as two dozen 
students have signed up to get their tattoos removed, said removing the 
markings is a first step toward improving a student's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are young people that maybe belonged to a gang or made a mistake 
getting a tattoo and realized they didn't want it," said Janice Schieferle. 
"But they've changed their lives now and are having difficulty finding jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan, another 17-year-old at the juvenile work-release center in Ventura, 
said he will be in Fillmore on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost 18, and I'm tired of screwing around," said Nathan, silver studs 
piercing both earlobes and tattoos across his hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The three dots at the base of his left thumb, he says, stood for "sex, money 
and drugs" at the time. But now, Nathan says, they only alert prospective 
employers to a lowlife past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll shake the person's hand, but he sees this, and this," the Oxnard boy 
said, pointing to the triangle of dots and a thick ink-black cross he says more 
closely resembles a squashed fly. "Then they just stare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Adam, Nathan concedes that he was high on drugs when he marked himself 
with a homemade tattoo gun, and when he allowed his friends to draw an 
indelible skull across his pale shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I just think they look ugly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Harmon, a teacher in the juvenile work-release program, was one of the 
local educators who first asked Scheibner to donate her time to help teen-agers 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a tattoo that's visible, you're probably not going to get 
hired," Harmon said. "People in this society think of criminals as having 
tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the kids are not ready to disavow their personal artwork. Linda 
Streeper, who works with Harmon, said many of the boys who pass through the 
work-release program are proud of their tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're the young ones who are new to the program," Streeper said. "They 
haven't gotten that look yet from an employer, or been passed over for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark wears a series of tattoos. He plans to get the unfinished eagle on his 
leg and the dots on his hand removed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not ready to part with the "SS" he wears on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can cover that with a watch," the 17-year-old Ventura boy said, pointing to 
the half-inch marking. 
</P>
<P>
 "These others I can't cover up." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Dermatologist Adrianna Scheibner will provide a free tattoo-removal service at 
the office of Dr. James Howatt, 852 Ventura Ave., Fillmore, on Friday. Minors 
must show parental permission. For information, call Janice Schieferle at 
Fillmore High School, 524-1711.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TENTATIVE OK GIVEN TO PROJECT RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have tentatively endorsed plans to renovate the 58-acre 
complex known as the Wagon Wheel, an aging motel-restaurant-bowling center near 
the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point in Oxnard's career, that was the premier spot for Oxnard," 
Councilman Michael A. Plisky said."But over the years it has deteriorated, and 
it needs to be totally renovated." 
</P>
<P>
 Its owners, Martin V. Smith & Associates of Oxnard, plan to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 During a study session with the Oxnard City Council on Tuesday, the developers 
unveiled preliminary plans for a high-rise residential, office and 
entertainment complex they hope will rival some of the finest tourist 
attractions in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Vice President Walter Calhoun said he was pleased with the reception the 
project received, despite the lack of detail. An environmental assessment and 
design reviews are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our architect has revised the plan, changed its size and scope a little bit 
and integrated some important elements that we've been able to gather from 
visiting other sites," Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky asked that the developers come back to the City Council before a 
specific plan is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the last opportunities we're going to have for this kind of 
development," he said. "It has to be top-quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun said he hopes to be back within two months with more detailed plans 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be several years before actual construction begins on the project, 
which was prompted in part by state transportation plans to upgrade the nearby 
freeway interchange. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MORTAR SHELL CAUSES STIR IN DOWNTOWN LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Fletcher was walking through a grocery store parking lot in Ventura on 
Wednesday morning when he spotted what looked like a mortar shell. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mortar shell: an 81-millimeter, standard military-issue shell lying 
outside the Vons supermarket on Ventura's West Main Street, Ventura police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and bomb specialists were summoned to retrieve the shell, but not 
before Fletcher carried it in his car and into a restaurant a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were trying to determine late Wednesday if the shell was live. "We 
don't make it a practice of taking them apart," said Sgt. Rod Thompson of the 
Ventura County Sheriff Department's bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, 26, of Camarillo, picked up the shell, put it in his car and took it 
with him to the nearest pay phone at a restaurant on California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy walked in, looked around and went over to the phone, holding the 
mortar," recalled manager Shona Nicholson, who said she assumed it was a relic 
he had bought at a thrift store. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were a bit more alarmed. They instructed Fletcher to take the mortar 
shell out to the parking lot and wait for the bomb squad to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb experts carefully loaded the shell into a trailer equipped to withstand a 
dynamite blast and stored it in a bunker in Camarillo until military 
specialists can retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The shell found Wednesday was typical of those used since the Korean War, 
Thompson said. He added that military hardware occasionally turns up in the 
community because veterans have brought home war souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he advises against picking them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use these incidents to say 'Thank you, but next time you see something 
like this, don't touch,' " Thompson said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLAN WOULD AVOID LAYOFF OF 6 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Ventura police officers who faced layoffs due to budget cuts would have 
their positions permanently funded under a proposal recommended Wednesday by 
the city's finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, composed of three City Council members, will forward its 
recommendation to the full council for approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to retain the officers comes out of parking fee revenues, which 
increased because police made sure more residents paid their tickets this year, 
and out of dollars the city hopes to recover from the school district for 
supplying it with crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials also said they expect at least two officers to retire within 
the next year. Committee members asked that those positions, when vacant, would 
not be filled until the committee has examined whether the city can afford to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of salary and equipment for each of the six officers runs 
between $70,000 and $80,000 per year, said Terry Adelman, the city's director 
of management resources. 
</P>
<P>
 By adding together the parking fee revenues and the expected crossing guard 
payments, and counting on two officers retiring, committee members said they 
believed that the city could avoid laying off any current officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way, we don't send out the message (to the six officers) that, if things 
go bad, you are the next one off the boat," Councilman Steve Bennett said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DEVELOPER GETS TAX BREAK ON FARMLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer hoping to turn strawberry fields into tract housing received a 
$107,000-a-year tax break from Ventura County this week, when a county panel 
agreed to tax the prime real estate at the same rate as farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that county officials fear could bring other developers forward 
demanding tax reductions, the county Assessment Appeals Board No. 1 slashed 
$10.7 million off the taxable value of 126 acres near Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Development Assn., which is planning a 3,500-home development on a site 
south of the Oxnard city limits, bought the three tracts in 1990 for prices 
ranging from $99,000 to $119,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals panel, which includes county Supervisor John K. Flynn, agreed with 
the developer that the land -- still covered with strawberries -- should be 
valued at $30,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody pays $119,000 an acre for strawberry fields," said a skeptical James 
Dodd, tax specialist for the county assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd acknowledged that the recession has lowered property values, but argued 
that the land should still be worth $70,000 to $80,000 an acre. He cited 
similar prices in comparable land sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developer argued, and two of three panel members agreed, that the land 
should be taxed at agricultural levels until development is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these plans are certain, and in fact, one alternative presented was 
no development option," Richard Shapiro, a representative for the developer, 
told the board. "In other words, a zoning change is unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro cited major hurdles, including an environmental impact review now 
under way, approval of annexation by Oxnard and "approval by an ever-changing 
City Council, with ever-changing political pressures and intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he found the arguments convincing, particularly in light of two 
court cases requiring the assessor to prove that the land will be developed "in 
the predictable future." "The assessor has a burden to carry," Flynn said. "The 
assessor has to be able to predict within a reasonable time frame." PHYLLIS W.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MOTORIST SHOT WHILE WAITING AT STOP SIGN

<P>
 A 32-year-old Ventura man was critically wounded by a gunman who walked up and 
shot him while he was waiting at a stop sign in his minivan, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Edward Rios was in critical condition at Ventura County Medical Center 
on Wednesday, a nursing supervisor said.He suffered at least one gunshot wound 
to the head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios was driving the minivan belonging to his family's janitorial service 
north on Callens Road about 11 p.m. Tuesday when he braked for a stop sign at 
Market Street, Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rios was stopped, a man wearing dark clothing and a ski mask walked 
across the street in front of the van and suddenly pulled out a handgun and 
began firing at Rios and a co-worker, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't discovered a reason why, at this point," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled as the wounded Rios drove across the intersection. He crashed 
the van into a bus bench and mailbox, Anderson said. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LAW PROPOSED FOR OUTSIDE DINING AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As warmer weather arrives and restaurant patios begin to appeal to diners, 
Thousand Oaks officials have proposed a new ordinance on outside dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners approved the draft ordinance earlier this week and sent 
it to the City Council for consideration.The proposal regulates outdoor 
smoking, street setbacks and sign placement on awnings and umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-table outdoor expansion planned by owners of Roxy's Deli on Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard prompted city planners to draft the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have any guidelines," planner Haider Alawami said. "This will 
take care of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Alawami said the city's smoking ordinance, which prohibits smokers from 
lighting up within 20 feet of a restaurant's entrance, will also be extended to 
outside dining areas under the new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mervyn Kopp, the only commissioner to vote against the proposed ordinance, 
said he thought the restrictions on smoking outside at Roxy's were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say we don't want you to inhale smoke when you can inhale major pollutants 
from cars going by on a major thoroughfare like Thousand Oaks Boulevard is just 
silly," Kopp said. "I like to eat at Roxy's, but I'll eat inside thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance calls for enforcing the city's already strict sign 
policies by prohibiting restaurant owners from displaying advertisements or 
identification on shade umbrellas or patio awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners also agreed to allow restaurant owners an average distance of 10 
feet between the street and the edge of their outdoor dining areas. Alawami 
said the arrangement would give owners more leeway to build in limited space. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to consider the draft ordinance May 17. MARY F.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; REMOVAL OF OAK FOR FLOOD PROJECT 
PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials said Wednesday that they are investigating the unapproved 
removal of an oak tree at the site of a county flood control project under 
construction in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They are investigating whether the county needed a permit to take down the oak 
at the debris basin project next to a sensitive wetland on Reino Road between 
Lynn Road and Kimber Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue really is whether we can require a permit of another government 
agency," Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without the permit, Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah said she was 
outraged that the county did not inform the city of its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, the flood control district has shown an incredible 
unwillingness to cooperate," Zeanah said. "I am putting this on next week's 
City Council agenda so we can begin to see what rights we have as a city." 
</P>
<P>
 A subcontractor on the project said Wednesday that the county supervised the 
removal of all growth and vegetation on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clearing was all done under the strict direction of Ventura County flood 
control," contractor Larry Mosler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Ventura County Flood Control District could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosler also said that, since news reports were aired saying the project may be 
draining the neighboring wetland, much of his equipment has been vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, he said, vandals broke windows and tore out instrument 
panels on the grading equipment being used on the project, causing about $1,000 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosler said he believed that the attack on his machinery stemmed from concerns 
that the project may be draining the wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to understand that we're just doing our job out there, and that 
equipment belongs to us, not the county," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they have a complaint, they should take it up with the people who set the 
policies." MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ENTREPRENEURIAL FOURTH-GRADERS SHOW A 
PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lessons of free enterprise came quickly Wednesday in Kathy Turner's 
fourth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition. Patent infringement. Product demand. Surly customers. Those were 
the pitfalls that troubled students in Turner's class as they tried to hawk 
homemade products during a chaotic half-hour bazaar at Wildwood Elementary 
School in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Elsea, 10, said the secret of success was sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary and his partner, Jason Kaminsky, 10, carved out a profitable niche at 
earlier markets by selling huge chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people were doing cookies, but no one else was doing giant cookies," 
Zachary said. "We sold out in two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, the partners' non-patented cookies clearly had 
competition. Several other students also were hawking huge cookies, and sales 
for Zachary and Jason had slipped slightly. As a result, the pair cut their 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're the only one doing it, you can place it as high as you want," Jason 
said. "But if we have competition, we lower it, or if it's not going well we 
lower it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the competition, the pair still made a healthy profit of $168 in 
school-issued scrip, thanks in part to the chocolate milkshakes sold along with 
the cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students sold jars of potpourri, cups of mints, bags of popcorn, fake 
tattoos, snow cones, green origami frogs and decorated stationery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty easy to make money because everybody buys everything," said 
10-year-old Tom Nicholas as he stood near the snow-cone booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildwood's open market was part of a yearlong lesson in capitalism and civic 
duties that combines math, social studies and writing skills. Since September, 
Turner's class, along with fourth-graders taught by Karen Buck, have created 
mini-societies of small businesses and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, the students get a $100 paycheck but have to fork over $50 for desk 
rental. Other costs include $2 to go to the bathroom during a non-authorized 
time, $25 for a business license and $2 for pencils and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also can be fined $2 for being tardy, $5 for late homework and a 
whopping $50 each for showing dishonesty or disrespect. Losses can be recouped 
by doing extra classwork or on market day. 
</P>
<P>
 After each market day, the teachers helped students analyze any business 
problems they had. Wednesday's topics included a line for the snow-cone booth 
that blocked another student's display, patent infringement and rude customers.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY OKS REZONING TO ALLOW 4 HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting pleas to protect the region's ridgelines, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council has agreed to rezone 16 hilly acres in Newbury Park to accommodate up 
to four single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep, scrub-covered property, visible south of the Ventura Freeway 
between Rancho Conejo Boulevard and Ventu Park Road, actually lies in an 
unincorporated pocket outside the city's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 But owners Larry and Grace Mosler have said they hope to annex their land to 
Thousand Oaks, provided the city rezones the property to allow more development 
than the one residence permitted under county rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action Tuesday night "pre-zones" the Mosler's property for up to 
four residences, signaling an intention to take formal action once the land is 
incorporated and comes under city control. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Moslers could begin building, they would have to bring a specific 
development plan before the council. The pre-zoning establishes the parameters 
for development but does not guarantee approval for any given blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moslers had requested a change to allow seven houses, and Larry Mosler 
said he was not happy with the four-house limit after Tuesday's hearing. His 
attorney, Chuck Cohen, said he would consider taking the zone-change request to 
the county and scrapping plans for annexation to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moslers' property is situated on sharp slopes that normally would be 
protected by city ridgeline policy. But a majority of council members said they 
believed that several houses could be developed on an already graded flat pad 
without degrading the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski dissented, arguing that the 
new zoning would destroy open space and undercut the city's tough 
ridgeline-protection guidelines. STEPHANIE SIMON

ELECTIONS /4TH SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT; SIMI'S MIKELS POINTS TO HER EXPERIENCE 
IN BID TO SUCCEED HOWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protecting funding for law enforcement, keeping government off the backs of 
business and establishing a commercial airport at Point Mugu are among the 
goals Judy Mikels plans to pursue if elected to the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Simi Valley City Council, Mikels said she understands the 
concerns residents have about crime in their neighborhoods and schools. As the 
owner of a small framing business, she said she knows firsthand the need for 
economic recovery and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, 48, said she also has a regional perspective on issues facing the 
county. She is a member of the Ventura County Council on Economic Vitality, the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments and the California Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience sets me apart" from her two opponents, said Mikels, who has 
been endorsed by outgoing Supervisor Vicky Howard. "I'm really in this just to 
make sure that the people of this county have a real shot at keeping this area 
what they want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who has decided not to seek a second term, described Mikels as 
dedicated, hard-working and knowledgeable on local as well as county and 
regional issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's extremely hard-working," Howard said. "And that's important because 
this is a job that requires a lot of time and dedication on top of everything 
else because it's a moving target. There are new issues and new problems coming 
up all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Planning Commissioner Michael Piper, who has worked with Mikels on 
the council and the Planning Commission, agreed with Howard's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Judy is absolutely the most qualified candidate," Piper said. "The 
energy is there, and the intellect is there. She has invested a lot of time in 
understanding the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Mikels said one of her top priorities would be to ensure that the 
county's law enforcement agencies and criminal justice system have adequate 
staffing and equipment to do their jobs effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to put our resources where we need them most, and I think that is in 
law enforcement," said Mikels, who has been endorsed by former Simi Valley 
Police Chief Paul Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To help stimulate the economy and bring new jobs to the area, Mikels supports 
a proposal to establish a commercial airport at Point Mugu. The Navy has 
offered to share its runway with the county to reduce operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need it for safety, for revenue and for business growth," Mikels said, 
adding that a shared use of the runway would also protect the Navy base from 
possible closure in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need those jobs," she said. "It's not just the military, but all the 
contractors and subcontractors that work for the government on that base. 
You're talking about a tremendous amount of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some critics say there is not enough of a demand for passenger 
service to support a commercial airport, Mikels said it is important for the 
county to take steps to protect its options with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say we don't need commercial air service in this county is very 
shortsighted," she said. "Maybe we don't need it in the next five years, but if 
we don't protect Point Mugu until we grow into the need for full commercial 
service, then we're never going to site another airport in this county again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she also supports a proposal to add a new $30-million outpatient 
wing to Ventura County Medical Center. The Board of Supervisors has approved 
the expansion in concept but will not consider a funding package until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has prompted Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura to launch a 
campaign against expansion of the public hospital, which it considers an 
emerging competitor for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she believes that the public's health needs will continue to 
increase in the future "and I don't believe private hospitals are going to be 
prepared to take care of those needs." 
</P>
<P>
 If President Clinton's health plan is passed, however, Mikels said then the 
county may want to take another look at the scope of the project to determine 
its financial viability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on that, I might delay expansion if it is fiscally prudent to do so," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels also backs a proposal to develop a new landfill at Weldon Canyon near 
Ojai to serve the cities of the west county. Bailard Landfill in Oxnard is 
slated to close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels worries that if another landfill site is not developed in the interim, 
then west county cities could end up shipping their trash to the Simi Valley 
Landfill, which she strongly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ojai officials have successfully fought a new west county dump, a 
group of San Diego investors who want to develop a landfill at Weldon Canyon is 
collecting signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, who is an alternate member on the East County Waste Task Force, 
questions whether a ballot initiative would be legally binding because of all 
the regulatory agencies that would be involved. But she said she supports a 
ballot measure because "it would force the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she has personally surveyed the Weldon Canyon site and believes 
that it is the best location for a new dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a NIMBY thing with me," she said. "It's just a good solid place to 
put a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
 In other issues, Mikels said she agrees that firefighters in the future should 
receive a share of money generated from Proposition 172 -- a half-cent sales 
tax initiative approved by state voters in November for public safety programs. 
The money is now split among law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we get a new fire chief in place, I think firefighters could and should 
go back to the table and be a part of the Proposition 172 funding," Mikels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said she always planned to run for county supervisor; she just 
never knew when. Then one day in early February, she got a surprise call from 
Howard, who said she would not be seeking reelection. Would Mikels be 
interested in running? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I said no, because my mind was so boggled," Mikels said. "It was 
such a traumatic announcement. I honestly expected Vicky to go two terms or 
maybe three." 
</P>
<P>
 But after discussing the issue with her family and doing some soul-searching, 
Mikels decided to enter the race, with Howard's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her motivation for running, Mikels said, was because the only 
announced candidate at the time was her council colleague Barbara Williamson. 
Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery announced his candidacy the same day 
as Mikels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I just didn't think Barbara was going to do a good job" 
because of her lack of government experience, Mikels said. Mikels was elected 
to the council in 1990 and Williamson in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she believes that Williamson is still learning the ins and outs of 
city government and is not prepared to make the jump to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can just walk into this job and know everything," she said. "It's an 
incredible learning curve. There's public safety issues, planning issues, 
public works issues . . . and you've got to make the effort to learn it. I 
don't see that she's done that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williamson, a vice president at Simi Valley Bank, sees her newcomer status 
as an advantage. She paints Mikels as a defender of the status quo and says 
what voters want is new leadership in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want another Vicky Howard," said Williamson, who has been outspoken 
in her criticism of the supervisor for what she perceives as a lack of 
leadership. "In essence, that's exactly what we're going to get if Judy gets 
elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson stresses that Mikels was Howard's third choice to run for 
supervisor. She noted that Howard had also consulted with Mayor Greg Stratton, 
who had already committed to run for county auditor-controller, and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was the 50th choice, it didn't matter," said Mikels, who stands to lose 
her council seat if she either wins the supervisor race in June or qualifies 
for a runoff in November. "If I decided to run, it was because I wanted to run. 
It didn't matter what anybody else wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 While Howard in many ways has served as her political mentor, Mikels pointed 
out that the two have distinctly different personalities and styles of 
governing. Howard is quiet and studious; Mikels is outspoken and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot like Vicky in that I do my homework," Mikels said. "I'm unlike 
Vicky in that I'm not very often perceived to be a lady. I have a reputation 
for being tough. I won't be walked on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she believes that Howard's endorsement is a vote of confidence in 
her abilities and one that will help draw support for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important," Mikels said of Howard's endorsement. "She is very highly 
regarded in the district. For those people I can't get to, if they were pleased 
with Vicky and know her integrity, they will support me. I think it shows that 
Vicky believes I can do the same or as good a job as she can." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mikels received Miller's endorsement, the Simi Valley Police Officers 
Assn. and the Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Assn. have endorsed Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Williams, president of the Sheriff's Deputy Assn., said the union 
believed that Williamson's banking experience would give her an advantage in 
dealing with county budget matters and ensuring that law enforcement was 
protected from cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was not a vote against Judy, but an endorsement of Barbara," he 
said. "We think both of them are very fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels played down the importance of Williamson's endorsements, saying they 
were representative of the unions' leadership and not from the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally have a lot of support from individuals" in those agencies, she 
said. After pausing a moment, Mikels added: "Endorsements are funny. I'm not 
sure they really help all that much." Profile of Judy Mikels

GIRL TELLS OF BEATINGS, TORTURE BY MOTHER; COURTS: THE WESTLAKE 16-YEAR-OLD, 
WHO WAS LOCKED IN A FAMILY RACQUETBALL COURT, TESTIFIES IN CHARLOTTE RUSSO'S 
CHILD-ABUSE TRIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 The teen-age daughter of an affluent Westlake woman on trial for child abuse 
testified Wednesday about years of torture and humiliation, including being 
beaten, hosed down and forced to live in the bathroom of the family's 
racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, after she picked the lock of the bathroom door to escape, her mother 
ordered her to disrobe and proceeded to strip search her in an attempt to find 
the key, the girl told a jury in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, 51, faces one count of felony child abuse for allegedly 
biting the girl and one misdemeanor count of child abuse for locking her in the 
racquetball court, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, now 16, was the first of dozens of witnesses expected to take the 
stand during Russo's trial, which is expected to last four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the girl's testimony, attorneys for both sides agreed that Russo 
incarcerated her inside the racquetball court's bathroom and that the woman had 
bitten her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney James M. Farley and Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona 
disagreed as to the circumstances surrounding those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In her opening remarks, Corona called Russo a wicked mother who went beyond 
the acceptable level of discipline, physically and emotionally torturing her 
child for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being jailed for months in the racquetball court bathroom, the 
girl was "scratched, pinched, slapped, bitten and punched by her mother," 
contended Corona. The prosecutor called Russo's conduct "outrageous treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, however, described Russo as an ideal suburban mother who was only 
looking to instill a degree of responsibility into an unruly child. The girl, 
Farley said, manufactured her claims of abuse "for the purposes of gaining 
attention and becoming the center of attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that the girl had medical troubles when Russo and her husband, 
Richard, adopted her at the age of 1. The girl testified that she has had heart 
surgeries four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlotte Russo is not the wicked mother who has singled out one child . . . 
for abuse," Farley argued, saying it is wrong to portray the victim as the 
"Cinderella stepdaughter of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, however, took the witness stand and described alleged events at 
the Russo's nine-bedroom home on Outlook Circle in just that manner. 
</P>
<P>
 She responded to some questions from Corona with precise detail, while 
appearing to have difficulty understanding some others. Twice, as the girl 
grappled with responses, Corona asked Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. for a short 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said she lived a fairly normal childhood until the seventh grade, 
when her mother perceived her to be underachieving in school. The girl said her 
grades were Bs and Cs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, she said her mother began leaving her out of family plans and making her 
sleep in a dressing room of the racquetball court, which is detached from the 
family's home. The girl said her mother enrolled her in summer school in 1990 
at La Reina High School, requiring her to ride her bike the seven-mile 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo became even more upset with her, the girl said, when she would 
hitchhike to classes. As punishment when she got home, the girl said she was 
forced to lay on her back, raise her feet in the air and pedal an imaginary 
bike until she was exhausted and hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 By Halloween, 1992, she said she was sleeping in the dressing room of the 
$75,000 racquetball court full time and excluded from family activities, such 
as "family fun day" on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "What were you doing when the rest of the family was having fun?" Corona 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the racquetball court," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her mother also began referring to her by profane names. When asked 
what the names were, she declined to say, but did write them down for the jury. 
Among the milder ones were "tramp (just like your mother)" and "no good." She 
said the "mother" referred to was her biological mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She was allowed back in the home for two days after having a seizure in March, 
1992, she testified, until her mother woke her one morning at 2 and ordered her 
back into the racquetball court for not completing her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after that, she said, that her access in the racquetball court 
was limited to the bathroom, where her father had configured the lock to work 
from the outside so she could not leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girl said she picked the lock with the spring from the spool that held 
the toilet tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd put the wire in through the hole (on the lock), and it popped. When it 
popped, I thought, 'Great!' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to stay in there for God knows how long," she said. ". . . It 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said she only walked around the racquetball court and was careful to 
return to the bathroom before her mother returned. But she said her mother 
noticed that the door had been unlocked and searched the bathroom for a key. 
That is also when Russo conducted a search of the girl's body cavities, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the girl said her daily routine included eating the same meal every day. 
At one point that meal was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. Later, she said, it changed to oatmeal, eggs and orange 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
 She also testified that she was showered down with cold water from the garden 
hose on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 When she complained about the cold water, her mother told her that she "didn't 
deserve hot water," the girl testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo has pleaded guilty to a single count of misdemeanor child abuse 
and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He and his wife are expected to testify 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, meanwhile, is expected to be back on the stand when the trial 
resumes this afternoon.

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA TO MAKE A NAME FOR ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the silver spurs, 10-gallon hats and red bandannas bouncing through Conejo 
Valley Days this week start to seem a bit hokey, Thousand Oaks' cultural mavens 
can offer some relief: a delicate gold stickpin boosting the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The rectangular pins, which feature a leaping dancer against a turquoise 
background, will sell for $3 apiece at this week's Western-themed festival. 
</P>
<P>
 They're the first -- and likely the cheapest -- of an expected gush of Civic 
Arts Plaza paraphernalia. From limited-edition medallions to colorful 
silk-screened T-shirts, a barrage of mementos bearing the performing arts 
center's logo should hit Thousand Oaks this summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchandise, which must be licensed by the city attorney, will commemorate 
both the Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening and Thousand Oaks' 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Most will bear one of the Civic Arts Plaza's logos: a graceful silhouette 
known as the "Exuberant Muse," or two dancers cavorting on a stylized piano 
keyboard under an oak tree.  
</P>
<P>
 In approving the concept late Tuesday, Thousand Oaks council members turned 
all licensing decisions over to a citizens committee organizing October's grand 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive director of the performing arts center, Tom Mitze has established 
just one ground rule -- no weapons can be licensed. In lieu of assault rifles, 
he suggested the Exuberant Muse might look good on tote bags, cups and other 
inexpensive, family-oriented products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have everything from crystal goblets all the way on down to coffee 
mugs," theater Commissioner Julian Macdonald said. "We could have a tremendous 
price range, so everyone in the community would have a keepsake." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program approved Tuesday, vendors must first approach the citizens 
committee with proposals. They can then negotiate for the right to use the 
Civic Arts Plaza logos. Vendors selling the merchandise for charity might get a 
discount, whereas others might have to pay a percentage of their profits in 
royalties, Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a group called Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza may set up a 
permanent souvenir store in the building's lobby. For now, however, most 
marketing will focus on the grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Thousand Oaks resident Scott Bennett, now an account executive at 
Liberty Mint in Utah, told the council his firm is prepared to launch a line of 
medallions. Bennett believes he could sell several thousand silver coins for 
about $30 apiece.

CONEJO VALLEY DAYS OPENS WITH A SHIVER; THOUSAND OAKS: HUNDREDS TURN OUT ON 
FIRST DAY OF CARNIVAL DESPITE THE COLD. MANY REMAIN UPBEAT DESPITE THE WEATHER 
FORECAST FOR WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the opening night of the Conejo Valley Days carnival, 16-year-old Katie 
Petrick sat shivering on the platform of the dunking booth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing only a bathing suit in the 50-degree chill, Petrick and a half-dozen 
other Newbury Park High School cheerleaders worked harder to maintain their 
smiles than they ever did at a losing football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're freezing to death, but we're still having fun," Petrick said after 
being dunked. "This is what Conejo Valley Days is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be true this year, as hundreds showed up Wednesday night for the 
first day of the five-day country-Western festival despite the cold and the 
thick cover of black clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while weekend forecasts include the chance of rain on Saturday and 
Sunday, everyone from the grand marshal to a sandal saleswoman tried to remain 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has done so much work and made this place look so great, I just 
think it's going to be terrific," said Maria Prescott, this year's grand 
marshal. "Rain can't kill the spirit here." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, volunteers hammered the final spikes and turned the last few 
screws, and Conejo Valley Days officials cut the ceremonial ribbon to open the 
carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shimmering white tents, hundreds of booths and rides, and an 86-foot-tall 
brightly lit "skywheel" filled the grass lot at the Moorpark Freeway and Janss 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next four days, festival officials said, as many as 75,000 people are 
expected to crowd the site to buy food, merchandise and enjoy the rides and 
games, all to raise money for area charities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a 37-year-old festival steeped in tradition, and has long included 
events like the women's Western wear competition, the interservice luncheon and 
bingo -- which are scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Slated for the weekend are a rodeo, a parade down Thousand Oaks Boulevard and 
a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always start slower on Wednesday and Thursday and build up toward the 
weekend," said Doug Ross of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. "You'll see 
on the weekend that things will really get hopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and about 25 others attended the quiet ribbon-cutting ceremony at 5:30 
p.m. Wednesday in a remote corner of the festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, area residents began streaming onto the site to sample the food and try 
the rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake residents Sam and Gerry Minas brought two of their grandchildren to 
the event and strolled casually around the children's tent, which is a new 
addition to the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a fantastic way to relax and to show the kids a good time," 
Sam Minas said as he helped his grandson pan for gold. "The kids just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the main tent, representatives from a host of nonprofit groups offered 
literature and information, and vendors sold items ranging from cowboy hats to 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandal saleswoman Georgiann Tommasino said she was excited about the event, 
but cautiously eyed the sky, hoping rain wouldn't dampen her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think even in the cold weather people will come in and buy the sandals," 
Tommasino said. "But I think the weather's going to get better. This is just to 
tease us." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters from the National Weather Service, however, were less confident 
that the skies would turn blue for the remaining four Conejo Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
 Daytime temperatures through Sunday are never expected to get above the 
mid-60s and there is a chance of rain late Saturday and early Sunday as a 
second storm crosses over Southern California, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't turn out that way," said Christina Blanchard, who is 
selling frozen-banana ice cream to raise money for the Rainbow Girls of Conejo 
Valley. "All we can do is hope for the best."

COUPLE SUES CITY OVER DRAIN FLOODING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks couple, who say a city storm drain has caused severe flooding 
on their property, sued the city in Ventura County Superior Court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald and Jean Lowe claim that a storm-drain system fails to divert water 
from Moorpark Road, leading to serious damage to their home and property on 
Calle Jazmin.They asked for a restraining order to prevent the city from 
operating the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attorney, Steven E. Young, said that periodically the Lowe's home 
"becomes a lake" because of the storm drain. He said the lawsuit was filed 
because city officials have ignored a claim for damages filed by the Lowes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Atty. Bob Rogers said the city settled an earlier claim 
with the Lowes, paying them $1,582 in 1991, after they won an appeal in small 
claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said their latest claim, asking the city for $50,000, was filed after a 
drainage system overflowed in February, 1993. "They're not going to get that," 
Rogers said. "So, I guess they're going to court." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is no proof the city is responsible for the couple's dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said damage to the Lowes' house is extensive. He said floors, carpet and 
drywall have been destroyed, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has allowed this problem to continue over and over again," Young 
said. He said no other residences appear affected by the flooding.

FINLEY GOES DOWN, ANGELS KNOCKED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers thought he had figured out the key to Chuck Finley's early season 
struggles and it didn't take all his years of expertise or hours of studying 
videotape to reach the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Chuck gets behind, they sit on his fastball," the Angel manager said, 
"and when you're always 2-0 and 3-1 in the count, I don't care if you're Sandy 
Koufax, it's pretty hard to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so far, he's just had one bad inning that's hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Rodgers' theory proved half right. Baltimore got to Finley 
for four runs in the sixth inning en route to a 13-1 victory in front of 20,569 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't because Finley couldn't find the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, making his 200th career start in a light misting rain, struck out 
seven and walked only one, but he gave up three home runs, the most homers he's 
allowed in exactly a year. The Yankees hit four homers against Finley last 
April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who doesn't understand what the count means to hitters, doesn't 
understand this game," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 On this evening, the Orioles either didn't quite get it or didn't much care. 
Mike Devereaux hit a bases-empty homer in the fourth inning on a 1-2 pitch. 
Rafael Palmiero had a slight advantage in the count (2-1) when he led off the 
sixth with a prodigious homer over the 386 sign in right-center. Chris Hoiles' 
two-run shot to left two batters later came off Finley's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a pretty good ballgame going through five," Rodgers said. 
"How mistaken I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Making light of the heavy air, Baltimore pounded out a club-record 11 
extra-base hits. In Finley's previous three starts, the Angels lost by one run. 
This time, that sort of disappointment wasn't much of a prospect after the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty good about the way he was pitching," Rodgers said. "He was 
getting ahead of guys and had made 20 or 25 fewer pitches in the early innings 
than he had been. He was going along good and then the . . . hit the fan." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Rodgers concerned? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to sit down and talk about some things, to look at some 
film," he said. "We need to talk about how he feels, go over the thought 
process involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The game became out of reach -- and nearly out of control -- in the seventh 
inning when Scott Lewis came out of the Angel bullpen and gave up a single to 
Jeff Hammonds, a double to Palmiero and a a three-run homer by Cal Ripken -- on 
1-1 pitch -- that hit the top of the short fence in the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was gone before he recorded an out . . . and before Rodgers had a chance 
to make a pitching change. Lewis hit Hoiles in the helmet with an 0-2 fastball 
and was ejected. Hoiles appeared unfazed and jumped immediately to his feet, 
but both benches and bullpens emptied, even Angel bullpen catcher Mick 
Billmeyer trotted out with a cast on his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the turf was too soggy, but the usually obligatory rugby scrum never 
materialized and the Angels went quietly into the damp night, still clinging to 
a share of first place in the American League West with a 9-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles put together three consecutive doubles with two outs in the eighth 
inning and handed Ben McDonald a nice little double-figure advantage going into 
the eighth. They made it a dozen going into the ninth when Brady Anderson hit 
his third homer in two games -- on a 2-2 Joe Grahe delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, who became the first pitcher in the American League to earn his 
fifth victory, allowed the first runner he faced in the game to score and 
yielded four hits in the first three innings. But he settled down and allowed 
just two baserunners in the next three innings and retired the side in order in 
the sixth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who apparently was attempting to heed Rodgers' advice, jumped ahead of 
each hitter in the first inning, but still managed to prove he's his worst 
enemy. He had leadoff hitter Anderson 0-2 before giving up a single to right. 
Anderson stole second and ended up on third when Finley's errant pickoff throw 
went into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who was the victim when Billy Hatcher stole home Friday night in 
Boston, was pitching from the stretch this time, but Ripken's bloop single put 
the Orioles ahead, 1-0.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: RELAXATION HELPS PUT LEWIS BACK IN 
SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most maddening thing for Amy Lewis was that she knew she was a good 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been showing it game after game in the early part of this season for 
the Southern California College softball team. Then the Golden State Athletic 
Conference season started and she managed only three hits in the first eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bad," Lewis said. "It seemed like I would hit really well against our 
nonconference opponents, then I would go totally in the tank in the conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting caught up in the numbers thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That can be excused on a team that hits as well as the Vanguards, who lead the 
NAIA District 3 in batting average at .324. Six starters are batting better 
than .300, including Lewis. But that's only after a major rally last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the key to breaking the slump was extra work after practice and 
learning to relax at the plate. After that, breaking through wasn't hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
 She batted .647 (11 for 17) in the Vanguards' final six regular-season games 
last week, boosting her average 42 points to .336. Lewis, a junior from Rancho 
Santiago College and Villa Park High, had five doubles, a triple and drove in 
nine runs and was named District 3 player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 After the slump, Lewis was tickled by her performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was even laughing after the hits," she said. "I was standing out on the 
bases cracking up. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bekki Turner, who co-coaches the Vanguards with Terry Zeigler, wasn't 
surprised. Turner hadn't been concerned during the slump; Lewis was helping in 
other ways. Even before last week, Lewis led the district in runs batted in and 
triples (she now has 48 RBIs and 10 triples) and Turner believes she is the 
best defensive catcher in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "She controls the game from behind the plate," Turner said. "She keeps people 
up and is a good leader on the field."

second consecutive Golden State Athlete Conference title and will play host to 
the District 3 tournament, May 6-7.

<P>
 Azusa Pacific and Cal Baptist, assured of finishing second and third in the 
conference, are the other two teams in the tournament. SCC is 8-0 against those

 Compton settlement -- A story in Tuesday's editions incorrectly said the 
family of two unarmed brothers, shot to death in their driveway three years ago 
by a Compton police officer, will receive $4 million to $6 million under a 
settlement with the city. In fact, Compton has tentatively agreed to make a 
cash payment of $2.1 million to settle the lawsuit.In addition, six children of 
one of the men are expected to receive the proceeds from the investment of part 
of the money. A lawyer for the victims' family contends that those payments, 
made over several decades, could amount to a total payout of up to $6 million. 
However, the city's risk management expert says it is impossible to determine 
the amount of money that the investments will return.

 "Decorating your home is like good sex," Susan Ashbrook says. It takes a lot 
of time and patience to get it just right. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled objects throughout her two-bedroom, Craftsman-style bungalow in 
Venice were found over many years -- on routine scouting missions to garage 
sales, thrift shops and flea markets. They add up to the kind of place where 
friends and house guests linger. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ashbrook, a publicist for the Donahue Group in Beverly Hills, was in her 
20s, "Everything was about instant gratification." Now in her 30s, "I have the 
patience to wait for something great." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her most memorable finds are a gaggle of American-made green vases with 
identical glazes from the 1930s, and a vanity plucked from a thrift shop near 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift shopping takes a strong commitment, says Ashbrook, who does "drive-bys" 
of her favorite spots almost daily. But, above all, it requires confidence in 
your personal style. When she left one shop with a bunch of glass grapes 
rendered in the form of a lamp, people laughed, pronouncing it exceptionally 
ugly. If only they could see it now -- wired to illuminate her garden. Sources
