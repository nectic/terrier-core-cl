 FLY SWARM: Two crop-eating cousins of the Medfly have surfaced recently -- but 
not in Ventura County. . . . Three guava fruit flies were found in Pomona and 
four Oriental fruit flies were discovered in Walnut Park, both in Los Angeles 
County. . . . But hold the aerial malathion spraying, please. Instead, workers 
hand-spray a lethal mix of bait and pesticide that kills only the male flies. 
</P>
<P>
 FEELING GOOD: Tracy Sproule of Ventura completed the Gatorade Ironman 
Triathlon over the weekend, finishing 11th in the 18-to-24 age group (C6). . . 
. Triumphing over tough conditions, including brutal heat and winds during the 
race in Hawaii, was "one of the best feelings in the world," the 23-year-old 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAZA ACCESS: Some Thousand Oaks residents worry that the Civic Arts Plaza 
isn't accessible to the disabled (B1). . . . In an Oxnard program designed to 
give the disabled greater access to public buildings, four volunteers have 
collected $75,000 in fines from motorists who park illegally in spaces reserved 
for the disabled. Now, officials are looking to expand the program. . . . "The 
community wins because they get money for access modifications," said Glenn 
McIntyre, an Oxnard police officer who uses a wheelchair and helps oversee the 
program. "And people with disabilities win because they get more open parking 
spaces."

 A newly revealed side effect of malathion?Christopher Smith of Camarillo, the 
latest home of a gang of Medflies, picked up a flyer from GASP, whose letters 
stand for Group Against Spraying People. At least, we think they do. But the 
flyer used the word "Spaying."

 Off the news rack: We were shocked -- shocked! -- to find photos of Police 
Chief Willie Williams in the National Enquirer and Star tabloids. It turns out 
they were merely shots taken at the Jack Webb Tribute, a fund-raiser for the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Historical Museum. Williams posed with a group 
of actors who had portrayed cops through the years.

<P>
 But where was Lt. Frank Drebin of "Police Squad"? Probably got lost on the 
way.

 Can't be too careful these days: Eva Hain alerted us to the fact that the LAPD 
has a little backup help at its substation in the Larchmont area (see photo).

 The Demento touch: The legacy of the late Jim Healy, the wacky KMPC 
sportscaster, lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 Whimsical Will Simpson is emulating Healy's use of news bites for comical 
effect in his broadcasts on the Dr. Demento radio show. Whimsical Will, whose 
"Demento News" segments can be heard on Sunday nights on 101.9 FM, also employs 
countless blurbs, including some from Healy's collection of utterances by 
Howard Cosell and others. (One of our favorites is honorary Hollywood Mayor 
Johnny Grant's quote, "Aw, blow it out," which he barked at some protesters.) 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC, meanwhile, is selling tapes ($12 apiece) of its entertaining 90-minute 
special on Healy, produced by Steve Bailey. Proceeds go to the American Cancer 
Society. (Information: 310-840-4914.)

 Next the DMV will want an arm and a leg: Here's another slapstick story from 
the folks at the Department of Motor Vehicles, who occasionally issue driver's 
licenses with the wrong people's photos on them. 
</P>
<P>
 This one concerns the driver's license renewal form. Both Andrew Sincosky of 
West Covina and Leonard Martinez of Canoga Park noticed that their letters had 
lines of mangled type that gave the impression that, in addition to the usual 
fees, the DMV wants its ounces of flesh.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; MORE, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday's long-awaited debate between Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown was lively 
and illuminating, but by no means did it explore all the differences between 
the two gubernatorial candidates. Clearly the matter of debates should not be 
put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has challenged Wilson to more debates but he has declined. The governor 
should reconsider. The issues in this campaign and the trade-offs for this 
beleaguered state are far too complex for the two to satisfactorily explore in 
just one hour. The people of California deserve another opportunity to hear 
them in face-to-face confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of debates, where are the folks from Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds 
and the other large tobacco companies that are bankrolling Proposition 188? 
Apparently hiding behind that cloud of rhetorical smoke about "tough but 
reasonable" smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions embodied in Proposition 188 would repeal all the truly tough 
local smoking ordinances already on the books. The measure would kill the 
farsighted statewide workplace smoking ban scheduled to take effect in January. 
In their place it would put -- surprise -- rules much friendlier to cigarettes. 
Cities, counties and the Legislature would be barred from ever adopting tougher 
rules to protect nonsmokers.  
</P>
<P>
 To Philip Morris and friends, the less said the better. No doubt that's why 
industry backers of the measure have declined almost all requests to debate its 
merits. They claim to be waging a "cerebral" campaign to educate voters. Looks 
more like they're trying to play with voters' heads.

RED LINE BREAKTHROUGH AT HAND?; SUBWAY OPTION -- WITH A CAVEAT -- NOW CLEARLY 
IS BETTER THAN FREEWAY ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We hope there will never again be a mass transit decision-making process that 
is as bitter and drawn out as that of the east-west San Fernando Valley rail 
project. Arguing over how to extend the Red Line subway across the width of the 
Valley has gone on for five years, and the matter may yet deteriorate into a 
swamp of legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be sad, given the scarcity of transportation dollars and the 
Federal Transit Administration's recent order halting federal funds for the Red 
Line until construction and management problems are resolved. There must be no 
further delay in a decision on the Valley rail project. Fortunately, one option 
has emerged as the more sensible choice -- with a caveat. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considers the matter late this 
month, it will have the choice of a subway route along Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards or an above-ground option along the Ventura Freeway. We strongly 
support the subway option. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, in an advisory vote, residents favored the freeway route. But 
the best cost estimate for the subway then stood at $3.03 billion, compared to 
$2.59 billion for the freeway route. The most recent cost estimates, based on 
new engineering, have shaved the edge to less than 1%: $2.27 billion for the 
subway and $2.25 billion for the freeway route. The new estimates were part of 
the reason the Los Angeles City Council, following the lead of several of its 
members from the Valley, voted 11 to 1 Tuesday for the subway option. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Transportation says that the subway could be 
more easily integrated with existing bus lines, would create less traffic 
congestion and would be easier to construct segment by segment if funding 
problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of another major earthquake, a separate subway and freeway would 
increase the chances of one surviving intact. Finally, $159 million has already 
been spent on subway rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
 The only caveat here is that the MTA must ensure that there be no repeat of 
the kind of outrageous tunneling problems that have marred construction efforts 
to date. Is that too much to ask?

IRAQI COMPLIANCE, NOT SWEET TALK; COPING WITH HUSSEIN'S HEGEMONIC AMBITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late last Saturday, after a dozen hours of pointed argument and negotiation, 
the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning Iraq's 
movement of troops close to the Kuwait border and demanding not only their 
withdrawal but also that Iraq never again threaten its neighbors. Less than 48 
hours later the consensus that put this resolution on record had fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, which had made no effort to mask its dissatisfaction with the 
resolution it found expedient to support Saturday night, discovers itself in 
deepening disagreement with the United States and to a lesser extent Britain 
over where U.N. policy toward Iraq should go next. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's view, as expressed by Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, is that the 
United States overreacted to what Baghdad intended to be innocent and routine 
military maneuvers in southern Iraq. Moreover, Iraq has made every effort to 
open up certain of its most suspect military facilities to U.N. inspections. 
Further, it says it is conditionally prepared to recognize Kuwait's 
independence, dropping its claim that Kuwait is a separated province of Iraq. 
Given this moderation, Moscow says, Iraq deserves to be rewarded. Russia wants 
the economic sanctions against Iraq eased. Specifically, it wants the ban on 
its oil sales lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The American response, as forcefully expressed by Ambassador Madeleine 
Albright, is that "words are cheap. Actions are the coin of the realm." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein trails a long and sordid record of meaningless promises and 
bogus assurances that can't be erased by yet more consoling lies and deceptive 
sweet talk. What Washington demands is full Iraqi compliance -- actions, not 
words -- with relevant U.N. resolutions. For starters, that means unequivocal 
recognition of Kuwait's independence and international borders. That, along 
with other appropriate unconditional actions, must precede any end to the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament had the chance a few days ago to renounce the 
claim to Kuwait. It didn't do so. Its deputy prime minister, Tarik Aziz, had 
the opportunity to underscore Iraq's honorable intentions when he spoke to the 
Security Council on Monday. He did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has powerful commercial reasons -- Baghdad has promised it both debt 
repayment and lucrative contracts -- for seeking a softer approach toward Iraq. 
But Washington has a more compelling motivation for insisting that Iraq abide 
by the U.N. resolutions: Neither this country nor its allies want to fight a 
second Persian Gulf war in response to Saddam Hussein's hegemonic ambitions. 
That really is what the debate over lifting the sanctions is about.

CONNELL FOR STATE CONTROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state controller is California's chief fiscal officer, signing the state 
government's checks, auditing the budget and helping oversee state pension 
funds. In this year's general election the two major-party candidates for the 
office are Democrat Kathleen Connell and Republican Tom McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times endorses Connell on the basis of her hands-on experience as a 
financial officer in the private sector and as a teacher on investment at UCLA 
and UC Berkeley. Connell's ideas for saving the state money through increased 
efficiency are also more doable than the provocative proposals that McClintock 
puts forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell won the Democratic primary by spending roughly $1.3 million of her own 
money. She became wealthy as an investment banker with her own firm and, before 
that, as a vice president of Chemical Bank in New York, where she advised 
cities and states on bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposes to help California deal with its fiscal woes by using some of the 
same tools of fiscal discipline that a private company would use if facing a 
budget shortfall of $5 billion to $6 billion such as that now looming for 
Sacramento. She promises that as state controller (salary $90,000) she would 
conduct an immediate performance audit to identify ways of reducing the deficit 
and launch an ongoing program of audits to continue searching out waste or 
fraud. In addition, she would implement performance-based budgeting for the 
state in a noble effort to hold departments and programs accountable under 
previously agreed-on standards of performance. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock, too, has ideas for saving money in Sacramento, but they tend to be 
politically unfeasible -- and generally reflective of the rigidly right-wing 
reputation he developed during 10 years in the state Assembly. He would, for 
instance, abolish the office of lieutenant governor and most of the governor's 
Cabinet. He argues these positions represent a useless layer of bureaucracy 
between the governor (whose staff budget he would cut 15%) and the state 
agencies that actually deliver services. While thought-provoking, such ideas 
are far out, not to mention far off. For now California government needs to 
focus all of its creative energies and financial resources on just getting the 
bills paid. McClintock is an impractical choice for such a key office.

IRAQ MOVES ON KUWAIT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * So Saddam Hussein has reared his ugly head again! Just as George Bush 
demonized this comic book villain four years ago, Bill Clinton is now taking 
his turn -- just in time for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had no business getting into the Iraq/Kuwait conflict in 
1990. I was part of the 10% who opposed the Gulf War. I am proud that my wife 
and I spent every weekend at the Federal Building in Westwood protesting this 
unjust, unnecessary war. The U.S. succeeded in killing 100,000 Iraqis, 
unfortunate people who didn't choose Saddam as their leader and had no way to 
get rid of him. This was clearly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Gulf War, the supposed "alternative" -- as if the situation is the 
U.S.' to fix -- has been economic sanctions. This policy hurts the people of 
Iraq. Our government can take responsibility for Iraqi children who face 
malnutrition, inadequate medical care, and shortages because goods can't get 
into the country. The embargo should end immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge President Clinton to drop the embargo against the Iraqi people and to 
withdraw all U.S. troops from the Middle East. The U.S. is not the world's 
policeman.  
</P>

<P>
 Present: Bill Clinton commits troops to the restoration of the legitimate 
government of Haiti; is pilloried for jeopardizing American troops in the 
absence of a threat to national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward: Demands are made on the Clinton Administration to commit troops 
to Kuwait to protect the oil reserves in the name of our national security 
interests.

 * Regarding your editorial, "Clinton Said 'No,' and Saddam Blinked," Oct. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 I think not. Clinton is still dealing with a military deck that Ronald Reagan 
provided, you know, in those greedy '80s, when he and his wife were trying to 
become millionaires in one-party Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The military was made strong again, first rate, in spite of the protests of 
the liberal Democrats in Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't you think it strange that the liberals who were so against the Gulf War, 
when George Bush was President, are now strangely silent, as Clinton tries to 
increase his poll numbers. Haiti. A great foreign policy victory? No. Just 
danger for American kids.

before Clinton sent 36,000 troops to oil-rich Kuwait, where the danger to the 
men and women of our military is far more real than it ever was in Haiti? Can 
anyone doubt that the trillionaire Emir of Kuwait thinks of Uncle Sam as "Uncle 
Sucker"?

 * Ross Perot's paranoid warning that President Clinton's strong response to 
Iraq's troop buildup along the Kuwait border is nothing but a ploy to gain 
strength in the upcoming election (Oct. 10) proves what many have suspected all 
along -- that Perot is not only inane, he is insane. I hate to think what would 
have happened to the world if Perot had been President in 1940.

 * Was Saddam Hussein really "naive" to think that he could shake off sanctions 
by dispatching his troops to the border? The last six months have been witness 
to a parade of renegade leaders who, strangled by global sanctions, have 
touched off international incidents to gain a bargaining chip. And whether it 
was Kim Il Sung, Fidel Castro or Raoul Cedras, the U.S. has gladly gone to the 
negotiating table with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Saddam was logically expecting Jimmy Carter to ride to his rescue.

<P>
 * The second coming of Saddam Hussein is the lesson that we seem unwilling to 
learn. Nearly all wars are caused by the ambitious self-love of one man. 
Saddam's single voice now summons us again to war as he luxuriates in fame. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can we hope that diplomacy, negotiations and compromise with another 
nation will substitute for individual redress. Instead, a world court must 
charge this man with crimes against humanity; arrest, convict and banish, not 
kill, but keep as living evidence of our determination to end war, the vice of 
the emperors. 
</P>
<P>
 Orderly progress is man's destiny. It will come when we establish a process 
that anticipates and suppresses these individual scourges of our future.

OIL SPILL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times report on the Unocal oil spill in San Luis Obispo County 
("Setbacks Slow Cleanup of Huge Oil Spill," Oct. 11) ignores several essential 
aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with the Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the lead agency for 
the response to the spill is the U.S. Coast Guard.State agencies are 
participating in the cleanup pursuant to that law and to formal agreement with 
the Coast Guard. The Times did not make this clear or quote a single federal 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same logic that Gov. Pete Wilson should personally receive criticism 
for the conduct of the Department of Fish and Game, should not President 
Clinton be held responsible for the specific actions of the Coast Guard? 
Obviously not. In the case of the state, this matter has been directed 
continuously by experts on the scene with oversight by and communication with 
other supervisory officials as appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that over 34,000 gallons of diluent have been recovered thus 
far and that our eventual efforts will prevent a much greater quantity of this 
substance from reaching marine waters, critics complain that we have acted too 
quickly. Yet, they fail to cite specifically the environmental harm of the 
cleanup. Nor do they offer any alternative to the current course of action. 
Even the chemist whose study they cite stated: "They're (the responding 
agencies) doing a very good job. . . . It has been a very successful project." 
</P>

 The state is dedicated to an aggressive and open multi-agency response to the 
spill and the pursuit of all legal remedies against the responsible party, 
Unocal. Why does The Times insist on giving credibility to unsubstantiated 
charges by those who only want to play politics?

COSTLY IMPACT OF PROP. 184 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for your editorial, " 'Three Strikes' Worries" (Oct. 12). This 
isthe biggest overreaction to a social problem that California has ever seen. 
What the public does not think about is the long-term impact of the law on 
everyone's civil liberties and the systems that we all use. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will the "three-strikes law" destroy a declining education system, 
but I am told that no civil cases will be heard in the Santa Monica courts and 
Los Angeles will be permanently backlogged. Californians will have to pick up 
the AFDC costs for children whose mothers and/or fathers have been sentenced to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 I administer a nonprofit organization that provides long-term transitional 
housing for men and woman veterans who have histories of substance abuse. In 
the past few weeks we have received several calls from veterans in jail who 
could be facing 25 to life. One caller explained that he had been a heroin 
addict since he was 14. He had a dysfunctional family and had been locked in 
closets by his mother when he was a child. He began to cry when he said, "I am 
not a criminal, I am a heroin addict with behavior problems and I don't deserve 
to spend 25 years to life in prison because my substance abuse problem has 
never been addressed. I have never hurt anyone except myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He told me that the prison system did not address substance abuse and that he 
used more drugs while inside prison than he did when he was on the outside. He 
was begging me to help him get a chance at getting clean and sober and to live 
a productive life. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of California have convicted and sentenced every veteran, disabled 
person and poor soul, who was not given a chance at life with loving parents 
and a support network. This population was doomed at birth, and the residents 
of the Golden State will sacrifice their children's education, the justice 
system and the quality of life to make sure that everyone, not just violent 
offenders, is sent away forever. I agree that violent offenders should be given 
maximum sentences, but Proposition 184 is overkill and residents of California 
will pay the price for life.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE; KENZABURO OE: THE MAN WHO TALKS 
WITH THE TREES; AN AUTHOR WHO GAVE VOICE TO HIS IMPAIRED SON IN HIS BOOKS 
DESERVES TO HAVE MORE READERS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MASAO MIYOSHI, Masao Miyoshi is Hajime Mori Professor of Literature at UC 
San Diego. Among his publications are As We Saw Them and Off Center, published 
this past summer, respectively, by Kodansha America and Harvard University 
Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Japanese author Kenzaburo Oe is 
extremely timely, coinciding with two major events in this extraordinary 
writer's life. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief background: Anyone who has ever read him knows that Oe the writer is 
inseparable from Oe the father. His son Hikari, now 31, was born with severe 
brain damage and remained mute until he was 6. And ever since Oe decided to 
bring him up as a normal human being, Hikari has been in every page of his work 
as in every minute of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 For Oe, speaking on his silent son's behalf by turning him into an 
ever-present character as his double has been his most important reason for 
writing fiction. The son has been studying music for many years, and some time 
ago he began to compose, although his speech and movement have been limited 
throughout. Only a few weeks ago, Hikari completed his second CD of pieces for 
piano and flute. This recording, like his first one, promises to be a great 
success among music lovers of Japan, answering Oe's lifelong hope for finding a 
voice for his voiceless son. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, Oe has just finished the first draft of his huge trilogy, 
"Moeagaru midori no ki" ("A Green Tree in Flames," named after Yeats' poem), 
which he insists on calling his last novel. As he tells it, now that Hikari can 
express sadness and happiness in his own full "voice," Oe's ventriloquist role 
for his son is ending. As Hikari gradually gains independence, Oe feels his 
presence receding from the pages of his narratives. The time has come for him 
to quit his fiction, as Oe describes it. As if to celebrate this moment of 
fulfillment, the English word " Rejoice! " concludes the first draft of the 
last part of his "last" work. This event -- the completion of the novel and the 
public renunciation of fiction -- occurred a mere several weeks before the 
Nobel award was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is also timely because Oe's recognition abroad will reawaken the 
Japanese readers who have lately been, though thoroughly respectful, neglecting 
Oe's intellectual and literary achievements. Oe is too difficult, they 
complain. Their fascination has been with vacuous manufacturers of disposable 
entertainment, including the "new voices of Japan," like Haruki Murakami and 
Banana Yoshimoto.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the malaise of Japan may be more critical. There has been little 
probing of contemporary Japan's cultural life. The kabuki and flower 
arrangement continue, of course, but neither new novelists nor social analysts 
are emerging who seriously question Japan's preoccupation with buying and 
selling, except among some women writers. By emphasizing Japan's homogeneity 
and proclaiming the "spirit of harmony," mainstream critics and scholars 
refrain from self-analysis. Convinced of Japan's "uniqueness," commentators 
often fail to articulate Japan's position in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government curiously -- and shamefully -- has yet to honor its 
native son Oe in any form. The Ministry of Education is hastily forming a 
committee, according to the Asahi newspaper, to consider the possibility of 
conferring the imperial Order of Culture on this "controversial" author, now 
honored by a Nobel. When a quiet inquiry was made, Oe firmly expressed his 
intent to decline the offer. His reason was that the state-initiated Order of 
Culture was against his idea of democracy. Oe's decision may encourage those in 
Japan who are still grappling with life's big questions and the world's lasting 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe is a formidable scholar. He reads Dante in Italian, Confucius in Chinese, 
Faulkner in English, Rabelais and Sartre in French, the formalists in Russian 
and "The Tale of Genji" in the original. And he remembers everything. Once, I 
was with him visiting a university rare-book collection. Visibly excited over 
the discovery of a rare facsimile edition of William Blake's long poem, 
"Jerusalem," he began to recite it from memory. I left him alone with an 
astonished librarian, and the recitation was still going when I returned. Of 
course, learning by itself does little good to anyone. Oe, however, never 
leaves knowledge distant from the opinions he forms and actions he takes in 
thought and in his everyday life. He is a thoroughly engaged man, regularly 
speaking up for Japan's minorities and protesting its political system. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few translations into English and other Western languages of this 
remarkably prolific writer. His language and style are said to be complex and 
difficult, nearly untranslatable, and potential translators seem frightened 
away. Those who do read him will find his mythological cycle not just sober and 
speculative, but saturated with cosmic laughter and grotesque humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his short stories are as funny as they are accessible. There is no 
reason why there can't be many more translations of his works. There are indeed 
very few writers now in the world who can compare with him in candid 
description, complex ideas, bold imagery and sudden illuminations and a probing 
sense of history and justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe has long had the habit of spending hours literally talking to trees. When 
he visits a new place, for example, he often walks along in the woods and 
groves, stopping to gaze from time to time and bending down to pick up a fallen 
leaf and guessing the tree's identity, origin and history. He can cite the 
names of almost all the trees in the world in Japanese, English and Latin. Oe 
calls trees his friends. I wonder if this prize will place him among the men 
and women of Asia and other parts of the world outside Japan so that the world 
may know him as closely as Oe knows it.

WHY THE SCARLET 'A' WORKS AGAINST US; SEX OFFENDERS: PUNISHING THE GUILTY WITH 
HARD TIME AND LIFELONG LABELS ONLY ENSURES THAT THE PROBLEM WILL GROW WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEROME G. MILLER, Jerome G. Miller, clinical director of the Augustus 
Institute in Alexandria, Va., is a national authority on corrections, 
alternative programs and clinical work with violent juvenile and adult 
offenders. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm riding along in my car against the background noise of a radio talk-show 
host working up her audience over the prospect that a sex offender might be 
living nearby. The discussion centers on the federal crime bill, which 
encourages police to pass out photos and addresses of anyone in the 
neighborhood who has been previously convicted of molestation. (California has 
gone further by dispensing names, ZIP codes and photos of sex offenders to any 
and all who might ask.) 
</P>
<P>
 The host's diagnoses range from "monsters" to "scum bags" and her policy 
proposals range from leafleting to the death penalty. Then, a soft-spoken male 
caller offers a simple solution: Sex offenders should be made to wear large 
identifying tags around their necks, with immediate imprisonment should they be 
caught without them. "You know -- like Hitler did with the Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief silence follows and the host moves on to other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, I've been treating these "perpetrators," as the stilted 
language of law enforcement puts it. They usually suffer from one or another of 
the 50 so-called sexual paraphilias. Few are strangers to their victims. Most 
are friends and family members who have harmed their own. Few are violent, and 
unlike demons, they tend not to fall out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of Sean, a 14-year-old hockey and baseball player who wants 
desperately to be straight and macho but who, from age 11, has been attracted 
to younger boys. Hiding this from his family, his jock buddies and himself, he 
clings to the hope that all will eventually be well. Then one day, a tease 
turns serious and Sean and a 10-year-old boy are involved in month-long series 
of convoluted sexual encounters. Sean is arrested, and though he is being 
effectively treated, will probably carry the label of sex offender for the rest 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Pablo, a handsome 15-year-old from Central America convicted of 
fondling a 13-year-old girl at a swimming pool. As his treatment unfolds, 
familiar patterns emerge: abandoned at age 6 by his homosexual father (who had 
not molested him) only to be sodomized at age 9 by his mother's new, otherwise 
aggressively heterosexual husband.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill, 24, was questioned by the police after he approached a 12-year-old boy. 
"If you have a problem," they said, "we'll help you find treatment." Weighed 
down with the guilt of unwelcome impulses since puberty, Bill unburdened 
himself -- revealing a secret sexual encounter he'd had with a boy five years 
earlier. He didn't mention his more fearsome secret -- that he had been 
sodomized by his older brother two or three times a week from age 8 to 13. He 
feared the revelation would destroy his mother and jeopardize his brother's 
career as a Marine fighter pilot. Bill's treatment turned out to be a 10-year 
sentence to the state penitentiary.  
</P>
<P>
 Take 26-year-old Scott, who came to us charged with sexual assault. The 
incident arose out of a consensual bondage scenario with his girlfriend that 
suddenly turned violent. He had no history of sexual offending. However, as a 
teen-aged juvenile he was sentenced to an adult prison for burglary. Two months 
later, he was gang-raped. His inability to fend off his attackers anointed him 
a cell block "punk." For the next three years, he was made to serve on demand 
the sundry sexual needs of straight, non-sex-offender inmates. Scott returned 
to the streets transfixed by violent sexual obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The painful dilemmas that wind their way through these lives are seldom 
well-addressed through the criminal-justice system and even less so through 
vigilantism. John Money, the eminent Johns Hopkins University researcher 
studying sexual compulsions, summarized it best. "The adversarial system for 
the treatment of paraphilia by means of prosecution and punishment," he said, 
"must be pronounced an abject failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popular view that sex offenders are untreatable, research shows 
otherwise. Studies done in Canada, California and Vermont demonstrate that 
appropriate treatment can substantially cut the chances of a sex offender 
re-offending. Unfortunately, in the current national hysteria, a troubled 
pedophile dare not talk much about himself or his past without a high 
probability of his therapist reporting him to the authorities. The risk doesn't 
end there. 
</P>
<P>
 Take 13-year-old Troy, grossly sexually abused by a 25-year-old friend of his 
older sister when he was 11. Shortly thereafter he attempted the same thing 
with his 8-year-old sister. He was locked up for a number of months, then 
released for treatment at a local mental health center. The adolescent group 
members had to begin each therapy session with this mantra: "My name is ------. 
I am a sex offender and I will be one for the rest of my life." The ritual 
troubled Troy and he asked his mother, Why? The therapist told her that she had 
seen it on "Oprah." 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, sex offenders anger us. But often our reaction seems to go 
beyond indignation and taps more primitive impulses. Indeed, the first recorded 
execution of a youngster in this country involved a 17th-Century Massachusetts 
farm boy who was discovered engaging in sexual play with one of his pet 
animals. The teen-ager was forced to watch as his pets were hanged one-by-one 
in front of him, after which he was himself dispatched on the gallows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, all the hot lines, leaflets, talk-show kitsch and vigilantism 
won't slow the rate of sexual abuse. Precisely the reverse. As troubled 
individuals are tagged and driven from neighborhoods and families and friends 
and slip into that nether world of isolation and trance that feeds perverse 
fantasy, sexual offending can only grow more dangerous and egregious.

CORNFLAKES TASTE LIKE POVERTY; THE LESSONS AND MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD CAN HAUNT 
THE PSYCHES AND CUPBOARDS OF MIDDLE AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Cornflakes so remind me of the powerlessness of poverty, the worst of my 
memories of beingone of five children of poor parents, that I cannot eat them. 
Neither commercial nor generic cornflakes exist in my universe, because they 
take me back too far. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was a laborer with an elementary-school education and tremendous 
pride. Too frequently, he was temporarily laid off, for periods sometimes as 
long as a year. During periods of layoff, he devised alternate ways to produce 
income to support his family: He scavenged for old radios to repair and sell, 
he worked in carwashes during Philadelphia winters when no one else wanted to. 
He took any odd jobs that came up. When the jobs got too odd and too far 
between, he resorted to bartering. A neighborhood grocer, Mr. Birrell, would 
take an old electric mantel clock as collateral for food, on my father's 
promise to pay with cash when his situation improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Birrell got to dictate the kind and quality of the goods he would exchange 
for the mantel clock. In a way that would never happen when my father was using 
cash for his purchases, Mr. Birrell would direct my father to get the largest 
box of cornflakes, a package of bologna or hot dogs, a loaf of bread, a large 
can of baked beans. If these provisions ran out before my father could scare up 
more cash, he would send one of us kids to Birrell's with a note, and Mr. 
Birrell would package up more of the same. He did not look pleased to see us 
and our brown paper missives.  
</P>
<P>
 I was about 8 when I made a serious connection between cornflakes for three 
meals a day and my father's bleaker moods, to which my mother paid careful 
attention. We kids had to not be aggravating, and my bag lunch would have 
dreaded boiled-egg sandwiches and little else. Then there was the time that Mr. 
Birrell hesitated to take the clock, even for cornflakes. Mrs. Birrell, who 
worked alongside her husband, slicing hams and salamis at the front of their 
narrow crowded store, had seen my mother emerge from the newly opened rival 
market across the street (closer to our house by several crucial steps after a 
long summer day folding hot sheets in a commercial laundry) with a grocery bag. 
Why wasn't Birrell's good enough for our cash, Mr. Birrell wanted to know. I 
don't remember what my dad said to ensure that his children ate, but he got the 
cornflakes. I used to wish that he argued about his right to shop wherever he 
chose or that he wrapped that clock back up in its old towel and left. Of 
course, had he done that, there would not even have been cornflakes.  
</P>
<P>
 I have wrestled with the demon fear of poverty 
</P>
<P>
 that alternately haunted me and fueled my efforts to build a life that might 
foreclose any resort to cornflakes. It took major inner resources and secrecy 
to live with a temporary need for food-stamps and Medi-Cal in my 20s. That was 
not something I could tell the proud man who reared me with constant reminders 
not to be "beholden to others." I lost weight and sleep trying to resolve the 
conflict between relief and trepidation that accompanied my petition to the 
Oakland school district for my daughter to get reduced-cost school lunches 
during the lean years when I was earning my undergraduate degree. I hobbled 
through parts of my education pridefully rejecting financial aid, mouthing the 
justification that somebody needed it more than me. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in my fifth decade, with the daughter building her own future, I can 
live with a temporarily empty refrigerator without apprehension. When my 
checking account has $3.45 in it, I don't think, 
</P>
<P>
 nor do I wonder who else thinks that it is evidence of the capriciousness of 
my character that I could spend close the bone. I am pleased that my daughter 
had no idea we were so poor when she was growing up that some evenings she had 
dinner when I did not. She thinks our lives were interesting. We got by. We 
thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 But the line is drawn at cornflakes. They taste like poverty. The mental and 
spiritual weight of a soggy bowl of cornflakes is just too much. I have hedged 
on the frequent question, "How did you . . . " because "By not eating 
cornflakes" seems such a frivolous answer. But there are moments when it feels 
like too long a look back might derail forward progress. I make some talismanic 
connection between not eating cornflakes and whatever success I can claim in 
this life. As long as there are no cornflakes in the cupboard, the risk of 
poverty is averted, and I have control of my destiny. I believe in this 
particular magic.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STONES DO THE 'VOODOO' THEY DO SO WELL 
</P>

 OK, let's get all the Rolling Stones jokes out of the way. Let's call them the 
Geriatric Stones . . . the grandfathers of rock . . . and what have you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ha ha. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- whose core members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and 
Ron Wood are either approaching 50 or past it -- are targets because rock 'n' 
roll isn't supposed to be an old man's game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed as an expression of youth and it has generally been at its 
most captivating when being reinvented by fresh voices, a role the Stones long 
ago conceded to such younger forces as U2, R.E.M. and Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard to find any derisive laughter among the 55,000 fans at Jack 
Murphy Stadium on Monday as the Stones kicked off their tour's Southern 
California swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was too dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 Against all odds, the Stones are a band that refuses to roll over. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years after making its U.S. debut just up the road in San Bernardino, 
the landmark British outfit defied the rules of rock longevity with a show 
that, on balance, was even stronger than 1989's triumphant "Steel Wheels" 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways those dates seemed a last hurrah, a lavish spectacle in which the 
band played most of its classic hits with unbending professionalism and skill. 
What was left? "Steel Wheels II"? 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise is that the new "Voodoo Lounge" tour is more inviting on every 
level -- from more alluring staging to a generally more satisfying selection of 
songs. Most disarming of all: the renewed passion of the band members and the 
good-natured way they confront the aging issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened with the Southern California debut of Seal, the British 
singer/songwriter whose 1991 hit, "Crazy," was an inviting calling card. But 
his melodic blend of funk, pop and rock seemed largely lost in the vast stadium 
setting. His smaller theater tour later in the year will be a better test of 
his performing strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Stones took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be," Jagger declared teasingly in the first 
line of "Not Fade Away," the 1964 hit that opened the two-hour set. The still 
lean, athletic singer delivered the lyric with such biting authority that he 
mocked the idea that this is a band living on borrowed time. His words, in 
effect, were a vow that the Stones can still entertain and excite. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jagger said it with the confidence of a man who has learned night after 
night on this tour, which began in August in Washington, D.C., that he is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience erupted with applause and cheered even louder when the band 
followed with one of its classic concert numbers, "Tumbling Dice." Through the 
rest of the evening, they touched on a lot of other trademark tunes, from 
"Start Me Up" and "Sympathy for the Devil" to "Brown Sugar" and "Street 
Fighting Man." 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds like too much of a sentimental journey, the band played with a 
fire and command -- bassist Darryl Jones filling in ably for the retired Bill 
Wyman -- reminding us that they are masters of the rock form. The support cast 
-- keyboardist Chuck Leavell, a four-piece brass section and two backup singers 
-- added punctuation that was consistently spicy and precise. 
</P>
<P>
 Augmenting the music on this tour: lighting that's frequently as colorful and 
disarming as a carnival midway, and equally striking video effects on overhead 
screens. The latter range from appealing computer animation sequences to clips 
of old screen darlings (Shirley Temple to Betty Boop) during "Honky Tonk 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most captivating moment visually was during "It's All Over Now," when the 
Stones used the video screen to make another wry commentary on the aging issue. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the stage action is projected in color on the screen so that fans in 
remote areas of the stadium can better see what is happening on stage. However, 
for this song, the images were in grainy black and white, giving the impression 
that we were watching vintage footage from the '60s. It was so effective that 
you had to turn to the live action to make sure the video image actually was 
reflecting what was happening on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The illusion only worked because the band was playing with such vitality and 
joy, negating any audience disappointment that it wasn't really the '60s Stones 
on stage. No small feat. 
</P>
<P>
 The band members are more comfortable and relaxed on stage than at any time 
since the '70s. Jagger still struts at times like an overactive marionette, but 
he seems less the frontman caricature that he was in the '80s. Richards, too, 
jumps at times with such enthusiasm that you'd think he was standing on a 
trampoline as he played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's weakness was some of the new material. In their only sign of 
timidity Monday, the Stones seemed unwilling to take a chance on slowing down 
the blistering pace. 
</P>
<P>
 This caused them to turn to some of the weakest songs in the new "Voodoo 
Lounge" album, including "You Got Me Rocking" and "I Go Wild" -- generic 
reworkings of traditional Stones rave-ups. The band could use its time more 
convincingly by turning instead to some of the new album's softer tunes that 
have a bit more imagination and charm, such as "Sweethearts Forever," with its 
Drifters-like innocence, or "Brand New Car," with its wry blues sass. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, the band delivered a show filled with more than 
enough richness and heart to live up to its remarkable legacy. All geriatric 
joking aside, this group still deserves proudly the name Rolling Stones. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'CLERKS' SHINES LIKE A GEM IN A FIVE-AND-DIME STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lenny Bruce would have loved "Clerks." Rude, boisterous, obscene and 
irreverently funny, it has all the crude energy and delight in life's profane 
chaos that the celebrated comedian found so irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the discoveries of last year's Sundance Film Festival (where it shared 
the Filmmakers Trophy) and later a prize-winner at the International Critics 
Week at Cannes, "Clerks" is also an example of what is best and most hopeful 
about the American independent-film scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Made in grainy black and white on a skimpy budget of $27,575, "Clerks" is the 
inspiration of 23-year-old Kevin Smith, who wrote, directed, co-edited, 
co-produced and even found time to play a cameo as the laconic Silent Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporadically employed himself as a convenience-store clerk, Smith did more 
than write a script based on his own cool and crazy life behind the counter; he 
actually filmed it in the Quick Stop in Leonardo, N.J., that hired him, 
shooting after it closed each night at 10:30 till the small hours of the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Clerks" is not just a case of poor movie makes good. For Smith, a 
film-school dropout who used part of his tuition to finance his debut, has an 
anarchic gift for sketch humor and the raunchy banter of guys just hanging out. 
Though the politically incorrect language is tough enough to have earned 
"Clerks" an initial NC-17 rating (re-rated R on appeal), its exuberance gives 
it an alive and kicking feeling that is welcome and rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply structured as a day in the life of clerk Dante Hicks (Brian 
O'Halloran), Dante's saga begins unexpectedly with an early morning call from 
his boss telling him he'll have to open the store even though it's Saturday, 
his nominal day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Conscientious to a fault, Dante is unknowingly embarking on a spell of nonstop 
harassment and humiliation that leaves him understandably muttering, "bunch of 
savages in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 On the professional side, the Quick Stop's obstreperous customers subject 
Dante to a flood of eccentric behavior, from pelting him with cigarettes to 
scrutinizing every egg in the case to wanting the simultaneous use of the 
employees' bathroom and a choice porno magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Paralleling this are Dante's romantic problems. His stand-up girlfriend 
Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) brings him homemade lasagna for lunch, but 
outrages Dante with revelations about her past sexual habits that lead to one 
of the film's funniest colloquies. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dante can't get his mind off his ex, the glamorous Caitlin (Lisa 
Spoonauer), even though they broke up years ago and she cheated on him 8 1/2 
times while they were together. What was the half? A drunken tryst with Dante 
in a darkened room when she thought he was someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing an ironic Greek chorus to all these woes is Dante's best friend, 
Randal (Jeff Anderson), the clerk at an adjoining video store whose stock is so 
feeble Randal himself rents elsewhere. A prankster and instigator, Randal 
believes in abusing his customers whenever possible and encourages Dante to be 
more aggressive in his dealings with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Randal and Dante are the center of "Clerks," Smith has a profligate eye 
for odd and curious characters, and appearances by a manic drug dealer, a smug 
personal trainer and an intense Russian named Olaf who is desperate to play 
metal, are among the film's zany highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cast with either non-professionals or actors with no more than local 
experience, "Clerks" is unapologetically rough and even ragged at times. But 
its lack of circumspection turns out to be its charm. Unabashed and unashamed, 
"Clerks" is always itself, and that is something of an accomplishment.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'HOOP DREAMS' HITS NOTHING BUT NET; THE FILM HAS TAKEN A SIMPLE 
CONCEPT AND TURNED IT INTO A LANDMARK OF AMERICAN DOCUMENTARY FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball is not just a game. The quintessential city sport, played with 
reckless passion on random patches of concrete, it classically offers a way out 
of poverty for its best players, but there is more. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's used right, basketball can also provide a way in for those who have 
the wit to use it, a chance to dramatically combine the excitement of 
competition with a provocative look at the complexities of urban life. And 
"Hoop Dreams" certainly does it right. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2-hour, 49-minute epic that zips by like a fluid fast break, "Hoop Dreams" 
has taken a simple concept and, by a Horatio Alger combination of luck, pluck 
and pure hard work, turned it into a landmark of American documentary film. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on the personal side of the city game, "Hoop Dreams" tells us more 
about what works and what doesn't in our society than the proverbial shelf of 
sociological studies. And it is thoroughly entertaining in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of filmmakers (Steve James, Frederick Marx, Peter Gilbert) 
responsible for "Hoop Dreams" made it the old-fashioned way: refusing to stint 
on time spent with their subjects, a pair of promising teen-age Chicago 
basketball players, they shot some 250 hours over a five-year period, staying 
with the young men from before their high school careers to what transpired 
after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a film as rife with incident, with the ups and downs of 
outrageous fortune, as any Victorian triple-decker novel. By adroitly 
eavesdropping on reality, the "Hoop Dreams" team rooted out the kind of 
unvarnished home truths that make for the most engrossing viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Where luck enters the equation is with the players selected. Both William 
Gates and Arthur Agee are but 14 years old when "Hoop Dreams" begins, just out 
of grade school but already good enough to dream of the money and glory of an 
NBA career. And the cameras are present when Earl Smith, a neighborhood talent 
scout, discovers Arthur on a local court. "I don't know anything about him," 
Smith says, "but I'll bet you a steak dinner in four years you'll be hearing 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Either or both of these kids could have proved to be duds on the court as well 
as ciphers as human beings, but it is the great good fortune of "Hoop Dreams" 
that the reverse is true. Explosively talented players who are willing to be 
honest in the face of the camera, their life paths turn out to be unpredictable 
and intensely human, with the agonizing drama of victory and loss on the court 
always present to add zest to the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Both William, a smooth natural leader, and Arthur, whose talent is undeniable 
but rawer, are actively recruited by St. Joseph High School and its 
cantankerous coach, Gene Pingatore. The alma mater of the NBA's Isiah Thomas 
and a perennial basketball power, St. Joseph's tranquil suburban location 
requires adjustments for both boys that range from three hours of commuting 
time to demanding academics and the novelty of spending time with white people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the pleasure of "Hoop Dreams" lies in discovering what happens to 
William and Arthur as their lives unfold, giving away any more of their stories 
wouldn't be fair. Interspersing interviews with parents, siblings, friends, 
coaches, counselors and others with talks with the boys themselves (plus 
liberal amounts of game footage), each subject's particular mixture of 
disappointment and joy becomes involving in a way fiction often is not. 
</P>
<P>
 What is worth pointing out are the meaty themes "Hoop Dreams" touches on, one 
of the pivotal ones being the thoughtless way these kids are fed into the 
omnivorous machine that is big-time sports. 
</P>
<P>
 While bringing talented city kids out to St. Joseph's may seem like a win-win 
situation, it soon becomes obvious that both the school and the boys' mentors 
have agendas that do not necessarily put the welfare of their players first. 
"We don't understand what we're really doing to these kids," says a rival 
coach, and the truth of that is much in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But though the pressures placed on these kids are severe, "Hoop Dreams" 
emphasizes why they try to endure. For both William ("This is my ticket out of 
the ghetto") and Arthur ("Nobody is going to take my dream away from me"), 
basketball is the only thing they can have pride in, the only place where they 
can see their presence making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 In plain contrast to the sense of hope basketball engenders is the grinding 
nature of the poverty the boys' families, both their fierce and protective 
mothers and their troubled fathers, have to contend with. Without any sense of 
special pleading, "Hoop Dreams" underlines the difficulties of making something 
of yourself in an indifferent system, helping us to understand Arthur's mother 
when she bares her heart and says, "Do you wonder sometimes how I am living? 
It's enough to make you want to lash out and hurt someone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, we feel we know both William and Arthur and their lives in a way 
only a film like this can manage. When the final crawl lets us know just what 
both men are up to today, audiences talk, marvel and express concern, just as 
they would with their own friends, and there is no better gauge of "Hoop 
Dreams' " considerable accomplishment than that.

DINING REIVEW; MERCI, BOCUSE! SAYS PROTEGE OLHATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who among you hasn't dreamed of having your most influential teacher return to 
bestow approval on your achievements, of having the master appear to validate 
the path you have chosen? Exactly that happened to chef Pascal Olhats Monday 
night when his mentor, celebrated French chef Paul Bocuse, was honored at a 
special dinner at Olhats' restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 guests came to Pascal to see Bocuse, to purchase signed copies 
of his new book, "Regional French Cooking," and to eat a dinner inspired by 
recipes from his three-Michelin-star restaurant just north of Lyons on the 
banks of the Saone, where Olhats says he spent two of the happiest years of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 At 69, Bocuse remains the most famous chef in the world, the ambassadeur of 
French cuisine, a regal, commanding figure in his chef's whites. He also is a 
most quotable man, as he demonstrated when he got up to address the crowd of 
eager diners, between the crayfish and veal courses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "France wouldn't be what it is today," he intoned in French, aided by 
translator Steven Brauer of Mumm's Champagne, "if it weren't for June 6, 1944." 
Bocuse has a good reason to be so resolutely pro-American: He was severely 
wounded during the war, and an American transfusion helped saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner was an unqualified success. Olhats paid homage by attempting to 
duplicate Bocuse's famous soupe aux truffes , crowned by a pastry hat of the 
sort Bocuse created for then-French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1975. 
I am lucky enough to have eaten Bocuse's own version in France, and I shall 
never forget the experience. This one may not have been as chock full of foie 
gras or as redolent of shaved black truffle as the prototype, but no one was 
heard complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 There followed a light gratin of crayfish and lobster, a tasty veal chop with 
chanterelle mushroom and a quirky white chocolate interpretation of an Opera 
cake with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Throughout most of the evening, 
Bocuse stood beaming near the entrance to the kitchen, his white toque perched 
upright atop his head. Occasionally he would sit to sign his book or to 
autograph copies of the evening's menu, speaking pearls of wisdom.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answering questions from admiring guests, he proved as masterful at the art of 
conversation as he has proved in the kitchen. Asked by a health-conscious 
gourmet about the harmful effects of butter and cream, he scoffed: "Nous sommes 
cuisiniers, pas medecins " (we are chefs, not doctors). Touche and amen. Bocuse 
has built a life around simple, rich cooking. If you have to ask, you'd better 
not indulge. 
</P>
<P>
 You can catch chef Bocuse at a special dinner in his honor tonight at the new 
Citation restaurant next to Hollywood Park in Inglewood or Thursday night at 
Pinot restaurant in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing that, have Pascal prepare one of the Lyonnaise-style dishes that 
surface from time to time in his restaurant.

 Trial Date Set: A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday set a trial date of Jan. 13 for 
rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and two co-defendants accused of killing a man in the 
Palms area last year. A grand jury has indicted the rapper, whose real name is 
Calvin Broadus, along with McKinley Lee and Sean Abrams for murder in the 1993 
shooting death of Philip Woldemariam, 20. Lee, Broadus' bodyguard, has 
acknowledged shooting Woldemariam, but claims the action was in self-defense. 
Broadus is accused of driving the Jeep from which the shots were fired.

 UK/LA Concert Canceled: The British Consulate has officially canceled the 
planned "Prince's Trust Benefit Concert" which was to have taken place at 
Universal Amphitheatre on Nov. 3 as part of the citywide UK/LA Festival. The 
concert would have been the first U.S. pop concert under the Prince's Trust, 
which has previously organized several charity concerts in London. No lineup 
was ever announced for the performance, but the event was included in the 
magazine-sized UK/LA Festival brochure. A consulate spokeswoman said funding 
for the project "fell through" when organizers could not finalize plans to 
televise the event. The cancellation did not entail any conflicts with the 
schedule of Prince Charles, who is still expected to attend several UK/LA 
events.

 Suicides Follow Cobain: Three young men whose bodies were found Sunday in a 
storage facility near Vancouver, Canada, apparently killed themselves in 
despair over the April suicide of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, police said. 
Two bodies were found in a car inside the facility and the third was alongside. 
The men, in their late teens or early 20s, appeared to have been dead at least 
a week from carbon monoxide poisoning. Notes in a diary found at the scene 
suggested they were depressed over Cobain's death. "They were upset about it. 
When Cobain died, they died. It's very sad," a police spokesman said.

THEATER REVIEW; MONOLOGUES HIGHLIGHT HBO NEW WRITERS PROJECT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Scheffer writes terrific monologues, judging from Program B of the HBO 
New Writers Project Festival, at the Stella Adler Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Scheffer's monologues, performed by different actors, make up the 
second half of the program. They're funny, lyrical, captivating. Each is about 
a gay character, and the first two characters are marginally connected by the 
same psychiatrist and by a key image of a fiery dance. Yet the characters are 
distinctive enough to ward off any sense of sameness. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Alien Boy," Daniel Parker plays a plump and precocious 13-year-old son of 
a Holocaust survivor. He's just beginning to realize he's gay, back in the 
"Boys in the Band" era. It entices and frightens him, and it interests him a 
lot more than the Judaism he rejects. The script's only dubious device is to 
dress this kid in a cutesy sailor suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry McIntyre appears in "Fire Dance," which is about a black drag queen who 
leaves the profession after his mentor is in an accident. It's a stylish piece. 
But Scheffer's best work is his last, "The Falling Man," about a ballroom 
dancer (Michael Malone Starr) who loses his virginity on the same night he's 
declared cha-cha champion of the world. He also contracts AIDS soon thereafter, 
but he tries to discover as much excitement in his new "falling" state as he 
found in his sure-footed dancing days. Beth Milles directed Scheffer's work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first part of Program B is devoted to "The Answer to My Prayer," 
by Nancy De Los Santos. It's a mildly amusing account of a single Latina's 
search for Mr. Right, abetted by a prayer from her late grandmother and the 
ministrations of some elderly cousins. Ada Maris is a sympathetic presence as 
the woman beset by cartoonish creeps, but the script seldom strays from the 
predictable. Tony Plana directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Okita's brief anecdotal monologue, "The Spirit Guide," performed by 
Steve Park, opens the program rather inobtrusively with a tale of a man's 
encounter with a friend who claims to have a pipeline to God. Cathleen 
Fitzpatrick directed.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TAKING STEPS': MADNESS UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Ayckbourn has been called the Neil Simon of England.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they both can be very funny. But Ayckbourn takes another step. He's 
often cerebral. That means that he often asks the audience to use their minds, 
and their imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program note for the original production of "Taking Steps" at his own 
theater in Scarborough, England, Ayckbourn said, "This is, I hope, a play you 
can enjoy on several levels at once." He was being facetious. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three settings in the play: an attic, a bedroom and a lounge, and 
the connecting stairs and passageways. And the rooms occupy the same space, 
with action sometimes taking place in two or all three simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The titular taking of steps is by the actors seeming to climb stairs, descend 
them and, once, even fall down them, while rushing from one room to the other, 
ignoring the characters in the other rooms, who actually are in the same room 
they are in, except they're on different floors. For Golden West College's 
production, Charles Davis' setting works efficiently on all its levels, even 
squeezed together. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayckbourn's conceit is an amazing piece of theatrical organization that is 
clear as a bell in operation. Simon doesn't have the typically British sort of 
mind that not only would be fascinated by this visual conundrum but would be 
interested in taking the effort Ayckbourn did to put it all together so 
beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Paul Schwartz, who directs this stylish production, obviously does have 
a similar mind, along with other insights into the levers and cogs that 
tick-tock inside a British comedy. His timing and rapidly shifting rhythms are 
just right for Ayckbourn's madness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is negligible: A woman (Jennifer Severance) is about to flee the coop 
just as her husband (Steve Silva) is buying a country house. Her brother 
(Darren Zinzer) is staying at the house, waiting for his fiancee (Debbie 
Gerber), who isn't keen on their relationship. There's also the husband's 
gormless solicitor (Mark Krumme) and the leather-clad biker son (Steve 
Guerrero) of the home's previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a first-class farce, with mistaken identities, wrong overnight bed 
partners, all accomplished with the dead seriousness the genre requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzer and Severance as the siblings have the lightness and crispness usually 
required of Noel Coward, and couldn't be better. Krumme is as obtuse as a 
British junior solicitor can be and manages to be funny even when he's not 
speaking. The tone of Silva's husband is a bit heavy-handed at times, without 
the froth that makes the others sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except at the Sunday matinee, when other actors take the parts, Gerber is a 
sullen delight as the reluctant fiancee, and Guerrero, with excellent timing, 
is often quite funny, though his trying to make a juvenile Colonel Blimp of the 
biker seems odd -- a simple wealthy, if slightly coarse, young sprout would 
better fit Ayckbourn's writing and probable intent.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'AN ITALIAN STRAW HAT' IS AN EYEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "An Italian Straw Hat," the zany 19th-Century French farce by Eugene M. 
Labiche, has over the years been remade into an operetta, a movie, even several 
stage adaptations. Yet the language of this warhorse has probably never looked 
as good as in the winning new tour by the National Theatre of the Deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The story -- a silly bit of business about a bridegroom who struggles to make 
amends after his horse eats a lady's hat -- has enough twists and turns to tax 
any company. Yet director-adapter Kenneth Albers has found bold ways to mix 
spoken and signed words, reaping humor and visual invention from what might 
have been a mannered, burdensome device. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakneck pacing demanded by farce sometimes overwhelms even this 
incredibly well-rehearsed cast. But for the most part, Albers' "Straw Hat" is 
still a treat for the eyes and, yes, ears. 
</P>
<P>
 A reviewer can only imagine how a person without hearing perceives the show 
(which played over the weekend at Occidental College and moves later this week 
to Rolling Hills Estates, San Diego and Costa Mesa). Many audience members at 
Occidental's Keck Theater signed their applause by raising their arms in the 
air and waving their fingers like so many rows of wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 The production has special charm for a viewer who can hear. Victor Becker's 
fairy-tale set is dominated by a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower, which 
serves as the perch for Maestro (Ira Mitchell), a one-man synthesizer-and-drum 
band of director Albers' ingenious devise. Mitchell sails through the 
near-impossible job of providing music, sound effects and certain character 
voices during virtually every scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Maestro, along with the valet Felix (Brian K. Jennings), serves as the show's 
link to the aural world. Albers wittily drives home the point when Felix 
declines to step in and help a character with a broken leg, explaining, "Sorry, 
Frank, I'm just your voice." (Amazingly, this same character seems to have been 
given a French accent -- in sign language.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sonic accompaniment just adds another rich layer to the show, which in its 
expressive movement and demonstrative acting reminds one of the silent film 
comedies of Chaplin or Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rich hero Fadinard, Robert DeMayo betrays his training as a mime with a 
beautifully acrobatic performance. His eyes alone say more than most actors' 
entire bodies. Meanwhile, Anthony Natale steals his scenes as Achille, a fey 
poser in a blonde wig. 
</P>
<P>
 General audiences may be tempted to shun a work like this one because of the 
company's name. But notice that it's a troupe of the deaf, not exclusively for 
the deaf. Anyone with an abiding interest in theater should see what they have 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * "An Italian Straw Hat," Thursday-Friday at Norris Theatre, Rolling Hills 
Estates, (310) 544-0403; Saturday at UC-San Diego, (619) 534-6467; and Sunday 
at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, (714) 432-5880. Running time: 2 hours, 5

THEATER REVIEWS; 'ALFIE' A SERVICEABLE REVIVAL OF A WORTHY PRODUCT OF THE '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First produced in the early 1960s, Bill Naughton's "Alfie" is a natural for a 
revival. Resiliently funny and moving, full of high spirits and low humor, the 
play concerns the lubricious exploits of Alfie Elkins, a commitment-phobic 
Cockney lorry driver whose determined detachment and indefatigable sexual 
appetites prove a dangerous combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Faith, who recently completed a tour of Britain in the title role, stars 
in the current Los Angeles production, which is part of the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Although initially a play, "Alfie" is best known as the popular film of the 
mid-1960s, starring Michael Caine in a definitive performance that ranks among 
the very best ever committed to film. Caine's anti-heroic shadow in the role 
looms large over Faith. More intrinsically offhanded than Caine's, Faith's 
Alfie is far more the romping puppy dog, indiscriminately chewing the slippers 
of every female within his territory, whereas Caine's seducer, all hooded eyes 
and dodginess, is as directed and reptilian as a striking snake. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the question of Faith's age. In his 50s, Faith hovers dangerously 
on the cusp of caricature with his portrayal of what should be an eager young 
stud-about-town. Still a fit, attractive man, Faith manages to squeak by and 
remain convincing in the role, but his years lend the play a completely 
different resonance. Although it may not be what Naughton originally intended, 
that's not necessarily bad. Faith may be a long-in-the-tooth seducer, but he is 
inarguably more pitiable in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith, who co-directs with Katya Nelhams-Wright, is accustomed to wearing many 
hats. A British pop star of the early 1960s, Faith has subsequently enjoyed 
success as both an actor and financial columnist.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Faith shows palpable promise as a director, this particular hat is 
still a loose fit. In a production as brisk and straightforward as Alfie's sex 
drive, Faith and Nelhams-Wright elicit no-frills, assured performances from 
their talented cast. Catherine McGoohan is particularly fine as Lily, the mousy 
married lady whose dalliance with Alfie results in an agonizing back-room 
abortion. Also a standout is Judy Geeson as Alfie's middle-aged lover, Ruby, 
whose randy amorality rivals Alfie's. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with his own performance, Faith needs a stronger directorial hand to 
draw out the subterranean impulses that motivate Alfie's behavior. Faith plays 
his laughs well, but it is only in the final scenes of the play, when Alfie is 
forced to confront the destruction he has wrought, that Faith unleashes his 
dramatic capabilities in a viscerally affecting scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its faults, the production provides a welcome opportunity to 
rediscover the late Naughton's talent. Trapped in an ossified class system, 
Naughton's characters find recourse in humor and sex, the time-honored 
indulgences of the poor. Although we may be troubled by Alfie's amorality, we 
appreciate him as a rich comic creation, very much the product of his time -- 
and ours. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Alfie," Tiffany Theater, 8532 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends November 20. $22.50-$25.00.

ART REVIEW; ART, LIFE ARE EQUALS IN INDONESIA WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Browsing the vast residue of world art can give the brain claustrophobia, like 
a library out of shelf space. To deal with this overload, the mind simplifies 
treasures into categories and categories into cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Um, let's see -- African art is sort of blocky, pre-Columbian tubular and 
squat while Oceanic leans to the spiky. Such pigeonholes have their uses but 
are inherently confining. That's why exhibitions such as two new ones at UCLA's 
Fowler Museum of Cultural History are so bracing. They let fresh air into the 
attic of perception and rearrange the old furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Arc of the Ancestors" and "Gift of the Cotton Maiden," they present 
venerated objects from Indonesia, a geography rarely the subject of aesthetic 
scrutiny, despite being the fourth most populated place on the planet and the 
largest of Muslim nations. Sailing off the southern coast of continental Asia, 
it's an archipelago consisting of more than 13,000 islands.  
</P>
<P>
 They spread across the map in an upward-smiling curve. Aptly enough that curve 
is a leitmotif of Indonesian art. According to art history professor Jerome 
Feldman, the show's curator and author of the informative catalogue, the curve 
turns up in everything from saddle-shaped roofs to dagger hilts. Sure enough, 
it does. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, the exhibition tends to throw viewers a bit of a curve of its 
own. The art's purposes are familiar enough. These 70-odd objects donated from 
the collection of Jerome L. Joss involve the veneration of ancestors, 
encouragement of fertility, celebration of harvest and the rest of the earthy 
and sidereal themes typical of such magical art. 
</P>
<P>
 It's their form that challenges preconception. Lovingly patterned surfaces 
seem to combine Oriental refinement with the ferocity of objects from the Sepik 
River region of New Guinea. It's as if Indonesia remembered the high cultures 
that flourished in Java and Sumatra in the 12th and 14th centuries, and before 
that the presence of Buddhist and Hindu influences, not to mention the residue 
left behind by such colonialist powers as Portugal, the Netherlands and Japan. 
When you add this historical palimpsest to the polyglot of local-dialect styles 
that make up this art, it's a marvelous melange. 
</P>
<P>
 A decently cultivated viewer might get a mental toehold on all this by 
remembering the elegance of Javanese rod puppets. In fact the most spectacular 
work in view is a puppet, but of a very different sort. Called a Sigalegale, it 
was fashioned by an artist of the Toba Batak people of North Sumatra and 
depicts a near life-size male figure carved from wood dressed in a robe and 
turban-like hat. (In woollier days the head was covered in human skin or 
fashioned from a real skull.)  
</P>
<P>
 He stands atop a decorated wooden box containing the complex mechanism that 
runs him. He can dance, blink or even weep, all apparently unaided because the 
operator sits at a discreet distance.  
</P>
<P>
 His job is to soothe the spirits of those who died childless. He symbolizes 
all the substitutes people use for unborn offspring -- art, pets, dolls, cars. 
. . . He is Pinocchio eternally promising Geppetto that some day he'll be a 
real boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesian art has a knack for this kind of archetypal imagery. A pair of 
carved wood male and female ancestor figures from the Nage of Flores Island 
look at once like infants and adults. Depicted nude, they have large round 
heads, simplified features and minimal emphasis on gender differences. Their 
artist imbued them with a combination of innocence and savagery that is both 
Shakespeare's Calaban and Freud's Id. 
</P>
<P>
 Textiles are generically less directly expressive than figurative objects, but 
anyone who appreciates the form, likes abstract art or wants to flesh out their 
impressions of Indonesian society shouldn't pass up the Fowler's companion 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the museum and assembled by curator Roy Hamilton, "Gift of the 
Cotton Maiden; Textiles of Flores and the Solar Islands" is the first 
comprehensive show ever devoted to the subject. Its 288-page catalogue is 
richly illustrated and redolent with revealing stories. One tells of an 
Indonesian group who regards the normally esteemed weaver as bearing a curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally the "Cotton Maiden" is valued as a practitioner of women's most 
important work. Making sarongs and shawls is venerated as an important source 
of income and prestige since the items play an important role as brides' 
wealth. Designs passed down the generations are so distinctive it's possible to 
tell where a person comes from by the pattern of their garb. When girls are old 
enough to undertake weaving they dance the streets with anklets of cotton 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's surprising that such lush objects can be fashioned from humble cotton. 
Patterns are so finely calibrated and hues of burgundy, indigo and saffron so 
sonorous the textiles look heavily textured.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken together the exhibitions evoke a culture in some ways richer than our 
own. Like other peoples we have had the arrogance to call "primitive," 
Indonesians manifest a mentality innocent of our myriad mental pigeonholes.  
</P>
<P>
 The concept of dualism is strong in the archipelago, but otherwise practical 
life and myth are equally alive and real. The categories we use to separate the 
arts from one another and denigrate them to the status of fictive entertainment 
seem nonexistent. They live vividly blended and equal. 
</P>

 HISTORIC ROADBLOCK: A well-known World War II bunker in the path of proposed 
homes near the Bolsa Chica wetlands has been temporarily saved from 
destruction. . . . "It's a historical resource," says Paul Lusignan, keeper of 
the National Registry of Historic Places, which recently declared the structure 
eligible for listing. The finding stops the bulldozers for now. But Lucy Dunn, 
a spokeswoman for the developer, Koll Real Estate Group, says it's confident it 
can build homes there eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 LEAF BUILDING: Those people at the Tree Society of Orange County say they're 
back in business for spring planting, thanks to corporate donations. The 
society has awarded grants to groups for three major tree-planting projects 
this fall. . . . Groups can apply for spring planting grants of up to $1,000 
through the Arboretum at Cal State Fullerton. The only catch: The trees must be 
planted on public property like a campus or park or along a city street. 
</P>
<P>
 STILL KICKING: The New York Giants released veteran punter Sean Landeta early 
last year, convinced that his best days were behind him. He's proving them 
wrong. . . . Landeta, immediately picked up by the Rams, is the third-best 
punter in the conference this year, with a 44.3-yard average -- just 
three-tenths of a yard behind leader Greg Montgomery of the Detroit Lions. . . 
. And the Giants' punter, Mike Horan? A distant 10th, at just 40.8 yards. 
Landeta probably wouldn't mind if the Rams wound up in Baltimore -- he lives 
there in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 HARD TIMES: The Rams don't want to play at Anaheim Stadium; the Angels can't 
play there until the strike ends. And now the Big A has even lost that 
humorous, struggling baseball franchise from Fox TV's new Sunday night show 
"Hardball," according to Daily Variety. . . . It says "Hardball," which had 
outdoor scenes shot at the Big A, has fallen victim to low ratings, despite a 
power lead-in show, "The Simpsons."

PREP ROUNDUP: KATELLA GETS EARLY SCARE BEFORE SWEEPING CYPRESS

 Katella rallied in the first game and cruised the rest of the way, sweeping 
host Cypress in Empire League volleyball Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (7-4, 4-1) trailed, 14-8, in the first game before scoring the 
next eight points to win, 16-14.Cypress struggled the rest of the match, losing 
the last two games, 15-7, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Katella's Kellie Alva had seven kills and Rachel Nelson 
added four, including two to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella took a 6-5 lead in Game 2 and didn't look back, scoring the last six 
points of the game. Lisa Kornely had three aces and Silvia Parak added one kill 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights jumped to a 7-1 lead in Game 3 before the Centurions (3-6, 3-2) 
rallied to trail by one, 7-6. But the Knights held strong again, scoring the 
last four points to win, 15-8. Alva finished off Cypress with three consecutive 
aces.  
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions were led by senior Julie Adams, who had 13 kills, including six 
in Game three, and Michelle Woiemberghe, who had six kills, five in the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights, who took over sole possession of second place, one game behind 
Kennedy, got 15 kills from Alva and eight from Nelson. JON CLIFFORD

INITIATIVE WOULD HASTEN SPREAD OF TB, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study released today predicts that passage of Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigrant initiative, will hasten the spread of tuberculosis in 
California because immigrants will be afraid of contacts with medical 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, led by a USC team and based on data gathered in Los Angeles 
County, already is fueling concerns in the medical community that Proposition 
187 will drive illegal immigrants underground because it would require 
health-care professionals to report undocumented immigrants to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to try to implement (Proposition 187), we would decimate our 
clinics," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, who leads the public health fight against 
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases as chief of disease control programs 
for Los Angeles County. "The secret of not having these people become a problem 
to themselves or others is the early discovery and management of the disease. 
If you scare people away or make them frightened, they aren't going to come in 
early." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said she also fears that passage of Proposition 187 could trigger the 
revival of other diseases, such as long dormant strains of syphilis that 
haven't been common in California for 50 years, or lead to a re-emergence of 
the measles epidemic that peaked in 1990 and killed 41 Californians, 34 of them 
preschool-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study found that under current law most undocumented immigrants with 
tuberculosis believe that they are safe from deportation when they seek medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, 6% of those with active tuberculosis who told researchers that they 
did not have immigration documents said they delayed care because of fear that 
they would be reported to immigration authorities, said the authors of the 
study, published today in the Western Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 If a measure such as Proposition 187 were to pass, that percentage would rise, 
leading to the spread of the disease, the scientists predicted. The authors 
said that "any increase in the fear of immigration authorities" by patients "is 
likely to increase the delay between onset of symptoms and first contact with 
the medical care system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because each patient possibly exposes an average of 10 contacts to the 
disease during the course of delaying care, such an increase would spread 
tuberculosis beyond those who delay," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, drafted by a team of USC and UCLA researchers led by Dr. Steven 
Asch, a faculty member at the USC School of Medicine and an internist at 
County-USC Medical Center, said that the longer people with active tuberculosis 
delay treatment, the more likely it is that they will spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication of the report just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election 
landed with a predictable political bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ralph Ocampo, president of the California Medical Assn., a statewide 
organization of physicians opposed to Proposition 187, cited the study in once 
again criticizing the measure for attempting to put physicians in a conflict of 
interest position with their patients by requiring doctors to report people 
they even suspect of being illegal immigrants to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using health-care facilities at all as a detection site is immoral and flies 
in the face of what the medical profession should stand for all over the world, 
which is that we take care of sick and injured people first," said Ocampo, a 
San Diego surgeon. "If there is a question about legal status, let that be 
handled by the appropriate authorities but not by health-care professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, an active supporter of Proposition 187, said through a 
spokesperson that if the measure passes, he will continue to provide those 
services that are necessary to protect the public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem that exists today and will exist in the future whether or 
not Proposition 187 passes or fails," said Leslie Goodman, an assistant chief 
of staff for Wilson. "We don't know what the potential consequences might be." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, who in the past has criticized opponents of the initiative for using 
scare tactics, said, "You have to question the motivation of this group in 
putting out this study." 
</P>
<P>
 The journal is published by the California Medical Assn. and represents a 
consortium of 10 western states. Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the CMA, said the 
study was started 2 1/2 years ago, before Proposition 187 got on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's authors do not cite Proposition 187 by name, but instead refer in 
the report to "legislation" and the "immigration initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions researchers asked of the people they interviewed who had 
active tuberculosis was: "Were you afraid going to the doctor might cause 
trouble with immigration authorities?" 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that "few patients feared that seeking care would result 
in difficulties with immigration authorities" and that most seemed aware that 
health-care professionals did not report information on residency status to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin and other health-care professionals say they have spent years 
cultivating that trust. In the arena of public health, they say the reason for 
that is to protect society at large as well as the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disease does not check on someone's immigration status and the disease 
controller had better not," Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is important because the study found that 71% of the 313 patients 
who agreed to be interviewed reported that physicians discovered their 
tuberculosis when they sought care for one of the classic TB symptoms: 
coughing, fatigue, fever, swollen glands or weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The study examined 526 active cases of tuberculosis reported to the county's 
Tuberculosis Control Registry between April and September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers said the county was an ideal target for such a study because it 
"lies at one of the epicenters of the tuberculosis epidemic -- second only to 
New York City." 
</P>
<P>
 They said further that "unlike the nation as a whole, immigrants make up most 
of the active tuberculosis cases in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest update, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
said that 1,940 active cases of tuberculosis were reported in the county in 
1993. That figure is down from 1992, when 2,198 cases were reported, but up 
dramatically from the 1,190 cases discovered in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Using phone numbers and addresses from the county's Tuberculosis Control 
Registry, the researchers wrote and phoned people with TB. Because many are 
transients, efforts were made to track them down in soup kitchens, shelters and 
a special clinic for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the researchers got the cooperation of 313 people, 69% of whom 
were immigrants. One-fifth of the respondents said they were in the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuberculosis in Los Angeles County is definitely a disease of immigration," 
Asch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they came into the country with the disease or picked it up here was 
unclear, he said.

NO DEADLINE SET ON DNA TEST RESULTS IN SIMPSON CASE; COURTS: ITO FINDS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT DELAYS WERE INTENTIONAL. HE ALSO SUSPENDS JURY SELECTION TO 
ASSESS POTENTIAL IMPACT OF NEW BOOK ABOUT NICOLE SIMPSON. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito stunned O.J. Simpson's defense team Tuesday 
by declining to set a deadline for the completion of DNA tests, then 
temporarily halted jury selection because he is concerned about the impact a 
splashy new book could have on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito has generally favored prosecutors in the face of repeated defense 
attempts to suppress evidence and invalidate searches, his ruling on the 
proposed deadline took many by surprise. In two separate court sessions last 
week, the judge had expressed his displeasure with the pace of prosecution 
testing and with its arguments justifying delays. 
</P>
<P>
 He had strongly indicated that he would impose some sanction, raising defense 
hopes that he might rule in that side's favor this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he found that although there were delays, there was no evidence of 
bad faith on the part of prosecutors. That clears the way for DNA testing of 
almost two dozen items -- including a bloody glove found outside Simpson's home 
-- to continue without the threat of a deadline from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is sort of stunned and disappointed by the ruling," Simpson 
attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said outside court. "We expected, based upon 
the judge's statements last week, perhaps a far different ruling. . . . We 
can't explain the ruling." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito had barely resolved that issue before he waded into another. Reacting to a 
newly released book purporting to detail the last months of Nicole Brown 
Simpson's life, the judge ordered a temporary halt to jury selection, sending 
members of the jury panel home until Thursday. O.J. Simpson has pleaded not 
guilty to killing his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman, whose slashed and 
stabbed bodies were found June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, co-authored by a friend of Nicole Simpson's and a National Enquirer 
columnist, was released this week. Ito received a copy Tuesday morning and said 
its publication has raised new concerns about Simpson's ability to get a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what Ito can do about the book is unclear. But when he spoke to 
prospective jurors Tuesday afternoon, the judge used his strongest language yet 
to suggest that he might order the jury sequestered. "Those of you who serve on 
the case may be de facto incommunicado for a significant period of time," Ito 
told prospective jurors during a solemn session. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ito changed his admonition to the panel. Where previously he 
had asked the prospective jurors to avoid coverage of the case, he modified 
that order to insist that they avoid all television and radio broadcasts as 
well as all newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark requested a word with Ito. 
After a brief discussion with Clark and defense lawyers, Ito turned again to 
the potential jurors and added: "I neglected to tell you: You are to stay out 
of bookstores." 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the book -- a salacious and in many ways unverifiable account 
titled "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted" -- was 
the latest disruption in a jury selection process that has moved haltingly 
since questioning began last week. The questioning has moved far more slowly 
than Ito had anticipated and has been stopped twice, once because a prosecutor 
fell ill and again Tuesday because of Ito's concerns about the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some analysts suggested that Ito had overreacted to the book, others 
said the judge had acted prudently in the face of a complicated problem. "What 
he's saying is, 'Let's take the most protective measure we can without going to 
sequestration yet,' " said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor. "I 
would say he has his hands full here." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as jury selection has progressed, Ito and the attorneys for both sides 
have grappled with a host of other issues, the most significant of which was a 
potential deadline on the completion of DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen blood samples from Simpson's home and car were at risk after 
defense attorneys charged that prosecutors had delayed tests to gain a tactical 
advantage. Despite Ito's efforts to elicit an explanation from prosecutors, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn struggled last week to offer a rationale for why 
certain tests were not begun until three months after blood samples were first 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 During two hearings last week, Ito appeared displeased. At one point, he 
warned prosecutors that they were about to lose the argument. That heartened 
defense attorneys, who believed the judge was about to rule in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page ruling, however, Ito reiterated his observation that there 
were delays in testing but said the defense had failed to produce evidence that 
the delays were intentional. That came as a great relief to prosecutors, who 
could have lost significant evidence if Ito had set an early deadline for test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the judge understood that the people are proceeding in 
good faith in an expeditious, ethical and scientifically prudent manner while 
responding to repeated defense motions regarding evidence," Suzanne Childs, a 
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Barry C. Scheck, a Simpson lawyer who specializes in DNA issues, the 
defense had argued that Ito could infer bad faith from the delays. But the 
defense team did not offer direct evidence of misconduct -- letters or 
testimony, for instance, showing that prosecutors had deliberately stalled 
rather than pressing ahead with testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere fact that the prosecution waited until the second week in September 
does not, standing alone, establish bad faith in the context of the unique 
facts and circumstances of this case," Ito ruled. "Both sides are now hurtling 
towards the evidence presentation phase of this litigation without a clear and 
precise view as to what the scientific testing of the physical evidence will 
reveal, and both sides are in this position as a matter of choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts were generally unsurprised by Ito's decision, noting that the 
judge could not impose the sanctions sought by the defense unless he found 
specific bad faith on the part of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he didn't find that, and as frustrated as he was about the delays, 
he could not impose a cutoff unless he found evidence of deliberate bad faith," 
said Gerald Chaleff, a prominent Los Angeles defense attorney. "Absent a 
showing of bad faith, there really is no sanction." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella agreed. Without direct evidence of 
misconduct by prosecutors, the defense was left to argue that Ito should base 
his ruling simply on an inference, he said. And that fell short, Arenella 
added, because the delays arguably were as inconvenient to prosecutors as they 
were to defense attorneys because they mean that both sides are forced to 
prepare without a full set of scientific results. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ruling was the day's most important substantive development, the 
uproar surrounding the release of the book delayed the proceedings and caused 
Simpson's lawyers to publicly state that they believed their client's right to 
a fair trial was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proceedings today have left a very dark cloud over our system of 
justice," said Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys. "I have been 
concerned for a very long time about whether O.J. Simpson would have a very 
difficult time getting a fair trial based on all the media attention. Events of 
today have convinced me O.J. Simpson cannot get a fair trial, and it concerns 
us greatly because so much effort has been put into this by both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The book -- co-written by National Enquirer columnist Mike Walker and Faye D. 
Resnick, a friend of Nicole Simpson's -- hit bookstores this week amid great 
fanfare. Ito directed his clerk to secure a copy so that he could review it and 
determine whether any adjustments needed to be made to jury selection as a 
result of its publication. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the book Tuesday morning, Ito addressed prospective jurors 
after the lunch break. Although he did not name the book, Ito told members of 
the panel that it "has caused the court deep concern about Mr. Simpson's 
ability to get a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick's book is replete with allegations against O.J. Simpson, many of them 
based on what she said were private conversations with his ex-wife. Resnick 
repeatedly states that she believes O.J. Simpson is responsible for the June 12 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Resnick writes that Nicole Simpson told her, "O.J. loves me so 
much he's going to kill me . . . and get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick also said that the former football star told her in April, while 
Nicole Simpson was trying to distance herself from her ex-husband: "If she's 
with another man, I'll kill her. You tell her she'd better play her role and 
look like my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those and other inflammatory passages, Resnick's co-author, Walker, 
acknowledged at a news conference hawking the book that it contains no "smoking 
gun" information about the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it influence the trial?" Walker asked in response to a question. "I 
can't imagine with the billions of words that have been spoken about this case 
it can have an undue influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The book contains a description of an alleged June 12, 1994, argument between 
O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife that, if true, would appear to contradict a 
statement he gave to police. In that statement, Simpson said he had not spoken 
with his ex-wife at their daughter's ballet recital, which took place hours 
before the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick, who acknowledges she was in drug rehabilitation at the time of the 
murders, writes that Nicole Simpson called her that evening and told her of an 
argument at the recital. That account, however, is contradicted by comments 
made by members of Nicole Simpson's family. They have said Simpson would not 
speak to his ex-wife at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Resnick says she met with prosecutor Clark shortly after the 
killings and that Clark asked her to make a statement. Regarding the matter, 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said, "I am confident that the defendant and the 
people can and will have a fair trial." At the news conference Tuesday, Walker 
said his co-author has not been asked to testify but has been asked to sign a 
sworn statement, which she has not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick has been out of public view for months but plans to emerge with a 
flourish this week. She has scheduled several television appearances, and 
Geraldo Rivera read aloud from her book on his show Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a news release, the publishers already have contracts to sell 
750,000 copies of the $14.95 book to bookstores. A local company has released a 
two-cassette abridged version of the book, read aloud by Resnick, which is 
selling for $16.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The B. Dalton Bookseller store in Downtown Los Angeles reported brisk sales 
Tuesday, with more than half its inventory being sold by early afternoon. One 
of the early copies went to one of Ito's law clerks, and the scores of 
journalists covering the trial scooped up more during the lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said at the news conference that part of the proceeds from the book 
would go to a fund to finance the college educations of O.J. and Nicole 
Simpson's children, Sydney, who turned 9 Monday, and Justin, who is 6. He 
declined to say what percentage of the proceeds it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 But Denise Brown, Nicole Brown's older sister, said the book's publishers had 
not approached her or, to her knowledge, other members of her family about 
establishing a trust fund for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a lie," she said, while declining to comment on the substance of the 
book. "We don't know anything about that. I don't have a clue about that and 
don't know what the fund entails." 
</P>
<P>
 Juditha Brown, Nicole's mother, said the family had purchased a copy of the 
book and was planning to look through it Tuesday night. Without having read it, 
she was reluctant to comment on the book's contents. She said she has been 
angered by some of the accounts she has heard but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she does not know how close her daughter was to Resnick. "I know 
they were friends at the end, but maybe only for a year or six months," she 
said.

KEMP, BENNETT AND INS CHIEF DECRY PROP. 187; CAMPAIGN: STATEMENTS BY GOP 
LEADERS, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL BROADEN OPPOSITION ON TWO FRONTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening new fronts in the debate over Proposition 187, a ranking Clinton 
Administration official and two leading national conservatives Tuesday 
condemned the California ballot measure, which is aimed at cutting off public 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Republican Cabinet secretaries Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett said 
in interviews that they will issue a statement today denouncing Proposition 187 
as unconstitutional, contrary to conservative principles and likely to 
encourage discrimination against ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, immigrants have become a popular political and social scapegoat," 
the two men will say, according to a copy of the document provided to The 
Times. "But concerns about illegal immigration should not give rise to a series 
of fundamentally flawed, constitutionally questionable 'solutions' which are 
not consonant with our history." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a Tuesday appearance in Los Angeles, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner offered the strongest 
condemnation of the ballot measure to date from a Clinton Administration 
official. She maintained that Proposition 187 is based on a faulty premise: 
that social welfare benefits act as a magnet for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe that the proposition is an effective way of enforcing the 
law against illegal aliens," she said at a news conference. "The incentives for 
illegal immigration are to work in the United States, not to sign up for 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the White House never has taken a formal position on the 
controversial measure, Meissner's remarks amplified a steady drumbeat of 
opposition from leading Democrats and Clinton Administration officials, 
including White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
But the Kemp-Bennett statement marked the first significant opposition to the 
initiative from national Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The brusque rejection of Proposition 187 puts Kemp and Bennett directly at 
odds with Pete Wilson, California's Republican governor, who has strongly 
supported the measure and made opposition to illegal immigration a cornerstone 
of his reelection campaign. But beyond its impact on California, the 
Kemp-Bennett statement brings into the open the discomfort quietly expressed 
over the last year by a number of conservative thinkers about the GOP's 
hardening line against immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett served as education secretary under President Ronald Reagan and has 
emerged as a favorite of social conservatives, with his denunciations of 
illegitimate births and calls for cultural renewal. Kemp served as housing and 
urban development secretary under President George Bush and is considered a 
potential top-tier contender for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination. Both are 
now co-directors of the Washington-based think-tank, Empower America. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Maliniak, a spokesman for the campaign against Proposition 187, said that 
the Kemp-Bennett statement demonstrates that opposition to the measure is 
broadening as its implications come into clearer focus. "This elevates it yet 
again to another level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harold Ezell, former INS western states director who helped write the 
measure, said that he doubts the Kemp-Bennett statement will change many minds. 
"These two guys have been sucked in by the Democratic Party line," he said. 
"Clinton must have written their press release." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Bennett acknowledged that they are uncertain whether their statement 
will erode the overwhelming support for the ballot measure among conservatives 
and Republicans. In a Times poll earlier this month, the measure was favored 
59% to 33% among likely voters statewide. Support was most intense among 
self-described Republicans (75%) and conservatives (72%). 
</P>
<P>
 But the two former Cabinet members said that they consider it important to 
condemn the measure, if only to discourage the party from emphasizing 
anti-immigrant themes elsewhere in the country and in the 1996 presidential 
campaign. "I am concerned that, if this passes in California, it will be 
introduced in other states and people will want to put it in the 1996 
platform," said Kemp, who is traveling this week in California and will appear 
today at the Richard Nixon presidential library in Yorba Linda. "It corrodes 
the soul of the party." 
</P>
<P>
 In their statement, Bennett and Kemp stressed that they oppose providing 
welfare benefits to illegal immigrants but noted that such benefits already are 
prohibited by law. In attempting to eliminate other public services for illegal 
immigrants, Bennett said, he and Kemp fear that the proposition will inspire a 
broader wave of "nativism" that could also produce a backlash against legal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a thing like this gets started, the kind of brushes that are going to be 
used tend to be way too broad," Bennett said. "It is wrong in itself, but it is 
also going to label all immigrants, it is going to turn into a war of colors, a 
war of races. It's bad stuff. It is poison in a democracy." Bennett noted that 
earlier he had expressed support for the proposition. But he said that 
statement had been based on the mistaken assumption that it dealt solely with 
cutting off welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatically, the two men maintained, the measure's requirements that 
schools and hospitals report people they believe to be in the country illegally 
could lead to both discrimination and an expansion of government authority that 
should be anathema to conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charging teachers and nurses with the duty of reporting people they suspect 
to be illegal immigrants is profoundly anti-conservative; it relies on a highly 
intrusive Big Brother approach," Kemp and Bennett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 They added: "It is also a mandate for ethnic discrimination. Does anyone 
seriously doubt that Latino children named Rodriguez would be more likely to 
'appear' to be illegal than Anglo children named, say, Jones?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell argued that Kemp and Bennett were exaggerating the measure's impact 
because the reporting requirement does not apply to teachers. Rather, students 
would be required to prove their legality to school administrators when they 
sign up for classes, he said. Both sides, however, acknowledged that medical 
personnel would be required to check the citizenship status of those suspected 
of illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the concerns about discrimination, Kemp and Bennett said that the 
Republican Party risks alienating entrepreneurial, family-oriented immigrants 
who might otherwise be attracted to the party's message. "The Republican Party 
helped to create a Democratic base in many of America's cities with its hostile 
stand toward the last generation of immigrants from Italy, Ireland and the 
nations of Central Europe," they write. "Can anyone calculate the political 
cost of again turning away immigrants, this time. . . . Asians, Hispanics and 
others?" 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the illegal immigration problem, the two men write, government 
should instead focus on intensifying enforcement at the border, cracking down 
on fraudulent immigration documents and reforming the INS bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in her Los Angeles appearance, Meissner endorsed a two-pronged 
strategy to reduce illegal immigration, stressing enhanced border enforcement 
and stepped-up efforts to ensure that those here illegally do not find work. 
That plan is in line with proposals recently endorsed by the Commission on 
Immigration Reform, the bipartisan body that this month released its own 
sweeping report on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressing the need to target enforcement at the workplace, Meissner said that 
officials are currently seeking ways to improve verification of prospective 
workers' immigration eligibility, probably involving some kind of link between 
INS and Social Security Administration databases. The Commission on Immigration 
Reform endorsed such a concept, which would allow employers to verify the 
eligibility of prospective workers, presumably via telephone hookups to the 
newly created database. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House plans to submit legislation to the next Congress on a range of 
immigration issues, Meissner said, and is likely to include some proposed means 
of improved employer verification. 
</P>
<P>
 But any such proposal is expected to be costly, cumbersome and meet fierce 
opposition. In their statement, for instance, Kemp and Bennett denounced both 
the national identification card and central database proposals in terms 
similar to their criticism of Proposition 187 as an unwise expansion of 
government power likely to foster discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday in San Diego, Meissner expanded on her criticism of the measure, 
saying it would strain the already overburdened immigration service and other 
federal and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of Proposition 187 "would be very resource-demanding of the 
immigration service," she said. "It would also create very severe demands on 
school resources, health provider resources and resources of social services 
institutions. It would cost money to enforce it not only at the federal level 
but at the state level." 
</P>
<P>
 H. D. Palmer, a campaign spokesman for Wilson, called Meissner's comments part 
of a "blatant pattern" by the Clinton Administration to use immigration issues 
to rescue the flagging gubernatorial campaign of Kathleen Brown, the Democratic 
nominee.

HURT PRESIDENT, WHOSE SECOND CHOICE IS CALLED UNQUALIFIED. INVESTOR CONFIDENCE 
MAY BE SHAKEN.

 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's first choice for the crucial job of prime 
minister has rejected the offer, leaving the restored leader facing a possible 
lack of confidence in his government by international lenders and the Clinton 
Administration, according to Haitian and diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart Michele, a wealthy businessman and close associate of Aristide, was 
offered the prime ministership last week in Washington, the sources said, but 
turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said that Aristide's second choice for prime minister is Claudette 
Werleigh, a little-known social activist with almost no support in the local 
business or international financial communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her appointment," said one diplomat, "could lead to the unraveling of 
Aristide's entire financial team" in the Cabinet. "It certainly would hurt the 
confidence (of foreign) investors in Aristide's commitment to a modern, 
free-market economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate result would be the likely refusal of Leslie Delatour to 
serve in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Delatour, a widely respected former finance minister and World Bank 
consultant, has been Aristide's chief economic adviser in recent months and 
drafted an economic program that triggered promises of significant financial 
aid from several wealthy nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. officials involved in Haiti policy, including Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, expected Delatour would be named either finance minister or 
president of the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is not appointed to a key financial post or refuses to accept a ministry 
rather than serve with Werleigh, the confidence in Aristide's government among 
the international lending agencies and wealthy governments could be hurt, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole premise of the enthusiastic support of Aristide's return by the 
donor nations and the IFIs (international financial institutions) was that 
Leslie (Delatour), Leslie Voltaire and Mrs. Rey would make up the financial 
center of the government," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the widely held assumption that Delatour would be finance 
minister; Voltaire, a well-known planning expert, would be planning minister, 
and Marie-Michele Rey, a longtime and successful private banker, would head the 
Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 All are known as technocrats who advocate free-market economics, reduced 
government bureaucracy, privatization of public enterprises and alternative 
approaches to traditional government involvement in public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Werleigh's appointment would not immediately endanger the half-billion-dollar 
multinational aid program already approved for Aristide's government, 
international financial sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "it certainly could damage (private) investment prospects," one expert 
said, "and it would cause us to look closely at projects in the future. It 
doesn't build confidence, that is for certain." 
</P>
<P>
 No reasons were made public for Michele's refusal to take the prime minister's 
post, but sources speculated that Michele, who quit Aristide's first Cabinet, 
dislikes the indecisive manner in which Aristide is known to conduct affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign and Haitian experts warned against concluding that Michele's 
refusal was a crisis, pointing out that Aristide returned to power only 
Saturday after three years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other sources pointed out that Aristide had been preparing to return 
almost from the moment he was ousted by a military coup on Sept. 30, 1991, and 
was assured of his restoration a month ago when Haiti's army leaders agreed to 
step down and U.S. troops entered Haiti to enforce the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming Werleigh, who has served as foreign minister under the caretaker 
Cabinet of the departing acting Prime Minister Robert Malval, is seen by 
several sources as a sign of weakness on Aristide's part. Werleigh is 
considered an economic and financial neophyte, and the prospect of her heading 
the government has left some business people and diplomats shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 After Michele declined, Aristide settled on Werleigh because he wanted a woman 
in a senior position, some sources said, and because she represents a 
commitment to social programs. She served briefly as minister of social 
planning in one of the abortive governments before Aristide won the country's 
first democratic elections in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide had originally settled on Michele, the sources said, for three 
reasons: The two men were close friends and knew one another's thoughts; 
Michele was acceptable to the business and international financial community, 
and Michele accepted the need for a social agenda for the government. 
</P>
<P>
 One associate recalled that Michele resigned as commerce minister in 
Aristide's original Cabinet because Aristide was inconsistent, telling him one 
thing and then changing his mind after hearing an opposing viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said the earlier disagreement centered on Aristide's refusal to 
back Michele in his effort to reduce government subsidies to keep food and 
other consumer prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the political, and possibly economic, turmoil generated by the 
controversy over the Cabinet, Aristide did move ahead on some items in his 
first full day of official work Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A shipment of 150,000 barrels of gasoline, diesel and kerosene was to arrive 
Tuesday night, the first legal shipment of petroleum since an embargo was 
ordered in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials said the fuel would be put on sale today with the price 
of gasoline about $3 a gallon, about 30% higher than the pre-embargo cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also signaled that his permanent army commander will be Bernardin 
Poisson, who was quietly promoted to brigadier general Monday by acting 
commander Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval.

COLUMN ONE; PARTY'S OVER, KUWAIT TELLS ITS CITIZENS; EVEN A COUNTRY EARNING $35 
MILLION A DAY DOESN'T HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES. TALK OF TAXES AND BENEFIT CUTS 
IS NOT POPULAR. LEADERS SAY IT'S TIME FOR CODDLED RESIDENTS TO PITCH IN.

<P>
 A glitzy new, 511-seat McDonald's restaurant rests on a rocky outcrop of the 
Persian Gulf coast here, offering breathtaking views of the blue sea, passing 
tankers and, lately, American warships. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, though, the guy who lives in the palace across the street is 
the crown prince of Kuwait. And he doesn't like his new view. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to worry. The dispute is being solved in time-honored Kuwaiti fashion 
-- quietly and with money. The government is buying the 3-month-old McDonald's 
building and offering the hamburger chain another site, a few hundred yards 
down the coast, without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Money and determination have worked wonders in Kuwait since 1991, when half a 
million American soldiers joined a worldwide coalition to break Iraqi dictator 
Saddam Hussein's hold on this small emirate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil wells are pumping again, at a rate of 2 million barrels a day; the 
environment is steadily improving, and the cradle-to-grave social welfare 
system still guarantees every Kuwaiti a tax-free income, free medical care and 
interest-free loans. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a country earning $35 million every day for its 600,000 citizens has 
bills to pay. And the latest crisis with Iraq has Kuwait's leaders preparing, 
more seriously than any time since oil was discovered in this desert, to force 
their coddled citizenry to help pay the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is going to have to pitch in here," said Saud al Sabah, minister of 
information, member of the royal family and former ambassador to the United 
States. "We're tightening our belt. And it's the responsibility of all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait's $30-billion share of the costs of the Gulf War, along with the $30 
billion it spent to extinguish the oil fires and rebuild, have taken their 
toll, at least on paper. Kuwait also has committed $3.5 billion to expanding 
its own military and promised to pay as much as half of the at least 
$500-million tab run up by the international rush to defend it in the current 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 No one here questions defense spending, especially in light of the threat 
posed by Hussein. "Money can always be recovered and made up," Saud said in an 
interview. "But once you lose your country, you have nothing. We've fully 
committed our financial resources to this whole operation." 
</P>
<P>
 But many Kuwaitis, still nursing their personal financial wounds from the war, 
are wary of the talk of "fees" and even "taxes" emanating from the palaces 
where the country's rulers live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's illogical to impose fees," said Ghannam Jamhour, an opposition member of 
Parliament, "particularly in a country where the citizens see national funds 
flowing out of the country in loans and grants to other countries in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait spends considerable sums on development aid, mostly in the 
non-oil-producing Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: Kuwait is not poor, not by any measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although war and reconstruction costs have forced it to draw down its foreign 
investments by 50%, the oil in the ground and the emirate's remaining 
investments, worth $60 billion, have made it easy to obtain loans at friendly 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuwaitis are spending too much, and the government, which employs 92% of 
adult Kuwaitis, is running an annual deficit of $6 billion, large enough to be 
worrying. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are obvious: Every Kuwaiti is constitutionally guaranteed a job, 
free medical care and free education. Their air-conditioned houses have the 
lowest utility bills in the world. A telephone costs $100 a year, with free 
local calls. And no one pays income or sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Newlyweds can get a free new home from the government simply by applying, 
though there is a waiting list. If they prefer, Kuwaitis can receive free land 
and a $210,000, interest-free, 60-year loan to build their own house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, to bolster morale in the besieged emirate 
and help people get back on their feet, Kuwait's ruling family forgave all 
loans for everything from houses to Mercedes-Benz cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The social cushion already is enormous, and, with half of Kuwait's population 
younger than 18, the drain on the country's resources is likely to grow rapidly 
in coming years. So the government is searching for places to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, it suggested minimal fees for some medical services but 
dropped the idea in the face of loud objections. Now the government is 
considering other alternatives, including charging for local telephone calls, 
imposing a trial wage tax or increasing the duty on luxury goods. Those higher 
duties seem likely soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about luxuries, not necessities," Saud said. "Like 
Mercedes-Benzes and Rolls-Royces. You pay just 4% now. That's ridiculously 
low." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides raising money, he said, the government needs to "seriously think" 
about cutting its own spending -- or at least redirecting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Government departments and state-run businesses now are bloated with people, 
many of whom do little more than occupy a desk and chair during the six-hour 
workday. The more ambitious have businesses of their own, which they tend 
during their substantial free time. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the country's army, air force and police are seriously understaffed, 
reflecting, some say, the reluctance of Kuwaitis to get their hands dirty in 
real work. 
</P>
<P>
 The new McDonald's, owned by a Kuwaiti entrepreneur, has a staff of 170 with 
20 managers -- all hired and trained in Manila. And most houses have a 
full-time Indian or Philippine maid, who gets paid, on average, $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joke making the rounds among foreigners here, a Kuwaiti man is asked 
whether making love is work or pleasure. "It must be pleasure," he says, 
"because if it was work I'd get an Indian to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kuwaitis are a minority in their own country, accounting for just 
one-third of the 1.6 million people here. And they have long relied heavily on 
imported labor -- from Egypt, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines -- to do 
everything from manage businesses to clean houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Those foreigners, though, are not exactly welcomed with open arms. The law 
prohibits non-Kuwaitis from owning property or having a majority share in any 
company in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all in the same boat," said Wilson Mangally, an Indian who works as a 
middle manager for a car rental company here. "And the Kuwaitis think they can 
buy anything with money." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has tried before, without success, to get Kuwaitis to pay some 
of their own way. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, diplomats say, it may work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the 1970s, they were literally looking for ways to spend money here," 
a Western diplomat said. "But now, with the threat of Saddam across the border, 
they are beginning to understand that the government pockets aren't 
bottomless." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason such change may be more welcome is the significant move toward 
democracy in the country. Although the government, run by the ruling Al Sabah 
family, still has the last say, it listens more these days to its opponents in 
Parliament. And criticism of the royal family, though not the emir, is daily 
fare in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The royal family still has the ultimate power," said Dr. Jasem Hajia, a 
U.S.-trained psychiatrist in Kuwait City. "Some don't like it, but most of us 
are used to this kind of rule. They aren't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Gulf War, a kind of social contract has been forged between the 
rulers and citizens in Kuwait. For its part, the government does its best to 
keep the oil machine running and build up the country's defense alliances; 
citizens agree to allow the ruling family to stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, this is a more politically stable country now than before the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic reforms have been slowly, but steadily, implemented. Although one 
analyst says it will be 30 years before the vote is extended to women, the 
government recently added sons of naturalized Kuwaitis to the voting rolls, 
increasing the country's electorate from 80,000 to about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the threat from Iraq has helped pull the nation 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is, of course, money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwaitis like to spend it, taking yearly or twice-yearly vacations to faraway 
spots, buying expensive cars and all manner of electronic gadgetry. At the 
shopping malls and on the streets, pagers and telephones sound from the deep 
pockets of Kuwaitis' white dishdashas.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he carries a pager, Issa Aljadi, a 24-year-old engineer at the 
national oil company, said: "I don't know. In case my mother wants to reach me, 
I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 But the free-spending days may be numbered here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less money -- it's a fact," said Jassim M. Hassan, a biochemist at 
Kuwait University. "It's a new thing. Before, no one would have dared suggest 
that we pay any government taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "By nature, we Kuwaitis are not the kind of people who keep money and save 
money," he added. "We like to enjoy life. But you can't do what you did before. 
We'll all have to contribute now, and that's a positive thing. We are shaping 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign diplomats say that fewer than 10% of Kuwaitis are hard-working 
entrepreneurs and that most of those are experts in finance. Many of the rest 
avoid difficult jobs and are content to live on what the government gives them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old social network, which one diplomat describes as "beyond 
Sweden," has, indeed, spawned a feeling of relaxation, if not laziness, among 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just spoiled," said Badir Refai, an oil company executive with two 
Mercedes-Benzes in his garage. "They don't want to pay for electricity or 
water. And they take so much medicine home from the clinics that they have to 
throw them in the garbage. Why shouldn't we pay?" 
</P>
<P>
 The world stereotype of slothful Kuwaitis angers many here, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling in the world that we don't deserve what we have," said 
Saif Abbas Abdulla, 52, chairman of the political science department at Kuwait 
University. "But we are not living like kings. We are not even living like 
prime ministers. It is a reasonably comfortable life. And we know how to 
utilize our money."

PROBE LAUNCHED INTO NASDAQ STOCK TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation of the Nasdaq 
stock market, looking into allegations of price-fixing and other illegal 
practices by dealers in the nation's busiest stock marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antitrust division is looking at the possibility of anti-competitive 
practices in the over-the-counter stock market," said Justice Department 
spokeswoman Gina Talamona. 
</P>
<P>
 Talamona declined to answer questions about the probe, but sources who have 
been contacted by government lawyers said the investigation is examining the 
fundamental stock-trading practices of Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the investigation appears to be in a preliminary phase. If 
the antitrust division decides to go forward with the case, it could bring 
either criminal price-fixing charges or civil antitrust charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronically linked national market is home to the shares of such 
familiar companies as Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. In 
the first six months of 1994, its average daily trading volume surpassed the 
New York Stock Exchange for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions have been raised this year about whether Nasdaq trading may be 
rigged against small investors. The Justice Department inquiry follows the May 
release of a study by two business school professors who said they found 
evidence of at least tacit collusion to fix investors' trading costs among many 
of the 510 Nasdaq market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Major market makers and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which owns 
and operates Nasdaq, have strongly denied the existence of collusion in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, T. Grant Callery, general counsel of the 
Washington-based NASD, said: "Neither the NASD nor the Nasdaq stock market has 
been contacted by the Justice Department regarding any investigation. We will 
cooperate fully with any such investigation when and if we are contacted." 
</P>
<P>
 Market makers are the dealers who, committing their own capital, stand ready 
to buy or sell specific Nasdaq stocks at publicly quoted prices. They include 
such well-known Wall Street firms as Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and Morgan 
Stanley Group Inc. and lesser-known firms that do little besides trade Nasdaq 
stocks, such as Troster Singer Corp. and Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where a single "specialist" firm is the 
sole market maker for each stock, each issue on Nasdaq (the name originally 
stood for National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system) has 
multiple market makers who are expected to post competing prices for buying and 
selling shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the business professors' study was made public, at least 24 class-action 
lawsuits have been filed against major market makers on behalf of investors, 
nearly all alleging violations of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard B. Simon, a lawyer in San Diego with the firm of Milberg, Weiss, 
Bershad, Specthrie & Lerach, which filed one of the cases, said a judicial 
panel consolidated most of them Monday, assigning the suits to U.S. District 
Judge Robert W. Sweet in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the Justice Department has formed a task force of staff 
lawyers and economists to scrutinize Nasdaq, with participation by at least one 
regional antitrust division office as well as the department's headquarters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers have interviewed several market makers who are anxious to 
cooperate in the investigation. They also have spoken with officials of the 
federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the business school professors who 
wrote the critical report and several of the lawyers who filed class-action 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force have also spent time sitting on Nasdaq trading desks 
in recent weeks, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their paper, to be published in December in the Journal of Finance, William 
G. Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul H. Schulz of Ohio State 
University found that for many of the largest Nasdaq stocks, dealers seemed to 
always quote prices in a way that maintained at least a 1/4-point, or 25-cent 
"spread." 
</P>
<P>
 These spreads -- essentially the market makers' profit margin -- are the gap 
between the "bid" price (the price at which a market maker is willing to buy a 
stock) and the higher "asked" price (at which the firm is willing to sell). 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, by contrast, spreads for most stocks are 1/8 
of a point, or 12.5 cents, an NYSE spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The professors found that for 71 out of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks, 
market makers seemed never to quote prices in "odd eighths" of a point. In 
other words, bid or asked prices could be 20, 20 1/4, 20 1/2 or 20 3/4, but 
never 20 1/8, 20 3/8, 20 5/8 or 20 7/8 -- even though such quotes are common 
for other stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The direct result was that spreads in these stocks were never less than 1/4 of 
a point. And the wider spreads end up costing investors, in the aggregate, 
millions of dollars every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie and Schulz concluded that the only possible explanation for the 
spreads was "tacit collusion" among market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after their report was made public, spreads for a few of the stocks 
they cited -- including Apple, Microsoft and Thousand Oaks-based Amgen Inc. -- 
suddenly narrowed to 1/8 of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the Justice Department inquiry has broadened beyond looking 
at possible collusion on spreads to other alleged anti-competitive practices. 
These include allegations that market makers refuse to honor their posted 
prices and that the dealers systematically prevent customers from finding out 
about offers from fellow investors to buy or sell at prices better than those 
available from the market makers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not the first time the antitrust division has gotten involved in 
securities matters, the inquiry represents an unusual foray into an area 
normally left to the SEC. Anne K. Bingaman, appointed by President Clinton to 
head the division, has led the unit into a series of new initiatives after a 
long period of relative dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. has been moving to impose some new restrictions 
on Nasdaq, aimed at getting better prices for individual investors. But John C. 
Coffee Jr., a Columbia University professor specializing in securities law, 
said the Justice Department is better equipped than the SEC to deal with any 
broad problems that exist in the market's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the kind of case that the SEC specializes in," he said of the 
allegations of collusion, adding that the antitrust division is "much more used 
to dealing with a whole pattern and practice by a very large industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of several large Nasdaq market-making firms -- including Morgan 
Stanley Inc., Charles Schwab & Co. (which owns giant Nasdaq market maker Mayer 
& Schweitzer Inc.), Troster Singer Corp. and others -- either declined to 
comment or said their firms were unaware of an investigation.

CALIFORNIA'S PRISON BUDGET: WHY IS IT SO VORACIOUS?; CORRECTIONS: INMATE 
INFLUX, HIGH WORKER PAY, LITIGATION AND SOARING MEDICAL COSTS ALL TAKE THEIR 
TOLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the nation's largest prison system, nothing is cheap -- and as felons by 
the thousands are sentenced under "three strikes," the cost of operating this 
unwieldy system is certain to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, salaries are inflated to entice people to work in a bleak, isolated, 
often dangerous world. The annual state prison payroll exceeds $2 billion. Top 
pay for correctional officers equals that of the best-paid big city cops. 
</P>
<P>
 Food alone runs $2.45 a day per inmate, but the grocery bill for 130,000 of 
them will be $194 million this year. An unhealthy lot, they will rack up 
medical costs of $300 million, and doctors will do everything from delivering 
hundreds of babies to treating cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade into history's most expensive prison building boom, California will 
spend $3.1 billion this year to run its prisons. Around the turn of the 
century, the prison population and the cost of running prisons will double, if 
the "three strikes" law is enforced to the fullest, according to the Department 
of Corrections and the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 As voters mull the "three strikes" initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, government 
experts say the state will be unable to pay for the incarceration of everyone 
sentenced to prison in years to come, unless sentencing laws are drastically 
overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 To feed the voracious prison budget, the money will have to come from higher 
taxes or cuts in state support for other programs -- chiefly the University of 
California and California State University systems, according to financial 
consultant William Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billions of dollars will have to go from other budgets just for 'three 
strikes,' " said Pickens, a former vice president at Cal State Sacramento. "The 
numbers are quite clear, irrefutable." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, said 
corrections spending can rise without tax increases. As the state emerges from 
the recession, more people will have jobs and pay taxes, providing more money 
for all state operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably get more than our fair share," Brown said. "We'll get 20% of 
the growth. But we won't get all the growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without "three strikes," records and interviews show, California's prison 
system already is strained: 
</P>
<P>
 * Growing numbers of inmates arrive with communicable disease -- nearly a 
fourth of them have the tuberculosis virus -- adding millions in costs and 
raising fears that workers will contract disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * One in five inmates has mental problems or brain damage -- and the 
Corrections Department has lost initial rounds of two class action lawsuits 
over care of mentally ill prisoners. The cost of complying with court orders 
could add tens of millions of dollars to the department's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * Staffing levels are among the lowest in the country, although the 
23,000-member California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. plans to push for 
more staff to ensure officers' safety during the expected influx of more unruly 
prisoners with longer sentences under "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Although a third of its employees are women, the department has a history of 
sexual discrimination, receiving more complaints and paying out more in damages 
-- $2.2 million -- than any other state agency in the 1990s. In August, the 
department lost a $1.3-million sexual harassment judgment, but it is appealing. 
Corrections officials are trying to solve the problem by spending $1.6 million 
on training and investigations of sexual harassment claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department has trouble finding competent officers and professionals 
willing to work in desolate locales where most new prisons open. Some prisons 
have scores of vacancies, and wardens have been dismissed at three new prisons 
over management problems. Chuckwalla Valley prison at Blythe has had four 
wardens since it opened in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest challenge corrections faces is coming up with adequate 
experienced, well-trained supervisory and middle-level management staff, 
because we've grown so rapidly," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections administrators try to limit costs by centralizing policies and 
purchasing among 28 prisons, and reducing inmate programs. But the driving cost 
remains inmates -- and that number rises almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Legislature takes 20,000 inmates, they can have $100 million (back) 
and I won't say a word," said Corrections Department director James Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the nation's prison population will reach 1 million, and state and 
federal governments will spend $21 billion to operate their prisons. 
California's share, $3.1 billion, will be $1.6 billion more than Texas and $1.7 
billion more than New York, according to a national study. Although California 
has the largest inmate population, its cost per prisoner, about $24,000 
annually, also is higher than in those states. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a look at some reasons why California's prisons cost so much: 
Politicians 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders, taking a tough-on-crime stance, are unwilling to shorten or 
eliminate prison terms for even nonviolent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state could save $157 million next year by eliminating prison terms for 
people convicted of petty theft, drunken driving, drug possession, marijuana 
offenses, forgery and fraud, according to a Corrections Department analysis. 
The state could save $94 million more by eliminating prison for people 
convicted of drug possession for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards union told a legislative committee that it would support "phasing 
out" prison terms for people found guilty of petty theft. Enough inmates are 
doing time for petty theft to fill an entire prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of those suggestions surfaced in public debate. The guards union put 
its efforts into winning passage of "three strikes" and other anti-crime bills. 
The Legislature obliged, passing 104 bills lengthening sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "An election year is not the most opportune time for criminal justice reform," 
said Geoff Long, consultant for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to cut incarceration costs by overhauling sentencing, lawmakers take 
slaps at the prison budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A favored target is conjugal visits. California is one of seven states that 
allow inmates with good discipline records to have private overnight visits 
with spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Legislature approved the prison budget this summer, Assemblyman Dean 
Andal (R-Stockton), running for a seat on the State Board of Equalization, won 
passage of a measure to ban such visits for child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings will be negligible because the entire conjugal visiting program costs 
$3.7 million a year. The most likely outcome will be that other inmates will 
take the place of convicted molesters who are denied conjugal privileges. 
Meanwhile, at least five inmates serving time for crimes against children have 
sued over the issue. Staffing 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest cost in prisons is salaries -- 66.5% of the budget. The payroll 
goes up one position each time six felons arrive. To fill a single position, 
the department must hire as many as five employees to cover all shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 California's staff-to-inmate ratio is third lowest in the nation, the Criminal 
Justice Institute reports. But California also pays its prison employees more 
than virtually every other state. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief physicians at a prison are paid as much as $103,212 a year. Chief 
psychiatrists earn up to $101,832. Wardens make $83,748, 20% above the national 
average maximum pay, the institute says. 
</P>
<P>
 The department spent $146.6 million on overtime last year, $52 million more 
than had been budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 It also pays $2,400 bonuses to entice employees to remain for a full year at 
less desirable posts -- such as two prisons in Blythe. Employees who remain a 
year at San Quentin and Soledad prisons are paid $2,100 housing allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at remote prisons, finding professionals is difficult. Pelican Bay 
State Prison in far Northern California was open more than two years before it 
had a full-time psychiatrist -- prompting allegations of inadequate mental 
health care in a major suit over conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally," said Pelican Bay Warden Charles Marshall, "you don't send any 
inmates in until everything is in place. That wasn't reality. The reality was 
they were coming in at 300-plus a week." 
</P>
<P>
 California's force of 15,798 correctional officers, or guards, will be paid 
more than $720 million this year, including overtime. The state pays veteran 
officers more than any other state except Alaska, New Jersey and New Mexico. 
Officers at the top pay step -- and more than half make top pay -- get $10,000 
a year more than those in the federal Bureau of Prisons, and 47% above the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven years on the job, an officer makes $44,676 a year, plus an annual 
uniform allowance of $530. That rivals the top pay for a Los Angeles patrol 
officer -- $47,940, attained after 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With bonuses and overtime, a seven-year officer at Blythe could bring in an 
extra $16,000, boosting his or her pay to $60,000, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Novey of the guards union says, "This profession has been in existence for 135 
years and it got the raw deal for 130 of them. They're just catching up. . . . 
They just want their just wages for a tough job." Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 California spends more on prisoners' health and mental health care -- $372 
million -- than 36 states spend on their entire prison budgets. The cost will 
mount fast as more prisoners serve longer sentences and some prisons become 
"essentially retirement communities," said Norman Carlson, former head of the 
federal Bureau of Prisons and a professor at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisoners by their very nature are in very poor health. Their medical costs 
far exceed the cost of incarceration," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical system includes a new 75-bed, $17-million hospital at Corcoran 
State Prison, hospitals at three older prisons, and contracts with community 
hospitals close to each of the prisons. To control costs, improve care and 
limit the spread of disease, Gomez created a health services unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say 1,153 inmates are known to carry the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. But a random study by the state Department of Health 
Services in 1988 found that 2.5% of the men and 3.1% of the women entering 
prison have the virus. If that number is accurate, the prison system would have 
more than 3,100 inmates with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth of the inmates -- 33,084 -- carry the TB virus, and roughly 100 
inmates a year come down with TB. Still, treatment costs exceed $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some money -- no one in corrections knows how much -- is spent on inmates such 
as Raymond Jackson. Jackson, in prison for kidnaping, is one of many inmates 
who arrive as drug abusers in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was placed on kidney dialysis in 1981 at the California Medical 
Facility, Vacaville. Acting as his own lawyer, he also sued to force the 
department into giving him a kidney transplant. Doctors balked, saying he was 
an uncooperative patient who hoarded his painkillers. But in 1987, after a 
state appellate court ruled in his favor, he got the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 At least seven other prisoners received kidney transplants at state expense -- 
about $50,000 each -- while Jackson waited five years for his, according to his 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's case did not end with the operation. He refiled it, claiming that 
the delay amounted to deliberate indifference to his suffering, and has lawyers 
representing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the state takes custody of somebody," said Antonio Ponvert III, one of 
the lawyers representing Jackson, "that person is precluded from seeking help 
elsewhere. . . . As a parent does for a child, you have an obligation to care 
for that person." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, before "three strikes" was part of the criminal justice lexicon, a 
study done for the Corrections Department found that 11% of the men and 15% of 
the women in prison had serious mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommended construction of new wards and renovation of old 
cellblocks for an estimated 18,000 mentally ill inmates, as well as the hiring 
of 520 medical and mental health staff. The total added cost was $122 million 
-- plus $68 million already being spent on mentally ill inmates. The department 
began funding the improvements last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aggressively dealing with it," said the correctional agency's Brown. 
"We're required to provide enough mental health care to avoid cruel and unusual 
punishment. We're not required to provide Mayo Clinic-level care." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two prisoners rights lawsuits have alleged that 28,000 inmates 
throughout the prison system are being deprived of adequate mental health care. 
If the Corrections Department loses and federal courts seize control of mental 
health care in prisons, costs could skyrocket to $300 million a year, said Kyle 
McKinsey, head of the department's health care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're under a constitutional obligation to provide mental health care," 
said Donald Specter of the Prison Law Office, which is pressing both suits. 
"However ironic it may seem, state government isn't similarly required to 
provide mental health care to you and me." Litigation 
</P>
<P>
 California inmates file about 1,000 lawsuits a year. Many are bizarre and 
frivolous. But some are serious, like one brought by the family of Tyler 
Henderson. Sent to prison at 19 on a second-degree murder conviction, 
Henderson, an epileptic, arrived at Pelican Bay in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, he and his family repeatedly told the prison that he needed a 
particular drug to control his seizures, but he did not get the medication and 
suffered more than 100 seizures during the next 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson died March 15, 1992. The Del Norte County coroner determined the 
reason to be a grand mal seizure -- a highly unusual cause of death in a day 
when epilepsy can be controlled with medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The department settled the case in 1993 for $175,000. Citing inexperienced 
staff at the new prison as a reason for Henderson's death, Jerry Prod, chief 
lawyer for the department, said: "We didn't watch him close enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The department settled another death case at the new women's prison at 
Chowchilla for $360,000 last year. The case involved Diana Reyes, 42, convicted 
of assault and drug possession. When medical staff found her four hours before 
she died in June, 1991, she was on a mattress on the floor of her cell, caked 
with dried feces. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of her death angered some prison staff. Medical technical 
assistant Robbie Jean Waters testified in a deposition: "Why was she on the 
floor, and why was she like this, and why hadn't she been seen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prod said the department settled the case because "we thought we had a chance 
of being held liable" in a trial. In all, the department settled nine medical 
malpractice cases last year for $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office assigns 80 lawyers and paralegals to 
defend the department against prisoners' lawsuits. The Corrections Department 
also hires outside attorneys, spending $17 million since 1990 on private 
lawyers to defend it against inmate and employee suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firms include several that are politically connected in Sacramento. 
One is Nielsen, Merksamer of Mill Valley, which has a contract worth $480,000. 
Vigo (Chip) Nielsen is Gov. Wilson's longtime campaign lawyer. Steve Merksamer 
was former Gov. George Deukmejian's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to win, so they look for the most qualified law firms they can 
find," Merksamer said. "We didn't solicit this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Prod said he was unaware that Nielsen is active in Wilson's political 
operation. He said he selected the firm because its partners include former 
deputy attorneys general who specialize in civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
 The department paid $2.8 million last year to outside firms to handle employee 
lawsuits, many of which involve sexual discrimination. While Gomez has tried to 
crack down on sexual misconduct, his agency continues to lose cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a Marin County judge ordered the state to pay $1.3 million to Lisa 
Pulido, who quit her job as a correctional officer at San Quentin after years 
of harassment. Co-workers and superiors propositioned her, followed her home, 
even assaulted her, said her lawyer, Pamela Y. Price of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido's judgment was the largest sexual harassment ruling against the 
department -- but not the only one. In the early 1990s, the department paid 
$1.4 million in sexual harassment claims, more than twice the sum paid by any 
other state agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some states, including Texas, California has avoided court orders that 
essentially seize control of major parts of the management of the state prison 
system. But California has been the target of class action suits brought on 
behalf of hundreds or thousands of inmates. When the department loses, the 
court orders define much of how it operates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, high-security prisoners mounted a successful suit charging that 
conditions at San Quentin, then California's highest-security prison, violated 
constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result of its loss in that suit, the Corrections Department built 
the $240-million Pelican Bay prison, which has an operating budget of $83.2 
million this year. Pelican Bay also has come into the sights of prisoners 
rights attorneys, who have alleged that conditions in its security housing 
unit, open less than five years and reserved for gang leaders and especially 
violent inmates, amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Programs 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s and '60s, California prisons were renowned for educational and 
vocational programs. In 1967, the state became the only one to pass an inmates 
bill of rights, guaranteeing prisoners most rights enjoyed by free people, 
including the right to marry, correspond confidentially with lawyers, and read 
virtually any book or magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, 6,500 inmates were enrolled in college courses. But with 
strained state finances, the Corrections Department abolished college courses 
for prisoners, and last month, Wilson signed legislation curtailing the inmates 
bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It all reflects a basic change in attitudes about the purpose of California 
prisons. Punishment, not rehabilitation, is the primary goal. 
</P>
<P>
 As more inmates arrive with "three strikes" sentences, the department will be 
forced to cut deeper into educational programs, predicted one prison official 
involved in educating inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The state spends 3% of its prison budget on education. But more than half the 
inmates have less than ninth-grade literacy, and an estimated 17,000 inmates 
are on waiting lists for prison jobs or education. 
</P>
<P>
 "While other correctional operations, such as prison construction and hiring 
of correctional officers, have been shielded from deep budget cuts, education 
has taken a severe blow," the state-funded Little Hoover Commission reported 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "We could put everybody in programs, but it would cost another 
$100-$150 million. The people who complain we don't put enough people in 
treatment often are the same people who complain that we take too big a share 
of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Sianez, 51, is serving a murder sentence of life without parole at the 
new prison at Folsom. Incarcerated since 1978, Sianez took college courses 
until that program was cut. He used to earn enough from leather work that he 
sent some money to his wife, whom he met and married while at Folsom. Now, he 
said, his art supplies amount to paper and pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no program," Sianez said. "You have a yard, and that's about it. 
There's even a bill to do away with weights. A lot of these guys, that's all 
they do. . . . It's going to get tougher, just like on the streets."

for the coming decades. The Times visited prisons, from the Imperial Valley to

CELLULAR PHONE FIRMS FIGHT HIGH-TECH WAR WITH PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Neither police investigators nor cellular phone officials know exactly how 
long Abner Pajounia and Davoud Yashoron operated the alleged dark side of their 
electronics shop on La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale police detectives -- who arrested the owners of Master Mobile 
Sound on Friday and then, posing as salesmen, conducted a sting operation over 
the weekend -- say the store was all too typical of those that have made 
cellular telephone fraud a high-tech crime of epic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and telephone company officials on Tuesday proudly displayed more than 
100 illegal "clone" phones and the computer equipment needed to make them, and 
said that when the costs of the illegal calls are tabulated, it could turn out 
to be one of the biggest cellular phone fraud busts ever in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities face a daunting task in trying to eliminate a fraud problem 
that accounts for an estimated $300 million a year in illegal calls nationwide 
-- and Los Angeles, the cellular phone capital of the country, is also the 
fraud capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Now law enforcement officials and cellular phone company technicians -- 
desperate to protect a dynamic industry that has created tens of thousands of 
jobs and altered the lifestyles of millions of Americans -- are redoubling 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch Cellular, one of the two big cellular carriers in Los Angeles, has 
dispatched more than 250 private detectives to scour Southland streets to 
identify cellular phone fraud. The industry is unleashing an array of powerful 
new electronic countermeasures that could take a big bite out of the problem -- 
but also might alienate some customers and saddle companies with both financial 
and operational burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 LA Cellular, which is subject to far more fraud than rival AirTouch Cellular, 
has quietly introduced a code system that could eventually require all 
customers to electronically "unlock" their cellular phones with an eight-digit 
code before making calls, according to an internal memorandum obtained by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also testing an electronic anti-fraud system called Operation 
Blackbird. Meanwhile, around the country, elaborate fraud detection schemes 
with names such as "Fraudbuster" and "Clone Detector" are being deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have launched our own high-tech war back at criminals," said Mike 
Houghton, a spokesman for the Cellular Telephone Industry Assn. "When this 
first started, we didn't know how to fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 Most cellular phone fraud involves "cloning," a process in which a thief 
steals the electronic serial number of a customer's cellular phone and programs 
it into a computer chip, thus making a perfect duplicate, or "clone" of that 
customer's phone. While cloning has been going on for some time, it has grown 
rapidly and become much more sophisticated as the cellular phone industry has 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1.2 million customers, LA Cellular and AirTouch operate in the nation's 
largest cellular phone market, and while they won't discuss losses from fraud, 
market analysts and industry insiders say they have been among the hardest hit 
companies in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to David Gamson, a legislative aide to state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal 
(D-Los Angeles), author of a bill that raised the theft of cellular phone 
service to a felony crime beginning this year, about one out of every four 
cellular phone calls made from Los Angeles is made from a counterfeit phone. 
</P>
<P>
 In some poorer Los Angeles neighborhoods, phone counterfeiters offer unlimited 
long-distance phone calls to customers for about $75 a month, said Detective 
Richard Garcia, who is assigned to the sheriff's Lomita station in southern Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In another variation, phone bandits set up call-selling schemes in which they 
use two cloned phones patched together and link callers with anyone anywhere in 
the world for between $10 and $20 per call, said Chuck Ortmann, the resident 
agent in charge of the Riverside County office of the U.S. Secret Service, 
which recently busted an Ontario call-sell operation. 
</P>
<P>
 While these types of calls do not exactly represent lost business for the 
cellular carriers -- customers in the fraud schemes generally would not be 
subscribers -- the illegal calls soak up valuable capacity on cellular systems. 
In addition, they can be a major inconvenience for subscribers whose phones are 
cloned: While they don't have to pay for clone calls, their numbers have to be 
changed, and straightening out the billing can be a major hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first found out about being cloned when I received a bill for $7,000," said 
Kenneth Hirsch, a West Hills dentist. "It looked like a United Nations: There 
were calls to Chicago, Ireland, South Africa, Russia, Lebanon and all over the 
U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first called LA Cellular, they told me the fraud department will 
contact me soon. The next month, an additional $2,000 showed up. . . . This was 
about four, five months ago. Since then they never got back to me, but they 
keep sending me the bills. I have called them four, five times." 
</P>
<P>
 LA Cellular officials say they believe that the problem is serious enough that 
many customers will voluntarily adopt the company's new Fraud Prevention 
Feature (FPF), which will require them to enter *56 plus 0 plus a four-digit 
personal identification number. And some resellers who asked not to be 
identified said they believe that the company plans eventually to make it a 
mandatory feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Goode, in charge of fraud prevention for LA Cellular, acknowledged that 
the company plans to push the fraud-prevention feature aggressively, but denied 
that there are any plans to make it mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cell fraud is a complex problem, and FPF is just one of many tools we use to 
combat that fraud," Goode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other tools are elaborate indeed. The Operation Blackbird 
technology precisely analyzes the radio signals emitted by each phone and uses 
the information to create an "electronic fingerprint," which is then checked 
every time that phone is used. If a mismatch is detected, the call will not go 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch has already implemented a similar system called Phoneprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countermeasures include systems that monitor and record customers' 
phone-calling patterns and alert company officials when wide variations are 
found. A sudden series of calls to Latin America, for example, would trigger an 
alert if that subscriber had never called there before. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw Cellular is experimenting with a voice-activated system that would 
require callers to match a voice print kept on record with the company before 
the phone could be turned on, said Jane O'Donaghue, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the more conventional methods of thwarting cellular 
pirates, such as contacting the person who receives an illegal phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to find out who you are by who you call," Dave Daniels, head of 
security at AirTouch promised. "We have no qualms about subpoenaing someone's 
mother, brother or sister into court. If they're foolish enough to want to get 
friends, relatives and business associates hauled into court, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, some law enforcement officers complain that prosecutors have been 
reluctant to file felony charges even when strong cases are brought to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecution is becoming more aggressive: In one of the largest cases to 
date, Rodney Phillips, 29, of Los Angeles, was recently convicted of possessing 
more than 20 altered phones and 200 phone numbers that AirTouch officials say 
were used to make more than $2 million in fraudulent phone calls. Phillips' 
sentencing is scheduled for November, said U.S. Atty. Christopher Tayback. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last October, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, guided by 
information provided by AirTouch, has made 340 arrests for phone fraud, Daniels 
said. LA Cellular would not provide details of arrests made through its 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Rich Garcia, hailed both by Daniels and his colleagues as 
a phone-clone hunter extraordinaire, said LA Cellular's reluctance to share 
information with authorities may have made them a favorite target of phone 
bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the biggest victims in the cloned phones," he said recently "Eighty 
percent of our cases are on LA Cellular. They have been more difficult to deal 
with and didn't provide information in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the companies and law enforcement agencies do, though, the 
bandits will be working on ways to continue plying their trade. Currently, the 
technical mainstay of cloning is a an electronic device -- called an ESN reader 
-- phone bandits use to send a false signal to trick cellular phones, which 
respond by identifying themselves with the internal serial number and the phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Serial numbers are also sometimes stolen and sold by company employees. With 
this information, creating a clone phone is relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out about how to put two phones together that work on the same line 
at the cellular phone store I used to work at. . . . It's pretty easy," said 
one phone pirate who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that his name 
not be used. "Originally I did it for a couple of friends and then it got out 
of hand. People started coming over, and they had 30-day guarantees and you 
have to honor those," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When these phones are sold by the pirates, he explained, they come with a 
30-day guarantee of service. If a phone is shut off before then, the buyer is 
given another number to use. 
</P>
<P>
 The pirate said a phone cloner can get into the business for $6,000 to 
$10,000. That includes the price of the computer gear needed to reprogram the 
phones and the fee paid to the technician who actually reprograms the chips. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-connected phone-clone salesman can sell 100 phones a week at about $100 
per phone. He said the cloned phones are widespread and are used by people 
across the socioeconomic spectrum. Some businesses use the cloned phones 
because they are a lot cheaper than paying for a legitimate service, he claims. 
And many of the people who use these phones, he claims, don't realize they are 
using a subscriber's phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just feel like they're just screwing the phone company and who cares 
about them?"

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 184; SPONSOR SAYS JUDGES HELPED WRITE '3 
STRIKES'; LEGAL EXPERTS SAY SUCH JURISTS SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM CASES 
INVOLVING THE SENTENCING MEASURE. MIKE REYNOLDS REFUSES TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO 
HELPED HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 Three judges took a leading role in writing the "three strikes" criminal 
sentencing law passed by the Legislature and now up for popular vote on the 
Nov. 8 ballot, according to the sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts are questioning the ethics of judges in lending their expertise 
to the supporters of the measure, saying they should be disqualified from 
ruling on any "three strikes" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the situation, Mike Reynolds, the driving force behind 
the "three strikes" initiative, Proposition 184, has declined to name the 
judges he says drafted the measure. No judges have come forward saying they 
helped write the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the judges told him they did not want their names to become 
known, because lawyers appearing before them on "three strikes" cases might 
question their impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a professional photographer from Fresno, said he never could have 
drafted "three strikes" without professional help from lawyers, prosecutors and 
the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reynolds, who entered the political arena after his daughter was 
murdered in 1992, seeks to protect judges he says assisted him, attorneys and 
other legal experts contacted by The Times say that any judge who took a hand 
in formulating the initiative has an ethical obligation to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds to me the judges recognized they should disqualify themselves from any 
motion that would require them to rule on the constitutionality," said Superior 
Court Judge Darrel W. Lewis of Sacramento, a former chairman of the ethics 
committee of the California Judges Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should voluntarily disqualify themselves from ruling on any 
constitutional question about it," Lewis added, "or at the very least, they 
should disclose to the participants that they actually played a significant 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot is identical to 
legislation signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the legislation already on the books, Proposition 184 doubles sentences 
for those who commit a second felony after one that is serious or violent. 
Criminals who have committed two violent or serious felonies such as murder, 
rape or burglary face minimum sentences of 25 years, and possibly far more, if 
they commit a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prosecutors have said portions of "three strikes" are poorly worded and 
ambiguous. Defense lawyers and other critics say the law will result in 
thousands of nonviolent criminals being sent to prison for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Judges Assn. and the California Judicial Council commonly take 
positions on legislation in Sacramento. But helping to draft a measure for a 
private person such as Reynolds goes beyond that, said Municipal Judge Julie 
Conger of Alameda County. 
</P>
<P>
 Conger, another former chair of the judges association's ethics committee, 
said any judge who helped author the initiative may have violated a specific 
canon of judicial conduct which precludes judges from practicing law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot practice law (if you're a judge)," Conger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conger said she views as "suspicious" Reynolds' statement that judges took a 
lead role in writing the law. A judge who got involved in such an undertaking 
would come forward "if they are true to the code of judicial conduct," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorship became an issue during a televised debate on Proposition 184 
last week in the Bay Area. "Three strikes" opponent Vincent Schiraldi charged 
that the initiative was authored by the National Rifle Assn., although he said 
in an interview afterward that he had no proof for the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very suspicious of covert authorship," said Schiraldi, who runs the 
Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. "We can't scrutinize 
the people who wrote this." 
</P>
<P>
 After the debate, Reynolds explained the genesis of "three strikes." He told 
The Times that judges took a lead role in drafting the measure, which was then 
circulated to deputies in the attorney general's office, and other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to tell you who was responsible for this," Reynolds said. "They 
were judges that did the actual pen to paper, the initial draft. . . . A 
nucleus of three judges did the actual framing and pen to paper, and we took 
that to other judges, blind. They did not know where it came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he would not name the judges, Reynolds said: "They asked to 
stay without identity. There could be at some point a need for them to rule on 
a 'three strikes' case and they didn't want to placed in a position of 
partiality. It could affect their position on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Once before, Reynolds made the statement to The Times about the measure being 
drafted by judges. Early this year, before "three strikes" qualified for the 
Nov. 8 ballot, Reynolds said in passing that one of the judges who worked on 
the initiative lived in a particular house in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times checked property records, finding that the home belongs to Municipal 
Judge William Kent Levis of Fresno. Levis declined to discuss the authorship of 
"three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize," Levis said in a telephone interview recently. "We're not 
supposed to get involved in political situations or political campaigns." 
Claiming the issue is "pending" before the voters, he maintained that judicial 
ethics precluded him from commenting -- a statement disputed by law professors 
familiar with judicial canons dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of relevant information that people don't comment on," Levis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although justices on the state courts of appeal and Supreme Court ultimately 
will determine the constitutionality of many provisions of "three strikes," all 
judges who hear criminal matters, including municipal court judges, will have 
opportunities to rule on aspects of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "A municipal court judge decides whether or not to bind someone over for 
trial," said James Thomson, president of California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice. "Most dispositions are occurring at municipal court."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; DUELING ATTACK ADS UNLEASHED BY CANDIDATES; 
FEINSTEIN AND HUFFINGTON HIT THE AIRWAVES AGAIN WITH A NEW SERIES OF NEGATIVE 
TELEVISION SPOTS. BOTH SIDES APPEAR TO TAKE SOME LIBERTIES WITH THE FACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their record-setting and vitriolic race for the U.S. Senate, Democratic 
incumbent Dianne Feinstein and GOP Rep. Mike Huffington continue to burn up 
television time with a series of ads that paint each other as frauds, tax 
cheats, even lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads represent the latest salvos in what is now -- at more than $27 million 
-- the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history. And with three weeks 
left in the contest, it is likely that millions of dollars more will be spent 
by the pair to reach California voters the fastest way they can -- over the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's latest commercials, including one released Tuesday, portray her 
challenger as a do-nothing freshman congressman whose previous business career 
was riddled with scandal. Huffington, her ads conclude, is a "Texas oil 
millionaire Californians just can't trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's latest ad describes Feinstein as a multimillionaire and political 
waffler. She is, says the ad: "A career politician who will say or do anything 
to stay in office." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, like two dozen before them in this contentious race, contain elements 
of truth but also take liberties, some significant, with the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, NBC News Tuesday demanded that the Huffington campaign 
immediately halt a commercial that claimed the network was critical of the 
Feinstein campaign. In that ad, which stopped airing Monday, Huffington's 
campaign claimed that "NBC News labeled (a Feinstein) ad the 'meanest, 
sneakiest' of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC attorney Roberta R. Brackman said the ad was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman defended the ad by arguing that in 
1988 NBC had been critical of an ad by then-Senate candidate Leo McCarthy that 
was similar to an ad used by Feinstein in her 1990 race against Wilson. So even 
if NBC had not directly criticized Feinstein, Grossman said, "Plagiarism is not 
going to excuse Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the other claims and analysis: 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington ad: "Which candidate is worth $50 million, but uses a taxpa y er - 
paid chauffeur to get to work? Feinstein."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: The latest Huffington commercial, which began airing statewide 
Sunday night, highlights Feinstein's well-documented wealth. The Roll Call 
newspaper in Washington has estimated her net worth at about $50 million, 
primarily because of the assets of her husband, investor Richard Blum. 
(Huffington's worth has been estimated at $75 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 And although she is driven to and from work, Feinstein has denied that 
taxpayers are footing the bill. Earlier this year, she told The Times that no 
taxpayer money was spent on personal driving services for her, though a staff 
member does drive her to business appointments during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington ad: "Which one double-dips, taking a $133,000 Senate salary and a 
$33,000 San Francisco pension? Feinstein."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: As a former San Francisco official, Feinstein is entitled to the 
pension as well as her salary as a senator. Feinstein campaign manager Kam 
Kuwata on Tuesday sought to turn the issue against Huffington. "She has worked 
in her life, unlike Congressman Huffington, who has only taken money from his 
father," Kuwata said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the amount, Kuwata countered that the senator donates about $200,000 a 
year to charities -- a total that exceeds both the salary and pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington ad: "Which one broke the law so massively she got the biggest 
statewide candidate fine in California history? Feinstein."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Feinstein did pay a $190,000 fine for violations of campaign 
reporting laws in connection with her 1990 campaign for governor. The amount 
remains a record fine for a statewide candidate in California. Kuwata points 
out that both Feinstein and Gov. Pete Wilson paid large fines to the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission because their errors -- blamed on accounting 
mistakes -- occurred during expensive campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad's "broke the law" wording might suggest criminal law violations, when 
in fact Feinstein's campaign violated civil campaign reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington ad also attacks Feinstein on two other points: saying that she 
has opposed term limits and that she voted herself a pay raise in the Senate. 
Both are true. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's camp, meanwhile, has leveled its own barrage of accusations 
against Huffington in two current commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein ad: "Associated Press reports that government records describe 
Huffington as secretive, threatening and greedy."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: The ad, which began airing early this month, cites press stories 
critical of Huffington, including one by the Associated Press. But the points 
drawn from that story emerged from a civil lawsuit in Texas, not government 
reports or documents as the ad implies. Further, as Huffington's campaign has 
pointed out, the accusation was leveled in a countersuit filed by an oil 
company being sued by a Huffington company. In the countersuit, according to 
the AP story, the company charged that the Huffington family lawsuit was 
prompted by "avarice and greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein ad: "He claims he's for cutting government spending, but the 
'Hypocrisy Index' of the National Taxpayers Union lists Huffington because he 
promised to vote for big spending cuts, but voted for huge spending increases 
instead."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: The newest Feinstein ad, which began airing Tuesday, says that 
Huffington's congressional record has been criticized by the Washington-based 
National Taxpayers Union. And the group does list Huffington as among 31 
federal lawmakers to have voted for large federal outlays after promising big 
cuts in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's spokeswoman Grossman questioned the validity of the NTU's 
method for ranking members of Congress. Previously, she said, the organization 
counted all the legislation sponsored by a lawmaker -- an approach that 
Huffington's campaign has said put Feinstein high on the list of spenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it just counts the votes of legislators -- an approach, Grossman said, 
that hurts freshman legislators whose bills often never see the light of day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's campaign manager countered that Huffington's camp is guilty of 
a different kind of hypocrisy if it is now disputing a taxpayers' group it once 
embraced in its own ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you use their numbers or not," Kuwata said. "You can't have it both 
ways."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN DENIES PLANNING RAPE DISCLOSURE; IN HER 
FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT'S DRAMATIC DEBATE STATEMENT, 
CANDIDATE SAYS HER DAUGHTER KNEW SHE MIGHT BRING UP THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown on Tuesday rejected any suggestion that she and her 
aides planned the emotional revelation on statewide television last week that 
her daughter had been the victim of date rape or that Brown used the story 
without telling her daughter first. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing solemn and subdued, Brown told reporters outside the Ronald Reagan 
State Office Building that her daughter Sascha, 25, was the only person who 
knew before her debate with Republican Gov. Pete Wilson that the candidate 
might bring up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is totally supportive," Brown said as she responded for the first 
time since Friday's debate to questions about the rape discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, said she had intended to talk only generally about 
the rape experience to counter Wilson's allegations that she lacked the 
experience to be a governor who could be tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke from my heart Friday night," Brown told reporters, "and I drew upon 
my own personal experiences -- my experience as a woman, as a mother, as a 
parent. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Brown broke off in mid-sentence and paused, seemingly in deep 
thought, for a full 10 seconds. Then she continued: ". . . And I don't think 
Pete Wilson should question my commitment to fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had declined until Tuesday to further explain her debate remarks, 
although staff members have discussed the incident. Tuesday's news conference 
was scheduled to discuss waste and "bureaucratic bloat" in state government 
under Wilson. After several questions on that subject, a television reporter 
asked Brown if she had any comment on "all the hoopla" about the rape 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown hesitated and said: "Well, I think the only comment I would make is that 
the only person who knew I might say anything about this is my daughter. My 
daughter is totally supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the analysis misses the point," she continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is that the incumbent governor is either so out of touch that he 
doesn't understand what a parent feels, is so out of touch that he does not 
appreciate what a woman feels about crime, or is cynical in using the issue of 
crime, and particularly the issue of rape, as a campaign political issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The manner in which the date rape was disclosed had prompted speculation that 
it was a calculated strategic decision planned by Brown and her campaign staff. 
But aides, including campaign manager Clint Reilly, said they were unaware of 
it until Brown disclosed it about midway through the hourlong debate. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were questions about whether Brown had cleared the idea with Sascha 
Rice before using it in the debate and whether she was cynically exploiting a 
painful experience by a family member for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded Tuesday that Wilson and his media consultants "are the ones 
who are cynical" for using in television commercials the same video footage of 
a supposed crime scene that is being used against three Democratic female 
candidates for governor this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign also has made extensive use of crime victims' groups to 
appear at his campaign events to promote Wilson's toughness on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also was asked Tuesday if there was irony in the fact that she had 
opposed Wilson's "one-strike" bill, which contained up to life terms for 
first-time rapists, including date rape. She said that many rapists would have 
gone free or been prosecuted on lesser charges under such legislation because 
of the difficulty of winning convictions with a possible life term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's "one-strike" bill "represented either the cynicism and the 
manipulation of that issue by this career politician, or reflected his being 
out of touch with what this crime was all about," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown supported successful legislation that increased rape sentences but did 
not impose life terms for first offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said later that "if she doesn't understand that in fact there are a lot 
of people who feel that people who are repeat violent offenders should be 
permanently removed from society, then she is the one who is out of touch, and, 
indeed, I am convinced that she is." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brown was referring to life terms for a first rape conviction. She 
did support the "three strikes" bill that provided up to a life term for 
violent offenders convicted of a third felony.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; STATE ECONOMY IS ON UPSWING, WILSON SAYS; 
INCUMBENT ALSO RECEIVES ENDORSEMENTS FROM MAYOR RICHARD RIORDAN AND FORMER 
BASEBALL COMMISSIONER PETER V. UEBERROTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Trumpeting a message distinctly different from the pessimistic note he struck 
for most of his first term, Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday contended that the 
long-foundering California economy is on its way back -- and he brought in two 
high-profile supporters to vouch for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chatsworth, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan offered his formal 
endorsement to the incumbent. Hours later in Anaheim, former baseball 
commissioner and 1984 Olympics czar Peter Ueberroth seconded the motion with 
his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither move came as a shock, since all three men are Republicans. But they 
carried a small measure of suspense because Ueberroth has endorsed Democrats, 
including Dianne Feinstein in the current race for U.S. Senate, and Riordan not 
only won a nonpartisan office in a largely Democratic city but also has hired 
Democrats to work in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's endorsement was accompanied by a bit of insider's intrigue because 
the man who ran his successful mayoral campaign, Clint Reilly, is now running 
the effort of Wilson's challenger, Democrat Kathleen Brown. Riordan and Brown 
also share an influential pair of behind-the-scenes advisers, attorneys William 
and Kim Wardlaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the mayor was effusive in his praise of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing this because he's shown the kind of leadership that was needed to 
turn California around," Riordan told San Fernando Valley business leaders 
meeting in Chatsworth. "Pete Wilson has the integrity and the guts to lead this 
state into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan entirely omitted any mention of Brown, and came close to comparing the 
two office-seekers only when he moved to the issue of crime: "Pete Wilson 
understands, as I do, that a tough stance against crime is not just rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Riordan and Ueberroth gave Wilson credit for helping to turn the state 
around, which is the governor's theme as the last weeks of his reelection 
campaign tick down. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ueberroth put it at an Anaheim campaign stop, "California needs a person 
who is strong right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat framing of California's economic environment starkly contrasts with 
the governor's negative comments through much of his term in office. Shortly 
after he was sworn in, Wilson began lamenting what he termed government 
interference that further harmed an already shaky economy. As the state dropped 
into a recession, Wilson had a ready list of culprits, from the workers' 
compensation system to government red tape to greedy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the first day of a two-day swing that was scheduled to include a 
host of business success stories, Wilson was openly hopeful. He credited 
changes wrought by his Administration and the Legislature with sparking a state 
resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came to this office, it was very clear that the workers' compensation 
system was driving jobs out of California wholesale," Wilson told small 
business owners at an early morning gathering in Hollywood. "We had a system 
notoriously corrupted, shot through with fraud. It was a national disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to bring about reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that in his first term business taxes were dropped, new incentives 
were adopted and regulations governing businesses were streamlined. Business 
leaders, he said -- and Ueberroth and Riordan concurred -- are more hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hearing announcements up and down the state that people are staying, 
they are growing," Wilson said in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took pains Tuesday to sketch out some plans for a second term -- tort 
reform and no-fault insurance legislation, for example -- and made only 
backhanded slaps at his challenger Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, where Wilson accepted the endorsement of the California branch 
of the National Federation of Independent Business, he criticized Brown as a 
tool of labor and trial lawyers. He specifically cited her opposition to the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and her support for a health care plan that 
would require businesses to pick up insurance costs for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For those in the audience with long political memories, he also criticized her 
support for the failed 1990 environmental initiative known as Big Green. And he 
derided her newly released economic plan as one that would increase taxes on 
Californians. Brown and her campaign aides say that broad-based taxes would not 
be necessary and that much of her plan would be financed by bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need expanded government services," Wilson said. "We don't need the 
kind that will result in more and more debt." 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, the endorsement by Riordan was the return of a political favor. 
The governor endorsed Riordan early in his race for mayor, a gesture that was 
included in mailers sent to prospective voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson denied Tuesday that Riordan's decision to endorse him so late in the 
election cycle was an indication that the mayor had been under pressure from 
Brown partisans to hold back the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you very successfully twist Dick Riordan's arm," he said, 
calling Riordan "a very good political reader of tea leaves. He knows that 
people are paying more attention in October than they are in June or February."

STATE EDUCATION BOARD ASSAILED ON TEXT CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The acting chief of the California Department of Education has blasted the 
state Board of Education for its last-minute addition of three lower-rated 
books to the list of new mathematics texts that can be used in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting superintendent of public instruction, said the 
addition of texts that had been rejected during a months-long review 
represented a "significant retreat from high standards," implying that the 
school board caved in to pressure from publishing companies seeking a piece of 
the lucrative California textbook trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But some members of the governor-appointed state board vigorously defended 
Friday's 6-1 vote to add books and materials by Encyclopedia Brittanica, 
Houghton Mifflin Co. and Silver Burdett Ginn Inc. to nine texts that had 
survived rigorous review by two panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they wanted to give school districts as wide a choice as possible, 
board members Kathryn Dronenberg and William Malkasian wrote a two-page memo to 
colleagues outlining their reasons for the three additions. Board President 
Marion McDowell noted that the board has always had the authority to add to the 
list recommended by curriculum panels. 
</P>
<P>
 The textbook-adoption session reopened the debate on the state's newest math 
curriculum, called a "framework" in California, which has been widely endorsed 
by teachers and experts in the field, including the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The mathematics framework, adopted in November, 1991, still requires that 
students learn such basic computational skills as multiplication and division. 
However, it moves away from rote memorization in favor of teaching students to 
think about what solutions to choose when attempting to solve a problem. It 
seeks to instill understanding of basic mathematical concepts and recognition 
of their applications in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the framework, including some math teachers and the Administration 
of Gov. Pete Wilson, say it does not put enough emphasis on basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a new curriculum has been adopted in California, one of the biggest 
textbook purchasers in the nation, publishers are invited to write texts and 
develop other instructional materials that closely follow its guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition is strong to get a text on the list approved for use in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary and middle schools can spend up to 30% of their instructional 
materials funds on texts that are not on the approved lists. Districts wanting 
to use other books can also apply for a waiver from the state. But most 
purchase the bulk of their materials from the state-approved lists, and 
publishers, who make substantial investments to develop texts, work hard to get 
their books included. 
</P>
<P>
 It is common for publishers whose books do not make the cut to lobby the 
politically appointed state board, which has the final say. But it is unusual 
for the board to add a text that has been rejected by one of the two review 
groups. According to an education department spokeswoman, the board has done so 
only once in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting last spring, 25 math programs for kindergarten through eighth grade 
were submitted and reviewed by an advisory panel of 43 educators and 
mathematicians. Their recommendations were reviewed by the state Curriculum 
Development and Supplemental Materials Commission, which concurred with the 
panel's choices and forwarded them to the state board. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, the acting superintendent, urged the board to stick with the list of 
nine recommended texts and reacted angrily to the additions, which he said did 
not even come close to the standards set by the review panel and curriculum 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view," Dawson said in a statement released this week, "these additional 
materials simply don't meet the kinds of high standards and expectations that 
the board has had the courage to insist upon in the past."

MOTHER SAYS SHE FORGIVES GIRL'S KILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The grieving mother of a 5-year-old Norwegian girl said Tuesday that she has 
forgiven the boys who beat her daughter and let her freeze to death in a crime 
that has horrified Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot hate or bear a grudge against small children," Beathe Redegaard told 
the daily Dagbladet."They cannot have understood what they did. I forgive those 
who killed my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Silje Marie Redegaard was romping in the first snow of the winter over the 
weekend when her playmates attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was violence used against the girl, blunt violence. Severe hypothermia 
was probably the final cause of death," said chief inspector Harald Moholt in 
the central seaport of Trondheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy dominated the front pages of all major newspapers and shocked 
Norway's population of 4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Police questioned three boys, all ages 5 or 6. "Some were more active (in the 
attack) than others," Moholt said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagbladet said the girl fell unconscious after being severely beaten and 
kicked and that she froze to death shortly afterward. The daily Verdens Gang 
said Monday that she was trampled to death in an icy puddle and hit with a 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Moholt said the police investigation was nearly complete and that the case 
would soon be handed over to local child care authorities, who will decide what 
to do with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the suspects are all younger than 15, they cannot be tried. But they 
may be given treatment at home or placed in an institution for a limited time.

ROYAL DIVORCE REPORT DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles and Princess Diana have not agreed on a divorce or a financial 
settlement, their lawyers said Tuesday, denying a report that Diana will get 
$38.5 million when the couple divorce next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A French weekly, Voici, reported the settlement, quoting from a new book, 
"Diana: Her New Life," by Andrew Morton.The magazine quoted Diana as saying she 
"felt like the biggest prostitute in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said that proofs of the book, due out Nov. 8, appeared to have been 
stolen and that extracts printed in Voici were distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak from the new book followed revelations by Charles, 45, in an 
authorized biography, "The Prince of Wales," that he never loved his wife and 
was forced to marry her by his father, Prince Philip.

FERRY'S DETACHED FRONT DOOR FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 56-ton front door that ripped off the ferry Estonia, causing it to sink in 
the Baltic Sea last month with more than 900 people aboard, was found Tuesday 
on the sea floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators first using sonar and then a camera-equipped robot located the 
door 1.3 miles west of the wreck about 250 feet below the surface, said Kari 
Lehtola, a member of the three-nation commission investigating the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The door was torn off its hinges after locks failed during a violent storm 
Sept. 28, investigators have said. The ship flooded with water and sank 
quickly.

ON FIRST TRIP TO MOSCOW, ELIZABETH GETS ROYAL TREATMENT; RUSSIA: THE BRITISH 
QUEEN HAS AN ENVIABLE ITINERARY. BUT OTHER EVENTS POINT UP DANGERS IN A 
TROUBLED NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The queen wore lavender blue, and appeared amused. Boris Nikolayevich folded 
his hands neatly into his lap like an oversized schoolboy on his very best 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 As Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin sat 
side by side chatting in the gold-and-cream splendor of the Kremlin's Catherine 
Hall on Tuesday, the photographic flash power was sufficient to light up 
Siberia in December. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the queen's first trip to Russia, and her itinerary is to die for. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two days of her four-day visit, the monarch saw the hidden 
treasures of the Kremlin, attended the ballet "Giselle" at the Bolshoi Theater 
with President and Mrs. Yeltsin, strolled across Red Square, heard a Russian 
Orthodox choir harmonize under the golden domes of Assumption Cathedral and met 
the Orthodox patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 She drove through Moscow in her own Rolls-Royce, shipped from London for the 
occasion, visited a Russian school and accepted a silver samovar made in the 
ancient metalworking city of Tula. Today the queen and her husband, the Duke of 
Edinburgh, leave for St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Russian media are less interested than their British counterparts in 
rumors of divorce in the House of Windsor, and more interested in the pomp and 
circumstance of a monarchy that outlasted their own, the trip has gone 
swimmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow made much of the symbolism of the visit by a queen whose grandfather 
called the last Russian czar, Nicholas II, "Cousin Nicky." Yeltsin said the 
queen's presence proved that Russia is on the road to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia has repudiated the Bolshevik revolutionaries who assassinated 
Nicholas in 1918, upheavals in the last two days have reminded Russians that 
their country is once again a troubled and dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the queen's plane landed at Vnukovo airport Monday, an 
investigative reporter at Moscow's largest daily newspaper was killed in a huge 
explosion after opening a booby-trapped briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawmaker announced that 27-year-old Dmitri Kholodov was to have testified 
before Parliament this week about alleged illegal arms trading by high-level 
Russian military officers stationed in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues said Kholodov picked up the briefcase at a train station, after 
being told by an anonymous caller that it contained incriminating documents on 
the subject, and took it back to the Moskovsky Komsomolets newsroom. Another 
reporter was injured in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Kholodov's editors accused top military officials -- specifically, Defense 
Minister Pavel S. Grachev -- of complicity in the killing. Grachev indignantly 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Tuesday, the newspaper's editor in chief, Pavel Gusev, 
announced that several days before Kholodov's death, the reporter had visited a 
military base where organized crime groups had allegedly sent gangsters to be 
trained as hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 Kholodov had also written about alleged corruption in the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, a successor agency to the KGB. Gusev said members 
of the armed forces general staff might also have wanted him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev, on a trip to Kaliningrad, said he believes Kholodov's murder was 
politically motivated. But he called the accusations of military involvement an 
insulting attempt to rekindle anti-army hysteria and suggested that he may sue 
Gusev for slander, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In other disturbing news this week, Russian counterintelligence authorities 
Monday seized 60 pounds of industrial-grade uranium that may have been destined 
to be smuggled into Iraq, local news agencies reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, trading on one of Moscow's main stock exchanges was suspended 
after a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
 And even as the queen was being toasted Tuesday evening at a state dinner in 
the Kremlin's Hall of Facets, the Echo Moscow radio station reported that Prime 
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin's press secretary immediately denied the story after talking with 
his "bewildered" boss.

NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE; '94 ELECTIONS / BYPASSING THE POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By D'JAMILA SALEM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fueled by a perception of gridlock in Washington, a disgruntled citzenry seems 
determined to take things into their own hands. In addition to proposals placed 
on the ballot by politicians in many states, voters next month will consider 78 
citizens initiatives -- the most in a half-century -- tackling dozens of 
controversial issues elected officials often ignore. The primary reason for the 
increase in the number of initiatives is "a general frustration with the 
legislative process," said Bob Stern, co-director of the Center for 
Governmental Studies, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research group. He cited 
term limits as a perfect example of something a legislature would be loath to 
consider, but which has proven to be a very popular ballot issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger with initiatives is that any one with $1 million can buy their way 
onto the ballot" by paying for signature gatherers, Stern added. "When you get 
too many (proposals) on the ballot, people will just vote no on everything." He 
said that many of the initiatives are poorly written and "add to the public's 
growing skepticism in government." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many initiatives can also create a backlash. In Washington state, for 
example, which recently had led the country in trend-setting initiatives, just 
one of 33 proposals made the ballot this year -- a plan to expand the denture 
industry. But next door in Oregon, voters will have 15 ballot initiatives to 
consider, ranging from euthanasia to ending free speech protections for child 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of this year's initiatives deal with crime or gambling or are 
attempts to tighten control on elected officials -- either through term limits, 
campaign financing or reducing lawmakers' ability to tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Californian's will be voting on 10 initiatives ranging from immigration to 
health care. Here is a look at the rest of the nation, both citizens' 
initiatives and issues placed on the ballot by legislators: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gambling: Measures to expand gambling in one fashion or another appear on 
the ballots in eight states -- Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nebraska, Missouri, 
Rhode Island, South Dakota and Wyoming. Casino gambling is now allowed in half 
of the country, either on land or on riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: Voters in four states -- Florida, Missouri, Montana and Oregon -- are 
demanding a greater say in the revenue-raising process by adding measures that 
require voter approval of any new taxes. Montana and Nevada have initiatives 
requiring super majorities in their state legislatures to approve any new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crime: Six states -- California, Alaska, Idaho, Nebraska, Ohio and Utah -- 
have ballot measures that add or strengthen "victims bills of rights." Georgia 
and Oregon have measures on the ballot to set specific penalties for violent 
crimes. Wyoming voters will consider a proposal to create a life sentence that 
allows for no parole or pardons. In Ohio, death row inmates would lose one step 
in the appeals process if a proposal passes. In Colorado, an initiative would 
eliminate bail for ex convicts who are arrested on new charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gay rights: Ten states tried to place anti-gay rights initiatives on the 
ballot this year, but only Idaho and Oregon succeeded. Colorado's attempt at 
such legislation, Amendment 2, was approved by voters two years ago but was 
never enacted. Last week, the state supreme court declared it unconstitutional. 
Currently, no states have laws barring gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign finance reform: Diving into a subject that the U.S. Congress was 
unable to agree upon, six states (Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, 
Nevada and Oregon) have initiatives on the ballot that would regulate campaign 
contributions and spending. In Oregon, voters are considering allowing 
contributions only from constituents and reducing the amount one can contribute 
to elected officials. Colorado voters are considering capping the amount 
politicians can get from paid lobbyists, political action committees, 
corporations, labor unions and government-connected big business at $50 a year. 
A Massachusetts proposal would limit the amount special interests can spend on 
ballot questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abortion: Wyoming has an initiative that, if approved, would charge doctors 
performing abortions with felonies unless the life of the mother were in danger 
or the pregnancy were the result of rape or incest. A proposal to require 
parental notification gathered enough signatures in Colorado but was removed 
from the ballot by the state supreme court for technical reason. A 24-hour 
waiting period and informed-constant measure also failed to make the ballot in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * Euthanasia: Oregon has the only ballot measure allowing physicians to 
perform euthanasia. The measure would allow terminally ill patients to take 
prescription drugs to end their lives. Currently, no state allows assisted 
suicide, although a Michigan citizens' commission recommended that the state 
legislature authorize the practice under a detailed set of restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare reform: Although it's a sizzling topic on the federal scene, only 
one state was willing to touch it. Colorado's amendment 18 would allow the 
state to recoup the delivery costs of babies born to mothers on Medicaid from 
the biological parents or grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt was made in Washington, but the measure failed to make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Term limits: Term limits once again are one of the most popular initiatives 
on the ballot, under consideration this year in Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma and Utah. Term limits were first 
voted on in 1990 and have passed in 16 states thus far.

constitutions or develop legislation. Of the 24, only Mississippi, the most 
recent convert, and Illinois do not have measures on next month's ballots.

ISRAEL TURNS PEACE HOPES TO SYRIA; MIDEAST: OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT 
TREATY WITH JORDAN WILL SPUR TALKS. AMERICANS' VISIT NEXT WEEK COULD BE 
PIVOTAL.

<P>
 With peace agreements with the Palestinians and now Jordan, Israel is about to 
focus on Syria, its most implacable foe among the Arabs, in pursuit of a full 
settlement of the Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want peace with Syria," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres declared Tuesday. "I 
think we need to reach a comprehensive peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel hopes that the treaty to be signed with Jordan next week will not only 
encourage Syria to accelerate negotiations, but that it will suggest solutions 
-- such as Syria's lease back to Israel of territory it now occupies in the 
Golan Heights -- for the difficult problems the two countries face. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a strong element of warning, however, in comments from Israeli 
officials and analysts, asserting that Syrian President Hafez Assad should move 
swiftly and decisively to ensure he is not left out in the peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jordan and the Palestinians are the inner core of peace with the Arabs, and 
Syria could find itself marginalized, isolated and even left completely behind 
as we move forward," said David Kimche, president of the Israel Council on 
Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Syrians have the opportunity of finishing a good peace with (Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin, and they need to know that this opportunity may 
not be there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria would now become the target, other analysts said, of "a push-pull 
strategy" intended to bring it into serious bargaining with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will he get the best deal by being last?" Joseph Alpher, director of the Tel 
Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said of Assad. "No, and 
we have to tell him so. Assad won't want to be seen as a follower, certainly 
not of Jordan and the Palestinians, but he doesn't want to miss the boat, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the basic agreement a year ago with the Palestine Liberation Organization 
on Palestinian self-government, the treaty that Rabin concluded with King 
Hussein of Jordan this week has injected tremendous energy into the Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal with the PLO sparked King Hussein to act lest he foreclose 
opportunities and lose his natural advantage in the region, and the same is now 
true of Assad," Alpher added, stressing the speculative nature of his comments. 
"But I'm far from certain that Assad will respond in the same way. I don't 
understand what he gains for Syria from remaining out of play." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials are hoping that U.S. leverage will come into play in a major 
way next week and force a Syrian response. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to visit Jerusalem and 
Damascus early in the week in advance of President Clinton's trip to the Middle 
East, and to offer Assad the prestige of a presidential visit -- the first to 
Syria in more than 20 years -- if he breaks the stalemate in negotiations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite three years of U.S. mediation, those negotiations remain stalled on a 
series of major issues: the extent and timing of Israeli withdrawal in the 
Golan Heights, security guarantees such as demilitarization, local intelligence 
systems and international peacekeepers and the character of Syrian-Israeli 
relations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assad has long wanted the U.S. President personally to serve as the mediator 
with Rabin, but to get that he will now have to put up," a ranking Israeli 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, however, gave no indication Tuesday of any softening of his demand for 
a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War, as basis for peace -- and for his insistence on an Israeli 
commitment to pull out as the basis for treaty negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian president dismissed as "apostasy," much like a person forsaking his 
religion, the idea of a nation leasing its own land to a neighbor -- a crucial 
element of the Jordanian-Israeli settlement that will allow Israeli farmers to 
continue cultivating territory under Jordanian sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who dreams or imagines that Syria would rent its land is shamefully 
wrong and making a major mistake," Assad said after a meeting in Cairo with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "If people adopt this theory, it will lead to 
the opposite of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Assad also criticized Hussein for making a separate peace with Israel, but 
pledged that Syria would do nothing to upset the treaty. "We can put up 
obstacles, and everybody knows that," Assad said. "But this will only hurt us 
as Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Amman, Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali defended Jordan's decision to make 
peace with Israel, saying it could not wait for other Arab states. 
"Unfortunately, Arab coordination proved futile," he said, "and it was rather 
useless to wait for others." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about rumors of secret Syrian negotiations with Israel, Assad said in 
Cairo that no agreements had been reached in any forum. "We are still at the 
stage of feeling each other's pulses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yossi Olmert, a leading Israeli analyst and former government spokesman, 
argued strongly that most of the basic negotiations had already been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin has to gauge Israeli political opinion, to decide whether to proceed 
with a referendum on the Golan Heights or go to early elections or a referendum 
or whatever," Olmert said, "and from that will flow the compromises that will 
be made on the Golan Heights. The decision lies with Rabin, not Assad." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmert and other Israeli analysts read the treaty with Jordan as diminishing 
Syria's room for maneuver, applying pressure for it to come to terms with the 
Jewish state after nearly 50 years of hostility, but also clearing the way for 
an agreement once Assad feels he has a deal.

'WARM PEACE' WITH ISRAEL MAY BE LONG TIME COMING, JORDANIANS SAY; DIPLOMACY: 
LEADERS CLAIM NATION IS PREPARED TO END YEARS OF ENMITY. BUT ANALYSTS KNOW 
CHANGING HEARTS WILL BE DIFFICULT. 
</P>

 If all goes as planned, the Israeli flag -- for decades a hated symbol of this 
nation's worst enemy -- could be snapping in the breeze above a newly opened 
Israeli Embassy in just six weeks. Are Jordanians prepared for such a 
spectacle? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely, according to Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, who announced 
Tuesday that the Cabinet had that morning approved the peace treaty initialed 
the day before with Israel. The Jordanian Parliament is expected to ratify the 
accord Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jordanian people are well-prepared for peace; they have believed in peace 
for a long time," Majali said confidently, when asked by a reporter about the 
psychological impact of Israel opening a mission here. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sari Nasir, head of the sociology department at Amman University, thinks 
that Majali and the government are too optimistic about the reception Israelis 
are likely to receive here. Nasir points out that more than 50% of Jordanians 
are of Palestinian origin, and many Palestinians still feel their grievances 
against Israel have not been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too much, too soon," said Nasir. "People need much more time to 
understand and digest what is happening. Will Israelis feel safe walking the 
streets of Amman? If I were them, I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Majali and Nasir are partially right. On an abstract level, Jordanians 
and Palestinian Jordanians appear to have accepted the process of rapprochement 
with Israel that began in October, 1991, when the United States and Russia 
presided over the opening of Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid. In 1993, they 
witnessed the signing of a framework for peace between Israel and the 
Palestinians. In July of this year, they saw King Hussein announce an end to 
the state of belligerency that had existed between the two countries for 46 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask passersby on the streets of Amman whether they support the signing of a 
peace treaty with Israel, and the response is generally favorable. But probe 
deeper, and Jordanians invariably dwell on the economic benefits they expect 
will flow from making peace. There is no eagerness to get to know the neighbors 
with whom Jordanians have fought two wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children believe that these people are devils and that they ought not to 
be accepted," said Nasir, a Palestinian whose family became refugees twice 
after the Jewish state was born in 1948. As a child, Nasir fled with his family 
to East Jerusalem in 1948. As a young man, he fled from East Jerusalem to Amman 
after Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan in the June, 
1967, Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 Even government officials acknowledge that they have trouble with the human 
side of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Israel and Jordan opened the new border in the south last August," said 
Michel Hamarneh, the urbane director of Crown Prince Hassan's office, "I stood 
there at the ceremony, not knowing what to feel. In my mind, I had accepted 
this moment, I wanted it to happen. But all my life, I hated these people. I 
tried to inject hatred of them into my children." Hamarneh recalls that he 
could not bring himself to speak to the Israeli officials seated on each side 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the negotiating process that has occurred since Madrid has 
been carried out behind closed doors, with the principals emerging only for 
periodic, historic signing ceremonies, the treaty that King Hussein intends to 
sign next Wednesday is one made between regimes, not peoples, said Nasir and 
other Jordanians. 
</P>
<P>
 The sort of "warm peace" Israelis are hoping to build with Jordan will follow 
the formal treaty slowly, if at all, according to many Jordanians. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't change attitudes overnight," Nasir said. "There are so many people 
who have lost very dear ones, who have lost their villages, their social 
structure. These people are very bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 That bitterness, both Jordanian opposition figures and government officials 
agree, is unlikely to express itself in any violent form of protest. Hussein is 
a popular monarch, and his kingdom is well-managed by his security forces. 
Opposition groups on the left and right are closely monitored and kept in 
check. Palestinians, who under the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
leadership rose up against the regime in 1970, have in the past two decades 
become overwhelmingly middle class and settled into society. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no riots in the streets," Hamarneh said. "The Palestinians here 
would like to make the best of their lives here. They know that their dreams of 
returning to Palestine are finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian refugee camps, where opposition might be expected to be the most 
fierce, are directly controlled by the security police, and have been quiet 
since the initialing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic fundamentalists already have announced that they will vote against the 
treaty in Parliament on Saturday, but they hold only 16 seats and cannot block 
ratification. Leftists also are opposed, but across the spectrum opposition 
figures have taken pains to say their protests will be restricted to democratic 
expressions.

HANDLING OF CRISIS BOOSTS KUWAITIS' PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Iraqi soldiers massed near Kuwait's border two weeks ago, fears of a rush 
on dollars here prompted the U.S. Embassy to offer to loan the government $100 
million in greenbacks to calm the nervous citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Central Bank politely declined, saying it could handle the crisis. And 
on Tuesday, as Kuwaitis and foreign diplomats reviewed the past 10 tense days, 
they expressed surprise that the country had done just that -- calmly managed 
the crisis and strengthened the national backbone in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Day One," one diplomat said, "the government took charge of this. It's a 
totally different country than it was four years ago. There is public 
confidence here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another Western envoy: "The way Kuwaitis reacted to this episode might 
just restore confidence, both inside and outside this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Kuwaitis were patting themselves and their government on the back 
this week for their lack of panic in the face of the latest crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A few stockpiled goods, but the stores remained open with shelves full. There 
were no special roadblocks, and crime rates dropped. Kuwaiti troops were called 
to service and showed up. Hospitals were open. And political leaders, who once 
might have hidden in their offices, appeared regularly on television, urging 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking feature of the Kuwaiti government's response to fears of an 
Iraqi invasion could be found at bank tills. Rather than close their doors, 
Kuwaiti banks opened specially on a weekend day and calmly arranged money 
transfers and cash withdrawals -- mostly in U.S. dollars -- for customers 
worried they might have to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Bank saw demand for money transfers triple over three days. It 
injected $370 million into the money market, and then took the unusual step of 
calling a news conference a few days later to talk about it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we expected more," said Abdulaziz Salem al Sabah, the governor of 
the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Now money transfers have dwindled to normal levels, and the Kuwaiti dinar has 
strengthened against the dollar, soaring higher than it was before the crisis, 
bank officials said Tuesday. But public confidence in the Kuwaiti government, 
and the arriving U.S. and coalition forces, never left. 
</P>
<P>
 Saif Abbas Abdulla, chairman of the political science department at Kuwait 
University, said he was shocked by the change in attitude among Kuwaitis, and 
he attributes much of it to the opening of political discourse in this country 
over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Gulf War, "we felt betrayed by Iraq, we lamented our bad luck, we 
blamed our government for trusting Saddam Hussein," he said. "But this has 
shown that Kuwaiti society has grown tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just amazing," he added. "For a country that just four years ago was 
pillaged, it's amazing that we could quietly and systematically deal with this 
new threat. There was no panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Many diplomats, in fact, were more fearful than Kuwaitis about the threat 
posed by Hussein's military moves. They had expected the worst -- that the 
Iraqi leader would try to make a play for Kuwait City, or even seize some of 
the oil fields in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Although diplomats acknowledge that Kuwait's 18,000 troops would have been no 
match for Hussein's 80,000 fighters, they say the local army would have forced 
Hussein to "at least deploy in combat formation," as one diplomat put it, 
making it easier for air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The knowledge that Kuwaiti forces were backed up by arriving U.S. soldiers 
seemed to be enough to allay the fears of most Kuwaitis. But they know that the 
threat remains, and most say they would welcome a permanent U.S. military 
presence here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all still know that Saddam's capacity to harm is great," said Abdulla, the 
political scientist. "And when you have a neighbor like this guy, you have to 
keep building up."

U.S., CHINA TO SHARE DETAILS OF MILITARY PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime in the next month a team of Pentagon officials will travel to Beijing 
to give a "detailed briefing" to Chinese military officers about the U.S. 
defense budget and overall strategic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, said U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry at a news 
conference Tuesday in Beijing, the U.S. government has invited Chinese defense 
officials to Washington to deliver reciprocal briefings about the budget, 
policy and strategy of the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, in the aftermath of the Chinese army crackdown on 
demonstrators in Tian An Men Square, such an exchange would have been 
unimaginable. But Perry, who is concluding a four-day visit to China today, 
said the briefings will promote a confidence-building "transparency" between 
the two huge military establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of meetings with senior Chinese military and civilian officials, 
Perry outlined a program aimed at restoring military ties that were severed by 
former President George Bush in 1989, following the Tian An Men crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of a trip to Beijing in late August by Commerce Secretary Ronald 
H. Brown, who brought 25 senior business executives with him in an effort to 
stimulate trade, the Perry visit is the latest in a series of moves by the 
Clinton Administration to normalize relations with China. Perry is the first 
American defense secretary to come here since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more dramatic U.S. proposals carried by Perry were an offer to share 
computer technology that simulates nuclear testing and another offer to help 
the Chinese modernize air-traffic control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the Chinese informed the Americans that they plan to continue their 
program of underground nuclear testing until 1996. The Chinese have conducted 
two such tests in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The air-traffic control proposal, meanwhile, has obvious implications for 
several U.S. companies that are in competition with foreign firms to win what 
is likely to be a multibillion-dollar contract to revamp the military-run 
system.

CLINTON OKS DEAL TO STOP N. KOREA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM; ASIA: PACT WILL BE SIGNED 
FRIDAY. IT GIVES PYONGYANG ECONOMIC, POLITICAL REWARDS FOR COOPERATION ON 
WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Tuesday approved a deal reached by U.S. negotiators in 
Geneva to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program, saying the agreement 
"will make the United States, the Korean peninsula and the world safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly delighted by what he considers a victory for his foreign policy, the 
President appeared before television cameras to hail the agreement as "the 
first step on the road to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula." He instructed 
Special Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci, the Administration's lead negotiator 
with North Korea, to sign the accord Friday in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the White House refused to release the text Tuesday, and 
Administration officials said that it will not be made public until after it is 
signed. Instead, Gallucci and other U.S. officials briefed reporters on what 
they said are its principal elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, concluded Monday in Geneva, gives North Korea a series of economic 
and political benefits in exchange for promises to freeze and eventually 
dismantle its current nuclear facilities, which the CIA believes have been used 
to make the material for one to two nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North Koreans do have an interest in a political and economic opening. 
They do have long-term energy needs. And we are addressing those needs," 
Gallucci told reporters at a White House briefing. "They are giving up a 
nuclear program that posed an enormous risk to South Korea, to Japan, to 
Northeast Asia and to the international non-proliferation regime." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea will dismantle two large nuclear reactors now under construction, 
which would have had the potential to make enough fuel for hundreds of nuclear 
weapons. Operations of an existing, smaller reactor at Yongbyon will also be 
stopped, and it too will eventually be dismantled, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,000 radioactive fuel rods now sitting outside the Yongbyon reactor 
will be sealed, and U.S. officials said the North Koreans have agreed to let 
those rods be shipped outside their country. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an important new concession by Pyongyang, which previously had 
insisted that the rods, a potential source of fuel for nuclear weapons, would 
have to be stored on North Korean soil. But the rods do not have to be shipped 
out for eight or nine years. And Pyongyang has the same time frame to dismantle 
the nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for its concessions, North Korea will get two 1,000-megawatt 
light-water nuclear reactors valued at $4 billion. South Korea and Japan will 
supply most of the equipment and financing for those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The light-water reactors employ technology that can be used for civilian 
nuclear energy, but they produce plutonium that cannot be turned into 
weapons-grade fuel as easily as that from North Korea's current gas-graphite 
reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Administration officials said, the United States and its allies 
will supply North Korea with more economic benefits, in the form of oil 
supplies to provide energy in the years before the light-water reactors are 
finished. U.S. officials said that North Korea will get heavy oil, which cannot 
be used for tanks, planes or other military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond these economic benefits, the long-isolated North Korean regime will 
gain its first dollop of political recognition from the West. The United States 
and North Korea will open liaison offices in each other's capitals, the first 
step toward the establishment of diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the key compromise of the deal, North Korea agreed to submit to 
special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency of two sites 
believed to contain nuclear wastes. But the United States agreed that these 
inspections, which the agency had demanded last year, will not have to take 
place for "about five years," according to Gallucci. 
</P>
<P>
 The special inspections of these waste dumps are important because they are 
expected to show how far North Korea has progressed in its efforts to make 
nuclear weapons. The agreement does not specify a five-year delay, but it says 
that the special inspections must take place before North Korea gets any 
significant amount of nuclear equipment for its light-water reactors -- a 
period expected to take about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Administration, a number of specialists on the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons said they worry that the agreement represents nothing but 
promises that will not be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're letting them off the economic and diplomatic hook, without getting 
anything more than promises that have been broken in the past," said Gary 
Milhollan of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the North Koreans are being let out from under the present embargo and are 
being given oil to rescue their economy, we are losing the leverage over them 
that we now have, meaning economic leverage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we're not deluding ourselves," said David Albright, a physicist 
and nuclear expert who heads the Institute for Science and International 
Security. "Do you believe that the North Koreans want to put their bomb program 
behind them, or are they just buying time? You have to be suspicious of North 
Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Clinton maintained that North Korea's compliance with the accord 
will be carefully monitored by the international inspectors. "It (the 
agreement) does not rely on trust," he said.

BOSNIAN SERB GUNMEN KILL AID WORKER; BALKANS: LOCAL U.N. COMMANDER ASKS FOR 
NATO AIR STRIKE IN RESPONSE. BUT HIS REQUEST IS DENIED. 
</P>

<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen killed a humanitarian aid worker in an attack on a U.N. 
convoy Tuesday, provoking a plea for NATO air strikes that was denied by the 
rebel-encircled U.N. command here. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal attack on the convoy near the U.N.-declared "safe area" of Gorazde 
was the second blatant affront to the troubled Bosnian peacekeeping mission in 
as many days and appeared to be an attempt by Serbian forces to test the limits 
of the world's seeming indifference to the 30-month-old Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen had hijacked five truckloads of medical supplies in the 
presence of French peacekeepers a day earlier and refused demands lodged at the 
highest levels for return of the stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
 After Serbian forces fired on the food convoy leaving Gorazde on Tuesday, 
killing the Bosnian driver of one truck, the British commander of U.N. forces 
in the eastern Bosnian town appealed to the U.N. hierarchy based in Zagreb, 
Croatia, for a display of air power to punish the attackers, mission spokesman 
Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maj. Koos Sol, a U.N. military spokesman at the forward command center 
here in the Bosnian capital, said British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose and the 
Zagreb-based mission commander, French Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, decided 
against any use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was decided during discussions that this would not be useful," said Sol, 
who described the situation at the attack scene in Gorazde as "stable." 
</P>
<P>
 According to other sources at the command center here, Rose worked out a deal 
with Bosnian Serb warlord Gen. Ratko Mladic that would avert any show of NATO 
force in exchange for letting the United Nations retrieve what remained of the 
marooned convoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Three truckloads of food and seeds, as well as two British armored vehicles 
that had been providing protective escort, were recovered, along with the two 
uninjured drivers, said a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees here. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mladic appeared to have allowed the evacuation near Gorazde to proceed, 
his promise late Monday to return the stolen medical cargo reportedly remained 
unfulfilled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel attack near Gorazde occurred just outside a 12-mile 
weapons-exclusion zone proclaimed in April after a Serbian rampage conquered 
nearly half of the U.N. haven, killing hundreds of civilians and forcing more 
than 25,000 Muslims from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the incident's occurring outside the zone, however, any attack on U.N. 
peacekeeping forces is grounds for calling in air power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're seeing what they can get away with," protested an angry aid official. 
Referring to the medical supply theft, during which French soldiers at the 
Sarajevo checkpoint stood idly by, the official said the U.N. Protection Force 
"should have stood up to them. They should have locked the drivers in the 
armored vehicle (for protection) and called in reinforcements."

UKRAINE LIFTS THREE-YEAR BAN ON COMMUNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than three years on the ash heap of history, Soviet-style communism 
won a second chance Tuesday when the new Ukrainian Parliament lifted the ban on 
the old Communist Party. Hard-line lawmakers hugged each other and applauded as 
the measure passed by a vote of 201-105. Their leader, Petro Simonenko, hailed 
the vote as a "victory for legality and democracy in Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 But reformers charged that the Communists' resurrection was really prompted by 
their very capitalist desire to reclaim millions of dollars' worth of former 
Communist Party property that was nationalized in the wake of the failed 1991 
coup by hard-liners in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the three-year ban, a Communist Party was formed in Ukraine last year. 
Although it officially repudiated any connection to the Soviet party, nearly 
all of its 132,000 members are drawn from the 3 million Ukrainians who held 
party cards when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Shishkin, formerly Ukraine's chief prosecutor, opposed lifting the ban 
and warned that the vote "lays the legal groundwork for the Communists to raise 
the property issue in court." 
</P>
<P>
 The value of any leftover party cash has long since been eaten away by 
inflation. The high stakes are in real estate: thousands of buildings that once 
housed the ubiquitous party committees that ruled every aspect of Soviet life. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most have been taken over by government offices. But one former party 
building in Kiev now houses the U.S. Embassy, while the massive Central 
Committee edifice has become headquarters for President Leonid Kuchma's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the embassy is probably safe, observers say that if the Communists 
manage to reclaim only part of their former holdings, they could still become 
the richest and thus the most powerful political force in the country. Even if 
they fail, Tuesday's display of the opposition's political muscle could portend 
a battle with Kuchma over market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kuchma won't be able to count on Parliament's political support on many 
economic issues," Shishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Communists hold 94 of the 394 seats in Parliament, making them the largest 
bloc in a politically fragmented legislature.

SUIT CHALLENGING FIRINGS, DEMOTIONS MAY COST MILLIONS; COURT: GUARDS UNION SAYS 
STATE PERSONNEL BOARD FAILED TO RULE ON 55 CASES WITHIN SIX-MONTH DEADLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some were fired for hitting inmates, using drugs or having sex with the felons 
they were supposed to be guarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were demoted for falling asleep on the job, malingering or cursing at 
their bosses. They all may get back pay, or get back on the state payroll, 
thanks to a little-noticed suit by the California Correctional Peace Officers 
Assn. that could ultimately cost the state $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is challenging discipline meted out against 55 members in the suit 
against the State Personnel Board, an agency empowered to affirm or overrule 
disciplinary actions by state departments against employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that many disciplinary actions should be thrown out because 
the board failed to decide the cases within the six-month period required by 
law. Last month, the California Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections accounted for 31.5% of the 2,000 discipline 
cases heard last year by the personnel board, up from 24.1% two years earlier. 
This year, the board will receive a $1.5-million boost in its budget to hire 
more hearing officers to clear a backlog of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the cases challenged by the union involve: 
</P>
<P>
 * A tower guard fired at Tehachapi after he left his post and went into a cell 
to assault an inmate, who earlier refused to follow his command. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer slapped the prisoner, then took off his badge, bashed the prisoner 
in the face and shoved him into the wall, according to the personnel board. An 
administrative law judge concluded that the officer's action cast "discredit 
upon law enforcement officers generally and upon the Department of 
Corrections." 
</P>
<P>
 * An officer fired from a minimum-security camp for lying on his application. 
He claimed he had no drug abuse problems, although he was hospitalized for drug 
use shortly before taking a job with the department, and later used speed, the 
personnel board concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * A medical technician at Norco who was fired in 1990 when investigators found 
he gave drugs to a female prisoner in exchange for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate had told investigators that "she could have sex with appellant any 
time she chose. They challenged her to do it the next day." When the technician 
showed up the next day, the inmate led him to a room. There, he began fondling 
and kissing her. Investigators were watching from nearby. When they burst in, 
he resigned on the spot, but later sought to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two officers were fired and two suspended from the Chino prison for 
assaulting an inmate known as the "old man." On medication for mental illness, 
the man was notorious for yelling at passersby. One night, the inmate made a 
sexual reference to a female officer. Guards took him from his cell and brought 
him to a stairwell. There, one officer pulled on black gloves and, as others 
watched, slugged and kicked the prisoner. The old man cried out apologies and 
pleaded with them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Novey, president of the union, said that although some of the alleged 
wrongdoing may be "sickening," the department also takes action against good 
officers simply because managers don't like them. By sometimes failing to meet 
its six-month deadline, the State Personnel Board leaves workers hanging, not 
knowing whether they have jobs or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about being fair," Novey said. "In labor, losing your job is like 
death. All we ask is that they decide the cases in six months." 
</P>
<P>
 An internal State Personnel Board memo says that if the union wins the suit, 
the state would have to pay $4.6 million in back pay to corrections employees 
in the 55 cases. But a union victory could extend to 1,900 cases involving 
employees from many state departments, which were not decided within the 
six-month deadline. Costs could top $81 million, plus interest, according to 
the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Re-employment of some of these individuals will constitute a significant risk 
and liability to the state departments," the memo said.

PRIVATELY OPERATED PRISONS A POTENTIAL GROWTH INDUSTRY; BUSINESS: STATE HAS 
FIVE SUCH FACILITIES, MAY ADD ANOTHER. THE FIELD IS ATTRACTING LARGE INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prisons are a growth industry in California, so some entrepreneurs are hoping 
that the state will turn increasingly to privately owned and operated prisons 
as a way to shave costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections is unlikely to turn over control of 
maximum-security prisons anytime soon, and officials say private prisons will 
remain only a limited player as the $3-billion-a-year state prison system 
expands. 
</P>
<P>
 But four private companies now run five prisons for 1,300 low-security inmates 
in California, and the state is considering a proposal to open a sixth private 
prison for 550 medium-security inmates. With 22 states allowing private 
prisons, the business has caught the attention of big-time investors. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Cornell Cox, a corrections firm in Houston, entered the California 
market by buying the state's biggest private prison firm, Eclectic 
Communications Inc. Cornell Cox is backed by Wall Street investment houses 
Charterhouse and Dillon, Reed & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon, Reed's venture capital arm homed in on corrections as an investment 
opportunity because government spends billions a year on prisons annually and 
the market grows 12% a year, said Peter A. Leidel, a senior vice president of 
Dillon, Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is becoming a more significant problem," Leidel said. "More dollars 
will flow to it." 
</P>
<P>
 State records show that Eclectic has received contracts worth more than $50 
million since 1988. Arthur McDonald, the company's former owner, said he sold 
the company for more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald is a former social worker and vice president of a soft drink firm who 
started Eclectic in 1974 with "$1,000 and an electric typewriter." By the time 
he sold the company, he had run two private prisons for California and a dozen 
halfway houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime pays. I hate saying that, but it really does," said McDonald, who has 
retired to South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell Cox is privately held, but hopes to go public with a stock offering 
soon, Leidel said. This summer, Wackenhut Corp., a Florida-based security firm 
that runs a 200-bed prison in McFarland, spun off its prison subsidiary, 
Wackenhut Corrections Corp., and began offering its stock publicly. The state 
will pay Wackenhut $4.5 million this year to operate the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal justice professor Dale Sechrest, of Cal State San Bernardino, is 
studying private prisons and expects that the business will expand as prison 
costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "What worries me," said Sechrest, "is that all these promises of doing the job 
better for less money are not true." Private firms operate prisons for less 
than the state, but he said the difference is "marginal," a few thousand 
dollars per inmate a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, said 
the role of private prisons may increase slightly in years to come, but will 
remain limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is a fundamental role of government and should be done by 
government," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) held a hearing on the 240-bed Mesa Verde 
private prison in Bakersfield in July and concluded that it is cheaper to run 
than state prisons, and may do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is run by Durwood Sigrest, a former parole agent who co-founded 
Alternative Programs Inc. His contract pays $16,600 per inmate -- several 
thousand dollars a year less than the cost of housing in a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigrest saves money by paying guards $11 to $12.50 an hour, half of what the 
state pays correctional officers. Unlike the Department of Corrections, he also 
cut costs by not paying high prevailing union wages for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sigrest is "profit-motivated and efficiency-motivated," he also hopes 
to make a difference in prisoners' lives. "I feel an urgent need to make a run 
at that," he said.

FDA CONFIRMS RAT IN PEPSI CAN; FIRM DENIES RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators found a decaying rat inside a Diet Pepsi-Cola can sold 
in Orange County, but decided to close the case without issuing warnings to 
Pepsi-Cola or to the public, U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorities 
confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pepsi official said the company denies responsibility for the rodent and 
that the claim may be the latest hoax against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 An FDA spokeswoman said it was unknown how the rat got into the can and that 
the incident seemed isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators inspected the Pepsi-Cola bottling company factory in Buena Park 
that produced the soda, turning up no problems with cleanliness or quality 
control, FDA spokeswoman Rosario Quintanilla-Vior said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did find the rat in the can," Quintanilla-Vior said. "It was in pieces, 
but it was there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said official Anne Ward from Pepsi headquarters in Somers, N.Y.: "It's tough 
for anyone to know how the rat or mouse got into the can, but the FDA gave our 
plant a clean bill of health." 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old woman has filed suit against Pepsi-Cola Co. and the Albertson's 
grocery store chain, alleging that she bought and drank from the can of Diet 
Pepsi that contained the dead rat.

3RD HAITI SUICIDE CONCERNS U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by three suicides in three weeks among U.S. troops in Haiti, the 
Pentagon announced Tuesday that a "combat stress action team" has arrived to 
provide counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said they don't know if the suicides are related, but the 
number of self-inflicted deaths among the roughly 20,000 personnel in Haiti is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, where 96,000 troops served more than a year, there was one 
suicide. During the Persian Gulf War, there were 25 times more troops than in 
Haiti, but just eight suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the men in Haiti served in the same brigade of the Army's 10th Mountain 
Division. The dead included Army Pvt. Gerardo D. Luciano, 22, who died Sunday 
in Port-au-Prince.

U.S. WILL PAY HAITIAN SOLDIERS TO NOT DO JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government intends to pay the regular salaries of members of Haiti's 
widely reviled army and police force for doing exactly nothing, on the theory 
that nothing would be far better than a likely alternative: waging guerrilla 
warfare against the restored government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development, said 
that the half-billion-dollar Haiti recovery plan includes $5 million for 
military demobilization, some of it intended to keep soldiers and police on the 
payroll for four or five weeks while about 3,000 of the least cruel are chosen 
for an interim police force and the rest are placed in public works jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to pull the teeth of this dragon," Atwood said. "We do not want to 
move in such a way that the military personnel that are not scheduled to stay 
on will grab arms and go back into the hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's government eventually plans to cut the 7,000-member combined army 
and police force to about 1,500 soldiers while establishing a properly trained 
civilian police force. Some of the interim police will win spots in the new 
force, but many others will not. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood said that the demobilization money will prove to be a bargain for the 
U.S. donors and the Aristide government if it clears the way for a peaceful 
reorganization of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be performing the function of providing salaries and jobs and 
retraining," Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank and the leading donors of international aid agreed in August on 
a $550-million aid plan covering the first year after Aristide regained office. 
The total, of which Washington will contribute about $200 million, is more than 
a quarter of Haiti's annual gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is intended to create more than 50,000 jobs to repair the 
devastated environment and crumbling infrastructure. Many demobilized soldiers 
will be offered jobs, but there will be more available for the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the jobs will be of short duration, Atwood said the projects 
are important in helping to start Haiti on the road to recovery. United Nations 
economic sanctions imposed after the 1991 coup that drove Aristide from power 
reduced the gross domestic product by about 20% and forced impoverished 
Haitians to savage the ecology in an effort to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood said that it was a devastating error to ban the importation of propane 
gas for cooking because it resulted in Haitians cutting down most of the 
nation's trees to produce charcoal for cooking. With the trees gone, he said, 
about 20% of the topsoil washed into the Caribbean.

TEXAS FLOOD THREAT RISES; 26 DISASTER AREAS DECLARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In just three hours of pounding rain, water flooded Becky Wilford's house, 
leaving her groping at 2 a.m. for a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Four feet of water had surrounded her home by the time a rescue boat appeared. 
"Tie the boat to the pier," a voice called out. "That's not a pier, that's the 
deck to our house," Wilford shouted as she clambered onto the boat with her 
husband and child. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 Houston-area residents have been forced from their homes by a 
stalled storm system that has dumped more than two feet of rain on southeast 
Texas since Sunday, killing at least eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Ann Richards declared disaster areas in 26 counties, and late Tuesday 
President Clinton granted federal disaster relief for the counties. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena is scheduled to arrive Thursday to 
assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the flooding included a 62-year-old man who died of a heart attack 
after he drove his van into high water in Montgomery County, and a couple in 
the same county who drowned after they attempted to leave their car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baytown, a horrified 10-year-old girl watched as a 46-year-old man was 
swept into a rain-gorged gully. And three children drowned in Grimes County 
when rushing floodwaters washed the car they were riding in off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh victim, a 14-year-old boy, was swept into a storm drain in La 
Porte and is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 While the worst flooding occurred in counties north of Houston, torrential 
rains rendered freeways and roads impassable across the city and brought many 
businesses to a halt. Downtown Houston was deserted Tuesday, with all entrances 
to downtown from Interstate 10 completely under water. And buses that normally 
are filled with commuters and shoppers ran empty, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Area supermarkets were the busiest spots, as residents stocked up on water and 
canned goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the thousands who fled their homes headed to the 30 Red Cross shelters 
in the region. Some arrived, wet and tired, in grocery supply trucks and metro 
buses that had plucked them from the hoods of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tomball, a dump truck owner plowed through high water to rescue residents 
in low-lying subdivisions. And in Liberty, mud-splattered Tony Dillard spent 
Tuesday rounding up the cattle that had fled to high ground. "This is as bad as 
I've ever seen it," he said, surveying the flooded landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents, accustomed to Houston deluges, were caught short by the 
magnitude of the storm. Until Tuesday morning, James Buchanan thought that he 
was safe and sound at his house in Crosby, northeast of here. About 9:15, the 
water started inching into his living room. "I called the sheriff to come get 
me," said Buchanan, who found haven at a Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the rains will continue today and warned that residents, 
particularly in Liberty County east of Houston, may yet feel the brunt of 
floodwaters rushing south on the Trinity River. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be inappropriate to suggest the corner has been turned," said John 
Jadrosich, spokesman for the Trinity River Authority. "Residents should prepare 
for a flow that they've never seen before."

18-MONTH SENTENCE FOR WIFE-KILLER SPARKS OUTCRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who fatally shot his wife hours after catching her in bed with her lover 
drew 18 months in prison from a judge who said he was reluctant to give any 
jail time at all. Women's activists said Tuesday that the case amounts to 
giving spouses a license to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case explodes the myth that there is justice for domestic violence 
victims in Maryland," said Carol Alexander of the House of Ruth, a shelter for 
battered women. "He's sanctioned and approved an execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Robert E. Cahill, who could have sentenced 36-year-old Kenneth 
Peacock to 25 years in prison, said Monday: "I seriously wonder how many men 
married five, four years would have the strength to walk away without 
inflicting some corporal punishment. I am forced to impose a sentence . . . 
only because I think I must do it to make the system honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Peacock, 31, was shot in the head with a hunting rifle Feb. 9 after her 
husband came home unexpectedly during a snowstorm. Finding her in bed with 
another man, he went downstairs, had a few drinks, got into an argument with 
her and killed her. Her lover was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's comments generated sharp criticism from women's groups and 
advocates for battered spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 1994, and we have a judge who excuses a man who gets so jealous that 
he murders his wife," said Judith A. Wolfer, a lawyer active in domestic 
violence issues. "If this judge's message gets out that it's OK, that's not a 
society I want to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, 
said: "It's outrageous, and at the same time, it's not an uncommon treatment of 
women who are victims of male violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentencing reflects the judge's attitude toward this woman, that she was 
property, that he had the right to be judge, jury and executioner." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not immediately return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Carol Elgin, a member of the Maryland Bar Assn.'s committee on gender 
equality, said she wasn't aware of any past complaints against Cahill. The 
committee will discuss Cahill's sentence and comments today, she said.

VIRGINIA SENATE RACE VIES FOR SPENDING RECORD TOO; CAMPAIGNS: NORTH HAS RAISED 
$15 MILLION SO FAR, TO $4 MILLION FOR ROBB. IN THE COFFER CONTEST, CALIFORNIA 
RIVALS ARE TOPS, THOUGH, AT $27 MILLION.

<P>
 In addition to the record-setting spending in California's Senate race, 
Virginia's race between Republican Oliver L. North and Democratic Sen. Charles 
S. Robb may also go into the spending record books. 
</P>
<P>
 North, who built a huge direct-mail fund-raising network initially to pay for 
his defense in the trial growing out of the Iran-Contra scandal and then for 
political purposes, so far has raised $15.1 million, according to Federal 
Election Commission filings. Incumbent Robb has raised a little more than $4 
million. That may look small in comparison with North's money, but it is more 
than Robb raised during the entire 1988 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record for Senate campaign spending was $25.9 million, set in 
North Carolina in the 1984 contest between GOP Sen. Jesse Helms and Democratic 
Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. But Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) and Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) already have spent more than $27 million in their 
race for the Senate so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Virginia race, North and Robb are in a dead heat, tied in several 
recent polls, with independent candidate J. Marshall Coleman far behind. 
Although North has raised far more than Robb, he also has spent large sums on 
maintaining his direct-mail effort. As a result, the two may have roughly 
similar resources for the final stretch of the campaign. Both have been 
advertising heavily on television, including the relatively expensive 
Washington media market, which covers the northern part of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other closely watched Senate races generally show candidates of both parties 
spending heavily, with Republican challengers fully able to match the spending 
of Democratic incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tennessee, in the closely contested race between Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper 
and Republican Fred Thompson, each has raised more than $3 million. Thompson, a 
lawyer and actor who first gained prominence as the Republican counsel in the 
Senate Watergate inquiry, ended September with $515,000 in cash on hand while 
Cooper had $905,000. The Republican candidate raised more money than the 
Democrat during the summer. The two are seeking the seat that Vice President Al 
Gore vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, both Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his challenger, 
Republican Mitt Romney, have substantial personal fortunes, allowing them to 
match each other's spending in a relatively small state. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy had $2.3 million in cash on hand at the end of the reporting period. 
Romney already had lent his campaign $2 million and has been reported to be 
willing to spend at least another $2 million of his own funds in his quest for 
Kennedy's seat. The most recent polls show Kennedy with a small lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford has a sizable edge over his 
challenger, GOP Rep. Rick Santorum in money on hand. Wofford had $2 million in 
cash as of Sept. 30, according to the latest FEC filings, while Santorum had $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Santorum's fund raising picked up substantially during the summer as 
the race tightened, indicating that he may be able to match the incumbent's 
spending in the campaign's closing weeks. Recent polls have shown the two 
candidates even.

3 ANTI-ABORTION GROUPS TALK TO JUSTICE OFFICIAL; PROTEST: IN RARE MEETING, 
OPERATION RESCUE, PRIESTS FOR LIFE AND CHRISTIAN DEFENSE COALITION CONDEMN 
KILLINGS OF DOCTORS AND DECRY CLINIC ACCESS LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Representatives of three anti-abortion groups met with a top Justice 
Department official Tuesday to decry the slayings of abortion clinic doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting marked the first time that members of Operation Rescue, one of 
three anti-abortion groups present, have met with an official in any 
presidential Administration, said Justice Department spokesman John Russell. 
Operation Rescue is one of the nation's most militant anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute session with Assistant Atty. Gen. Jo Ann Harris, who heads the 
criminal division of the Justice Department, came less than two weeks after 
Paul Hill, 40, was found guilty of the July 29 killing of an abortion clinic 
doctor and his volunteer escort in Pensacola, Fla. Hill was convicted of 
violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a federal statute 
prohibiting anyone from harming or interfering with providers of legal 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said the meeting was prompted by Operation Rescue's wish to have the 
Justice Department give equal time to both sides in the abortion debate. Harris 
and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had met with abortion rights activists after the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Stern, the Justice Department director of public affairs, said that the 
meeting was "amicable" and "very constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-abortion groups, in addition to condemning the slayings, expressed 
concern that the new federal act is scaring peaceful protesters into avoiding 
clinics and that federal efforts to crack down are infringing on First 
Amendment guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things people don't agree with do not lose status under the First Amendment," 
the Rev. Frank Pavone of Priests for Life said at a street-corner press 
conference after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Harris) said she is as concerned about infringements of the First 
Amendment as she is concerned about violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the representatives failed to persuade Harris to specify the types of 
protest that she considers legal under the federal statute. Stern said that 
Harris told the group: "I don't teach a law school class. I'm not going to 
(delve) into the hypothetical." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Pavone at the meeting were Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue 
National, and the Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The three voiced concern in the meeting that the Clinton Administration is 
assigning more importance to crimes against women seeking abortions than to 
those protesting abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney referred to an incident Oct. 6 in which an abortion protester was 
fired upon outside the Baton Rouge Delta Women's Clinic in Louisiana. The 
protester was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney criticized the department for dispatching U.S. marshals to provide 
security at more than a dozen abortion clinics around the country after the 
July murders but not taking such action to protect protesters after the Baton 
Rouge incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney said Harris assigned a member of her department to be contacted in 
cases where anti-abortion activists believe that their rights have been 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is to be tried in January on Florida state murder charges and could 
receive the death penalty in the shotgun killings of Dr. John Bayard Britton, 
69, and his escort, James H. Barrett, 74.

PROPOSITION 184; NONVIOLENT 'THREE-STRIKE' CRIMES DETAILED; CALLING FOR DEFEAT 
OF TOUGH SENTENCING INITIATIVE, GROUP PROFILES 10 DEFENDANTS WHO COULD GET 25 
YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR MINOR OFFENSES, SUCH AS THEFT OF A SHIRT.

 They are a 35-year-old Pomona man who is charged with stealing $6 worth of 
meat to feed his family, a 33-year-old San Diego County resident who allegedly 
stole a shirt for a job interview, and a 25-year-old Modesto father of two who 
fell asleep drunk in his parked station wagon and woke up to find that police 
had discovered a gun and methamphetamines in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 They are men who, if convicted, will fall into a category deemed too dangerous 
to be allowed on the streets for at least 25 years. They will be three-time 
losers prosecuted under the state's "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice released a report 
profiling 10 nonviolent offenders facing 25 years to life in prison as a result 
of "three strikes," and warning that these cases are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these men were ever accused of harming a victim. They're not the 
stuff of front-page headlines," said Peter Collins, a San Francisco radio talk 
show host who led a news conference Tuesday calling for the defeat of 
Proposition 184, the voter initiative that would affirm "three strikes" and 
make it harder to amend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is for people . . . to look at these men and ask themselves, do we 
truly need so broad a law?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers urged voters to reject the "three strikes" initiative, saying its 
defeat would send a message to the Legislature. As it is now, opponents said, 
"three strikes" is "too soft on hard criminals and too hard on soft ones." And 
many, like Margaret Alvarado, whose son faces life in prison for allegedly 
stealing three chuck steaks, see "three strikes" for nonviolent offenders as an 
abomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's facing 25 years to life for stealing $6 of meat," a sobbing Alvarado 
said of her son, Michael Garcia. "In my heart, I feel that's cruel and 
unjustified. He's not a violent person. This law is fine for some people, but 
for so many others it's unreasonable. It doesn't fit the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jenkins, a deputy district attorney in Pomona, said Garcia was 
convicted at age 16 of murder, which influenced his decision to prosecute 
Garcia under the "three strikes" law. Garcia has said he had been talked into 
driving a car used in a fatal shooting, but never fired a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Schiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal 
Justice, acknowledged that he and other anti- Proposition 184 forces are 
fighting an uphill battle. A recent Times poll found support for the initiative 
among likely voters to be 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 184 hope that if voters reject the measure, they can 
persuade the Legislature to change the current law. Schiraldi said he would 
want the law amended to not count juvenile offenses or burglaries as strikes, 
and to require that the third strike be a violent crime. If Proposition '184 
passes, "you and I will be cold in our graves before the Legislature ever 
touches" the law, he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter's murder helped propel the law through 
the Legislature, said his daughter would not have supported the spirit of the 
current law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polly was a gentle soul, who did not believe in injustice, because Polly 
would not hurt a fly. Polly would give her last dollar to a homeless person, 
and Polly would not support an initiative to put a pizza thief in jail for 
life," Klaas said, referring to a "three strikes" case where a Redondo Beach 
man faces 25 years to life in prison for stealing some slices of pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas said the law "casts far too wide a net" and would sentence a first-time 
rapist to only four years in prison while people such as Dale Broyles, the 
Modesto man found sleeping in his station wagon, would serve at least 20. The 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office says 70% of all "three strikes" 
cases prosecuted by the office have been against nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Broyles, convicted of gun theft at age 19 because, he says, he was trying to 
protect a friend who did the actual deed, also tried to escape from jail after 
his girlfriend, pregnant with his child, was killed in a car wreck. He says the 
gun and drugs found in the station wagon were not his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never thought of myself as a violent person," he said. "They're taking 
it out on the wrong people. I've never hurt no one but myself."

FATHER, SON ARRESTED IN 1977 SLAYINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men have been arrested in the slayings of two young Fresno girls 17 years 
ago, Fresno County Sheriff Steve Magarian said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Marin Jr., 55, of Kingsburg, and his son, Ernest Marin III, 35, of 
Fresno, were booked into jail Monday night in part because of new information 
provided by people close to their family, Magarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said evidence indicates that the elder Marin was sexually 
attracted to Connie Ostos, 13, and Belinda Louise Hernandez, 12, and lured them 
to his Fresno home on Feb. 22, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were stabbed to death, and their bodies were driven to an area near 
Pine Flat Reservoir and dumped, the sheriff added. 
</P>
<P>
 Their corpses were found March 16, 1977, but were so badly decomposed and 
mutilated by animals that autopsies were unable to show whether they had been 
sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
 Magarian said the elder Marin is believed to have killed the girls. 
Authorities believe his son helped dispose of the bodies.

FORMER LAWMAKER FACES CHARGES IN HOUSE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Rep. Joseph P. Kolter was indicted Tuesday on charges that he obtained 
$11,000 in personal cash from the House post office and billed his office 
account for $33,000 worth of jewelry, luggage and other personal items from a 
congressional stationery store. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolter, a Pennsylvania Democrat defeated in the 1992 primary after 10 years in 
the House, was the second current or former House member indicted in the 
federal investigation of the House post office scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), former chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, was charged in a 17-count indictment May 31. He is accused of 
converting $636,600 in federal funds and $56,267 in campaign funds to his 
personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolter was charged in a five-count grand jury indictment with conspiracy, 
embezzlement and concealing material facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Baron, Kolter's attorney, said the former lawmaker "has maintained 
throughout that he has done nothing wrong, and we intend to plead not guilty 
and proceed to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Baron said, Kolter will challenge the indictment on grounds that 
only the House has the constitutional authority to judge a lawmaker's behavior 
while performing official duties. Rostenkowski mounted a similar challenge, but 
lost that motion in U.S. District Court last week. His lawyers said they would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment said Kolter obtained $11,000 in cash by disguising his 
transactions at the post office as stamp purchases for official purposes. 
Between 1985 and 1990, the indictment said, Kolter instructed then-House 
Postmaster Robert Rota to give him cash in exchange for vouchers and stamps.

WHITE PENTECOSTAL GROUP OFFICIALLY OKS DISBANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending nearly half a century of racial separation, an all-white association of 
Pentecostal denominations voted Tuesday to disband, taking a historic first 
step toward reclaiming the multiracial roots of American Pentecostalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous voice vote by 100 leaders of white denominations, including the 
Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal Holiness Church and the International Church 
of the Foursquare Gospel, followed several hours of closed-door soul searching 
and expressions of repentance by both African American and white Pentecostal 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is epic," said Del Tarr, president of the Assemblies of God Theological 
Seminary in Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Ethiel Clemmons of the predominantly African American Church of God in 
Christ said the vote marked the first time in this century that top leaders of 
both white and black Pentecostals have stated a willingness "to examine and 
probe the primary assumptions" of racism that for so long set Pentecostals 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting to dismantle the 46-year-old Pentecostal Fellowship of North 
America, white delegates to an unprecedented biracial conference of Pentecostal 
Christians cleared the way for the creation of a new multiethnic organization 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be called the Pentecostal Churches of North America, and its 
membership will be open to the estimated 16 million Pentecostals in the United 
States. Although no merger of actual denominations is envisioned, backers hope 
for growing cooperation at the local level between African American and white 
Pentecostal churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote came as no surprise. The groundwork was laid over the past 
three years by B.E. Underwood, general superintendent of the Pentecostal 
Holiness Church, and by Clemmons. The action was foreshadowed Monday night when 
an estimated 2,500 delegates burst into a song, "Lord, make us one!" 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the racially mixed crowd rejoiced together, some acknowledged 
Tuesday that hard work lies ahead to steer clear of tokenism in leadership 
positions and to get the word out to the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Clemmons said it will take three to five years for the full 
impact of cooperation to be felt at the local congregational level.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: FAR-FLUNG ROOTS OF JUDGE'S RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around the courthouse, judges are treated with respect and a certain awe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as though they're special people, protected from the pressures and 
influences of normal life by their black robes and their perches on an elevated 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent much of my reporting life in a different culture, covering the 
coarser world of politics, I find this amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, a judge is a lawyer lucky enough to have thrown a fund-raiser for the 
person who happened to get elected governor. Or a lawyer who knows someone who 
knows the governor well enough to put in a good word. 
</P>
<P>
 These connections are more than political. They are ideological. Governors 
appoint judges who share their beliefs on the law, especially on the conduct of 
the criminal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was truer to this precept than George Deukmejian, who devoted his two 
terms, from 1983 to 1991, to shaping the courts to reflect his unbending 
pro-police, pro-prosecutor, law-and-order vision of California. Among those he 
appointed was a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney named Lance A. Ito, 
who had been recommended by a friend and ideological soul mate of the 
governor's, then-Dist. Atty. Bob Philibosian. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the nature of the Deukmejian judges, and the way they have shaped the 
courts and the law, helps explain why Judge Ito on Tuesday refused a defense 
request that he discipline prosecutors for taking too long to complete the 
long-awaited DNA tests -- another ruling that favored the prosecution in the 
O.J. Simpson murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Memories being short, people don't associate Ito with the stern, usually grim, 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Deukmejian, Ito has his off-the-wall moments. Friends say he's a 
practical joker. And although he's always zinging the press, he's an occasional 
contributor to Steve Harvey's "Only in L.A." column. One of his items was about 
dueling traffic signs, a right-lane-must-turn-right sign near one outlawing 
right-hand turns. He took a photo of the signs, which Harvey put in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Another item was about devices that looked like video cameras over a crosswalk 
near City Hall. The transportation department said they were traffic measuring 
devices, but Ito, sounding suspicious of a Big Brother-type conspiracy, wrote 
Harvey, "Seems like a lot of effort to catch a jaywalker." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his occasional light touch, however, Ito fits the profile of a 
Deukmejian judge. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a prosecutor in the organized crime and intelligence division and in 
the gang unit. There, he worked well with L.A. cops, who usually bad-mouth 
deputy D.A.s. Ito and his partner, Peter S. Berman, "kept us out of trouble and 
helped guide us," said Sergio Robleto, commanding officer of the South Bureau 
homicide unit, who worked with Ito in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ito got on so well with cops that he married one, Margaret York, who 
was then an LAPD detective. They met when the cops roused Ito from bed at 4 
a.m. to obtain a search warrant. Today, she heads the LAPD's bunco-forgery unit 
and is the highest-ranked woman in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Deukmejian was looking for people who shared his common-sense, 
law-and-order profile," Philibosian said. "I thought Lance was particularly 
well suited in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 So I wasn't surprised when Ito sided with the D.A.'s office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contended that the prosecution had dawdled in sending a bloody 
glove and other key evidence to a laboratory for testing of DNA. Simpson 
lawyers argued that prosecutors were trying to overwhelm them with an 
"avalanche" of test results at the last minute, making it impossible for them 
to analyze the material. The defense had asked for sanctions against the 
prosecution -- that the test results be thrown out unless they were submitted 
by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution is correct in its position that the sanctions sought by the 
defendant are authorized neither by statute or case law," Ito ruled. The 
prosecution, he said, had complied with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 You may recall that last Friday, Ito had chewed out Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa 
Kahn for the testing delays. This prompted some courthouse observers to 
speculate that he'd side with the defense. But Ito's pique at Kahn didn't mean 
he'd turn on the prosecution, any more than his sending items to Steve Harvey's 
column means he likes the press. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to Ito's decision than the judge's own background. 
</P>
<P>
 I got an insight into that Tuesday when I talked to Gerald Chaleff, a Los 
Angeles defense lawyer and former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaleff reminded me that since the election of Ronald Reagan as governor in 
1966, the California bench has been filled with conservative appointees, with 
the exception of eight years of Jerry Brown. That means eight years of Reagan, 
eight of Deukmejian and three of Pete Wilson, all appointing conservative 
law-and-order judges. Nineteen conservative years to eight liberal ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the federal bench has been filled with conservative judges since 
the late Richard Nixon's election in 1968, with the exception of four years of 
Jimmy Carter and two of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 This means, Chaleff said, that volumes of conservative federal and state 
decisions have greatly eased restrictions on the manner in which the 
prosecution can submit evidence. These judicial decisions have been 
strengthened by legislation passed by lawmakers -- Democrats and Republicans -- 
who have been responsive to the public's demand for tougher laws on crime. "The 
people are getting what they voted for," Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Judge Ito on Tuesday was guided not only by his political and ideological 
roots and his personal philosophy, but also by a body of conservative law. 
</P>
<P>
 His decisions are no surprise. He is merely a highly visible example of what 
has happened to the law and criminal courts.

A CONSCIENCE CRIES OUT; CRIME: A MAN SURRENDERS IN AN ELDERLY WOMAN'S MURDER, 
SAYING HE WAS HAUNTED FOR 17 YEARS BY HER DYING WORDS. HE MAY FACE THE DEATH 
PENALTY. 
</P>

<P>
 "Oh Lord," the dying woman said. "I'm coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years -- during which he served prison sentences for robbery, attempted 
robbery, receiving stolen property and parole violations -- those last words 
haunted Julian Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, stricken by what he described as an awakened conscience, Imperial 
walked into the Whittier police station in August and admitted his involvement 
in the beating death of 73-year-old Mary R. Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been charged with first-degree murder while committing a burglary and 
could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting quietly in his cell and thumbing through a leather-covered Bible, the 
38-year-old man, with his short salt-and-pepper hair, brown tortoise-shell 
glasses and soft voice, has an aura of middle-class respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 But a host of tattoos -- including his gang nickname, "Crow," on his left hand 
-- hint at the darker side of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial was first arrested at age 13 for burglary, with subsequent arrests 
for auto theft, robbery and striking an off-duty police officer. He says he 
spent about three years in California Youth Authority facilities before 
reaching adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent jail interview, Imperial said that on Oct. 4, 1977, when he was 21 
years old, he and a friend -- looking for easy money -- decided to commit a 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose the first-floor apartment of Mary Stein, a widow who lived alone 
and managed a 38-unit complex on Pickering Avenue in Whittier, just two doors 
from where Imperial lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial said that while he was searching another room, he heard a pounding 
noise in a darkened bedroom. He said he walked in to find his friend, whom he 
would not name, striking someone in the bed with a bed slat. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial said he grabbed another board and struck the victim twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he heard her dying words. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by what had happened, Imperial said, he left the apartment with his 
friend and a few minutes later placed an anonymous call to alert police to the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have confirmed they received such a call. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial said that over the next three days, he and his friend spent the $500 
taken from the apartment on liquor and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Imperial was a suspect at the time, but he denied any involvement 
and there was no hard evidence, such as fingerprints, linking him to the crime. 
Detectives investigated the case for three months, then set it aside, said 
Whittier Police Sgt. Dan Petropulos. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial says that less than a year after the killing, he became a Christian.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted forgiveness for what I had done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not ready to change his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, he was sentenced to two years in prison for the attempted robbery of 
a Denny's restaurant. In 1984, he was sentenced to eight years for robbing a 
Downey liquor store. Four years later he was released, but parole violations 
put him back in prison three times. In 1991, he was sentenced to another year 
in prison for receiving a stolen television set and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Then finally, last summer, "I really got right with God," Imperial said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was staying at a Salvation Army shelter in Whittier at the time. 
After an evening service he approached the shelter's director, Barry Shrum, and 
sought advice about turning himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrum accompanied Imperial to the police station the following day. After 
giving a statement for more than an hour, Imperial was arrested on suspicion of 
murder. His preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 26 in Whittier Municipal Court. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dinko Bozanich said the investigation of Imperial's alleged 
accomplice -- a man currently in state prison -- is continuing. Authorities 
have refused to identify the man. 
</P>
<P>
 On his attorney's advice, Imperial pleaded not guilty in court. But in his 
recent jailhouse interview he described his involvement in Stein's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of running from the Lord," he said.

WARNING OF BALLOT SNAFU TO BE POSTED AT POLLING PLACES; ELECTION: SIGN WILL 
EXPLAIN THAT NUMBERING OF PUNCH HOLES FOR PROPOSITIONS 187 AND 188 IS 
POTENTIALLY CONFUSING. SOME ACTIVISTS SAY THE REMEDY IS INSUFFICIENT.

 Moving to forestall possible voter confusion surrounding two of the most 
controversial statewide ballot measures, the county registrar of voters said 
Tuesday that notices will be posted at polling places to help clarify the 
numbering on the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's decision was a concession to supporters and opponents of the 
measures as well as several civic groups that had demanded that county 
officials take some action to make the ballot less confusing for voters. 
</P>
<P>
 State election officials had also voiced concern about the ballot, suggesting 
the county caution voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The notices will be placed in all voting booths at each of the county's 6,104 
polling places on Nov. 8. The notice will also be included with absentee voter 
mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in response to the level of concern we are seeing from the Board (of 
Supervisors) and the large numbers of calls coming in," said Assistant 
Registrar-Recorder Michael Petrucello. "It is important to be responsive and 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Local election officials had initially declined to take any action, contending 
that the ballot posed no serious problem. But state election officials 
dispatched a letter to the registrar Friday asking that the notices be posted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the perfect solution," Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller said. 
"But we're too late in the process to do anything else. It's the best remedy 
under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also said the Los Angeles County numbering fluke may prompt revisions 
in the way ballots are made up. "This will be a wake-up call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion stems from a computer-generated numbering system used by the 
county that assigns each "yes" and "no" hole a number. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy had erupted over the ballot placement of Prop. 188, a 
smoking-related measure funded in large part by tobacco giant Phillip Morris, 
and Prop. 187, which seeks to deny illegal immigrants public schooling, social 
services and non-emergency health care. In a fluke, the "yes" punch hole for 
Prop. 188 is numbered 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the smoking initiative had worried that supporters of Prop. 187 
might inadvertently vote for Prop. 188. Supporters of Proposition 187 had also 
expressed concern about losing votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The registrar's decision was a small victory for activists and civic groups 
who had warned that a failure to clarify the numbers might prompt a contested 
election. They initially demanded that the ballots be reprinted, a plan the 
registrar has rejected as being too time-consuming and costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very positive move that will help clarify the issue for voters in 
what has been a confusing matter," said Alan Zovar, a spokesman for the 
Coalition for a Healthy California, which opposes Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased they have paid attention and realized this is an issue," said 
Marilee K. Scaff, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Los Angeles 
County. "The public has to be a good watchdog on these policies and we've done 
our job." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the proposed remedy did not satisfy Proposition 187 co-author Harold 
Ezell, who accused county officials of engaging in a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the city and county to put this out to millions of voters, to me it looks 
like a conspiracy," Ezell said at a news conference Tuesday. "How they can say 
they are going to put a little notice up there like a 'No Smoking' sign is 
outrageous, and I think somebody needs to be brought to task on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Gebe Martinez contributed to this story. Ballot Fluke 
Controversy has erupted over the ballot placement of Proposition 188, a 
smoking-related measure funded in large part by tobacco giant Phillip Morris, 
and Proposition 187, which seeks to deny services to illegal immigrants. In a 
fluke, the "yes" punch hole for Proposition 188 is numbered 187 on the L.A. 
County ballot. The registrar of voters office said Tuesday it will post notices 
at polling places to help clarify the numbering.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROP. 187; L.A. POLICE PANEL JOINS FOES OF MEASURE; THE 
COMMISSION ADDS ITS VOICE TO OTHER GROUPS AND GOVERNMENT BODIES IN OPPOSITION 
TO THE PLAN THAT WOULD DENY MANY TAX-BACKED BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday joined the chorus of groups and 
government bodies on record against Proposition 187, voting to oppose the hotly 
disputed ballot initiative that would deny public schooling and most 
tax-supported health care and other benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Hernandez Jr., president of the commission, called the proposal 
"immoral" in voicing his opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to make it almost unbearable for police to do their job in the 
city," Hernandez said of the state proposition, which enjoys a strong lead in 
the polls with less than three weeks before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with proscribing public benefits, the proposition would require that law 
enforcement agencies statewide question all arrestees "suspected" of being 
illegal immigrants about their residency status and then notify U.S. 
authorities of the identities of those believed to be undocumented. That 
requirement would appear to be in conflict with current LAPD regulations, which 
state that "undocumented alien status in itself is not a matter for police 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Deidre Hill, commission vice president, labeled Proposition 187 "racist and 
divisive," concluding that it was "the last thing we need in the city of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 A motion expressing opposition to Proposition 187, sponsored by Rabbi Gary 
Greenebaum, passed by a 4-1 margin after a brief discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole dissenter in the anti-187 vote was Commissioner Herbert F. Boeckmann 
II, who acknowledged that the measure was "not a panacea, not a cure-all," but 
added that it was inappropriate for the commission to take action on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as that strong a police issue," said Boeckmann, who attributed 
the proposition's support to frustration among voters about illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Deputy Chief Ronald C. Banks, sitting in for Chief Willie L. 
Williams, said that the proposition would likely increase juvenile delinquency, 
since tens of thousands of youths would be banned from public schools. The 
deputy chief also cited a likely "erosion ofcommunity trust" and a threat to 
community-based policing, as crime victims and witnesses alike might be 
hesitant to approach police, fearing arrest because of immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Banks said, the costs of putting Proposition 187 into effect 
would likely be "enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 William King, a retired U.S. Border Patrol chief who was a proposition 
originator, said the commissioners were "dead wrong" in their action. "The 
rank-and-file officer knows Proposition 187 is a good idea," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of police-immigrant relations has long been a charged one in Los 
Angeles and other areas with considerable populations of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the late 1970s, as large numbers of illegal immigrants arrived in 
Los Angeles, pro-immigrant advocates fought to have police cease picking people 
up solely for immigration violations. The result was a series of actions, in 
Los Angeles and elsewhere, that limited police questioning of suspects about 
their status and also circumscribed police cooperation with the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 sponsors, including King and several other former high-level 
INS officials, deliberately sought to bolster police-INS cooperation and 
increase the use of police resources in identifying illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 With the vote, the police commission joined the Los Angeles City Council, the 
Los Angeles Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles Unified School District in 
opposing Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-187 votes have a largely symbolic value, but, should the proposition 
pass, the commission could be called on to vote on implementing procedures. The 
City Council might also choose to draft legislation affecting police 
enforcement of the measure.

COLORFUL PALS; 2 GENTLEMEN FROM ITALY ADD NEW HUES TO FRIENDSHIP WITH OPERA 
MURAL PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
 They are just a couple of old friends from the old country. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Giovanni Palomba and Franco Altavilla describe the bond that 
has brought them together at a busy street corner in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One is an artist who for 45 years painted Michelangelo-like angels on church 
walls and ornate friezes on ceilings for celebrities such as Liberace and for 
other wealthy patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is owner of an Italian restaurant where framed reproductions of old 
masters cover the walls and the music of Scarlatti and the scent of linguini 
primavera fill the air. 
</P>
<P>
 They met 16 years ago at an Italian church in Los Angeles' Chinatown. Palomba, 
who has lived in this country 4 1/2 decades, was surprised to learn that 
Altavilla was a skilled stonecutter. In fact, the restaurant site was first 
leased as a sculpture studio by Altavilla, a U.S. resident since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the two friends met frequently to discuss art and music and to argue 
politics. They would sit for hours, sharing bottles of wine and cheeses 
imported from their respective hometowns -- the Naples area for Palomba, the 
village of Oria for Altavilla. 
</P>
<P>
 But when 77-year-old Palomba of San Pedro suffered a stroke that left him 
lying unconscious on the floor, he feared his life as an artist was over. 
</P>
<P>
 That thought left Altavilla stricken too. Palomba's talent was too precious to 
waste away, he decided. So was his friend's zest for life. 
</P>
<P>
 So Altavilla cajoled his friend to take brush in hand one more time to paint 
the walls outside his Gianfranco Delizie Italiane.  
</P>
<P>
 Each day he drapes plastic tarps over the front of his restaurant and 
maneuvers a motorized lift out of a back storeroom and onto the sidewalk. Then 
he loads paint cans into its basket and helps his friend climb inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly -- with deliberate and sometimes halting brush strokes -- Palomba is 
creating scenes from the world's most cherished operas on the white stucco 
above Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 For both men, it is a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I stay home, I feel like I'm dead or something," Palomba said. "When I 
paint, I feel like Pavarotti. I feel like a musician playing beautiful music." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the 57-year-old Altavilla: "It's fun to be with him. He is a very 
talented artist -- his work will bring joy to many people." 
</P>
<P>
 After the stroke, Palomba was wary about climbing back on the ladders and 
scaffolding that helped define his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only time I'd seen him sad," Altavilla said. "He told me, 'I think 
I'm finished.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Palomba's strength gradually returned. But his nerve was lagging the day 
Altavilla proposed the opera murals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'No, it's too big for me now,' " Altavilla recounted. "I told him 
that I needed help, that I wanted him to make the restaurant nice. I told him 
not to worry, that I'd make a nice scaffold outside. I said we'd do it slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Altavilla rented the motorized lift and the pair spent an hour arguing over it 
before Palomba finally acknowledged that riding on a platform was easier than 
climbing one. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three weeks to finish the first opera panel, "Cavalleria Rusticana." 
He started a scene from "Pagliacci" last week. After that comes "Rigoletto" and 
then either "Tosca" or "Madama Butterfly." The pair are arguing over which one 
to paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomba's wife, Grazia, watches from the sidewalk as the opera scenes take 
shape. "She helps me get the lines straight," the artist explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby say they enjoy watching the wall being transformed. "Beautiful, 
terrific," said Andrea Thompson, a deputy district attorney who works at a 
nearby courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's giving life to an old building," said lawyer James Blatt of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 It's giving life to two old friends too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think he may not finish," said Altavilla with a grin. "We'll get 
'Madama Butterfly' done, I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean 'Tosca,' " replied Palomba with a laugh. "You think I'm going to 
retire? Never!"

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; 
GORBACHEV ASKS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL 'PERESTROIKA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ex-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who heads an international ecological 
crusade, called for an international environmental "perestroika" on the second 
day of his two-day mission in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of the U.S. in the post-Cold War could be more important than its 
role was in the past," the former head of the now-defunct Soviet Union said 
Tuesday at a Town Hall luncheon in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country has the potential to be a leader in a new world order," he said 
through an interpreter. "The most important expression of that would be in the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev founded Green Cross International in 1993, two years after he was 
deposed as Soviet leader. Global Green U.S.A., founded last year, will be an 
affiliate of the international group, Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
 The American group will join Gorbachev in his campaign to get people in all 
countries to stop mistreating the earth, fix man-made disasters and reform 
ecological law, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev, flanked by his wife, Raisa, said that during the Cold War, the 
world was divided and "nobody had time for the environment." Times have 
changed, he added.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
CITY COUNCIL VOTES SUPPORT OF SUBWAY ACROSS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstering the supporters of an underground transit system across the San 
Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to support the 
subway they favor rather than a rival elevated line over the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of several Valley council members, the council reaffirmed 
the position it adopted five years ago in favor of a mostly subterranean line 
paralleling Burbank and Chandler boulevards for a mass transit project to be 
built in the coming century. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, by an 11-1 vote, was a blow for those led by County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich who want the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a 
monorail above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action swung the focus of the long debate to Mayor Richard 
Riordan, an MTA director who also appoints three others to the agency's 
13-member board. As mayor, Riordan has not committed himself to either option, 
although he backed the freeway monorail in his election campaign.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TRIAL DATE 
SET FOR RAPPER, 2 OTHERS IN MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Tuesday set a trial date of Jan. 13 for rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and 
two other people accused of killing a Long Beach man last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The tall, thin singer, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, spoke only once 
during the 30-minute hearing before Superior Court Judge Paul Flynn.He and 
co-defendants McKinley Lee and Sean Abrams all answered "yes" when asked if 
they would waive their right for the trial to start at an earlier date.  
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indicted the men on a murder charge for the Aug. 25, 1993, 
shooting death of Philip Woldemariam, 20, in Woodbine Park in Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Lee was the triggerman and Broadus was driving 
the Jeep from which the shots were fired. Abrams allegedly was in the back 
seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Nison said the victim and the suspects were gang 
members. The defense claims that Lee shot Woldemariam in self-defense after the 
victim pulled a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 Broadus and Lee are free on $1 million bail each, and Abrams posted a $200,000 
bond. But in a separate ruling Tuesday, Flynn ordered Lee placed under house 
arrest, pending a hearing Nov. 4.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TARZANA; 2 ROBBERS TAKE 
$500,000 IN JEWELS FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two robbers, who may have followed a jewelry broker from a Downtown jewel 
market, broke into a Tarzana home and made off five minutes later with $500,000 
in cut diamonds and sapphires, police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said jewelry broker Indra Jhaveri, 44, of Arizona, may have been 
followed Monday night from the Downtown Jewelry Mart -- where he had been 
trying to drum up business earlier in the day -- to the home of David Rahima, 
42, another jewelry broker, in the 19100 block of Santa Rita Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men, one armed with a semiautomatic pistol, knocked on the door of the 
house, police said. When Rahima opened the door, they pushed him to the floor, 
taped the mouth and hands of the screaming Jhaveri, grabbed the precious stones 
on the table and fled, police said. The stones were uninsured, according to 
Jhaveri. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for two white men in their 30s, one about 5 feet, 8 
inches tall and 160 pounds, with brown hair and eyes, the other about 6 feet 
tall and 180 pounds, also with brown hair and eyes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN MARINO; 3 TO STAND 
TRIAL IN SLAYINGS OF 2 AT GRADUATION PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Asian gang members were ordered Tuesday to stand trial in the shooting 
deaths of two high school students gunned down at a San Marino High School 
graduation party. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weeklong preliminary hearing in Pasadena Municipal Court, three 
young people who attended the party testified that gang members came to the 
party armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, a .380-caliber handgun and a baseball 
bat.They intended to battle "enemies" -- rival gang members already at the 
party -- the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects -- Cuong Chan Phan, 18, of Monterey Park; Vi Quoc Chauc, 
also known as Peter Chau, 18, of Rosemead, and Don Sam Ha, 19, a Los Angeles 
County resident -- will return Nov. 2 for arraignment on murder charges in 
Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Thi Tran, 19, of Westminster, pleaded guilty earlier to being an accessory 
to murder, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. No 
sentencing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suspect, Mia Quiocho, 18, of Rosemead, faces a separate preliminary 
hearing Nov. 15. Meanwhile, a 17-year-old faces a juvenile court hearing soon 
to determine if he should be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder charges against a seventh youth, Hau Tac San, also known as John Chan, 
20, of South El Monte, were dropped after investigators determined that he was 
not at the party.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS BAR USE OF COUNTY FUNDS FOR STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted without dissent 
to bar the use of county funds to build a new football stadium, dumping cold 
water on a proposal by National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for 
a partnership with government to construct such a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke was missing for the vote on the 
motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, but she has previously stated she does 
not believe a new stadium is in anyone's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion contended that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, recently the site 
of $60 million in earthquake repairs, would be likely to lose "a crucial 
tenant," the Raiders, if a new stadium were built and might be able to stay 
open only with the support of the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a new stadium, the motion added: 
</P>
<P>
 "A project with the scope of an 80,000-seat football stadium as Tagliabue has 
suggested would likely require public funding. With California still coping 
with the effects of the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression, 
allocating scarce government dollars on a football stadium when many vital 
services . . . are sustaining cutbacks would be a folly of the worst sort." 
</P>
<P>
 Needed instead, the motion said, "is a long-term lease with the Raiders that 
would allow for the financing without risk to the taxpayers of luxury boxes and 
other improvements that would again make the Coliseum a state-of-the-art 
facility."  
</P>
<P>
 At NFL headquarters in New York, spokesmen declined comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
BOARD TO STUDY PAYMENT OF SUSPECTS' HOSPITAL BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to study whether 
the county should pay the private hospital bills of drunk drivers and others 
who receive medical treatment while in police custody before being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was pressed by officials of Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
the Santa Clarita Valley.It is also being closely watched by administrators of 
the county's 119 private acute-care hospitals, which lose millions annually 
because many drunk drivers and psychiatric patients in police custody refuse to 
pay their bills, pleading poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care to 
everyone regardless of their ability to pay, a spokesman for the Hospital 
Council of Southern California said.  
</P>
<P>
 The custody cases cost Henry Mayo about $150,000 a year, just over 3% of the 
$4.5 million the hospital loses in uncompensated medical costs, officials there 
said. Countywide, hospitals lose about $1.5 billion annually in uncompensated 
medical costs, a hospital council spokesman said. No exact figures are 
available, but for some hospitals, the custody cases represent about 3% to 5% 
of the overall losses, he said.

COURT OF FAST RESORT; TEEN-AGE ATTORNEYS GRILL POTENTIAL JURORS AND QUICKLY 
SEAT PANEL IN SIMULATION OF SIMPSON CASE AT VALLEY MAGNET SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito certainly would have been frustrated by the teen-age 
attorneys' lack of courtroom savvy. But he would have been thrilled by their 
speed: Twelve jurors and two alternates were picked in the time it would take 
to dissect a frog. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, four weeks after beginning jury selection, the real attorneys in 
the O.J. Simpson murder trial are still at it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, would-be barristers at James Monroe High School in the mid-San 
Fernando Valley grilled would-be jurors about their ability to rule fairly in 
the Simpson trial. And if Simpson's freedom wasn't truly on the line, good 
grades were -- and questioning in the school's Law and Government Magnet 
program was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stated that you thought O.J. Simpson was a good man and incapable of 
committing such a crime. Why?" shot prosecutor Kristi Harty, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," 16-year-old potential juror Steve Ross replied sheepishly, "he looks 
like a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 To explore one of the least understood aspects of a criminal trial, the 
students were mimicking the jury selection process now taking place at the 
Downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet program focuses on course work ranging from criminal forensics to 
politics and often features guest seminars by attorneys and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, an appropriately somber "Judge" Bill Hence (a criminal law teacher 
at the North Hills school who is awaiting the results of his own bar exam) 
presided. Attorneys, wearing chic business dresses and three-piece suits but 
still battling acne, examined and cross-examined potential jurors who had to be 
home at 10 on school nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential jurors had already filled out an abridged version of the actual 
Simpson jury questionnaire, and both the defense and prosecution were poised to 
pounce on any bias in the surveys that they felt went against their case. 
</P>
<P>
 You want unbiased jurors, said prosecutor Amy Messigian, 14, so long as they 
are a little more unbiased toward your side. 
</P>
<P>
 Would one juror's status as a USC football fan get in the way of convicting 
heroic alumnus Simpson, Harty asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, Mr. Simpson played before I was born," the youthful juror 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Antonio Moore and Kaz Gohlke could hardly wait to dismiss 
one juror who felt that Simpson's real defense team was "kissing up" to Judge 
Ito by constantly referring to him as "your honor" and saying "please and thank 
you" so often. 
</P>
<P>
 If moments in the proceedings were refreshingly free of legal machinations -- 
and even had "Judge" Hence fighting a grin -- many of the questions struck at 
the heart of the case, and of its possible social implications. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latina juror was asked if the Los Angeles riots of 1992 had altered her 
attitudes toward African Americans. Another was asked a similar question after 
noting on her questionnaire that she had once been followed by a black man. And 
the prosecution especially sought out those with a strong belief in the 
reliability of DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the real trial has taken on an air of sensationalism and involves two 
grisly slayings, it is also perfect for such a mock jury selection, said 
teacher Mark Elinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the one time we've had the opportunity to deal with a case everyone is 
familiar with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be an overstatement. One of the would-be jurors set off a flurry of 
giggles when he conceded that he had no idea who O.J. Simpson is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not much of a football fan," he said.

LATINO-ARMENIAN FRICTION AT SCHOOL SPARKS VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Grant High School juniors were stabbed and a 16-year-old student shot near 
the Van Nuys campus Tuesday, apparently because of animosity between Armenian 
and Latino students that led to scattered after-school fighting, school 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys of Armenian descent who were stabbed several times as they walked to 
their cars after school were being treated at Valley Medical Center, where they 
were listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A third student, a Latino who was wounded in the calf in a drive-by shooting 
about 10 minutes after the stabbings, was in satisfactory condition at the 
Medical Center of North Hollywood, police and school authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made, and police were investigating the stabbings and the 
shooting. Detective Craig Rhudy of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
Division blamed the violence on tensions between Latino and Armenian gangs, 
which he said have been at odds for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been fights, stabbings, shootings -- just about everything," Rhudy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 50 and 100 students were involved in skirmishes after school, said 
Sgt. Steve Masters of the Los Angeles Unified School District police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivna Gusmo, a Grant High School guidance counselor, said tensions between the 
Armenians and Latinos -- the two largest ethnic groups at the school -- have 
been high. "You have the hormones flying and the machismo . . . ," she said.

2 OF 3 ELECTED IN FULLERTON VOW TO KILL UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO and SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's voters went to the polls Tuesday to replace three City Council 
members ousted by recall, culminating an unusual -- and costly -- special 
election marked by political infighting, bitter lawsuits and ballot-box 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the newly elected, Jan M. Flory and Conrad DeWitte, will serve on the 
council for no more than six weeks, unless voters reelect them in the Nov. 8 
general election. The third winner, Peter Godfrey, will serve a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's unprecedented election was forced by the June recall of three 
council members who voted to impose a 2% utility tax last year. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte and Godfrey have vowed to repeal the utility tax. Flory said she 
supports keeping the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte, a 46-year-old businessman, said voters agreed with him that the 
utility tax was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is feeling the recession and is cutting back," he said. 
"When government doesn't do that, you have to say, 'Hey, you guys aren't 
listening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Added Godfrey, a 49-year-old attorney: "This community voted for a 
conservative Republican to stop the taxing and spending. That's our policy. The 
clean campaign we ran is what won it. We didn't use any mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Flory, a 50-year-old family law attorney, said her victory proves that 
residents want to "return to normalcy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of the recall is that there needs to be better communications 
between City Hall and the citizens," she said. "The recall election made people 
take stock of the city and the services we take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote was the latest act in a yearlong political drama that has 
divided residents and cost the city more than $200,000 in election costs and 
legal fees. Because it was scheduled so close to the Nov. 8 general election, 
many city voters were left confused by the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer number of candidates also played a role in voter confusion. Eighteen 
people ran in the special election, including one unsuccessful candidate who 
called for a massive reorganization of city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terribly confusing," said voter George Lowe, a 46-year-old interior 
designer. "I think it's a waste of money to have a (special) election two to 
three weeks before the real election." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so confused," added Oliva Luna, 32. "There were so many candidates and 
no commercials that I didn't even vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The election didn't stop the City Council from holding an afternoon session 
that lasted into the evening. The meeting was attended by several candidates, 
who after the polls closed went to several restaurants around the city to wait 
for election returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was expected to spend $117,000 on the special election, and has spent 
more than $100,000 on June's recall vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue in Tuesday's election was the 2% utility tax imposed by the 
council last year. The tax, applied to monthly water, telephone, electric, gas 
and cable television bills, costs a Fullerton household an average of $4.40 a 
month, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Don Bankhead and Molly McClanahan 
approved the tax despite vocal opposition from hundreds of residents and 
business owners who said the levy was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members argued that the tax was the only way to balance the 
city's budget without making deep cuts in police and fire services. The tax, 
which would expire in September, 1995, is expected to provide the city with 
$4.6 million in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the council's actions, tax opponents launched a recall campaign 
that culminated in June when voters ousted Catlin, Bankhead and McClanahan by 
slim margins. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to save money, the city tried to consolidate the special election 
with the Nov. 8 general election, a move opposed by recall leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the Fullerton Recalls Committee took the city to court. Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood ruled in the recall group's favor and 
ordered Tuesday's special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent more than $8,700 on court costs related to the case, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of Tuesday's election will be inaugurated at a special Oct. 25 
council meeting. The two short-term council members will succeed Catlin and 
McClanahan, whose terms would have expired in November. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect the short-term winners to serve on the council for three 
or six weeks. They will leave office sometime after the Nov. 8 election, unless 
they are reelected to serve four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The other winner of Tuesday's election will serve out the two years remaining 
on the term of Bankhead.

 Despite continuing protests from some South County residents, the Board of

Canyon Road and widen it to a four-lane highway to ease traffic congestion and 
reduce accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, county and state officials have studied ways to 
improve safety on the roadway, one of the most dangerous in Orange County, 
averaging two to three fatalities a year. The county's Environmental Management 
Agency, which urged the board to adopt the redesign, said the roadway has an 
injury- and fatal-accident rate approximately double that of other state 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that relatively few people in 
town, including environmentalists, had appeared before the City Council or at 
workshops to oppose the plan that supervisors adopted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not unanimous support, but there never will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But about a dozen residents opposed the plan Tuesday, expressing concerns that 
design changes will infringe on the pastoral beauty and peace of the roadway 
linking the San Diego Freeway in Irvine with Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the move would undermine the efforts of Laguna Beach residents, who 
voted to spend $20 million for a wilderness park that the roadway bisects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am being steamrollered," said Eleanor Henry, a 34-year resident of 
Laguna Beach. "The wildlife in the wilderness park will cease to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna taxpayers are being robbed," said Jean Jenks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's plan, Laguna Canyon Road, which is now two to three lanes 
wide, would be widened to four lanes on a 4.8-mile segment between El Toro Road 
and the San Diego Freeway to accommodate a projected 42% increase in traffic to 
about 34,000 average daily trips by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased highway capacity also will help accommodate motorists entering 
and leaving the proposed San Joaquin Hills tollway, which is planned to 
intersect with Laguna Canyon Road about a mile north of El Toro Road, said Ken 
R. Smith, the county's director of transportation in the Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which still must be approved by the California Department of 
Transportation, calls for construction of the realignment and widening to begin 
in 1996, with completion in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said a consensus on a highway-widening plan did not come easily. "It 
represents a year and a half of intensive discussions between the cities of 
Laguna Beach and Irvine, the environmental community, CalTrans and" the Irvine 
Co., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's plan incorporates a number of environmental concessions. It 
proposes moving the existing roadway from between two natural lakes and 
relocating it to a less environmentally sensitive area farther west. This 
roadway relocation would also assist a plan to restore a historic linkage 
between the two lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, two wildlife undercrossings are proposed near the Laguna Lakes 
and a third near the Laguna Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realigned road will also serve as a main entry point to the future Laguna 
Coast Wilderness Park," Smith said  
</P>
<P>
 Another important concession that the county made to environmentalists, Smith 
said, was to promise to remove a six-lane highway designation for a portion of 
Laguna Canyon Road that is currently on the county's master plan of arterial 
highways. The stretch is between Lake Forest Drive and the proposed tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Harvey, executive director of the Orange County Bicycle Coalition, 
commended the plan for providing eight-foot shoulders on the road to make 
cycling safer. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was outnumbered at Tuesday's meeting by protesters, who called 
themselves the Canyon Coalition. They contended that the road widening and 
realignment were unnecessary because of other planned road improvements in the 
area, such as the planned widening of the El Toro Y and upgrading of Moulton 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters also attacked the adequacy of the road expansion's 
environmental impact report, contending, among other things, that it neglects 
to scrutinize a portion of the road where it will join with the proposed San 
Joaquin Hills tollway. The county staff countered that this issue has been 
addressed in the tollway's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the protesters contended that the proposed road widening would 
violate a provision of a bond proposition passed by Laguna Beach voters in 1990 
to help pay for the wilderness park that includes Laguna Canyon. They said the 
proposition stipulates that the acquired land would not be used for purposes 
other than a park without approval by the majority of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank and City Atty. Philip Kohn said after the meeting that they 
were unsure whether the road widening would require approval by Laguna Beach 
voters, but added that the matter could be raised in the future if the county 
attempts to acquire parkland from the city for the widening and realignment 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "To raise that issue now is premature," Frank said.

2 GRANT STUDENTS STABBED, 1 SHOT IN RACE ATTACKS 
</P>

<P>
 Two Grant High School juniors were stabbed and a 16-year-old student was shot 
near the campus Tuesday, apparently because of animosity between Armenian and 
Latino students that led to scattered after-school fighting, school authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys of Armenian descent who were stabbed several times as they walked to 
their cars were being held overnight for treatment at Valley Hospital Medical 
Center, where they were listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A third student, a Latino who was shot in the calf in a drive-by shooting 
about 10 minutes after the stabbings, was in satisfactory condition at the 
Medical Center of North Hollywood, police and school authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' names were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests were made and police are still investigating the stabbings and the 
shooting. Los Angeles Police Detective Craig Rhudy of the Van Nuys Division 
blamed the violence on tensions between Latino and Armenian gangs that he said 
have been at odds for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been fights, stabbings, shootings -- just about everything," Rhudy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But police said they do not believe that the victims were gang members and 
were unsure if the drive-by shooting was in retaliation for the stabbings. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 50 and 100 students were involved in skirmishes after school, said 
Sgt. Steve Masters of the Los Angeles Unified School District police. 
</P>
<P>
 Both stabbing victims were described by friends and relatives as Armenian 
immigrants who are not gang members. A hospital spokeswoman said one of them, a 
16-year-old, was being treated for a collapsed lung. He is a straight-A student 
with hopes of going to medical school, a counselor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the father of the boy, as he waited in the hospital: "I don't know what's 
happened. He's a very good student. I am proud of him and I don't understand 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of the other boy, her eyes red from crying, said the family has 
been in this country for 2 1/2 years. "We came here for a better life, but it's 
the opposite. I want to go back, but we can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivna Gusmo, a Grant High School guidance counselor who came to the hospital 
because she was worried about the boys, said they were walking to their cars 
when they were jumped by Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 Gusmo said tensions between Armenians and Latinos -- the two largest ethnic 
groups at the Van Nuys school -- have been high. "You have the hormones flying 
and the machismo of both cultures, and it's like getting little bulls 
together," she said. "We are trying to address these kinds of situations and 
prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's two groups of immigrants and, when you're trying to make sense of your 
new world, . . . you want to find someone lower than you" in the social 
hierarchy of the school, Gusmo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students complained that administrators and teachers knew about a planned 
brawl this week and that they should have done more to prevent it. A friend of 
the stabbing victims, who asked not to be identified, said at the hospital: 
"They knew but they're not too serious about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gusmo, who heard the remark, responded: "They're serious now." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old stabbing victim, who worked for Gusmo as an assistant, is a 
good student who doesn't get into trouble, she said. "He's a perfect kid," 
Gusmo said. "He's the one who will be a doctor, the one who will do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions were high since a fight broke out on campus a week ago, according to 
students, administrators and police. Another fight broke out Monday. Grant 
Principal Eve Sherman said administrators and teachers were on alert all day 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a sense of tension here," Sherman said. "When you've been in the 
business long enough, you can tell the way kids are looking at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Flare-ups began near campus just after classes ended about 2 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-by shooting occurred near Erwin Park on Ethel Avenue, about three 
blocks from the school, and the stabbings occurred two blocks south, closer to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A school district police officer was on campus during the day and on the 
perimeter of the school watching students leaving, Sherman said. Both the 
school district and the LAPD plan to increase patrols near the school today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a crisis team will be on campus to talk with students and 
teachers, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said that ill will had been increasing between the two groups, and 
that they expected conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of racial problems," sophomore Robin Nemany, 15, said. 
"The Hispanics will come up and say, 'I hate Armenians,' and the Armenians will 
say, 'I hate Hispanics.' It's been going on for at least six years -- there's 
always trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Daryn Maiman, a 15-year-old sophomore: "It doesn't make me scared; it 
makes me angry that they are fighting over something that doesn't make sense."

STATE STUDY LET FATAL DRIVER KEEP LICENSE; CRASH: DMV SAYS 'ABERRATION' IN 
SYSTEM MEANT 3 OF 5 SPEEDING TICKETS ISSUED TO SHANE YOUNG -- ARRESTED IN 
SILVERADO CANYON ACCIDENT -- WERE NEVER COUNTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The driver of a pickup truck that struck and killed a pedestrian in Silverado 
Canyon on Sunday was a chronic speeder with enough tickets to lose his license 
earlier this year, but remained on the road because he was unknowingly enrolled 
in a state research program that studied how errant drivers are punished, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from the state Department of Motor Vehicles said a suspension 
would have made little difference Sunday because the driver, Shane Young, 25, 
probably would have gotten his license back in September -- well before the 
crash that killed his close friend Jasmin Cook and injured two other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy has a history of speeding. He was deliberately negligent. It probably 
wouldn't have mattered whether he was in any program," said DMV spokesman Bill 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said an "aberration" in the computerized research program for which 
Young had been randomly chosen meant that three of the five speeding tickets he 
got last year -- enough to ensure the suspension of his license -- were never 
counted. The result was that while Young's license should have been suspended 
sometime last spring, he was allowed to continue driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idiosyncrasy. You might call it an aberration," said Madison. "We're 
going to examine why it's like that and whether it should change." 
</P>
<P>
 Young was picked by computer in March to be among 55,000 ticketed drivers 
placed in two special pools so their subsequent driving records could be 
studied. The idea behind the 20-year-old experiment is to allow officials to 
study whether measures such as warning letters deter driving violations, 
Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are chosen from drivers receiving two tickets over a 12-month 
period. They remain in the little-known program -- called Negligent Operator 
Treatment Evaluation System, or NOTES -- for up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In one group, those who receive a third ticket get letters warning them their 
license will be suspended after one more violation. In the other group, no such 
letters are sent, giving researchers the chance to see whether warning letters 
deter violations, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under DMV rules, licenses are normally suspended for any driver following four 
violations in any 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was placed in the NOTES program on March 16, after the DMV received 
confirmation that he had two speeding convictions within the previous 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Still working their way through the system, however, were yet two more 
speeding convictions that predated the March conviction that got him placed in 
the NOTES program. These two additional convictions would have been enough to 
reach the four-ticket limit when a license is suspended. But those two tickets 
were never counted because they were reported to the DMV after his enrollment 
and the NOTES computer was programmed to ignore prior convictions, Madison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's fifth speeding infraction dated to March 4, 1993 -- more than a year 
before his enrollment in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real unique situation where the convictions came in late and he was 
in the NOTES program," Madison said. "This is the first case that anybody's 
aware of that this has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 If Young had not been enrolled in the program, his convictions would have 
meant the suspension of his license -- most likely for three to four months -- 
in May, Madison said. In all likelihood, Young would have gotten his license 
back, with a year's probation, by the end of September, Madison said. If Young 
had not contested the suspension, though, he would have lost his license 
automatically for six months -- or until next month, Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and felony driving under the 
influence after police said he struck the three people on narrow Silverado 
Canyon Road while racing another a driver in another car. The second driver, 
Clint Wamsley, 19, was arrested on the same charges but has been released from 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook was walking on the edge of the winding road with two friends on bicycles 
when the crash occurred about 10:15 p.m. Police said Wamsley slowed his Ford 
Mustang when he saw the trio, but Young struck them when he swerved to avoid 
the Mustang. Shane Graham, 19, of Silverado Canyon and Timothy Smart, 21, 
remained in stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, Young was arraigned Tuesday on an unrelated vehicle violation 
that occurred in September. Young pleaded guilty to having faulty lights, and 
Municipal Judge Charles Margines suspended the fine. Margines said the lighting 
violation was "the least of your problems."

FDA FOUND RAT IN CAN, KEPT QUIET; HEALTH: AGENCY CONFIRMS REPORT OF RODENT IN 
PEPSI CONTAINER BUT SAYS NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND AT BOTTLING PLANT. COMPANY 
DENIES RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>

 Federal investigators found a decaying rat inside a Diet Pepsi can sold in 
Orange County, but decided to close the case without issuing warnings to 
Pepsi-Cola or to the public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed 
Wednesday, 
</P>
<P>
 An FDA spokeswoman said that it was not known how the rat got in the can and 
that the July incident seemed to be "isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators inspected the Buena Park Pepsi-Cola bottling operation that 
produced the soda where the rat was found, but turned up no problems with 
cleanliness or quality control, FDA spokeswoman Rosario Quintanilla-Vior said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did find the rat in the can," Quintanilla-Vior said. "It was in pieces, 
but it was there," she said. "But we've got to make sure we have all kinds of 
evidence before we make a public announcement if it's going to make (the 
public) worried or cause any kind of flurry." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pepsi official Tuesday denied responsibility for the rodent and said the 
claim may be the latest hoax against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough for anyone to know how the rat or mouse got into the can, but the 
FDA gave our plant a clean bill of health," spokeswoman Anne Ward said from 
Pepsi headquarters in Somers, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old woman has filed a lawsuit against Pepsi-Cola Co. and the 
Albertson's grocery store chain, alleging that she bought and drank from the 
can of Diet Pepsi that contained a dead rat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the woman's attorney released notes from a hospital report where 
staff members inspected the soda can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family brought in can of Pepsi; I removed the can with a can opener and found 
what apeared (sic) to be some sort of rhodent (sic) in the bottom of the can. 
Health Department notified," said the emergency room report from Anaheim 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency room employees declined to comment Tuesday and an administrator did 
not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Maria Del Consuelo Lazaro, a visiting schoolteacher from Jalisco, 
Mexico, filed suit Friday in Orange County Superior Court. She alleged that 
while visiting family in Buena Park in July, she drank about a third of a 
12-ounce can of Diet Pepsi that she had bought at an Albertson's only to spit 
out some strange matter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, according to her attorney, she went to the emergency ward 
at Anaheim General Hospital complaining of severe abdominal pains, diarrhea and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at the hospital opened the can and discovered a full-grown rat about the 
size of a fist, said Lazaro's attorney, Daniel Ramirez of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital later sent the can and its contents to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at the Albertson's in Buena Park has declined comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 4 letter to Lazaro, FDA Laboratory Director John Stamp wrote that 
the can contained: "44.1 gms. of material which consisted of two rat/mouse 
fragments and a small quantity of pale transparent liquid. Striated hair 
fragments (including rat/mouse hairs) were found adhering to the metal can lid 
-- 13 on the outer surface and 20 on the inner surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Quintanilla-Vior said FDA investigators never were able to contact Lazaro and 
speak with her directly, which was a factor in their decision to close the 
case. The FDA spokeswoman added that a language barrier with Lazaro had 
discouraged investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the FDA has received no other similar reports about cans from the 
Buena Park plant and that the agency has no plans to pursue the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said Lazaro developed a rash after drinking from the can and a fear of 
eating that has caused her to lose 30 pounds, and has sought psychological 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he will try to prove that the bottling company carelessly 
disregarded public safety. He said he is skeptical that the bottling company 
could come up to government standards, as the FDA maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do come up to governmental standards, we have a serious problem," 
Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Pepsi-Cola became the target of the largest product-tampering 
investigation in U.S. history when people from cities as far-flung as San 
Diego, Williamsport, Pa., and Albion, Mich., claimed to have found needles in 
Diet Pepsi cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three of the cases ended in arrests by the FDA for false claims. So far, 
none has shown Pepsi was at fault, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman in New York who claimed she found a rat in a can was recently 
arrested for making a false report, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take every call in good faith, but unfortunately, we've had some 
experience with people who have tried to take advantage," Ward said.

STUDENTS SPELLBOUND; CELEBRITY: EARVIN (MAGIC) JOHNSON SPEAKS AT LAGUNA BEACH 
HIGH SCHOOL ABOUT AIDS, HIS CAREER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 400 cheering parents and students packed the bleachers in the Laguna 
Beach High School gymnasium to hear former basketball star Earvin (Magic) 
Johnson speak about the importance of education, his career with the Lakers and 
how he is coping with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk about HIV to help you to understand that it's out there and it's here 
to stay, to make you think before doing things," said Johnson, who received a 
standing ovation from the crowd. "Talk to your teachers. It's not all about 
having HIV or AIDS. It's about getting somebody pregnant. None of us want to 
become early parents." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the audience that the safest sex was no sex and urged those students 
who do not abstain to practice safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by one student how he deals with the human immunodeficiency virus, 
Johnson said: "I just live. . . . You get up in the morning and you take your 
medicine and you work out for two hours. You don't have to think about it; it's 
with you every day. God blessed me with my family, my great health. I'm doing 
outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hushed gymnasium, one 14-year-old boy told Johnson that "it took a lot 
of character for you to get up and talk about AIDS the way you did." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 35, announced in 1991 that he had tested positive for HIV, which 
causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also impressed upon his young audience the importance of education and 
gave some advice to aspiring basketball players. "Make sure you get your 
education, because if you don't make it, you've got something to fall back on," 
he said. "If you don't put 125% into it, you're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong question-and-answer session, students wildly waved their 
hands, eager to be the ones to ask Johnson questions, which ranged from how he 
got his nickname to whether he missed basketball. The walls were hung with 
posters welcoming him. Johnson promised one young fan that he would come and 
play basketball with the Laguna Beach Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>

 Asked who most inspired him, Johnson said it was his father who helped him out 
the most. "But I think you have to inspire yourself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his goals were to own his own basketball team, have more children and 
travel around the world.

 "I think he's great," said Bobby Marquette, 9. "It's nice to know that he 
cares about other people, not just himself."

 "Magic is the epitome of what winning is all about, of making other people 
around you better and always keeping a smile on your face," Gary Arthur, 40, 
said as he sat on the floor with his three children, Ryah Sky, 6, Aria Star, 5, 
and Morea Light, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur clutched two T-shirts that he had brought as presents for Johnson and 
his wife, Cookie. "A picture with Magic, that would make a huge moment in my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Jensen Gray clutched a piece of paper headed "Dear Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to ask him what was it like to be HIV-positive and how are you 
doing," the youngster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another admirer gave Johnson flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur was equally enthusiastic. "I love the guy. I love what he does, what he 
stands for, the influence he's had on my life," he said. "He rises to the top; 
he makes the most of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur even got to ask his hero how he managed to inspire so many. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to making anybody better is first you gotta get out of yourself and 
into somebody else, because all of us are into ourselves so much," Johnson 
said. "I always want to see somebody else happy. My mom was the social 
butterfly in Michigan. If there was somebody sick two blocks down, she was the 
one cooking for them. I owe it all to my mother."

 Johnson was in town at the invitation of his longtime friend and City Council 
candidate Mel Owens. Earlier this week, the city was in an uproar over flyers 
distributed by Owens' campaign saying that Johnson's speech would be followed 
by a $90-per-person political fund-raiser hosted by an area gallery. In 
response to protests from school officials, Owens canceled the fund-raiser so 
the high school assembly could proceed without involving the Laguna Beach 
Unified School District in what some might consider a political event. 
</P>
<P>
 But a private reception was still held at the gallery after the speech, and 
though there was no charge, only friends of Owens and Johnson were allowed 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 As Johnson left the high school gym to attend the reception, he was mobbed by 
eager young fans clamoring for autographs and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You young people dream," was his final message, "because before you can 
become what it is you want to . . . you have to dream it. Education is the key, 
especially now."

DANCE A WRONG STEP FOR MEMBER OF DRILL TEAM; EDUCATION: STUDENT MISSES 
COMPETITION TO ATTEND IRVINE HIGH HOMECOMING AFFAIR.

 When Irvine High School senior Jennifer Hampton arrived for drill team 
practice this week, she was kicked off the team and off campus. Her offense: 
she had attended the homecoming dance -- held simultaneously with a drill team 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first unexcused absence in four years of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer's father, Dennis Hampton, is battling the Irvine Unified School 
District over her ouster.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's her last year of high school," Hampton said. "How can they tell her, 
'Oh, by the way, you have to skip the homecoming dance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had tried to head off the problem by pointing out the scheduling 
conflict earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, when she arrived Monday morning, she was dismissed from the 
team in an embarrassing encounter with the coach. High school officials 
confiscated her flags and demanded that she leave the campus for the day, her 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made her a spectacle in front of the drill team," Hampton said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the same scheduling conflict happened last year, Hampton said, school 
officials promised it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton said his daughter would not comment, on advice of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine High School Principal Gail Richards said the drill team competitions 
depend on requiring students to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a decision knowing full well what the consequences were, and so she 
has been removed from the squad," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer, 17, was the only one of 53 drill team members who attended the 
homecoming dance.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine High School Band Director Bob Avzaradel could not be reached for 
comment. The superintendent of Irvine Unified School District, David E. Brown, 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun," Hampton said. "It feels 
like I'm dealing with Caesar."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; ASSEMBLY CANDIDATES IN 2 RACES TRADE BARBS

 Democratic and Republican candidates in two state Assembly races traded barbs 
on crime issues Tuesday, with each side accusing the other of lying. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Irv Pickler, seeking to unseat Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in the 
68th Assembly District, said the incumbent "fabricated" Pickler's stand on 
"three strikes and you're out" legislation in recent campaign literature.At the 
same press conference at Anaheim City Hall, Democrat Mike Metzler made 
identical charges of misrepresentation against Jim Morrissey, his Republican 
opponent in the 69th Assembly District race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats produced mailers from their opponents that contended Pickler and 
Metzler oppose Proposition 184, the "three strikes" initiative, which calls for 
substantially longer prison sentences for repeat felons. However, Pickler and 
Metzler said they support the initiative and always have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pringle is one of the most dishonest politicians in California," said 
Pickler, an Anaheim councilman. "He will say or do anything to win election." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans countered that the Democrats' endorsement of the "three 
strikes" initiative is new. Both Republican candidates said they based their 
mailers on a news report that indicated the Democrats backed a less stringent 
version of "three strikes," not the tougher Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a way to ride the 'three strikes' bandwagon without supporting 
Proposition 184," said Pringle. "(But) we are glad to have him aboard now." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler "changed his position because we hit him hard and heavy," added Mark 
Thompson, a political consultant with the Morrissey campaign. "If we are 
talking deception, the real deception is theirs."MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; BOY WOUNDED IN HEAD IN POOL HALL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old boy remained hospitalized Tuesday after being wounded by gunfire 
in a Garden Grove pool hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who withheld the boy's name, said he was hit at least once in the head 
Monday night when a man opened fire with a small-caliber handgun inside the 
Paris Billiard Cafe in the 10000 block of Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was listed in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Woods said four men in a van pulled up in front of the billiards hall 
about 8:15 p.m. Monday. Two men ran inside and one of them fired the shots with 
a semiautomatic weapon, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating the incident as gang-related, Woods said. He said 
police believe the boy was not the intended target of the attack, but 
investigators had not determined who was.

CARL'S JR. CHAIN PRESIDENT QUITS TO JOIN HARDEE'S; MANAGEMENT: THE DEPARTURE OF 
DONALD E. DOYLE FROM CKE RESTAURANTS IS ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF UPHEAVALS IN ITS 
TOP RANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Management turmoil continued at CKE Restaurants Inc. Tuesday as President 
Donald E. Doyle resigned to take the chief operating officer's job at a North 
Carolina-based hamburger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle, the chief executive who joined the Carl's Jr. chain in late 1992 as the 
hand-picked successor to Carl's Jr. founder Carl N. Karcher, will join Hardee's 
Food Systems Inc. in Raleigh, N.C., which has 4,000 restaurants in 40 states, 
on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Doyle stepped into CKE at a pivotal time in its development and made 
significant contributions," said Chairman William P. Foley II, who will serve 
as chief executive officer after Doyle leaves later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher, the 78-year-old chairman emeritus, said the company he founded more 
than a half century ago is "going to go back and build sales. . . . That's what 
we have to do. I would hope that this (resignation) means that we can go back 
to business." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been anything but business as usual for CKE Restaurants in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Doyle's future at the company mounted on Monday when CKE 
Restaurants announced that Tom Thompson, a Bay Area Carl's Jr. franchisee, had 
been appointed to the newly created post of chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Foley said that Karcher was returning to his cherished role as 
the company's television pitchman, and that the burger chain had abandoned an 
ill-fated bid to compete with major chains on price -- a strategy strongly 
advocated by Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 These decisions come nearly a year to the day when Karcher was forced out as 
chairman during a bitter board fight over the burger chain's strategic 
direction. Foley invited Karcher back as chairman emeritus in December after 
taking a controlling interest in the fast-food company and being elected to the 
top post. 
</P>
<P>
 During Doyle's 21-month tenure, Carl's Jr. struggled to reverse a lengthy 
revenue and earnings slide driven in large part by Irvine-based Taco Bell, 
which forced all fast-food restaurants to cut costs. Doyle presided over a 
corporate restructuring and helped fashion a value-oriented menu that was 
introduced early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Karcher and Doyle agreed that the fast-food company had to cut its 
operating costs, they disagreed on how to position the 650-restaurant chain 
that consumers long had known for its relatively expensive but distinctive 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped that (the value menu) would work, but, in my heart, I didn't think it 
would," Karcher said. "It turned out that it didn't fly too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Most franchisees who operate 258 of the chain's restaurants welcomed news that 
Doyle was leaving and that the chain would again emphasize quality over lower 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see the most united Carl's Jr. that you've ever seen," said 
Ed Giammarino, a San Diego County restaurant owner who on Tuesday took over 
from Thompson as the new president of the Carl's Jr. franchisee association. 
"We're going to be a real threat to the rest of this industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle, who gave notice Tuesday upon his return from a two-week vacation in 
Rome, said that Hardee's first approached him in August through an executive 
search firm. Doyle traveled to North Carolina to meet Hardee's executives and 
to Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., Hardee's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said his interest was piqued because he had once worked with Jack 
Loughery, a now-retired Hardee's executive who is credited with building the 
chain. "It's an exciting chain with a financially strong parent company, and 
it's got exciting prospects," Doyle said. In the middle of negotiations, Doyle 
and his wife, Roberta, left for Italy. "When we got to Rome, the offer from 
Hardee's was there," Doyle said. "We took two weeks to talk about it, sorting 
through the options. It wasn't an easy decision because I really like Carl's 
and the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle also acknowledged that it had been difficult to take over the reins from 
Karcher, a fast-food industry legend. "There's no question that it was a 
transition that had its fits and starts," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardee's recently reported $34 million in operating earnings and $1.28 billion 
in systemwide revenue for the quarter ended June 30. By comparison, CKE 
Restaurants reported $864,000 in net income and $105.3 million in revenue for 
its second quarter, ended Aug. 15.

 Knott's Hears Overture From Ozarks: A landowner in Branson, Mo., says he has 
talked to Knott's Berry Farm representatives about building an amusement park 
on 340 acres he owns in this Ozarks music mecca."I have talked to them, as I 
have to other interested parties, but there's nothing official yet," said 
Marvin Motley. Until now, the only Knott's venture outside Buena Park has been 
a licensing agreement that allowed the creation of Knott's Camp Snoopy at the 
huge Mall of America in Minneapolis. Knott's Berry Farm spokesman Bob Ochsner 
said Tuesday that he couldn't confirm any expansion plans.

 AIG and 20th Century Sign Deal: American International Group Inc. and 20th 
Century Industries announced the signing of definitive agreements under which 
AIG will invest an initial $216 million -- and possibly up to $432 million -- 
in 20th Century and the two insurers will embark on joint ventures to sell auto 
insurance nationally. New York-based AIG will pay $200 million for a new issue 
of convertible preferred stock, plus $16 million for warrants to buy 16 million 
shares of 20th Century common stock.At 20th Century's option, AIG could also 
buy an additional $70 million in preferred stock if 20th Century's losses from 
the Northridge earthquake -- now estimated at $815 million -- exceed $850 
million. For 20th Century, the infusion of capital rescues it from possible 
failure.

MCA EXECS TRACED TO BAY AREA FOR TALKS

 MCA's top two executives departed Tuesday for a much-ballyhooed meeting with 
senior officials from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Neither side would 
would divulge the destination, but late in the day it was learned that MCA 
Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg had registered at a 
San Francisco hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was initially set in Hawaii at the posh Halekulani Hotel on 
Waikiki Beach, but MCA canceled its reservations Friday, after a torrent of 
publicity suggested that Wasserman and Sheinberg would propose a buyback of the 
company sold to the Japanese firm in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, there was a guessing game that the meeting point could be 
anywhere from Tahiti to the Aleutian Islands, with some executives likening the 
search to that for Amelia Earhart. Sources said Matsushita proposed the meeting 
several weeks ago, apparently to deal with worsening relations with the MCA 
unit. In September, Matsushita rebuffed MCA executives who were excited about a 
proposal to join ITT Corp. and Dow Jones in a bid for NBC. But those issues 
were clouded by news reports that MCA's talented associates, Steven Spielberg 
and David Geffen, were leaving to form their own company. That exodus 
apparently has alarmed the Japanese. KATHRYN HARRIS

DOLEFUL EARNINGS REPORT DRIVES ODETICS STOCK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Odetics Inc. fell 17% Tuesday as Wall Street delivered its response 
to the company's report that net income dropped 71% for its fiscal second 
quarter, which ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's class A common stock, which carries full voting rights, closed 
at $6 a share, down $1.25 a share from Monday's close on the Nasdaq market 
system. More than 111,000 shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Odetics' stock has been volatile lately, gaining and losing similar amounts in 
a day's trading. Just last week, the price jumped 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's class B common stock, which does not carry full voting rights, 
fell $1 a share to close at $6.25 in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, after the stock market closed, the Anaheim maker of automated and 
robotic products for the computer industry said its net income fell to $51,000 
during its second three-month period, from $177,000 in last year's second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company blamed the decline on expenses associated with its expansion in 
Europe and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Odetics Chairman Joel Slutzky said the company also 
had been disappointed by slow sales of its automated equipment for television 
station operations. Many stations were studying competing systems that had been 
introduced last spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers were digesting how these new offerings fit into the total 
picture," he said. Sales of that automated equipment have risen in recent 
weeks, Slutzky said, but he wasn't sure yet if that represented a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, second-quarter revenue rose 14% to $22.7 million from $19.6 million, 
and Slutzky said he expects that earnings will rebound to previous levels by 
the end of the fiscal year and that revenue will continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street had been expecting quarterly earnings of 10 to 14 cents a share, 
instead of the 1 cent a share the company recorded, said William Gibson, an 
analyst with the Santa Barbara office of Irvine's Cruttenden & Co. brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 But with growing sales for security camera equipment and other products, 
Odetics is "in good shape" overall, he said. "They're in a position for what I 
expect will be good growth for the second half of the fiscal year."

COMMERCIAL CENTER BANK FINALLY FINDS A BUYER; ACQUISITION: FIRST BANKS INC. OF 
ST. LOUIS WILL PAY $32.5 MILLION IN CASH FOR SANTA ANA-BASED OPERATION. 
</P>

<P>
 After more than five years of searching for a buyer, Orange County's largest 
community bank finally found one Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis bank holding company has agreed to acquire CCB Bancorp. Inc. of 
Santa Ana and its principal subsidiary, Commercial Center Bank, for $32.5 
million in cash. The purchase positions First Banks Inc. of Missouri to expand 
its commercial banking operations in California. The sale could be completed 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an excellent opportunity for First Banks to enter the vibrant Orange 
County market," said James Dierberg, chairman of First Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 With this acquisition, banking analysts said, First Banks, which has a strong 
emphasis on consumer banking, could move to expand Commercial Center's business 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out-of-state banks are manifesting their interest in Orange County," said Ed 
Carpenter, chairman of Carpenter & Co., a bank consulting firm in Irvine. "At 
$32 million, it's a good price for the acquirer and could allow First Banks to 
create the largest bank headquartered in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a well-capitalized regional bank, Santa Ana-based Commercial Center 
had $310 million in assets and $261 million in deposits as of June 30. First 
Banks has about $2.7 billion in assets and 91 branches in Missouri, Illinois 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is beginning to turn around, and people from other states are 
beginning to recognize that and look for opportunities here," said Alan R. 
Holbrook, president and chief executive officer of Commercial Center, who will 
be retiring from the bank when the deal is completed. His replacement has not 
yet been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal for Orange County. We will begin to be a true community 
bank and open more branches here in Orange County," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 85 employees, Commercial Center Bank has an unusual branch network, 
with offices located throughout the state. Along with a branch and headquarters 
in Santa Ana, there are branches in San Diego, Beverly Hills, San Jose and 
Walnut Creek. However, the branches in Beverly Hills and San Diego are closing 
as part of the deal, Holbrook said. No major layoffs are planned as part of the 
sale, he said.

 After losing $6 million in 1993 on its mortgage servicing operation, which 
sends bills to borrowers and collects loan payments, Commercial Center closed 
that division last month, Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded as Westlands Bank in 1970, Commercial Center was sold in early 1984 to 
Canadian Commercial Bank of Edmonton, in Alberta, and its name was changed. But 
just a year later, the Canadian bank became that nation's first bank failure 
since 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 It went on the block in the mid-1980s, when Price Waterhouse Ltd. of Toronto, 
the court-appointed liquidator, began selling assets of the bank. C. Garth 
MacGirr, a Price Waterhouse Ltd. partner in Canada, had acted as the bank's 
chairman, but he was replaced this year by William D. Grace, who also will be 
retiring when the acquisition is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Canadian operators of the bank focused on completing a deal in 
1994, hiring a Wall Street investment bank to solicit bids, mainly from 
out-of-state banks. Commercial Center Bank at a Glance

STATE OF THE ART AGREES TO BUY MANZANITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Accounting software developer State of the Art Inc., seeking access to the 
small business market, said Tuesday that it has reached a tentative agreement 
to buy a Northern California company in a stock swap worth $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company said it hopes to complete the acquisition of Manzanita 
Software Systems in Roseville, which develops financial management software for 
small business, by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 State of the Art plans to operate Manzanita as a subsidiary with all 81 
employees. The acquisition is not expected to affect State of the Art's 250 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the move would help State of the Art maintain its reputation as 
a strong software company. The acquisition also could soften the blow of 
disappointing third-quarter results, which the company also announced late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 State of the Art earned $531,000, or 6 cents a share, for the third quarter, a 
59% drop from $1.3 million, or 15 cents a share, earned in last year's third 
quarter. Revenue for the quarter increased 3% to $6.9 million from $6.7 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings for the first nine months fell 51% to $1.9 million, or 21 cents a 
share, from $3.9 million, or 43 cents a share, for the year-earlier period. 
Revenue grew slightly to $20.5 million from $19.4 million. ROSS KERBER

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOTIVE; ONE-FOURTH OF EACH DOLLAR SPENT AT O.C. STORES IS FOR 
VEHICLES, UPKEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite thick, brown air and the fact that the phrase "automobile travel" is 
an oxymoron most weekdays, the motor vehicle still is king in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how important our cars, pickups and sports utility vehicles are to us is 
spelled out in dollars and cents in the latest annual taxable sales report from 
the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The short form: We spend more money on cars than on food, drink, clothes or 
anything else that gets taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 25 cents of every dollar spent in retail stores in Orange County last 
year was spent on motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to 10 cents in Los Angeles County and 12 cents in Riverside 
County. But both San Diego County, where 26 cents of each retail store dollar 
is spent on vehicles and automotive-related purchases, and San Bernardino, at 
31 cents on the dollar, outpace Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state tax collection board's annual report for 1993, Orange 
County new-car dealers recorded $2.1 billion in taxable sales, and used-car 
dealers reported $221 million more in retail business. That's $2.3 billion 
spent in the county to buy cars, parts and equipment from the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Orange County residents -- and passersby who needed gas or 
repairs -- spent $1.3 billion on their cars at service stations and $258 
million more in auto-parts stores. 
</P>
<P>
 That means a grand total of $3.9 billion was spent in the county last year on 
cars and trucks -- more than was spent on any other single category of goods. 
The next highest total was $2.9 billion spent in general merchandise stores -- 
chiefly department and drugstores.

 Orange National Bank: The bank said Tuesday that it has instituted a program 
to help its business customers battle bad-check writers by teaming up with the 
district attorney's Bad Check Restitution program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange-based bank will send information to each of its business banking

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: WHEN A CRUSH IS THE PRIMER FOR LOVE, THE LIFE 
LESSONS CAN BE REWARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was in ninth grade, I had a crush on a gorgeous senior football player. 
As I made my way to science class each day, I would usually pass him in the 
hall. Sometimes he'd notice me and smile, which sent me into a tailspin for at 
least an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Though crushes seem anything but natural when they cause our breathing to 
become uneven and our legs to shake, they are actually a normal part of growing 
up, says Kimberlee Hancock, a licensed marriage, family and child counselor 
with KAH & Associates in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have a crush, we admire someone for whatever positive characteristics 
we believe the person has," she says. "It's not unusual to have a crush on an 
older person, such as a teacher or upper classmates. Crushes on someone very 
different are also common. A bookworm may find someone who walks on the wild 
side intriguing and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crushes are safe and generally not known, which means there's no fear of 
rejection," Hancock says. 
</P>
<P>
 As we age, crushes change in tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are young, we often don't act on the crushes. But once we reach high 
school, we may start to verbalize our feelings and make a move of some sort," 
Hancock says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they occur at a time when we are changing so rapidly, high school 
crushes carry a lot of emotional weight, she says. They are our first 
experiences with life outside of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt it's high school crushes that often lead us years later to class 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you leave school, life as it was is never the same," Hancock says. "When 
we think about crushes, it reminds us of that special time. Many of us go to 
reunions to rekindle those memories. We also go back genuinely curious to see 
what happened to someone we had a crush on." 
</P>
<P>
 At high school reunions, it's not uncommon for people to confess their 
crushes. Telling all can sometimes be therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a person confesses, it takes the energy and emotion out of the crush and 
gives a sense of closure," Hancock says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the person who didn't know about the crush, it can be flattering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry, who is single, says she kept a low profile in high school and didn't 
think she was very memorable. Since then, the 48-year-old self-employed Orange 
word processor has been shocked to hear how many people had crushes on her in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "At my 20th reunion, a former classmate came up to me and said that he and 
four other men would leave their wives for me; they all had big crushes on me 
in high school. My first reaction was, 'Why didn't you tell me then?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at her 30th reunion, Sherry was approached by a classmate who 
recalled seeing her walk in the door the first day of seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he remembers thinking, there she is, and he's had a crush on me ever 
since," she says. "We're going out for dinner after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual that people don't tell one another about crushes in high 
school, says Hancock. "Because of cliques and the way rumors get started, high 
school isn't a safe place to reveal crushes," she says. "Once you are out of 
school, you don't have to see these people on a day-to-day basis, so it's much 
safer to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding out that someone you had a crush on felt the same way can be a 
satisfying experience. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carrol, 48, who's single, recently went to her 30th reunion, she talked 
with a man she'd had a crush on during her junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on the football team and sat next to me in English class," says the 
Tustin graphic designer. "I thought he was really cute and an easy-going guy. I 
tried to flirt by making all kinds of eye contact, but he didn't seem to know I 
was alive -- until I started dating a guy from another school. When I walked 
into class with my new boyfriend's ring around my neck, he was shocked and 
began to pay more attention to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When she saw him at their recent reunion, they reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really nice to know that he remembered me and thought I was attractive 
then and now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 While some people like to visit reunions to see the person they had a crush 
on, others prefer memory to reality. Greg, 41, a married Orange County 
physician, doesn't want to see the girl he had a crush on in junior high. Part 
of the girl's allure, he says, was the fact that she came from the "wrong side 
of the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was from a community of bikers that lived in our area," he says. "It was 
exciting to think I liked her, especially since she was so different from me 
and ran around with the party crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 When Greg's dad saw him with her one night, though, he forbid him to see her. 
He and his family soon moved from the area, and he never saw her again. 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades I was mad that he had forbidden me to see her," he says. "It 
wasn't until years later that I understood why. Getting me away from that crowd 
was the best thing for me. Today that particular group of people have major 
drug and marital problems. The last I heard, things hadn't worked out very well 
for her. I prefer to keep my idealized image of her in the eighth grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg's best memories are of his earlier crushes. "I really miss the innocence 
and the warm, comfortable, snugly feeling of those young crushes," he says, 
recalling his first crush in third grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still remember her name. She had a long, strawberry blond ponytail. 
Unfortunately, little girls at the time were more enthralled with horses and 
she didn't notice me, even though I chased her and pulled on her ponytail." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg's most memorable crush was the one he had on his fifth-grade teacher. "I 
will never forget her," he says. "She was a very pretty brunette woman with a 
Southern accent. Her soft voice and warm hugs were very comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 There is something special about those early crushes, agrees Hancock. "It's 
very comforting to have known someone when you were 10 years old and played 
with frogs together," she says. "That kind of comfort starts to disappear in 
high school and diminishes as we age. Life becomes more fragmented and 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, it's very special when childhood friends eventually get 
together in a relationship, Hancock says. "That history creates a very special 
bond." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra and Steve Link know about this. In the '50s, they knew each other in 
seventh and eighth grade when they took dancing together and raised a 4-H 
steer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a huge crush on her," says Steve Link, 53, who is manager of the 
Carlsbad Convention and Visitor's Bureau. "I rode her home on the handlebars of 
my bike after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Fate intervened, though. After eighth grade, Sandra suddenly moved to Los 
Angeles to attend an all-girls boarding school to study to become a nun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sad to never hear from her again," Steve says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, when Steve was planning to marry someone else, he was 
surprised to hear that Sandra had also married. Then he didn't hear about her 
again until a few years after he left his wife of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1990, I was living in Oceanside and began to wonder whatever happened to 
her," he says. "I had saved the pictures of us back then, including one with 
our steer, and I thought it would be fun to share them with her." 
</P>
<P>
 He found her, and they met one morning. She had also recently divorced after 
20 years. Over the next 2 1/2 years, they dated, and last December they 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your first crush is very powerful. When I look at Steve, I still see a 
12-year-old boy, not the 53-year-old man he has become," says Sandra Link, 53, 
who works in a Vista manufacturing plant teaching English as a second language 
and Spanish literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve really is the love of my life," Sandra says. "Although I'm grateful we 
finally found one another, I just wish we hadn't lost all those years." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve says he feels the same way. "We should have been together the whole 
time," he says. "When we got back together, it was like we hadn't skipped a 
beat since school."

DUET FOR PIANO AND PC; IN A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE, O.C. MUSICIANS TEACH HOW 
TO MOVE IN HARMONY FOR HEALTH

 Nina Scolnik's hands move with grace and precision across the grand piano 
keyboard in her living room. Then she abandons Chopin and slides off the piano 
bench to settle onto a chair at her dining table, where a computer keyboard 
awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 There she types as if she were playing an etude, then stops to explain the 
connection she sees: 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're a butcher, court stenographer, landscaper, concert pianist or 
computer operator, if you want to cure aching fingers, hands, arms and back, 
you needn't resort to splints, wrist rests, stretching exercises or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Just learn the basic, natural movements that successful pianists have relied 
on for centuries, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not with the piano, the computer, the cash register or the meat 
cleaver, says Scolnik, 41, a piano faculty member at UC Irvine. "The problem is 
with the way people move. The finger, the hand, the arm must move as a unit." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the basic idea of a controversial message emanating from a Brooklyn 
woman who has taught piano for 50 years. During that time, Dorothy Taubman has 
spawned thousands of disciples of the Taubman method, known largely within the 
U.S. piano community. "Blaming the instrument," says Taubman, 76, "is like 
saying that writer's cramp is caused by the pencil." Or the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Taubman and her colleagues, including Scolnik, are launching a nationwide 
business to transfer what they know to a realm broader than pianists, flutists 
or violinists who suffer from what's called repetitive stress injury or RSI. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at teaching people how to use computers with techniques previously 
reserved for musical instruments, the company offers workshops to retrain 
injured workers and to train those who want to prevent injuries.

 As the RSI problem has mushroomed to afflict everyone from secretaries to 
executives with hurting muscles, tendons and nerves, Taubman and her associates 
have been approached on occasion by businesses wanting to see if the technique 
could help. But only recently has Taubman's institute decided to focus on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people out there in trouble (who) can't get help, and this 
little lady has figured it all out -- what the medical profession has not 
figured out," says Taubman Institute Executive Director Enid Stettner, who 
lives in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 To initially spread the word, Taubman is relying on two-dozen faculty members 
who teach at her institute, held each summer at Amherst College in 
Massachusetts. During the past three decades, thousands have studied there and 
gone on to teach thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 Key among them is Scolnik, the principal West Coast advocate of Taubman's 
methods. Since the late 1970s, she has been associated with Taubman and has 
introduced many of her own students to the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Taubman consulting firm starts up, to their dismay, one of Scolnik's 
former UC Irvine piano students, Greg Dempster of Laguna Beach, has also begun 
what he bills as the first company "in the country to adapt this approach to 
the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1983 to early this year, Dempster studied with Scolnik, who introduced 
him to Taubman's ideas. "At first I thought this was really snake oil, that 
this was from Mars," says Dempster, 34, who completed his undergraduate and 
master's work with Scolnik. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon Dempster, who had been injured from his earlier technique, became a 
believer. For a half-dozen summers, he studied with Taubman at Amherst and was 
a teaching assistant at the institute. He says, "My playing has grown by leaps 
and bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 As he was teaching one of his own students who worked as a computer operator, 
Dempster says, "it became obvious that this applied quite directly to computer 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past few months, Dempster put together a staff including other 
Taubman devotees and has already been offering seminars and making a pitch to 
intrigued representatives of Southern California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dempster knows that the Taubman Institute is miffed with him, he 
praises Taubman's genius. "The relationships she was able to figure out and 
observe in pianists are unparalleled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Stettner says that it is not that difficult for someone fully 
trained in the technique to teach it as a preventive approach. But she says "to 
cure somebody who is injured, you need great knowledge, and we have that 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Stettner and Dempster do agree, however, on Taubman's tenet that moving 
correctly is therapeutic and pain-relieving. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempster makes this exact point at a seminar in a salon at the Irvine Hyatt 
Regency. He is speaking to a small gathering, including representatives from 
Orange County businesses interested in this new tactic to combat RSI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Correct movement minimizes effort, fatigue," he says. "If you are not moving 
correctly, there is a level of fatigue you are operating under." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he cites the problem of hitting the keys too hard. "Anybody 
have an idea of the weight it takes to displace a computer key? It's about a 
gram or gram and a half. Your forearm weighs about 15 pounds. So this is always 
a winning battle." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dempster's request, his seminar students stand with hands and arms by their 
sides. Then he outlines another of Taubman's main ideas. "Notice how your hands 
hang. No two are alike. Everybody's hand will look different on the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural profile of the wrist, at rest, at your side -- that is more or 
less the profile it should have when it's moving or performing work. Anytime 
you distort that, so that any of the joint structure is out of the mid-range 
arc of motion, you develop problems." 
</P>
<P>
 That means avoid curling your fingers, avoid twisting your hands into 
positions that would mimic actor Charlie Chaplin's famous splayed feet antics 
and avoid stretching your fingers to reach unnaturally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To trouble-shoot for these tendencies in his students, Dempster asks one of 
them, Michael F. McCrackin, Fluor Daniel's safety manager at its Irvine 
facility, to sit before a computer keyboard. McCrackin begins to type. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempster spots a problem and coaches him to keep his hands in line with their 
natural curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, McCrackin said, his company saw there was a problem with 
RSI -- that typing on a computer is different from using a typewriter. "We 
started throwing things at the problem -- wrist rests, articulated keyboard 
platforms. But we didn't address how people were using the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ergonomic solutions have been insufficient, he said. And it's not enough, he 
said, to tell someone to align the body properly, to keep the wrists relatively 
straight or to take frequent breaks. Many people, he said, must be completely 
retrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,500 Irvine-based employees with the international engineering firm, 
he said he expects about 300 to 400 fall into the "high risk" category -- those 
needing retraining to cure an existing RSI problem or to prevent one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty excited by this whole concept. I'm impressed by the level of 
detail," he said. Even basic training, he said, would be beneficial. "You don't 
need to know how a car works to learn to drive it, to get the proper 
instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To explain what she knows in great detail, Taubman is writing a book and, even 
sooner, will release instructional tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Piano Quarterly, Taubman once said: "I do not regard 
my work as a 'method' or even a 'system.' Rather it is a set of strategies 
which, I hope, can help establish the foundation for a science of the movement 
of the fingers, hand and arm." 
</P>
<P>
 The test of that, she said, will be if "it can be applied successfully to a 
wide variety of problems and that it can be learned and used by others." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Taubman has by no means been embraced by the musical establishment. In 
introducing a 1992 interview with her, the journal California Music Teacher 
called her "perhaps the most controversial figure in piano pedagogy today." The 
editor's note went on to say that Taubman, "after being largely ignored. . .has 
in recent years won a grudging recognition for her successful treatment of 
injured pianists who had exhausted all known methods of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a documentary video of her summer institute, "Choreography of the Hands," 
musician after musician, including prominent pianists, testify how Taubman 
helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 One flutist, whose right hand was severely troubled before she found relief in 
Taubman's teaching, tells the story of how a physician "suggested I find a new 
profession and start over." And, Taubman says, the orthopedist "wanted to break 
every bone in her hand and reset it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Garry S. Brody, medical director of the Hand Rehabilitation 
Center at USC University Hospital, says: "Nothing else works. And you have to 
do surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he says much is still unknown about RSI. "We're all struggling to 
know, No. 1, what's really behind all this and, No. 2, how to prevent it and 
how to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Taubman approach goes, he says until scientific studies are done 
to verify the anecdotal claims, skepticism is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say a couple of months of trial won't do any harm. But if after a 
month or two you still have the problem, you'd better look for a more 
conventional treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, he adds: "Nobody ever died from a carpal tunnel problem. It's not 
a crippling disease. The problem is the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 To find what common ground might exist with medicine, music and the Taubman 
technique, an Oakland occupational health physician is starting a research 
project on injured pianists. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Pereira 45, is undertaking the work as part of degree studies at UC 
Berkeley's School of Public Health. A pianist since age 7, he has studied with 
Scolnik and Taubman. While living in Orange County and working as a physician 
in the 1980s, he completed a bachelor's in music with Scolnik at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do something to get this information more available to the 
mainstream in the medical community," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I know of physiology, the ideas she is saying make complete sense. 
The motions involved in piano-playing are often invisible. Dorothy's genius was 
figuring them out and how they connect with muscles and movement. It was like 
analyzing a wave form, and she broke it all down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In individual lessons with students, Scolnik breaks it all down, too. 
</P>
<P>
 At a lesson at Scolnik's home, Rebecca Bogart is playing a rapidly paced 
piece, Moszkowski's No. 6 in F major. Scolnik listens intently. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when Bogart, now 33, was living in the Bay Area, she suffered from 
acute tendinitis. "I experienced flaming sharp pains on the underside of both 
arms," she said. "The onset was dramatic and immediate, right after a concert, 
when I was lifting some boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years she tried medical treatment, painkillers and resting. She 
abandoned her new Steinway for her students to play. Not until she went to the 
Taubman summer institute did she find relief -- so much so that she moved to 
Laguna Niguel to be close enough to take weekly lessons from Scolnik. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bogart finishes the piece, Scolnik tells her: "On your A-flat you're 
letting your wrist fall." Bogart nods. Scolnik says, "We're talking very subtle 
stuff here." 
</P>
<P>
 And she says, "This is all so much easier to do right on a computer. There is 
much less involved." For one thing, she says, "you don't have to play chords." 
Preventing Repetitive Stress 
</P>
<P>
 The study of ergonomics -- how people work -- shows hand-arm alignment is at 
the center of keyboard repetitive stress injuries (RSI). Misalignment causes 
muscles to become overworked, causing stress and fatigue in the hands and arms. 
In retraining, piano and computer keyboard users learn how to move without 
causing the injuries. Signs of RSI 
</P>
<P>
 Repetitive stress injuries can have a variety of symptoms including muscle 
fatigue and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Puffy skin surface: General sign of stressed or overworked muscle group that 
flexes fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ganglions: Small cysts beneath skin form as result of stressed muscles that 
flex fingers and hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finger numbness: May be caused by inflammation of nerves in wrist when 
muscle that extends wrist rests on hard surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elbow swelling: Could indicate twisting and resulting stress of muscle that 
rotates wrist when arm is palm down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrist pain: Often caused by inflamed muscles constricting nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forearm ache: Usually indicates inflamed biceps which contracts arm and 
moves hand side to side. Top Causes of Injury 
</P>
<P>
 The most common poor keyboard postures cause the wrist joint to move beyond 
its range of motion, which leads to physical problems. The three most common 
incorrect keyboarding practices and their symptoms: 
</P>
<P>
 * Twisting: Long muscles in arms forced to stretch around the elbow, which 
stresses muscles in hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Elbow inflammation, throbbing in forearm, loss of dexterity of 
little and ring fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-curled fingers: Continuously flexed muscles that contract and extend 
wrist cause nerve compression in wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Pain in wrist or forearm; tingling or numbness in fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dropped wrists: Tendons press against nerves in wrist area, weakening the 
thumb, index and ring fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Numbness, tingling in fingers at night; swelling of wrist and/or 
thumb joint. Posture Perfect 
</P>
<P>
 Computer desks and keyboards can be equipped to ensure good posture and proper 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arm at 90-degree angle 
</P>
<P>
 * Keyboard at elbow height 
</P>
<P>
 * Back straight 
</P>
<P>
 * Thighs, forearms parallel with floor Ergonomic Equipment 
</P>
<P>
 * Padded wrist rests 
</P>
<P>
 * Cushioned keys 
</P>
<P>
 * Elbow rests 
</P>
<P>
 * Adjustable computer table 
</P>
<P>
 * Sliding keyboard holder 
</P>
<P>
 * Foot rest Futuristic Typing 
</P>
<P>
 New keyboards are designed to encourage good typing posture. This one, for 
example, splits in half and has built-in padded wrist rests, encouraging a 
naturally relaxed position of fingers, hands and wrists. Typing Test 
</P>
<P>
 * Score your knowledge of good keyboard technique with these true-or-false 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Only the fingers should move. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Shoulders should be relaxed and dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Keys must be pushed to bottom of stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Wrists should rest on edge of table or on wrist pad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Answers 
</P>
<P>
 1. False: Entire arm should move and get involved in the process. The elbow 
should act as a stable hinge supporting the forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 2. False: Shoulders should be relaxed, but dropped shoulders cause the long 
tendons to hold the arm in place, stressing the elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 3. False: Keystroke is complete through the top two-thirds of the motion. 
Finger muscles should be at rest at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 4. False: Resting the wrist on table edge can cause nerve damage. Use pads as 
guides for proper alignment, not as pillows.

COURT OF FAST RESORT; HIGH SCHOOL'S MOCK JURY SELECTION TAKES CUES FROM SIMPSON 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Lance Ito certainly would have been frustrated by the teen attorneys' 
lack of courtroom savvy. But he would have been thrilled by their speed.  
</P>
<P>
 Twelve jurors and two alternates picked in the time it would take to dissect a 
frog. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks after beginning jury selection, the real attorneys in the O.J. 
Simpson murder trial are still at it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's second-most-scrutinized court proceeding, would-be barristers at 
James Monroe High School in North Hills grilled would-be jurors about their 
ability to rule fairly in the highly publicized trial. If Simpson's future 
wasn't on the line, good grades were -- and the questioning was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stated that you thought O.J. Simpson was a good man and incapable of 
committing such a crime. Why?" shot prosecutor Kristi Harty, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," 16-year-old potential juror Steve Ross replied sheepishly, "he looks 
like a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 To explore one of the least-understood aspects of a criminal trial, students 
in the school's Law and Government Magnet program were mimicking the jury 
selection process currently taking place at the Criminal Courts Building in 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet program's course work ranges from criminal forensics to politics 
and often features guest seminars by real-life attorneys and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, as an appropriately somber "Judge" Bill Hence (a criminal law 
teacher who is awaiting the results of his own bar exam) looked on, attorneys 
-- wearing chic business dresses and three-piece suits but still battling acne 
-- examined and cross-examined potential jurors who had to be home at 10 on 
school nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential jurors had already filled out an abridged version of the Simpson 
jury questionnaire, and both defense and prosecution were poised to pounce on 
any bias in the surveys that went against their case. 
</P>
<P>
 You want unbiased jurors, said prosecutor Amy Messigian, 14, as long as they 
are a little more unbiased toward your side. 
</P>
<P>
 Would your being a University of Southern California football fan get in the 
way of convicting heroic alumnus Simpson, Harty asked one juror. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, Mr. Simpson played before I was born," the youthful juror 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Antonio Moore and Kaz Gohlke could hardly wait to dismiss 
one juror who felt Simpson's real defense team was "kissing up" to Judge Ito by 
constantly referring to him as "Your Honor" and saying "please and thank you" 
so often. 
</P>
<P>
 If certain moments were refreshingly free of legal machinations -- and even 
had Judge Hence fighting a grin -- many of the questions struck at the heart of 
the case and its possible social implications. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latina juror was asked if the Los Angeles riots of 1992 had altered her 
attitudes toward African Americans. Another was asked a similar question after 
noting on her questionnaire that she had once been followed by a black man. And 
the prosecution especially sought out those with a strong belief in the 
reliability of DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the real trial has taken on an air of sensationalism and involves two 
grisly slayings, it is also perfect for such a mock-jury selection, said 
instructor Mark Elinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the one time we've had the opportunity to deal with a case everyone is 
familiar with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that might be an overstatement. One of the would-be jurors set off a 
flurry of giggles when he conceded that he had no idea who O.J. Simpson is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not much of a football fan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * DNA TEST: Judge finds no proof that evidence delays were intentional. A1 
</P>
<P>
 * THE SPIN: Ito fits the Deukmejian judicial mold. B8

SUBWAY PLAN FOR VALLEY WINS BACKING OF COUNCIL; TRANSPORTATION: MEMBERS VOTE TO 
SUPPORT A SUBTERRANEAN ROUTE INSTEAD OF AN ELEVATED LINE DOWN THE VENTURA 
FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstering the case for underground transit across the San Fernando Valley, 
the Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to support a subway system rather 
than an elevated line down the Ventura Freeway for a new rail project to be 
built in the coming century. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of several Valley council members, the council reaffirmed 
the position it adopted five years ago in favor of a mostly subterranean line 
paralleling Burbank and Chandler boulevards. The decision, on an 11-1 vote, 
deals a blow to those hoping the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will 
select an aboveground route when the MTA board meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention in the fractious debate now focuses squarely on Mayor Richard 
Riordan, an MTA director who also appoints three others to the agency's 
13-member board. As mayor, Riordan has not committed himself to either option, 
although he backed a monorail system over the Ventura Freeway during his 
election campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of an elevated system called on Riordan to stand by his previous 
endorsement, despite increasing pressure on the mayor from Valley homeowner and 
civic organizations to join them in supporting the subway proposal. An aide to 
county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the Ventura Freeway alignment's most vocal 
advocate, dismissed Tuesday's City Council vote as a kowtow to powerful subway 
construction interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a reaffirmation of an earlier position they had taken to maintain 
the transit industry complex's preference for a subway system," said Habib 
Balian, Antonovich's transportation deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Antonovich has pressed the case before Riordan for a monorail 
system, the choice of Valley voters in a 1990 advisory ballot measure. On the 
other side, Supervisor Ed Edelman is scheduled to meet with the mayor today to 
lobby for a Valley extension of the Metro Red Line subway from Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully he'll be receptive to my arguments," Edelman said Tuesday. "I'm 
going to be armed with an 11-1 vote of the council. And I'm going to be armed 
with the report of the transportation department of the city," which 
recommended the Burbank-Chandler alternative Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded that the route would offer the best opportunity to connect 
passengers with bus lines, serve heavily frequented areas and provide a backup 
transportation corridor if the Ventura Freeway were damaged in an earthquake or 
other natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich criticized the report Tuesday, calling it "a document written by 
the subway proponents and not engineers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Valley council members cited the report in persuading their 
colleagues to vote for the subway option Tuesday. But with greater urgency they 
appealed to the council to end debate and make a decision, warning that the 
east-west rail line could lose its claim on public transportation dollars if 
even the appearance of official disunity continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical vote. If this alignment is not chosen (now), the San 
Fernando Valley will lose all funding" for a rail line, Councilman Marvin 
Braude warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone dissenting vote was cast by council President John Ferraro, who said 
the costs of the two routes had not been studied thoroughly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously absent when Ferraro called for the vote was Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, one of Riordan's appointees on the MTA board. Observers in the Valley 
rail debate are watching for a signal from Alatorre, who in the past voted for 
the Ventura Freeway alignment but who said he is now neutral on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after he and his aides conferred briefly with Antonovich's deputy, 
Alatorre disappeared from the council chamber as discussion began on the rail 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be reached for comment afterward. A spokeswoman said he remains 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson abstained from voting, saying he has not determined 
which route or technology is better. Serious questions about the safety and 
feasibility of a subway remain, he said, especially after the recent spate of 
tunneling problems beneath Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want a repeat of the Hollywood problems," he said. "I'm keeping my 
options open."

ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; CANDIDATES NEAR EVEN IN FUND RAISING; 
DESPITE CURRENT PARITY, DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT BEILENSON HAS RAISED LESS THAN 
HALF OF OPPONENT SYBERT'S TOTAL FOR PAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As their hotly contested congressional race enters its final, three-week 
stretch, U. S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and his GOP 
challenger, Richard Sybert, are nearly matching each other dollar for dollar in 
campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports released Tuesday show that the Beilenson campaign had 
$207,593 on hand as of Sept. 30, while Sybert had $203,840. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this parity, however, the reports show Sybert amassed a campaign war 
chest this year of $662,000, of which $421,000 consisted of personal loans made 
by the candidate to his campaign. With receipts this year of $275,000, 
Beilenson has raised less than half what Sybert raised during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two men met in a debate Tuesday night before a crowd of about 
450 at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, clashing over their finances 
and other issues: proposals to limit the terms of elected officials, 
Proposition 187 -- the anti-illegal immigration initiative -- and whether the 
federal government should pay for abortions for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert praised term limits as the best way to get rid of "career politicians," 
while Beilenson opposed them, saying such limits would increase the power of 
entrenched lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson opposed Proposition 187 as a "naive attempt" to deal with 
immigration problems, while Sybert said he supports it as necessary to laying 
the legal groundwork to challenge existing federal laws and practices, 
including the Supreme Court ruling that requires states to educate the children 
of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said he believes the government has no role to play in abortion, 
including financing those of the poor, while Beilenson said it would be unfair 
to deny low-income women the right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert attacked Beilenson as an ally of President Clinton. "If you like the 
Clinton Administration, don't vote for me," he said, insisting that Beilenson's 
attempt to cultivate an image as an independent does not square with his record 
of voting 90% of the time with the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson replied that if anyone asked Republican members of the House of 
Representatives to identify the most independent, nonpartisan and fair member 
of Congress, "I'll bet you $10,000 that 80% of them will name me." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, was virtually 
unknown in the 24th District until he began to wage his campaign to unseat 
Beilenson last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a steady stream of campaign literature issued during the GOP primary 
in June and with his financial boost from personal loans, Sybert -- who says 
his personal financial firepower is self-made -- has made his name known. He 
has begun to establish himself to such an extent that Beilenson is 
acknowledging that he has a tough fight on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, 61, is shooting for his 10th term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance reports filed this week provided the backdrop for some of the 
bitterest remarks in Tuesday's debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson called Sybert's acceptance of contributions from political action 
committees, or PACs, "the most profound difference" between the two men.  
</P>
<P>
 Sybert reported that he received nearly $40,000 from industry-related 
political action committees, which Beilenson contended shows that Sybert is 
already beholden to special interests "and he's not even in Congress yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson has for many years refused to take campaign contributions from 
political action committees, entities that usually represent special interests. 
Such contributions are ethically tainted and made only to influence 
congressional votes, Beilenson has charged. Thus, the congressman proudly 
claims to be part of a minuscule group of independent-minded members in 
Congress who refuse to take such contributions, and the campaign report he just 
filed for the period July 1 through Sept. 30 reflects that total abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger, however, has said his receipt of such money is a good sign. 
The PACs represent significant business interests in the 24th District, which 
-- through their contributions to him -- are symbolically casting a vote of 
confidence in his ability to spur economic growth, Sybert has argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every major employer in this area is helping me and not him. Why? Because he 
doesn't represent their interest," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sybert report shows contributions from three oil company PACs (the UNOCAL 
Political Awareness Fund, the ARCO PAC, and the Chevron Employees PAC) and 
several food industry-related organizations (the National Cattlemen's Assn. 
PAC, the Food Marketing Institute PAC, the American Meat Assn. PAC, and the 
National Restaurant Assn. PAC). 
</P>
<P>
 He also received money from PACs run by the Los Angeles city police union and 
by Mayor Richard Riordan's former law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of individual contributions, Sybert got money from six attorneys from 
the law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, where the challenger had 
practiced business law before becoming the director of Wilson's office of 
planning and research. Galpin Ford owner Bert Boeckmann ($1,000) and his wife, 
Jane, the editor of Valley Magazine ($500), and attorney David Fleming, former 
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. chairman ($500), also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, in an interview with The Times, heatedly denied that his own 
contributors have ever lobbied him to help them with their financial or 
political needs. "Almost everybody who gives me money," Beilenson said, "is a 
personal friend. . . . No, they don't lobby me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also acknowledged that he is still heavily dependent on campaign 
contributions from Westside residents. Beilenson represented an almost 
exclusively Westside district before he decided to run for the San Fernando 
Valley-based 24th District rather than fight with U. S. Rep. Henry Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles) over the only Westside-based congressional district left after 
the 1992 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to Beilenson were television producer Norman Lear ($1,000), 
former Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus ($300), and the politically 
active husband-wife legal team of Ben Reznik and Janice Kamenir-Reznik ($1,000 
each).

MURDER TRIAL OPENS WITH 911 RECORDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court hearing in the murder case against Jeffrey D. Peitz opened Tuesday 
with the playing of a dramatic 911 tape in which Peitz told an operator that an 
armed intruder had just killed his wife in the living room of the couple's 
Palmdale home. 
</P>
<P>
 "A black guy came in and shot her in the head," Peitz is heard saying on the 
tape in an emotional voice. "I came down and she was covered with blood." 
</P>
<P>
 But eight days after the Aug. 12 slaying, it was Peitz himself who was 
arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife, Teri, a 37-year-old Neighborhood 
Watch activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Peitz, a 38-year-old postal worker, had told investigators that he 
believed his wife was slain because of her crime-fighting work. He identified 
the killer as a man that Teri Peitz and other Neighborhood Watch members had 
confronted, saying that he was living as an illegal squatter in a vacant house. 
</P>
<P>
 But sheriff's investigators decided that Peitz's account was a cover-up after 
the African American man named by Peitz proved he was in Michigan at the time 
of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing, scheduled to continue today in Antelope 
Municipal Court, a prosecutor is trying to persuade a judge to order Peitz to 
stand trial on the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 911 tape, Peitz is heard at one point urging his wife to "Wake up! Wake 
up!" But minutes later, when the operator asks Peitz to administer 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to his wife, Peitz is heard to respond: "I know 
she's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 He later told investigators that the shooting occurred while he was upstairs 
folding laundry, and his wife was downstairs, watching her favorite television 
show, "COPS." Jeffrey Peitz said he heard two "pops," then hurried downstairs 
in time to see a black man leaving through the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's hearing, Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Spaulding, the first officer to 
enter the house after the 911 call, said he saw Peitz kneeling beside his 
wife's body. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spaulding said Peitz was not crying and did not look to him like a man 
whose wife had just been killed. He "just didn't look upset enough to me," the 
deputy testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the hearing, James Thomas Shaw, whom Peitz had identified as the 
killer, testified that he flew to Lansing, Mich., the morning of Aug. 12 to 
spend the weekend with relatives. The slaying occurred that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw produced his airline ticket receipts and family photographs taken during 
that weekend as proof he was out of the state when the killing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 He also testified that he had been involved in a financial dispute with the 
owners of the residence he was occupying and that he returned from Michigan to 
find himself locked out. 
</P>
<P>
 But he denied that he had threatened to harm the Peitz family or other 
neighbors who had put him under surveillance. "I didn't threaten to kill 
anyone," Shaw testified. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that he knew Jeffrey Peitz only as a man who once tried to "peep" 
inside his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz's 17-year-old daughter, Michelle Lee Peitz, testified that she was out 
on a date with her boyfriend when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her parents appeared to have a happy marriage and never engaged in 
physical fights or loud arguments. But after further questioning by attorneys, 
she also acknowledged that her parents underwent marriage counseling two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Michelle testified that her mother learned earlier this year that Peitz 
was involved in an extramarital affair. Her father promised the affair was 
over, and her mother forgave him, the teen-ager testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shooting, Michelle said she visits her father each weekend in jail 
and talks to him regularly on the telephone. "I feel that he didn't do it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing was adjourned, defense attorney Richard Plotin told 
reporters that the case against his client is flimsy. "They have no physical 
evidence against this man," Plotin said. "I don't think they even have 
sufficient suspicion (to justify a trial). They have speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo insisted that prosecutors have "a 
strong circumstantial case" against Peitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Portillo said investigators recovered a homemade silencer from the 
Peitz house. He also said Peitz appears to have waited at least 15 minutes 
between the time of the shooting and the 911 call, possibly to eliminate 
evidence.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $50,400 GRANT TO AID YOUNG MARATHONERS

<P>
 A grant of $50,400 has been awarded to Students Run L. A., a nonprofit 
organization that trains high school-age youths for the Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided by the Amateur Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles, the money will go 
toward buying uniforms and other equipment needed for the five-month training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a small-scale project of the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
Students Run L. A. is now a countywide effort to get children ready for the 
marathon, which takes place in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The project involves more than 100 teachers and 1,100 students from public and 
private schools, as well as continuation school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 12 public high schools in the San Fernando Valley will send their 
students to the after-school training sessions, school officials said. MAKI

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; A MATCH OF RACQUETS AND WHEELCHAIRS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ketan Gandhi remains undefeated on the handball court, but that's not the only 
reason his friends consider him a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi, 14, is confined to a wheelchair. But his determination to compete with 
his peers in sports has won him the admiration of his fellow students at 
Stephen R. Fitz Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, he has challenged students to hop into a 
wheelchair and try playing against him in a home-grown mix of tennis, 
racquetball and volleyball on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'That looks really easy.' But then they play, and I usually beat 
them. Then they say, 'Oh, that's really hard,' " he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi suffers from a osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder that makes 
bones extremely brittle and easy to break. As a result, he has required a 
wheelchair to get around since he was 5, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He mostly watched from the sidelines last year as his friends played sports. 
But this year he decided to try tennis. Because the courts were too large, he 
switched to playing on the handball courts, and instituted other game 
modifications such as using a bouncier racquetball rather than a tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He issued a challenge to a group of friends during one recent lunch recess, 
announcing, "OK, who's going to play me? Let's get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he was racking up point after point against 13-year-old Dao 
Hoang, a newcomer to the game. Swinging tennis racquets, the two traded shots 
against the wall and chased down the ball to return the other's hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's heroic. He puts all his courage into (playing) even though he's 
handicapped," said Tanner Smith, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi said he would love to challenge tennis pro Andre Agassi to a game, and 
added that he could probably beat the famous athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Agassi is presumably not as skilled at playing from a wheelchair, 
Gandhi exclaimed, "he would stink!" JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; TRANSFER OF OPERATION OF CULTURAL CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday to begin transferring operation 
of the Muckenthaler Cultural Center from the city to a private foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially strapped city has decreased its support of the center by about 
30% during the past three years.Still, this year it will spend $260,000 for 
center operations and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new contract, responsibility for 50% of the operational costs will 
be transferred to the Muckenthaler Cultural Center Foundation board by 1997. 
The city would continue to pay for most center maintenance, major repairs, 
water bills and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting center director Joe Felz said, "We anticipate entering into a longer 
contract after (1997), with the expectation of eventual total privatization, 
(although) the city will probably always insure the center and maintain the 
park" surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which sets policy and programming, began discussing privatization 
two years ago in the wake of the first city cutbacks and now contends it can 
better raise funds if the center is privately run. The theory is that donors 
are more generous to institutions that lack city support or governance, Felz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract takes effect Nov. 1 and specifies that "the center will be 
operated similar to past years, offering a variety of arts exhibitions, theater 
programs and fund-raising events." 
</P>
<P>
 The center was built in 1924 as an Italian Renaissance style home for Walter 
and Adella Muckenthaler, who donated the property to the city in 1965. ZAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY WON'T ASK STORES AT MALL TO CLOSE EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shops located on the city of San Fernando side of La Rinda Plaza -- including 
a liquor store, a restaurant and a grocery store -- will not be required to 
close earlier, a condition imposed by the city of Los Angeles on stores located 
on its side of the shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the San Fernando City Council on Monday endorsed other security measures 
enacted by the plaza's management at the request of Los Angeles in July -- 
locking parking lot gates at night, installing more lighting, maintaining a 
police substation at the mall and converting pay phones to make them usable 
only for outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
 La Rinda Plaza is situated partially in Los Angeles and partially in San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando store owners were happy with the decision, but some nearby 
residents said all businesses should close by 10 p.m. to cut down on cruising 
and other problems caused by teen-agers who hang out at the shopping center.  
</P>
<P>
 Security measures were taken in response to rising levels of crime, cruising, 
noise and vandalism at the shopping center at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Workman Street. The plaza was once a notorious nighttime hangout for hundreds 
of youths, including gang members, who cruised the center, creating traffic, 
noise and other disturbances that sometimes led to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions imposed on stores on the Los Angeles side in July included 
closing by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some San Fernando residents and store owners said Monday night that the 
security actions taken so far -- especially locking the parking lot gates at 
night -- are working. But they asked the council not to limit operating hours 
on the San Fernando side because some businesses would be hurt. "The businesses 
on the Los Angeles side of the plaza were not adversely affected (by the 
limited operating hours)," said Paul Charon, general manager of Pay Less Foods, 
which stays open until 11 p.m. "With our business, that's not the case. People 
buy food late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the owner of La Nueva Copa Granada, a restaurant and 
bar on the San Fernando side, threatened to sue the city if it changed its 
operating permit by requiring it to close at 10 p.m. The bar is open until 2 
a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree that liquor sales have anything to do with the problems at La 
Rinda Plaza," said Gregory M. Kunert, who spoke on behalf of Pancho Valenzuela, 
owner of the La Nueva Copa Granada. "The problem at La Rinda Plaza was with the 
cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando ultimately decided not to require stores on its side to close by 
10 p.m. because it cannot legally do so, according to the city's legal counsel, 
Julia Silva.  
</P>
<P>
 Silva explained that Los Angeles, as a charter law city, or city that sets its 
own governing rules, has the power to change permits restricting operating 
hours. But San Fernando, as a general law city, may only impose restrictions on 
business permits if there is a proven threat to the "health, welfare or safety" 
of the public.  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents were disappointed by the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow the sale of liquor late at night only enhances the problems we've 
had at La Rinda Plaza," said Mary C. Mejia, who lives near the shopping center. 
"Those of you who don't live here don't deal with the problems." TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CLEANUP DAY PLANNED AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to bring together a neighborhood still hurting from the Northridge 
earthquake, Bassett Street School in Van Nuys has organized a cleanup of its 
quake-damaged elementary campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a feeling of community," said Sue Michiels, a kindergarten teacher at 
the school who came up with the idea of holding a community day 
Saturday.Students, faculty, parents and neighbors will get together at 9 a.m. 
for three hours of painting, preparing walls for murals, planting flowers and 
sprucing up the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus still has damage from the Jan. 17 quake and about 25 apartment 
buildings in the neighborhood are still closed, Michiels said. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not expect that all the work that needs to be done will be completed 
in one morning, Michiels said. "Obviously, this is the first of many days we 
will have." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning's work will conclude with a potluck lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hoped that having parents involved in the project would show 
children how important an education is to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's work will include cleaning and painting furniture that has been 
donated to the school, putting other items in storage and taking care of work 
the school cannot handle during a regular working day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in desperate need of flower seeds and plants," Michiels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has tools or muscles to donate to the effort is welcome, Michiels 
said. The school is at 15756 Bassett St. Michiels can be reached at (818) 
782-1340. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the school in the cleanup effort will be the Woodcraft Rangers, 
Americorps VISTA volunteers and teen-agers from the California Conservation 
Corps, which is part of the Earthquake Response Volunteer Network started last 
month by President Clinton's Corporation for National Service. ED BOND

student achievement, preventing involvement with gangs and drugs, providing 
better access to child and health care, and offering more job training 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevins said she would try to make Santa Ana 2000 more widely known, encourage 
more community involvement in the organization's activities and aggressively 
seek funding for programs designed to promote education and job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting opportunity for me. (The group) has already done wonderful 
things, and we can do even more," she said. JON NALICKSANTA ANA 2000

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; FULL HOUSE AT FORUM PRODUCES FEW SPARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-attended forum for candidates in the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District board race produced few sparks this week despite a pitched battle that 
had been waged earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a pair of conservative candidates sought to distinguish themselves from 
the others in the field of eight vying for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Monday night forum at Mission Viejo High School, candidates 
differed mainly on sex education and educational philosophy. They responded to 
questions from an audience of about 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Dore J. Gilbert and Bobbee Cline are running as a team. They were 
the target of a handful of indirect attacks from Pat Soriano and Dave Schultz, 
who also are campaigning as a team and have been called extremist Christian 
candidates. The two reject the label, saying they are politically conservative 
parents who want to improve education by emphasizing basics and "American 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are Sandie Gonzales, Pamela S. Rush, Susan Krumpotich and 
Williams J. Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales and Rush are also campaigning as two who eschew the "far right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 8 election is being viewed as a struggle to control the balance of 
power on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Cline said the district has performed well in past years and could 
continue to do so under their leadership. The two defended the district's sex 
education curriculum, saying that it promotes abstinence as a primary goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said the district does not distribute condoms, after Soriano had told 
the audience that she opposes the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin and Schultz said they support segregating boys and girls during 
anatomical discussions of sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert also said the school district is not trying to "control the minds of 
your children." She was addressing critics of the recently abandoned 
state-mandated assessment test system. 
</P>
<P>
 Soriano said the district is moving away from basics, and instead is 
encouraging students to say "how they feel" about math problems and literature 
passages.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ANTI-GANG COALITION SEEKING COMMUNITY 
ASSISTANCE, INPUT

 Leaders of government and community organizations Tuesday called for more 
intense participation throughout the county to help implement a plan aimed at 
curbing gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe the gangs . . . need to know the community is going to do 
something about the problem," Margot Carlson, executive director of 
Irvine-based Community Service Programs Inc., said at a news conference in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Carlson at the news conference were Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, 
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, Orange County Chief Probation Officer 
Michael Schumacher, Dr. Nina Winn of the Orange County Department of Education 
and Marilyn MacDougall of Project NO Gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said the composition of the panel underscores an attempt to join 
the once-fragmented efforts of various agencies under the auspices of the 
year-old Orange County Gang Prevention Alliance. An action plan was drafted, 
they said, in response to information gathered last November at a Gang 
Prevention Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan lists several goals: encourage communities to determine the 
effectiveness of existing gang prevention and intervention programs; develop a 
program to involve youth as advisers in helping organizations and agencies 
assess anti-gang violence programs; and monitor pilot programs to update 
resource lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Action steps" that the plan proposes for the next 12 months include surveying 
community-based organizations to identify needs for information and training; 
preparing a quarterly newsletter to provide information on countywide anti-gang 
activities and resources; and developing at least one community action team in 
each of the five supervisorial districts in the county. LESLIE BERKMAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; NEW PARK CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION FOR LOCAL MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Troncatty recalls that back in 1984, when he began telling people about 
his dream of a new city park, they told him he was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Troncatty, then vice president of the Old Agoura Homeowners Assn., wanted to 
arrange a land swap: the 2.75-acre city-owned site on which the old park was 
situated for another tract down the street, a nine-acre parcel owned by a 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not normally done, trading property like that," Troncatty said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never gave up and, 10 years later, Troncatty was one of the speakers 
Tuesday at the groundbreaking for the new park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so happy. This is a dream come true for me, and for a lot of other 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the first phase of the new park -- an equestrian facility -- 
is scheduled to begin Monday, said Audrey Brown, the city's director of 
community services. The first phase is expected to be complete next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is being funded with a $600,000 grant from the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. The City Council recently awarded a contract for $618,465 to Terra 
Cal Construction Inc. for the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
 No general funds will be used for the project, city officials said. Additional 
funds will come from money raised under the Los Angeles County Park Bond Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The equestrian center, which will link up with a regional equestrian trail 
system, will be located between Chesebro Road, Colodny Drive and Driver Avenue. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Funding also has been obtained for a baseball field and a children's 
playground, said Audrey Brown, the city's director of community services. Funds 
are still being sought for a full-size basketball court and a 1,500-square-foot 
recreation building, she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plans, the equestrian center would be free and open to users from 
throughout the region. The center would be near a portion of the Zuma Ridge 
Trail, an equestrian path running through the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The old park was built by Los Angeles County and taken over by the city when 
it incorporated in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 Land for the new park was obtained by trading the old park site to Chesebro 
Development Group for nine acres, on which the new park is to be built, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already owned one acre at the site. Chesebro agreed to the swap, 
Brown said, because the 2.75 acres are not prone to flooding. FRANK MANNING

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; CYCLISTS JOIN CRITICS OF SAN JOAQUIN TOLL ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bicyclist's dream come true when the $67-million Newport Coast Drive 
opened in November, 1991, creating a rural 6.3-mile route for bicycles as well 
as vehicles from Irvine to the beaches of Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 But cyclists have now joined critics of the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road which 
will intersect Newport Coast Drive and bring the demise what they say is one of 
the county's premier bike routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the nicest on-road bike trail in this end of the county," said 
Irvine resident Marilyn Vassos, a member of the Bicycle Club of Irvine who has 
logged more than 2,000 miles on her 21-speed touring bike this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vassos, a retired teacher, said cyclists are angry about the impending loss of 
the route. "To just go and just take this road away is immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal residents filed a lawsuit in September against the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies, challenging the 50-cent toll motorists would pay to travel 
the full length of Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle riders would no longer be allowed on part of Newport Coast Drive, 
which will become a freeway. They will have to take either MacArthur Boulevard 
or Bonita Canyon Road to circumvent the toll road, eventually hooking back up 
with Newport Coast Drive, according to Transportation Corridor Agencies 
spokeswoman Lisa Telles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will still be able to have an access to the coast once the toll road is 
built," Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 But bicycle travel on crowded MacArthur Boulevard is much more perilous, 
according to Bill Sellin, who founded the 6,000-member Bicycle Club of Irvine 
in 1983. "The alternatives are few and far between to get to the coast," Sellin 
said. RUSS LOAR

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; HEAVY BOOTY FELLS WOULD-BE ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A would-be robber found out that crime can be a weighty business. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he held up two employees of a Northridge McDonald's as they returned 
from a bank with money.Unfortunately, what he tried to steal was a bag filled 
with $180 in coins -- a load so heavy he had to drop it to clear a fence as he 
tried to flee. Then he ran smack dab into a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this guy tried to run with the money, it was too heavy," said Sgt. Mike 
Sonntag, of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire division. "Some big 
heist." 
</P>
<P>
 Marebell Velez, 30, and Nancy Solis, 32, had just come back from the bank with 
$180 in change for the restaurant Monday when David Lydell Jones, 19, and an 
accomplice robbed them in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones grabbed the loot and took off, but as he attempted to jump a fence, he 
couldn't do it with the heavy booty, police said, so he dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 After jumping a few back-yard fences and running into traffic on Reseda 
Boulevard, Jones caught the attention of Officer David Gray of the LAPD's 
Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him, he was sweating and panting," said Gray, who was on his 
motorcycle at the corner of Lemarsh Street and Reseda Boulevard. "He said two 
people were chasing him and trying to kill him. Then I heard the radio call 
about the robbery and he fit the description almost perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was arrested Monday on suspicion of robbery and is being held in lieu of 
$35,000 bail at the LAPD's Devonshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 His accomplice is still at large, police said. JEANNETTE REGALDO

<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is expected to decide whether to 
file arson charges against a Camp Pendleton Marine who was arrested after a car 
similar to his was spotted leaving the scene of a brush fire, fire 
investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Pfc.Jose Antonio Sanchez, an infantryman at Camp Pendleton, 
is being turned over to prosecutors for review, said Dan Runnestrand, chief 
arson investigator for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was booked at Orange County Jail on weapons charges but has not been 
charged with arson, Runnestrand said. Bail was set Tuesday at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is not a suspect in any other fires, including the Laguna Beach fire 
last year, Runnestrand said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who has been stationed at Camp Pendleton since March, was arrested 
Sunday on suspicion of possessing a loaded rifle and brass knuckles after 
witnesses spotted a car similar to his leaving the scene of the fire. The rifle 
was loaded with tracer bullets, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said they believe a tracer round fired by the rifle may 
have sparked the fire that burned about 140 acres of brush Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Lt. David Steele, a Camp Pendleton spokesman, said base officials do 
not believe the rifle seized from Sanchez's car was issued by the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said that an investigation into whether Sanchez has violated military 
regulations is underway.THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PAY RAISE REJECTED BY CITY MANAGER

<P>
 City Manager Allan Roeder said Monday that he will not accept a 4% salary 
increase awarded him by the City Council until certain departments in the city 
improve their performance and their image. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining to be more specific about the problems, Roeder told the council 
members he would spurn the pay hike, which was approved by the council last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather get these problems squared away," Roeder said. "The council wants 
to see some improvements in the way some of our departments operate and since I 
oversee all departments, I'm going to defer. I think you should earn a pay 
raise before you receive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder, who earns $120,000 a year, has deferred salary increases in the past. 
The last increase he accepted was three years ago, but since then he has 
rejected annual increases because of the city's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, the council unanimously approved a 4% raise for City 
Atty. Thomas Kathe, who now earns $103,000 a year, according to Personnel 
Director Howard Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary hikes translate to $402 a month more for Roeder and $343 a month 
more for Kathe, who said he would accept his raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathe's raise was to go into effect immediately and includes a boost in 
monthly benefits from $520 to $739.TOM RAGAN

<P>
 To quickly respond to fires such as those that ravaged the county a year ago 
this month, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan for development 
of a helicopter program for the Orange County Fire Department by purchasing 
excess copters from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to renew as needed a contract the county entered 
into in June to lease a firefighting helicopter, while taking steps to acquire 
and refurbish two other helicopters of its own over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from Larry J. Holms, director of fire services for the county, 
projects the cost of the program at $9 million over the first 10 years of 
operation, if the helicopters are used only during daylight hours, and $10 
million if the helicopter service is available around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The board directed the Orange County Fire Department to begin operating 
helicopters during daylight but to assess the need for a full 24-hour 
helicopter service. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also received approval to develop a lease with Fullerton 
Municipal Airport for a short-term base of operations and with Airborne Law 
Enforcement, a regional air support program, for a future permanent base.LESLIE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; CHAMBER TO MAKE A GAME OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce has caught the Monopoly craze and plans 
to create its own version of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this to generate an awareness of the various businesses that are 
within the community and to give each business an opportunity to have their 
name on a game that is a fun activity that can be enjoyed," said Daniel L. 
Romey, the chamber's first vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills is one of several Southern California communities to 
manufacture its own home-spun version of the famous game. Chatsworth, Sherman 
Oaks and Westlake Village have already their own versions, as do Beverly Hills, 
Moorpark, Malibu, Santa Barbara and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodlandopoly . . . will be Woodland Hills' very own board game," reads a 
letter from chamber President Michael J. Miller in a pitch to area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your business name will be called 20 to 30 times, every time the game is 
played, for years and years to come, by thousands of players all over our local 
area," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee, businesses can buy a space in the game, which will be manufactured 
after all of the spaces have been bought, Romey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are only 50 spaces, so it is limited," he said. "It's on a 
first-come, first-served basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the games are produced, they will be available in major department 
stores, said Romey, an attorney who is in charge of special events for the 
chamber. The group hopes to get the game on the market before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are similar to Monopoly, but enough changes have been made that 
Monopoly's maker, Parker Brothers, cannot claim trademark infringement, said 
Dan Siegel of Hometown Games, which is marketing the game for Woodland Hills.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY TO PLANT TREES WITH $69,525 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas has received a $69,525 state grant that will be used to plant trees 
in various locations around the city, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grants are out there, so we might as well get them," Mayor Karyn Foley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the funds from the California Department of Forestry grant will go to 
plant trees in Juan Bautista de Anza Park, City Manager Charles Cate said. The 
planned 10-acre park, off Lost Hills and Las Virgenes roads, will go out to bid 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money, Cate said, will be used to replace trees along Calabasas 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will probably hire an arborist to provide suggestions about what kind 
of trees would be best, Foley said. Most likely, they would be 
drought-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get the most bang for the buck," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the plantings would meet the objectives of the Calabasas Beautiful 
Program, which she established to help make the city more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has applied for grants totaling about $3.2 million, Cate said. Of 
that, $2.3 million would go to help the city recover from the Northridge 
earthquake. To date, Cate said, the city has been awarded about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the grants the city has been awarded was $46,000 from the state 
Department of Transportation for a rubber asphalt overlay for Parkway 
Calabasas, according to Cate. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
approved a grant for $305,900 for designing plans for 12 miles of bike lanes 
along the Ventura Freeway corridor. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; POLICE TO HOLD PICNIC FOR NEEDY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department will sponsor an 
old-fashioned picnic for underprivileged youths from the west San Fernando 
Valley on Saturday at Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Castaic Lake Adventure, the day will include everything from potato 
sack races and tug of war to canoeing and a giant barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 350 youths who participate in a host of community-based policing 
groups are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tonya Johnson said the Northridge-based division holds annual 
get-togethers for several youth groups, but this is the first time that it has 
brought them together at once. "This is the largest one we've done so far," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire officers have invited youths from the West Valley Division as well, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Picnickers will also honor Officer Rosa Kusiak and Sgt. Bill Flores, both of 
whom have changed jobs after several years of working with community-based 
programs, Johnson said. "It's just our way of saying thank you to the people 
who started our youth programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which is not open to the public, will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; WATER DISTRICT DECISION DUE AFTER ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to wait until after the Nov. 8 election before 
acting on a proposal to separate the city from the Los Alamitos County Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting unanimously for the delay last week, council members said the 
election could bring changes to the council and the water district's governing 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district operates sewer services in Los Alamitos, Rossmoor and parts 
of Seal Beach and Cypress. Los Alamitos officials are considering whether the 
city should take over sewer services for its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a reason to rush the process," said Councilman Ronald Bates. 
"It's not big enough an issue. But at some time, it has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided not to file an application with the Local Agency Formation 
Commission that would have started the process of "detaching" from the water 
district, which has provided local sewer service for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said that an application at this time may be premature because the 
commission is expected to look into the issue of special districts and 
determine if some may be disbanded or consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force created by the County Board of Supervisors recommended in 1984 
that Los Alamitos combine sewer services with other public works operations to 
cut costs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pay about $1.25 a month for sewer services, and the rate could rise 
if the city takes over, said officials of the water district who are opposed to 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that they tabled this," said water district board member Arlyss 
Burkett. "It's in the best interests of the citizens not to pursue this any 
further." BERT ELJERA

2 ROBBERS GET $500,000 IN JEWELS; TARZANA: BROKER MAY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED TO 
ASSOCIATE'S HOUSE, WHERE BOTH WERE HELD UP AT GUNPOINT, POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two robbers, who may have followed a jewelry broker from a downtown Los 
Angeles jewel market, broke into a Tarzana home and made off five minutes later 
with $500,000 in cut diamonds and sapphires, police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said jewelry broker Indra Jhaveri, 44, of Arizona may have been 
followed Monday night from the Downtown Jewelry Mart -- where he had been 
trying to drum up business earlier in the day -- to the home of David Rahima, 
42, another jewelry broker, in the 19100 block of Santa Rita Street, where he 
planned to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is a random robbery," Los Angeles Police Lt. Ken Lady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 p.m., two robbers, one armed with a semiautomatic pistol, knocked on 
the door of the house, police said. When Rahima opened the door, they pushed 
him to the floor, taped up the mouth and hands of a screaming Jhaveri with duct 
tape, grabbed the precious stones on the table and fled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The robbers told (Jhaveri) a hundred times that if he didn't shut up, they 
would kill him," Detective Jay Rush said. "Then they just scooped up the stuff 
and ran out. It was very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, police said Rahima had reported shots being fired at his house on 
two occasions this year. The most recent such incident was Sunday, Lady said. 
He would not comment on whether the shots fired about 8 p.m. Sunday were 
connected to the robbery, or give any other details of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects in the jewel robbery, but are searching for two white 
men in their 30s, one about 5 feet 8 inches and 160 pounds, with brown hair and 
eyes, the other about 6 feet tall and 180 pounds, also with brown hair and 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The gemstones were uninsured, according to Jhaveri, who has been in the 
jewelry business for 10 years and was visiting from Arizona, where he buys and 
sells jewelry from his home. Some of the diamonds and sapphires were his, and 
some were on consignment from other jewelry brokers, he told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jhaveri and Rahima said they had done business with each other for 
three years. They both travel internationally to buy and sell jewelry and 
precious stones, and it was not unusual for them to carry large amounts of 
jewelry, Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahima, owner of a wholesale jewelry business in the San Fernando Valley, also 
has a residence and jewelry business in New York, Lady said.

COUNTY ORDERS STUDY OF UNPAID HOSPITAL BILLS; FINANCES: BOARD WILL REVIEW 
WHETHER IT SHOULD COVER COSTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE TREATED WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY 
BUT BEFORE ARREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to study whether 
the county should pay the private hospital bills of drunk drivers and others 
who receive medical treatment while in police custody before being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was pressed by officials of Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
the Santa Clarita Valley. It is also being closely watched by administrators of 
the county's 119 private acute care hospitals, which lose millions annually 
because many drunk drivers and psychiatric patients in police custody refuse to 
pay their bills, pleading poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care to 
everyone regardless of their ability to pay, a spokesman for the Hospital 
Council of Southern California said.  
</P>
<P>
 The custody cases cost Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital about $150,000 a 
year, just over 3% of the $4.5 million the Valencia hospital loses in 
uncompensated medical costs, its officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But every nickel counts when you're looking at the dollars that hospitals 
spend on uncompensated care," said Duffy Watson, the hospital's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials contend the county should pick up the tab because most of 
the patients ultimately become wards of the county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospitals have succeeded in recovering a portion of these costs from 
local police agencies, but most have not, said Harriet Ulmer, the Los Angeles 
regional director for the Hospital Council of Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 The county Sheriff's Department currently pays private hospitals for some 
medical services, like blood-alcohol tests for drunk drivers and emergency care 
for jail inmates, but has balked at picking up the tab for indigent patients 
before they are arrested and booked. Sometimes, especially in cases involving 
psychiatric patients, police do not end up arresting the person. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, hospitals lose about $1.5 billion annually in uncompensated 
medical costs, Hospital Council spokesman David Langness said. No exact figures 
are available, but for some hospitals, the custody cases represent about 3% to 
5% of the overall losses, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like a big percentage, but it's many, many millions of 
dollars," Langness said. "That can make a difference when you consider the 
average profit margin for the minority of hospitals that are profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The county may be legally responsible for paying the bills, according to a 
recent opinion from the county counsel's office. But there are a variety of 
conflicting legal opinions on the issue, particularly in cases involving more 
than one police agency, Ulmer said. "It's going to take some state legislation 
to figure out who is responsible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors ordered county administrators and health officials to study 
the issue and report back early next year.

COUNTY DEPARTMENT HEADS GET 1ST SALARY RAISES IN 3 YEARS; GOVERNMENT: CITING 
ROSIER FISCAL PICTURE, SUPERVISORS OK HIKES OF UP TO 4%. THOSE GETTING TOP 
INCREASE INCLUDE SHERIFF, DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR.

<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved the first pay 
raises in three years for department heads, including Sheriff Brad Gates and 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The raises reflect the county's improving fiscal picture, County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises range from 2.5% to 4%, based on job performance reviews recently 
completed by Schneider and the board. Department heads were judged on their 
ability to increase efficiency, stay within their budgets, generate new revenue 
and practice innovative management techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also considered the officials' interpersonal skills and 
whether they motivated employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the county's 27 top managers, 14 -- including Gates, Capizzi and 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron -- received the highest raises 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, Human Resources Manager Russ Patton, County Counsel Terry C. Andrus 
and Larry J. Holms, director of fire services, also received 4% raises. 
</P>
<P>
 With the board's approval, Schneider's salary rose from $135,512 to $140,940. 
Capizzi's salary rose to $126,214, and Gates' jumped to $115,689. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the nine managers who received 2.5% raises are Ronald Y. Butler, head of 
the public defender's office, and Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent from the list of executives receiving pay hikes were County Clerk Gary 
L. Granville and beleaguered Recorder Lee Branch, whom supervisors censured 
earlier this year after an investigation concluded that he sexually harassed 
two female employees and mismanaged his department. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters on Nov. 8 will elect either Granville or Branch to serve in the newly 
combined position of Recorder-Clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors will consider granting a raise to whomever wins the election, 
Schneider has said.

ANAHEIM PROCEEDS WITH PLANS FOR COMMUNITY CENTER; DEVELOPMENT: THE CITY COUNCIL 
AGREES TO HIRE AN ARCHITECT TO DESIGN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE $19.4-MILLION 
FACILITY, WHICH WILL SERVE VARIOUS GROUPS.

<P>
 Less than a week after breaking ground for a new downtown community ice rink, 
the City Council on Tuesday moved ahead with plans for an ambitious 
$19.4-million community center, which would be three blocks away.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the hiring of an architect to design the 
first $7.5-million phase of the facility, which will include a senior citizens' 
center, a gymnasium, a playing field, meeting rooms and an arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a true community center because of the variety of groups it will 
serve," Mayor Tom Daly said. "The challenge is designing a building so that all 
the uses will be compatible." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are optimistic that the community center and the ice rink, 
which is a joint venture between the city and the Walt Disney Co., will help 
revitalize the aging downtown area, said Christopher Jarvi, director of parks, 
recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are really rolling right now," Jarvi said. "Both projects spur on 
additional development. As we bring more people into the area, it makes it more 
attractive for big and small businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the facility to be built in five phases on both sides of 
Philadelphia Street between Center Street and Broadway as part of the 
Redevelopment Agency's revitalization of a 60-block area of central Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect, LPA Inc. of Irvine, will be paid $605,700 to design the 
project's first phase and to prepare a master plan for the remaining phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Later phases will include construction of a YMCA with a swimming pool, a Boys 
and Girls Club, a second gymnasium and possibly a community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the project is being funded by federal, state and county 
grants, the sale of the existing senior citizens' center, private grants and a 
$2-million insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the rest of the project has not been secured, but it will probably 
include private solicitations and grants, Jarvi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the initial phase could begin next year. No timetable has been 
set for the remaining phases, city officials said.

VALLEY BRIEFING: RATING THE LAWMAKERS; MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY TAKE STOCK AFTER 
LEGISLATURE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year, thousands of bills are introduced in the Legislature by state 
lawmakers whose names or track records may mean little to the average voter. 
While the decisions made in Sacramento may seem distant to Southern California 
residents, it is the state Capitol where many critical local issues get 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 From education to earthquake relief to economic reform, state legislators 
tackle a wide range of problem with solutions that sometimes typify which side 
of the ideological aisle the lawmaker occupies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, state legislators 
embrace a broad spectrum of views, ranging from the staunchest conservative to 
the most libreral. 
</P>
<P>

LOCAL ELECTIONS / CYPRESS; PUBLIC SAFETY, CARD CLUBS TOP ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public safety and opposition to card clubs are among the top issues as this 
45,000-population city prepares to fill three council seats Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates are relatively low in the community. Nonetheless, all of the 
council candidates, including incumbent Walter K. Bowman, emphasize their 
support for a strong police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, candidates Steven D. Bradley, Tom Carroll, Reynold Elkin, Chuck 
Hicks, Mary Ann Jones and Alice Kotloff Spatz all said public safety is among 
their key concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 The card club issue lingers in the city after residents last year 
overwhelmingly voted down a proposal that would have allowed them to operate. 
In this year's election, Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs, the organization 
that spearheaded the 1993 opposition, is backing Carroll and Jones, two 
founding members of the group. Tim Keenan, a spokesman for the organization, 
said residents need two unwavering card-club opponents elected to the council.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowman is the only incumbent on the ballot. Mayor Richard Partin is barred by 
the city's term limits from running again, and Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson 
chose not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, 56, a businessman, is a former mayor and a past president of the 
Cypress College Patrons of the Arts. He said that if reelected, he intends to 
continue to increase the number of patrol officers on the streets "by cutting 
unnecessary spending rather than (imposing) an unwarranted utility tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, 39, is a certified public accountant and has served as an officer of 
the Cypress Little League. He is a member of a countywide organization opposed 
to card clubs. His campaign issues include support for a strong police force, 
and parks and public amenities to maintain the city as a family-oriented 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, 62, is a retired business executive and served on the city's Fiscal 
Advisory Committee. He said his major concerns include citizen participation in 
government, and maintaining a good quality of life and financial stability in 
the city. He said the anti-card club vote last year was "a voters' mandate" of 
which he would be ever mindful. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkin, 68, is a retired business owner who has served on the Fiscal Advisory 
Committee and the board of directors of the Friends of Cypress Recreation and 
Parks. He said that in addition to public safety, his concerns include 
expanding the city's business base and studying and fulfilling needs of the 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, 43, is a safety program manager and was a school board member of the 
Anaheim Union High School District in 1989-90. He described himself as "an 
active member of the community who understands the needs of the city." He said 
the future of the city lies in three key areas: business development, community 
safety and budget management. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 46, is a bank vice president who has served on the Fiscal Advisory 
Committee and the Women's Roundtable of Orange County. She lists crime and 
financial responsibility as major campaign issues. She said she would push for 
more police on the street and would oppose a utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Spatz, 52, a licensed vocational nurse, has served on the School Closure 
Committee, Chamber of Commerce and Boys & Girls Club. She listed city financial 
independence and city safety as key campaign issues. She said a city "grows by 
utilizing the talents of its people."

PLAN TO REBUILD QUAKE-HIT AREA SPLITS HOMEOWNERS, MERCHANTS; RECOVERY: 
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN SHERMAN OAKS DISAGREE ON THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY 
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AS IT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AN EMERGENCY ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO and JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A draft plan to redevelop earthquake-ravaged neighborhoods of Sherman Oaks has 
divided homeowners and merchants who disagree on the role to be played by the 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks is one of five heavily damaged areas of the San Fernando Valley 
where the CRA is seeking to establish an emergency redevelopment zone. The 
570-acre area is roughly bordered by the San Diego Freeway, Coldwater Canyon 
Avenue, Ventura Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA's goal in the emergency zone would be to use money diverted from local 
property tax revenues to rebuild crumbling and abandoned commercial strips and 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said the draft plan, which will be released 
tonight, does not go far enough to restrict the CRA's power of eminent domain 
and to make planning decisions. Also, the plan needs a cap on administrative 
costs, homeowners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to shove this down our throats," said Matt Epstein, chairman 
of the homeowner association's CRA Study Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce backs the draft plan because it 
believes it will rebuild housing, restoring the customer base that was eroded 
when the quake destroyed many apartment buildings and condos.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sherman Oaks lost between 25% and one-third of its residents," said Barry 
Wegman, executive vice president of the chamber. "Businesses are dying because 
there is nobody to patronize them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven community leaders have been involved in drafting the plan. Sherman Oaks 
residents will have their first chance to see the proposal tonight when the CRA 
holds the first of two community workshops at 6 p.m. at Millikan Middle School, 
5041 Sunnyslope Ave. Another workshop will take place on Oct. 26 at the same 
time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 Also tonight, CRA commissioner and former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler will be the 
featured speaker at another community meeting sponsored by the homeowners 
association at 8 p.m. It is being held at the Union Federal Bank, 13300 Ventura 
Blvd., in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Close, president of the homeowners association, said Monday that 
his group of 1,600 families has begun circulating a petition to oppose the 
redevelopment zone for Sherman Oaks unless there is more local control over 
what is built and how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 He is calling for a community panel that would have veto power over individual 
redevelopment projects in the area or a plan that would more specifically 
detail CRA powers in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein added that homeowners want the CRA to limit itself to the role of 
moneylender, guaranteeing loans or providing gap loans to property owners whose 
insurance or loans from the Small Business Administration do not cover the full 
cost of reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Nocella, finance officer for the CRA, estimated that the project's budget 
will be $20 million to $56 million, depending on whether a five- or 10-year 
plan is approved. The money will be generated through a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, redevelopment agencies are empowered to condemn property 
through eminent domain proceedings and typically assemble large parcels of land 
that are sold to a developer, who revitalizes the neighborhood with 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency keeps the property taxes generated in the renewed 
neighborhood and invests that money in more improvements, such as sewers and 
business loans for more construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the Sherman Oaks draft plan, the CRA must abide by all zoning and 
land-use laws in the area and its power of eminent domain is limited. There are 
no single family homes in the proposed area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proposing to use eminent domain in very limited circumstances, only 
when the property is vacated . . . and only when the owner cannot or will not 
rehabilitate the property," said John Spalding, director of policy and planning 
for the CRA. "We are prohibited from using eminent domain in properties where 
people live. No one's home will be taken by eminent domain." 
</P>
<P>
 CRA officials said they plan to give first priority to restoring vacated and 
partially abandoned residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce is satisfied that the proposal provides adequate 
safeguards for the community. Officials are concerned that the homeowners' 
complaints will thwart a speedy revitalization of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegman said the CRA's draft is a good match with the chamber's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, the chamber wants to try to rebuild the residential base, then the 
business base and finally the infrastructure," Wegman said. "If any funds 
remain, some of the funds might be used to support a (landscaping plan) for 
Ventura Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA is expected to make its final recommendation to the City Council in 
November, after a 60-day assessment of the quake-damaged areas. Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, will not take a position on the issue 
until hearing from all segments of the community, said Alisa Katz, his chief 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed emergency redevelopment zones include portions of Northridge, 
Reseda, Van Nuys and Pacoima. Community groups in these areas, such as the 
North Hills Community Coordinating Council, have held hearings, but none has 
taken a position.

TESTS FIND SOME EXPOSURE TO TB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine people tested positive for exposure to tuberculosis in a skin-test 
screening of 92 students and instructors at Orange Coast College last week, a 
county health official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is below what one would expect in an ethnically diverse population 
such as Orange Coast's, and does not indicate any sort of health problem at the 
college, said Dr. Penny Weismuller, disease control manager at the Orange 
County Health Care Agency.The expected number of positive tests would be about 
16, or 17% to 18%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The TB screening was prompted by a former student's disclosure in September 
that she had developed active tuberculosis. The Los Angeles woman had attended 
a couple of sessions of a class in August with as many as 24 other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said 10 of those students had negative skin tests, one was positive 
from a previous exposure to TB, and one took the test but did not return to 
have it read by health officials. Twelve others did not show up for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who have positive tests do not go on to develop TB. The nine 
people with positive skin tests will need to have follow-up chest X-rays to 
determine whether the disease is present in their lungs, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials will continue their attempts to check on the students 
who were not tested, Weismuller said.

MUSIC REVIEW; A MIXED BACH FEST PROGRAM FROM ARMADILLO QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The locally based Armadillo String Quartet might be a more prominent name on 
our chamber music scene were not its members busy with dozens of other musical 
endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, this talented ensemble -- Barry Socher and Steven Scharf, violins, 
Raymond Tischer, viola, and Armen Ksajikian, cello -- showed considerable 
strengths in the second program of the Los Angeles Bach Festival, now in its 
61st year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a string quartet playing in a Bach festival will always be a problematical 
proposition, since, of course, in Bach's day there was no such thing as a 
string quartet as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the Armadillo put together a virtually experimental program listing 
Bach at both ends, for this concert in the Shatto Chapel of First 
Congregational Church, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At its center was Kurt Weill's rare String Quartet, Opus 8, written when the 
composer was a mere 23 and still a student of Busoni. It seems a deliberately 
wayward piece, drifting through numerous cosmopolitan avenues as if trying to 
get someone off its tail. 
</P>
<P>
 While its semi-tonal thoughts and busy textures are always engaging and 
well-wrought, one wants to knock this piece on the head and ask what's going 
on. The Armadillo, nevertheless, gave it a smoothly accomplished reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections from "The Art of Fugue," for which Bach left no specific 
instrumentation, concluded the event. But, given that the various lines didn't 
consistently speak separately on this occasion, and that the string quartet, to 
the modern ear, is the most conversational of idioms, and the fugue, arguably 
the least, this instrumentation didn't quite work here. The music sounded 
mechanical, despite conscientious, fine-tuned accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Socher's straightforward arrangement of a Bach prelude and fugue and a 
pleasantly lived-in performance of Beethoven's String Quartet, Opus 18, No. 5, 
completed an interesting evening. TIMOTHY MANGAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JEWISH COALITION OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the specter of totalitarianism, representatives of a Jewish coalition 
formed to fight Proposition 187 said Tuesday that the state ballot initiative 
unfairly targets children and would turn tens of thousands of adults into 
government informants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vicious and cruel proposition," said Rabbi Harold M. Schulweiss, 
leader of Encino's Valley Beth Shalom and a member of the Jewish Community 
Coalition Against Proposition 187, the ballot measure aimed at curbing illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The community coalition is said to include congregations representing more 
than 3,300 San Fernando Valley families, as well as regional Jewish 
organizations representing another 50,000 families throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulweiss told a news conference that he hopes the coalition will convince 
the Jewish community, as well as others, that Proposition 187 would fail to 
address problems of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Schulweiss said, it would hurt many children by denying them an 
education and routine medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, if approved by voters in November, would allow public 
schooling, non-emergency medical care and other government services only to 
those who can prove they are living in the United States legally. In addition, 
it would require school officials, police and health care workers to report to 
authorities anyone they believe might be an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes informants out of all of us," Schulweiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another coalition member, Tzivia Schwartz, said: "The comparison is to the 
experience the Jewish community had in Europe, where being suspected of being 
Jewish was grounds for all kinds of horrible things." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is drawing upon a growing xenophobia, a fear of new immigrant 
families that has even spread among the normally tolerant Jewish community, 
said Rabbi Jim Kaufman of Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are saying, 'I feel I want to vote yes, and I feel it is unJewish,' " 
Kaufman said. Rejecting newcomers, especially those in need, is so common -- so 
human -- that the Bible prohibits the practice more than two dozen times, he 
said. "The Bible acknowledges the feelings, but says we should not act upon 
those feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men said laws directed at minorities within a community are traditionally 
opposed by Jews, who have been the target of similar discrimination throughout 
their history. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that U. S. border authorities ought to control the flow of 
immigration, attacking those already living in California, especially children 
of immigrants, is morally indefensible, Schulweiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same arguments used by supporters of 187 -- that illegal immigration is 
solely a legal issue, that there is no more room or money -- was used when U. 
S. authorities refused port entry to the St. Louis, a ship carrying 937 Jews 
seeking escape from Nazi Germany in August, 1939, Schulweiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethics cost," he said, noting that many of the passengers later died in Nazi 
concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, chairman of the pro-187 campaign, said he does not believe that 
religious figures ought to criticize supporters of 187 on moral grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, we have separation of church and state, and we have to look 
at political issues without acrimony," he said. "This is a legal and, now, a 
political issue." SAM ENRIQUEZ

MAN SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS IN 1991 SLAYING OF GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Joseph Goodman, formerly of Canoga Park, was sentenced Tuesday to 12 
years in prison for the June, 1991, stabbing death of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman pleaded no contest last month to the charges.By entering the plea, he 
avoided a trial at which his mother and brother were expected to testify 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Beth Hollander was found the morning of June 20, 1991, behind a 
dumpster in the 21500 block of Prairie Street. She had been beaten, strangled 
and stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death remained a mystery until 16 months later, when Goodman's mother 
called police to say her son admitted the killing to her, and that she had 
tried to persuade him to surrender to police. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Goodman told his mother and brother that he had 
stabbed Hollander in self-defense during a quarrel. Goodman, a Jaguar mechanic 
who was born in Liverpool, England, and has lived in the United States since 
1981, had violently abused Hollander during a stormy, eight-year relationship, 
authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Before her death, Goodman had attempted to reconcile with Hollander and gave 
her an engagement ring. But Hollander told friends the night before she died 
that she planned to give the ring back, according to court records.

 A Santa Clarita man charged with molesting four girls more than 20 years ago 
is challenging the constitutionality of a new state law that allows molestation 
suspects to be charged within a year of the date the alleged crime is reported 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused man, William Lynch, 64, will appear in Los Angeles Superior Court 
on Thursday for a pretrial hearing, but his lawyer and prosecutors expect 
pretrial proceedings to be put on hold until the challenge to the law is 
decided in appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, free on $100,000 bail, was charged in June of molesting three sisters 
and their childhood friend from March, 1967, to July, 1972, when the girls were 
between 7 and 13 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the alleged victims secretly taped phone and personal conversations 
with him in July, 1993, about her memories of the alleged molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch already lost two earlier attempts -- at a preliminary hearing and an 
earlier pretrial proceeding -- to have the charges against him dropped on the 
basis of the legitimacy of the new law. But his lawyer, Frank Di Sabatino, said 
Tuesday that he will take his argument to the state's 2nd District Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the alleged crime was committed, the statute of limitations on 
his particular crime was three years," said Di Sabatino. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Francesca Frey said the challenge was expected and that she 
is confident the law will be again upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's ample policy considerations and ample case authority that allows us 
to go forward," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey estimated the appeals court proceedings will delay pretrial hearings in 
the Lynch case for two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged victims have said the case is not a result of "recovered memory." 
They said in court that they never forgot Lynch's actions but were afraid to 
speak to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who taped the conversations testified at the preliminary hearing in 
June that Lynch performed oral sex on her and tried to have intercourse with 
her.

MIKE PENNER: CLIPPERS ARE BETTER THAN EMPTY POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You force Orange County's sporting customers to go without their hockey for 
three weeks -- no Mighty Ducks, cold turkey -- and you have to presume they are 
going to be bored. 
</P>
<P>
 But this bored? 
</P>
<P>
 A Clipper franchise record 18,052 turned out at The Pond Tuesday night to 
watch a loosely defined "exhibition of professional basketball" against the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat: A franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 25 years of basketball, usually extremely wretched basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers never drew 18,052 in Buffalo. Never in San Diego. Never in Los 
Angeles. In Los Angeles, a turnstile count of 18,052 represents a pretty fair 
three-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, they flood the freeways, jam the parking lot and pay 
through the nose for this stuff, proving a theory I have long held about the 
magical, mystical, magnetic Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Open the doors, turn on the lights, flash a few words on the marquee -- 
"TONIGHT: HUMANS BREATHING HARD, 7:30," for instance -- and the place will be 
filled to the brim. 
</P>
<P>
 Or schedule nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Or schedule the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before have so many spent so much to witness so little. The Clippers, 
playing host here as part of Orange County's rent-an-NBA-orphan program, lost 
to the Lakers, 120-104, but the score might as well have been 220-104. The 
Clippers were never in the game, never had a chance, never pushed the 
opposition into breaking into a sweat, so in this regard, new head coach/poor, 
poor soul Bill Fitch has his charges in midseason form. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have one of these nights from time to time," Fitch said after following 
the bouncing ball clank off The Pond backboards, sail into The Pond seats and 
careen off Clipper fingers. "And, boy, we had one tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clippers, one of those nights included doling out 19 minutes to Tony 
Massenburg, 20 to Charles Outlaw, 23 to Harold Ellis, 12 to Keith Smart and 10 
to Orlando Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not make the most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to gauge the whole season on one exhibition game, but, on the other 
side, we got to play a lot of people," Fitch noted, grasping for a straw, any 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have been working hard in practice. They paid for the opportunity 
in camp. So we got them in there and now we have a better idea of what to do 
when we have to cut down to 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to cut an entire franchise? 
</P>
<P>
 Bright spots for the Clippers? Fitch scratched his head and said he thought it 
was good to get Massenburg, a 6-9 forward from Maryland via F.C. Barcelona -- 
not the soccer team, presumably -- some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's missed most of camp, so it was good to put him out there for the 
conditioning," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Eric Piatkowski, the rookie swingman acquired from Indiana in the Pooh 
Richardson trade, made his NBA debut after signing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He nailed his first shot," Fitch chirped. "That's another good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore Spencer also played. This was notable in that Spencer walked out of 
camp Monday afternoon. Quite literally. Spencer walked off the Bren Center 
floor in mid-workout, changed clothes and kept walking, all the way to the team 
hotel, about a three-mile stroll. 
</P>
<P>
 For several hours, the Clippers considered Spencer AWOL. Not a good thing for 
a team already down one center, Stanley Roberts, currently sidelined with a 
sprained waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Spencer showed up, but Fitch kept him out of the starting lineup 
Tuesday night. On most teams, this is considered a disciplinary measure, but on 
the Clippers, this is known as a lucky break. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Fitch started Bob Martin at center. He had four points and one 
rebound in 13 minutes. Then he sent in Robert Werdann. Then Matt Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he'd seen enough, so Spencer was finally told to take off the warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "His minutes were planned," Fitch said. "When you punish somebody, you don't 
want to overdo it. You just want to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, he won't do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Clippers are scheduled to do it again here six more times, 
all of them counting in the regular-season standings. 
</P>
<P>
 It keeps the place busy, I suppose, but if The Pond needs some suggestions on 
what do with itself during the NHL lockout, here's a partial list of things to 
try: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Indoor soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Roller disco. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Indoor plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Arena football. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Arena foosball. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Barbra Streisand concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Rolling Stones concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Sons of the Rolling Stones concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Barney (the Forum Blue Dinosaur) concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Tractor pulls. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Taffy pulls. 
</P>
<P>
 13. American Gladiators. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Roller baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Miniature golf. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Mater Dei basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 17. Mater Dei volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 18. Closed-circuit broadcasts of Phoenix Suns and Orlando Magic games. That 
way they can bill it, in good conscience, as "NBA basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 19. Save The Rams spirit rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 20. Clippers Go Home spirit rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 You wanted basketball, you got it. Too late to throw it back now.

$7 MILLION FOR WORLD CUP BOSS; SOCCER: ROTHENBERG AWARDED BIG BONUS WHEN THE 
EVENT MAKES A $60-MILLION PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg will receive $7 million in compensation for serving as the 
World Cup Organizing Committee's chairman and chief executive officer, the 
Times learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup Board of Directors released the event's preliminary financial 
accounting, and projected the monthlong soccer tournament's net at $60 million, 
about three times earlier estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The board announced that Rothenberg would receive a $3-million bonus. However, 
two board members said the board also voted Rothenberg an additional $4 million 
as part of a deferred-compensation package for "back pay due," calculated at 
$800,000 a year, running from August of 1990 through next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Rothenberg's extensive expenses the last four years had 
previously been reimbursed by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Rothenberg declined a salary of $350,000 a year that was offered by 
the board, saying he would accept compensation only if a surplus was produced. 
Rothenberg said many times later that he was not receiving a salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Peter V. Ueberroth, who chaired the Compensation Committee, said 
Tuesday that an outside consulting group had given a range of figures for the 
executive bonuses and that the board had made the final determinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also voted Scott LeTellier, WCOC chief operating officer, a $500,000 
bonus; Executive Vice President Marla Messing a $350,000 bonus, and Chief 
Administrative Officer Eli Primrose-Smith a $250,000 bonus, a board member 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of declining sports marketing dollars and increasing costs of 
mounting international sporting events, the surplus is considered by some to be 
remarkable. Early projections called for a $20-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the figures are exceptional," said Ueberroth, who organized the 1984 
Olympic Games in Los Angeles that netted $225 million. "In this country, we 
like to kick ourselves around. We are often embarrassed by our success in 
America. It's a good omen for Atlanta (site of the 1996 Olympic Games)." 
</P>
<P>
 The board announced that it expected to turn over $40 million to the U.S. 
Soccer Federation Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to promote 
and support soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of bonuses had been controversial among soccer insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the World Cup, even officials within the U.S. Soccer Federation, of 
which Rothenberg is the president, called for a closer accounting of what they 
characterized as the big spending habits of World Cup officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which met last Wednesday, wasn't in complete agreement on the issue 
of Rothenberg's compensation. There was a nay vote and two abstentions on the 
question of awarding Rothenberg $4 million in back pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against paying a guy for a volunteer job," said one board member, asking 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bonuses voted by the board: deferred salary continuation for 418 
full-time employees, which amounted to $7.7 million, and a bonus pool of $1 
million to be shared by about 60 employees.

A GRAYSHIRT SEASON?; KUTZTOWN'S 46-YEAR-OLD DEFENSIVE TACKLE HAS BEEN A MEDIA 
SENSATION, BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS: WILL HE PLAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sophomore they call "Iceman" rumbles through the crowded campus dining 
hall, stops to run his student ID card through a scanner, gets the go-ahead for 
dinner, grabs his tray and silverware and sets forth to do what college 
football players do best: 
</P>
<P>
 Eat. 
</P>
<P>
 The grub is typical dormitory fare. Tonight's special is sweet potato pie . . 
. with spinach? 
</P>
<P>
 There's enough starch on his plate to open a shirt laundry, but a man's got to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Iceman loadeth. Then, on to the salad bar, where en route he joshes 
with teammates who threaten him with noogies. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated, Iceman says a silent pre-meal prayer, hopeful his signals will 
penetrate the din of a fingernails-on-chalkboard rock song blasting from an 
overhead speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could name that grunge tune, Chuck Roseberry reveals for a moment 
what he is -- a 46-year-old grandfather of four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music?" he says sarcastically. "I thought it was a noisy (ceiling) fan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most thought Roseberry was nuts. Certifiable. It was one thing to make like 
Rodney Dangerfield and go back to school in his mid-40s, quite another to walk 
into the football coach's office and ask for a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what Roseberry did last February. Al Leonzi, the third-year coach 
at Division II Kutztown University, almost split a gut. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're at the wrong office," Leonzi told Roseberry, "You have to go to 
admissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry kept a foot wedged in the door and asked the coach to hear him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonzi told him to pull up a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry successfully begged for the chance to live his life over. The first 
45 years had gone bust. Roseberry had played his last football game 
Thanksgiving Day, 1965, but could never clear it from his memory. 
</P>
<P>
 His school, Warren Hills High of Washington, N.J., had defeated Hunterton 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great game," Roseberry recalls. "At the end of it, I wouldn't go out. I knew 
that was the end for me." 
</P>
<P>
 A good enough linebacker to get recruiting nibbles from UCLA, Miami and Texas, 
Roseberry was, however, an academic failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get in trouble so I wouldn't have to take my 
</P>
<P>
 finals," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry assumed he was stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, no one considered dyslexia. 
</P>
<P>
 Resigned to his fate, Roseberry enlisted in the Navy, served in Vietnam, then 
pursued a career as a police and correctional officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But he always considered himself a social misfit. "If I could have had an 
operation to have the pain removed, I would have done it," Roseberry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Three attempts at marriage failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My drug of choice was alcoholic women," he says between bites of meat loaf. 
Three grown daughters, all from his first marriage, don't speak to him. "They 
treat me like a bum." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he joined the Army Reserves to take advantage of Uncle Sam's 
post-service college plan, only to find himself smack-dab in the Persian Gulf 
War as part of the 402nd Military Police Unit, sucking sand in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Stooped in a bunker, in a scene right out of "Forrest Gump," Roseberry 
confided to a friend about his dumbness, explaining that when he read things, 
the letters were all jumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not dumb," the buddy said. "You've got dyslexia." 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed, Roseberry returned home to learn that marriage No. 3 was over, except 
for the paperwork. Working out in a health club near his home in Pogelsville, 
Pa., he met Abbie Klapac, a perky 40-something aerobics instructor and personal 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Klapac encouraged Roseberry to enroll in school at nearby Kutztown, founded in 
1866 and a quaint jewel of a college town about 100 miles northwest of 
Philadelphia. Kutztown U., which dropped the "State" a few years back, is 
tucked in rolling Pennsylvania Dutch farm country, where time stands still for 
Amish horse-and-buggy rigs that hold up traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry enrolled last January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed the dream," he says. "Abbie told me it was OK to live it." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing football was his own idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking in to ask to play was easy," Roseberry says. "What scared me was 
walking back into an academic situation where I was never successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonzi invited Roseberry to spring practice. If nothing else, the coach was 
going to get some psychological mileage out of it. If he can do it, you sure as 
hell can do it, Leonzi envisioned screaming at his 20-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was in the back of my mind," the coach acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kutztown players didn't know what to make of "Pops." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day I saw him, I didn't know what he was doing," senior linebacker 
John Mobley, the team's best player, remembers. "I thought he was one of the 
coaches. I thought he'd be here a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Holmes, the Kutztown quarterback, was quick to joke, "When he used to 
play, he folded his helmet and put it in his pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound defensive tackle, took it all in stride and 
outlegged a dozen or so quipsters up the dreaded hill climb. 
</P>
<P>
 When fall practice rolled around, so did Roseberry. Matt Santos, the school's 
sports information director, was sitting on a public relations powder keg and 
didn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical of his chances, the coaches never told Santos about Roseberry, which 
explains why there is no biography of the school's second-most famous player -- 
Buffalo Bill receiver Andre Reed also slept here -- in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonzi cut 26 players to reach his final roster. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Roseberry into his office to tell him he was among the chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made the team," Leonzi says flatly, making clear he was not party to any 
public relations hanky-panky. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry remembers his emotions ranged from shock to happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Griffith, a freshman nose tackle at Kutztown, didn't know what to think. 
His father, Bob, had played against Roseberry in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not embarrassed to call it a mid-life crisis," Roseberry says of his 
pursuit. "People can call it whatever they want. I call it a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rennie Sacco, Kutztown's trainer, could write a thesis on his season with 
Roseberry, known to many as Iceman. 
</P>
<P>
 He came by his nickname honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a new ice machine this year, double capacity," Sacco said. "We're 
using all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco and Roseberry are all but joined at the hip. After a day of full 
contact, Roseberry retreats to the trainer's room and emerges looking like the 
Abominable Snowman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco uses rolls of Saran Wrap to fasten ice-packs to most of Roseberry's 
moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry hurts most of the time. He has tendinitis in both knees and his 
right shoulder needs a daily jolt of electronic stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Wednesday practice, he popped an antibiotic into his mouth before 
limping off to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gulf War syndrome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who returned from Operation Desert Storm, Roseberry suffers from 
undiagnosed maladies that include bloated stomach and aching joints. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like every day having a mild case of the flu," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, every day he can, Roseberry drags himself to the practice field, 
something not all Kutztown players can say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've accepted him," Griffith, sidelined because of a shoulder injury, said 
as he watched practice. "I'm injured at 18. I took a pounding. Yet he's 
practicing and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco says few men Roseberry's age would have lasted this long. The trainer 
says the difference is Roseberry has kept in good shape over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to see a lot of 46-year-old guys," Sacco conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 When Klapac pushed her boyfriend -- now fiance -- back to school, she expected 
he would hit the books, not the blocking sled. Initially, she was against his 
idea of playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck is a man of great heart and great tenacity," she said. "He's as 
stubborn as can be." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roseberry constantly faces the question: 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at heart I never grew up," he explains. "I've always been a kid 
inside. I'm like Peter Pan. I never wanted to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he could not escape the pain of past failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have something we'd like to do over," he said. "This was a bad 
experience, academically. Being a good player and not being able to play 
college football, that was a painful experience in my life. The Lord gave me a 
chance to do it over. He didn't say, 'You'll be 22 again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry is proud of his academic accomplishments at Kutztown. Although 
slowed by his learning disability, he has maintained a 3.0 grade-point average. 
He is carrying 12 credits this semester -- cultural anthropology, history of 
civilization, theater and abnormal psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his dyslexia, Roseberry tapes all of his lectures. He bought two 
sets of books for each class so that Abbie can read along with him. Roseberry 
plans to graduate in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been easy for Klapac, educated in East Coast boarding schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never met anybody with fewer study skills," she said. "I told him, 
'Studying does not mean watching the Eagles game.' But he can listen well. And 
he's used that." 
</P>
<P>
 The pace is starting to take its toll, however, as national newspaper 
reporters and television crews descend onto the campus to chronicle his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos estimates that Roseberry, through mid-October, had granted more than 50 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry has already received seven or eight movie proposals from film 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't discuss his financial future, though, without fear of breaking NCAA 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So that he is not tempted, all business proposals are referred to the school 
president's office. Adhering to Section 12.3 of the NCAA Division II Operating 
Manual, the college formed a sports counseling panel to advise Roseberry about 
future endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the world can't get enough of him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a photo opportunity made in heaven, People magazine last Sunday paid to fly 
Mona Cohn, the recently crowned 48-year-old University of Kentucky homecoming 
queen, to Kutztown to be photographed with Roseberry in a 1962 Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Everyone is dying to know. 
</P>
<P>
 At TC's, a popular steak house near campus, a student is overheard talking to 
a friend: "You think he's going to play this weekend?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only one man knows: Leonzi. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the 52-year-old coach has not seen fit to put Roseberry in a game. 
One theory suggests that Leonzi is milking the story for all it's worth. Once 
Roseberry plays, the theory goes, the fairy tale ends and the camera crews go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The real concern, Leonzi said, is that he is in the midst of turning the 
program around and can't afford to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a 2-9 season, Kutztown has won four games in a row after two losses 
and Leonzi is clearly focused on the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an obligation to coach football," Leonzi said on the practice field as 
he prepared his team for last Saturday's game against archrival Millersville, a 
team Kutztown hadn't defeated since 1980. "I can't jeopardize whether we win a 
football game. When the decision is appropriate, then I'll do it. I don't want 
to jeopardize anybody or make a mockery out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roseberry is running out of games. He did not, in fact, play in the 12-7 
homecoming victory over Millersville. 
</P>
<P>
 At another recent home game, fans started chanting Roseberry's uniform number, 
"Seventy-two, Seventy-two," in a vain attempt to sway the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Klapac was leading the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the coach didn't hear me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news: Three of Kutztown's last four games are on the road, and 
Roseberry does not travel with the team. His last chance to play at home will 
be Oct. 29 against Shippensburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutztown players, some of whom might have resented his publicity at first, 
have clearly rallied around Roseberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been nothing but positive," quarterback Holmes said of Roseberry's 
publicity. "We're excited about all that's gone on. He's our way of putting us 
on the map." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry has a comfortable, albeit different, relationship with his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went away to college to get away from their parents, not to hang out 
with someone old enough to be their dad," Roseberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Roseberry is not totally uncool . He wears his graying brown hair long in 
the back and even has an earring. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Roseberry has not complained about not playing, but he knows 
time is running out. Despite overtures that he will be invited back next 
season, Roseberry said there are few tomorrows for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done this year, no doubt about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco, the team trainer, thinks Roseberry is physically able to play in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But that decision is not his. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonzi promises Roseberry will get his shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Why not put him in on the kickoff team? Then we could say he 
played and we could put balloons in the air,' " the coach said. "But it's got 
to be legit. It's got to be real. I want to put him in for more than one play. 
If he can play the whole quarter, he'll play the whole quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 So, until further notice, it's Shippensburg or bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to play," Roseberry said. "I can play. If I'm good enough to play 
against the first-string offense at Kutztown, I'm certainly good enough to play 
against an opposing offense. I can play. I need the chance to show I can."

WHEN MONEY DOESN'T BUY HAPPINESS; MANNING TURNED DOWN FAR RICHER DEALS TO GET A 
SHOT AT THE NBA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his corner office with the panoramic view of downtown, Jerry Colangelo, 
president of the Phoenix Suns, tries out a recruiting speech worthy of a 
college coach: We have a crackerjack organization, wonderful players, 
supportive fans, small-town lifestyle, sunshine 330 days a year, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he's not talking to a high school kid but a six-year NBA 
professional making $3.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo has salary-cap problems and would have to throw one of his players 
overboard to make any offer at all. Then it would be only -- he can hardly 
believe he's saying this out loud -- $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make a list, he says sensibly. Whenever the sheer weight of logic 
crushes you, make a list. 
</P>
<P>
 One this side of the ledger, he says, we will put our pluses: the players, 
fans, organization, facility, weather, lifestyle, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, there is only one thing: money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams are offering Manning $25 million. Colangelo figures he has a shot, 
but he has been an NBA executive a long time, which means he has seen players 
sneer at better offers and throw millions of dollars back in his face as if it 
were Monopoly money. This is the first time he has ever found himself trying to 
persuade a player to trade $24 million for a bunch of intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Colangelo says they have to talk to reporters, who know the player is 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
 To Colangelo's amazement, the player turns to his agent and, as the Sun 
president remembers it, says, "Well, this is where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how Danny Manning joined the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the deal, Colangelo suggested that Manning's agent call Atlanta to 
tell Stan Kasten, the Hawks' president. According to Colangelo, Kasten 
sputtered that Manning couldn't do that, the Suns didn't even have a slot! 
</P>
<P>
 Then they called the Lakers, whom Manning was to visit, and said they weren't 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said later he had made up his mind before he even got to Colangelo's 
office, when he was standing in the empty America West Arena, thinking, he 
remembers, "I could come to work here every day!" 
</P>
<P>
 They don't make them like that any more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For 5 1/2 seasons in Los Angeles, Manning was the Clipper who never smiled or 
frowned or said much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his agent, Ron Grinker, were turned off early, trying to negotiate a 
rookie contract, which was finally accomplished only after David Stern, the NBA 
commissioner, took over for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grinker and Manning vowed Manning would serve out his time and leave, thereby 
inaugurating a new chapter in Clipper history -- the million-dollar refugee 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith, the franchise's other young star, beat Manning to his own plan, 
signing a token-raise, one-year qualifying offer after his rookie deal was up 
-- in the NBA, a player becomes a free agent after his second contract expires 
-- and forcing a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manning era was shot through with acrimony. The Clippers grumbled behind 
the scenes about Grinker, who did his grumbling about them publicly. Manning 
suffered a knee injury and developed slowly. In the meantime, Grinker said team 
owner Donald T. Sterling questioned Manning's ability, telling the agent that 
perhaps Manning had merely been a good college player. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning and the Clippers took off under Larry Brown in the spring of 1992, but 
a season later the player and the hard-driving coach were again at odds, as 
they had been at Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Clippers' last playoff appearance -- a Game 5 loss at Houston in 
1993 -- an emotional Manning surprised everyone by saying he would consider 
re-signing. The sides were soon close to agreement on a five-year, $25-million 
deal, but negotiations broke down again. Manning signed his own one-year 
qualifying offer and was finally packed off to Atlanta for Dominique Wilkins, 
another free-agent-to-be whom the Clippers also let leave. 
</P>
<P>
 If futility had an image, this was it. For their time and trouble, the 
Clippers got nothing. Six years later, they are starting over. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody won. Manning challenged the Clippers to prove they wanted to win. They 
thought he was high-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard," Manning says. "Every day in the off-season, you work out with 
the thoughts of competing for a championship, wanting to get better. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We were always talented. There was never a doubt about talent on the team. It 
was just a matter of us staying together long enough. . . . We went through so 
many hardships but we didn't get to enjoy the good times together that we 
should have because of the hardships we went through. And I think that was very 
unfortunate for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Manning passed up another $25-million offer from the Hawks for a 
better one in Phoenix: $1 million now, the chance to play on a championship 
contender, the rest of the $24 million later -- assuming his surgically 
repaired knee doesn't fail in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning doesn't discuss it, but the insurance he carries probably doesn't 
cover a pre-existing condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk he is running is what makes this special. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny has been very diligent with his money, to a point of knowing that money 
is not what it's all about," Grinker says. "In spite of players getting $40 
million, $50 million and maybe $100 million, I see Danny smiling a lot more now 
than I've ever seen him since leaving Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's nice. It's refreshing. It's wholesome." 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns are swimming in wholesome. After Manning's announcement, they got 
Wayman Tisdale, a free agent departing Sacramento, to turn down a $2.4-million 
offer from the Clippers -- for $850,000 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisdale had averaged 56 losses for his five full seasons as a King and wanted 
to see how the other half lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah," Tisdale says. "You learn to appreciate a lot more of the things 
that are real and what's real is winning in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you can say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm getting paid.' But when you go 
home and really sit down, any player who has pride, he's not happy. And that 
was my whole thing and I'm sure it was Danny's thing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "(When the Suns called) I said, 'When do you want me in town?' Once I got 
here, saw the atmosphere, saw the reality, the good people who are here, it was 
pretty easy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can it work? 
</P>
<P>
 Superstar jams in the NBA often turn into ego wars of the kind fought by the 
West-Baylor-Chamberlain Lakers, but this situation looks more promising. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, everyone knows who is first in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any superstars," Charles Barkley says, "except me. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about it. I just do my thing and hope they can catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second place, Manning is there at Barkley's invitation. The two talked 
last season and Barkley told Manning he ought to come to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 They seem made for each other on a basketball court. Barkley is a 6-foot-5 
power forward who can rebound but has trouble guarding taller players. Manning 
is a 6-10 small forward who can guard taller players. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley expects to lead. Manning expects to complement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to knock Danny Manning, but Charles is a superstar," guard 
Danny Ainge says. "I think there's only a handful of them in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 When Barkley retires -- he again is vowing this is the year -- Manning will 
become "the man." It might take him a while to grow into it, as it did at 
Kansas, with the Clippers and the Hawks, but he has the ability, if not the 
disposition. It is where he has always been headed, although it has taken some 
time to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about on the court," Manning says. "Because when I get on the 
court, I'm versatile enough, I'm unselfish enough, I'm going to get along with 
my teammates and I'm going to hopefully make them better. That's what I like to 
do when I step out on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about the basketball. Basketball's the easiest part to me. The 
hard part's trying to get all these damn (moving) boxes out of my house. 
They're everywhere. That's the hard stuff." DANNY MANNING'S NBA STATISTICS

OTTON STAYS IN THE PICTURE; SOPHOMORE FILLS TALL ORDER WITH ROB JOHNSON INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Trouble in Tumwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday afternoon in Tumwater, Wash., Sid and Marjean Otton were 
relaxed, leaning back on their sofa, watching the early going of the 
USC-Stanford football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Their son, Brad, is the USC sophomore backup quarterback. He didn't figure to 
play Saturday, though. Starter Rob Johnson was back in action, after a weekend 
off with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, however, Johnson tumbled to the ground, having 
re-sprained the ankle. He couldn't walk, and was helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton's parents were suddenly on the edge of the sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera focused on son Brad, hurriedly warming up on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw him direct one running play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then: Pop! 
</P>
<P>
 The Tumwater cable system crashed. No picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went leaping to the phone and asked someone out of town to record it for 
us, then we ran for the car, drove eight to 10 miles outside of town to a 
friend who was on another cable system, and watched it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only missed his first couple of passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley Michael Otton, like the player he has temporarily replaced, is the son 
of his high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Otton was seated in the stands at Oregon State when his son went all the 
way for the Trojans in a 27-19 victory, and as luck would have it, the guy 
seated right in front of him was Bob Johnson, the El Toro High coach, and Rob 
Johnson's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to evaluate Brad's quarterbacking in the Oregon, Oregon State and 
Stanford games, Sid Otton cautioned that such analyses by fathers might be 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the football field, Brad's always had a special charisma about him that's 
made him a good field general," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always had poise, and he's showed that in the games. I guess I'm most 
happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, USC Coach John Robinson said much the same thing at his Tuesday media 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otton's play has really been a boost for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing a backup quarterback has to do when he has to play 
is go in there and not look scared, to play like he enjoys it. And Brad's done 
that -- creating a sense of ease. He's even giggled at times in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He missed a couple of throws Saturday that might've broken the game open for 
us, but I have a very positive feeling about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, who expected to play only in late-game, mop-up situations when this 
season began, is 30 for 56 in passing, having done most of that in the last two 
games. He has thrown two touchdown passes and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-feet-6, he's the tallest USC quarterback ever. 
</P>
<P>
 And he fell out of the Big Sky onto the USC campus last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton was a freshman starter at Weber State in the Big Sky Conference last 
season, when the university trustees began making noises about curtailing -- or 
even dropping -- the football program. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton was a 58% passer -- he had thrown for 536 yards in a 67-28 victory over 
Northern Arizona -- and had thrown 16 touchdown passes. "I was in a situation 
where I had three years left and I was in a program where I felt the 
administration wouldn't give a commitment to the football program," Otton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was going to transfer, that was the time I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Otton and his father talked with Brigham Young, Montana, Idaho, Washington 
State, Fresno State and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Riley, USC's offensive coordinator, figured he had an edge. Sid Otton had 
played high school ball in Idaho for Riley's father, Bud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad and his dad contacted us, and we got a film of his 500-yard game with 
Northern Arizona," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched it with John, and he said, 'Recruit him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Otton, who visited three schools in five days in late January, first 
committed to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after I told Coach (Mike) Price I'd come to Washington State, he 
called me," Otton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They already had six quarterbacks in school and when they heard I was coming, 
they were all in (Price's) office the next day, he said. He also said the 
quarterbacks' parents were calling him. So we agreed it wouldn't be a good 
situation, and I called Coach Riley and told him I'd come to SC." 
</P>
<P>
 So Otton enrolled for the spring semester and, because he was transferring 
from a Division I-AA school to a I-A program, was not required to sit out a 
year. He joined the Trojans for spring practice and did well, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at that, he was a distant No. 3 on the depth chart. The backup then 
was junior Kyle Wachholtz. But Wachholtz became academically ineligible, making 
Otton No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton still had little expectation of getting serious playing time this year. 
Johnson came into the season as a Heisman Trophy candidate . . . and began 
encountering misfortune in Week 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Speared in the back in the Washington game, he was slowed somewhat for two 
games with a sore lower back. Then he suffered a high ankle sprain -- the 
slow-to-heal kind -- against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton came on to complete seven of 15 that night, in a 22-7 USC loss. 
</P>
<P>
 He was solid and consistent at Oregon State, completing 13 of 21 for 208 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But against Stanford, Otton said, he wasn't satisfied with his play after 
Johnson suddenly went down again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy we won, but my performance was mediocre," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't mentally ready. I didn't throw real well. Rob had come back during 
the week, it was going to be his show. I kind of took a step back, mentally. I 
wasn't even paying close attention early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't make that mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Robinson said Otton probably would start against Cal on Saturday at 
the Coliseum, that Johnson might suit up and play "in an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 USC players have remarked on Otton's poise under fire in his limited duty this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's cool," tailback Shawn Walters said. "He makes everyone at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year-old sophomore, Otton is old enough to be in the NFL with his old 
Washington prep rival, Drew Bledsoe. But he had a redshirt year at Weber State, 
then went on a two-year Mormon mission in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for his father, Otton was a backup in his junior year of high school, 
on a team that went 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still hear about that from his mother," Sid Otton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great team Brad's senior year, when he started. We were 13-0 and 
didn't have a close game. And Brad was upset with that, that we weren't 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Otton threw 29 touchdown passes that season, but Bledsoe, from Walla Walla, 
got most of the recruiting attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Otton urges Robinson to be patient with his son. The best is yet to come, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad's physically a late bloomer," he said. "When he was 16, he was 5-7, 128 
pounds. He was 6-1 and 145 as a junior, and 6-4 and 175 as a senior." 
</P>
<P>
 Might be that by Otton's senior season, USC fans will remember Otton's 
sophomore year as the year he was "only" 6-6.

MIKE DOWNEY: SANITY THREATTENED BY A PLAYER'S GREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exactly who does Sedale Threatt think he is? Does this guy honestly believe 
that the Lakers cannot get along this season without him? Did this guy actually 
talk himself into walking out on his teammates in the middle of the night 
because the cheapskate Lakers were paying him only $2.4 million a year not to 
be a starter?  
</P>
<P>
 It might be different if this very replaceable player represented the entire 
future of the franchise, the way, say, Glenn Robinson theoretically does in 
Milwaukee. Or it definitely would be different if this individual had a 
loophole in his contract granting him the right to remove himself from training 
camp until his contract situation was resolved, the way the unfairly criticized 
Anfernee Hardaway did in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not what we have here. What we do have is a second-string point 
guard, Threatt, with two years remaining on his very generous contract. When 
the Lakers awarded all this money to him, NBA teams were not exactly pounding 
on Sedale Threatt's door. Until he turned up in L.A., in fact, this guy was a 
classic example, if ever there was one, of Just Another Player. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing anything, period," a clearly irritated Jerry West said with 
conviction, as the Lakers prepared for Tuesday night's exhibition with the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Good. If Sedale Threatt wants a contract extension, let's see if he can get 
one from the CBA Rapid City Thrillers. Or maybe in Spain. Because no other NBA 
general manager in his right mind is going to give this ingrate a longer, 
richer contract, should the Lakers cut him loose. Threatt is hardly a guy who 
is going to turn a good team into a great team, or a fair team into a good one. 
He couldn't start for the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Greed is a character flaw that makes malcontents of otherwise reasonable human 
beings. It makes one wonder how Sedale Threatt can look at himself in the 
mirror. He is not a bad guy on the whole, but does he honestly believe the 
Laker offense revolves around him? Or that people come out to see him? Does he 
take pride in being beaten out for a starting job by Nick Van Exel, a tiny 
rookie picked 37th in the draft? 
</P>

 A monster was created when the owner of the Charlotte Hornets gave so much 
money to Larry Johnson that every other player in the league feels underpaid. 
Alonzo Mourning deserves more than Johnson because he is the best player on 
their team. But if you pay Mourning more than Johnson, the rest of the Hornets 
will have to get by on minimum wage. How rich can one owner be? 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's this salary-cap business, which is having a trickle-down 
effect on baseball and hockey. First-year players are making more than Charles 
Barkley, as was duly noted this week by none other than Charles Barkley. Ron 
Harper was already making more than Michael Jordan when Harper demanded a raise 
from the Clippers. Harper couldn't carry Jordan's you-know-what. Yet who gave 
Harper his sweet new deal? Jordan's old team, Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie Robinson wants $100 million from Milwaukee. The owner isn't sure 
the entire franchise is worth $100 million. Robinson hasn't played one minute. 
His nickname shouldn't be "Big Dog." His nickname should be "Greedy Pig." 
</P>
<P>
 These guys live in dream worlds. They have a center on the Clippers, one 
Stanley Roberts, who is larger than most centers, including the World Trade. 
Roberts recently expressed a desire to be thought of around Los Angeles someday 
in the same terms as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. This guy must be smoking Twinkies. It 
would take Stanley Roberts two more good seasons to approach Benoit Benjamin's 
stats. 
</P>
<P>
 We become accustomed to athletes wanting things their way. Orel Hershiser, who 
applied for free agency Tuesday because he could, once stated memorably that 
the reason baseball players seek better deals is because, "That's the way we 
keep score." And he is correct in that it falls under the heading of free 
enterprise, but it also leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of customers who 
would like to believe that an athlete might accept a wee bit less, simply to 
stay and play for them.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler, too, seemed stubborn and pig-headed Sunday when he openly 
defied his coach, Art Shell, by changing plays and then arguing on the 
sideline. It would be nice to be able to defend Hostetler by saying that the 
Raider coaching staff's play-calling is so terrible -- which it is -- that the 
quarterback should call audibles whenever he can. But we can't, because defying 
authority creates anarchy and puts Shell in the position of not being able to 
control his team. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Clippers walked out of camp Monday and one might say that the 
unfortunate thing is that more of them didn't. Who knows what was bothering 
Elmore Spencer? Maybe he wanted Stanley Roberts' meal money. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Lakers, if they cave in to a player with two years remaining on his 
contract, particularly a player who could be adequately replaced with one phone 
call, then they are nuts and deserve one another. And one thing we know about 
Jerry West. He's not nuts.

NHL LABOR; NEITHER SIDE WANTS TO BE FIRST TO CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the 18th day of a dispute that has wiped out 98 games and threatens to 
consume the season, the NHL and its players' union couldn't agree Tuesday on 
who will pick up the phone to arrange the next negotiating session. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke, in Los Angeles as part of a 
cross-continent tour to promote the league's point of view, acknowledged he 
doesn't foresee a quick settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL 
Players Assn., have not talked since Oct. 11, when the NHL rejected the 
players' last proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always an optimist, but right now I don't have much hope or faith," Burke 
said. "After we rejected their last proposal, Gary Bettman asked, 'Is there 
anyone in this room who can't afford to go a season without hockey? Is anyone 
unwilling to go a season without hockey?' That is not our desire, but the fact 
of the matter is we're prepared to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said he has been told it's common for negotiations to hit a lull, but he 
is frustrated with the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes on to a serious length, it will start to look silly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he is not prepared to initiate contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our phone numbers work too, you know," he said. "Nobody on their side has a 
broken finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said he won't make the next move, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our last proposal was sent back and rejected," he said. "They said we'd gone 
backward. Given that response, the league's rejection, it's clear they're 
committed to a major fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight centers on how to help subsidize small-market clubs. The NHL's last 
plan included a gradual payroll levy that would increase at a rate of 5% for 
every $325,000 a team spends on salary over a negotiated figure. The top rate 
would be 122%. 
</P>
<P>
 The league also proposed a flat 3% levy on the gate receipts of the top 16 
revenue-earning clubs, to be credited against the payroll levy. Minimum payroll 
levels would be established to ensure players' salaries would not decrease from 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that formula would punish teams with high payrolls and 
drive down salaries. Its last plan also featured a graduated payroll levy of up 
to 7% on the top four revenue-earning clubs. Its gate receipts levy was also 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
 King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA's negotiating committee, 
repeated players' claims that owners exaggerate their financial straits to 
provide a reason to limit salary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a ton of money that's there and they're disguising it. A ton," he 
said. "How many teams are reporting losses, and what are the losses for teams 
whose arenas are owned by the same owner? We want them to make money. Just 
don't put us in shackles to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Burke: "We understand each other. We just can't agree on a damn thing." 
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings and Mighty Ducks will release ticket refund information today or 
tomorrow, as will most NHL clubs.

CLIPPER UPDATE; SPENCER WON'T EXPLAIN WALKOUT

 Clipper center Elmore Spencer, who stormed out of practice Monday night at UC 
Irvine and walked three miles to the team hotel, met with General Manager Elgin 
Baylor and Coach Bill Fitch Tuesday to explain his temper tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a private matter," Spencer said before Tuesday night's game against the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with the GM, I talked to the trainer and I talked to the coach. It's 
been dealt with in a professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer declined to explain why he didn't act in a professional manner when he 
departed practice 15 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to answer, but it's personal," Spencer said. "It has been 
resolved. Actions were taken and both parties are ready to move on." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There were no new developments in the walkout of Laker guard Sedale Threat, 
who left the team in an apparent attempt to get a contract extension.

 The Clippers will play the Denver Nuggets tonight at 7:30 at the Sports Arena 
while the Lakers play the Seattle SuperSonics at 7:30 at the San Diego Sports

BRAVES WON'T TRY TO KEEP PENDLETON 
</P>

<P>
 Terry Pendleton, the National League's most valuable player in 1991, will be 
let go by the Atlanta Braves, the team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves will not offer Pendleton salary arbitration for next season, making 
him eligible for free agency. Pendleton, 34, has been with the Braves since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not in our plans for next year," Brave spokesman Jim Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz said Pendleton's age and the high salary the team would have had to 
pay to keep him contributed to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Pendleton hit .252, with seven home 
runs and 30 runs batted in.

BASEBALL LABOR; TALKS TO BE RESUMED BY USERY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's labor talks will resume in Washington today with what is expected 
to be mostly a procedural session with special mediator William J. Usery. Daily 
negotiations are not likely to begin until next week and there is no indication 
of a change in positions by either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any reason to believe Bud Selig has changed his mind one bit, 
but hope springs eternal," union lawyer Eugene Orza said Tuesday in reference 
to the acting commissioner and the owners' quest for a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig confirmed that there has been no change in the owners' proposal and said 
he would honor Usery's desire for a gag rule on negotiating specifics. Selig 
said the mediator has already been in contact with both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of catching up to do and he's doing that aggressively," Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, 17 more players filed for free agency Tuesday, among them Bo 
Jackson and Rex Hudler of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's negotiating meeting with Usery, management lawyers Dick Ravitch and 
Chuck O'Connor will be accompanied by 11 of the 12 owners and club executives 
selected by Selig to his original negotiating team, including Colorado Rockies 
owner Jerry McMorris, who has maintained the closest ties to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said six or seven members of the players' negotiating committee would 
attend the first negotiating session since Sept. 9 and only the fourth since 
the strike began on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been some speculation that Usery will be the means by which 
the owners save face and eventually back off of the salary cap, an attorney 
familiar with the situation said the owners still seem determined to implement 
their proposal unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides are in a box they can't get out of," he said. "The players will 
never approve a cap, and the owners have already wiped out the season and World 
Series. They aren't going to change directions now."

BASEBALL LABOR; DODGERS DON'T OFFER GROSS ARBITRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers picked up the 1995 option on Jeff Treadway on Tuesday, but did not 
offer arbitration to pitcher Kevin Gross, who had free agent repeater rights 
and now becomes an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, said the club retains interest in 
re-signing Gross but not through arbitration, a process in which the Dodgers 
would be unable to hold the line on his $2.7-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not closing the door on Kevin, but we recognize he has other doors now 
as a free agent," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger executive also revealed that he expects to meet soon with free 
agent third baseman Tim Wallach and his representatives but that he told 
Wallach's attorney by phone Tuesday that the Dodgers are extremely high on 
third baseman Ron Coomer, who drove in 123 runs at Albuquerque, and "we think 
Coomer has a very good chance to be ready" in 1995. ROSS NEWHAN

NO MERE ANCIENT MARINER; AT 76, MCEWEN HAS SEEN SOUTHLAND SPORTFISHING GROW -- 
AND SUPPLY OF FISH SHRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ed McEwen watched from the Pacific Queen as anglers and deckhands from Frank 
LoPreste's Royal Polaris spread their bounty of yellowfin tuna over the 
concrete concourse at Fisherman's Landing, wall to wall. If McEwen were 
inclined to rages born of frustration, he might have split the rail with one of 
his large, hard fists, and his deep voice could have been heard all around Fish 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But McEwen was quiet and relaxed, knowing that although this day was the Royal 
Polaris' day, tomorrow could easily be the Pacific Queen's. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know from one day to the next," McEwen said. "Nobody can be right 
on 'em all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 If McEwen has learned one thing in his 60-some years in the sportfishing 
business, it's that "you can't out-guess the fish." 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen will be one of a couple of dozen skippers sharing such knowledge Nov. 5 
at the Sportfishing Assn. of California's Casino Night fund raiser at Ports O' 
Call Village on the San Pedro waterfront. He has been doing it longer than any 
of them, since the very beginning of Southern California's sportfishing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it all," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 McEwen, 76, is the Santiago of the Southland. Hemingway should have done at 
least a chapter on him. He has seen sportfishing when you got a cane pole with 
a hand line and could fish all day for $2 and were home sipping whiskey before 
the horizon swallowed the sun like a marlin grabbing a mackerel and "we thought 
a long trip was (from Long Beach) to the Huntington Beach Flats," because there 
was no reason to go any farther, unless your appetite was for bluefin, and then 
you simply went to Santa Catalina Island, the island of romance, where the sun 
felt warm and the sea promised . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway aside, McEwen would prefer to believe the only thing he and old man 
Santiago have in common is an affinity for the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God every day that he's given me the health and the ability to do 
what I like to do," he said. "I love to fish, and I feel good when I'm on the 
ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen the industry survive the Great Depression and World War II. But 
old? Only in that he was around when deckhands worked only for the fish they 
could catch and sell, and when instinct, not electronics, told you when to tell 
your customers to reach for their rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dog-eat-dog," McEwen said. "Still is." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not that bad. SAC, organized by Bill Nott in 1972, has unified the 
Southern California sportfishing industry to work for common interests. Rival 
boats often share information on where the fish are. It's competitive, but it's 
not cut-throat anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a game," McEwen said. "Everybody wants to win. You want to be the 
high boat. You want to carry the most passengers because that's where the money 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the good old days were something else. 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen grew up in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started fishing in the late '20s on the Music," he said. "It was like a 
carnival (on) the Pine Avenue Pier. Every boat had its own barker. 'Come ride 
the big, fast Music! . . . Come ride the Paula G! . . . The Moonlight! The 
Water Witch!' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd come down after school and haul people's fish off the pier for tips. I'd 
fish on weekends. The boat crews did not get paid. We got two spots alongside 
the bait tank to fish. You could buy a $10 commercial license and you were 
legal to sell fish. That's how I worked my way through school. That was a way 
of life." 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen and Nott worked side by side on the Music as teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fish were large," McEwen said. "The equipment was bad -- well, not good 
-- big, old linen line. When it got wet it'd swell up like a rope. You couldn't 
break it, but you couldn't cast it very well, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1936, the guys in the Tuna Club (at Avalon) were agitated because sport 
boats were over there catching yellowfin tuna and selling 'em. They didn't like 
the competition in catching fish they wanted to weigh in for the Tuna Club." 
</P>
<P>
 So, McEwen says, the politically positioned members of the Tuna Club got a law 
passed, making it illegal to sell fish caught on a sportfishing vessel, and a 
lot of deckhands had to find other ways to make a living. McEwen took out state 
license No. 13 -- he wasn't superstitious -- and started running a boat in 1937 
from the old Santa Clara Landing in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We more or less started the run to Catalina Island from Long Beach," he said. 
"The normal fare in those days was $2. We were going to charge $3 because we 
had a twin-screw boat, the Sea Sport, and there was only two of them in 
operation (in Southern California). 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'You'll never make it. People won't pay that much to go 
fishing.' But it was very popular. We caught lots of fish, including tuna. In 
those days you could catch a lot of bluefin right at Catalina." 
</P>
<P>
 Most sportfishing shut down with World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you fished out of the Port of Long Beach or San Pedro there were submarine 
nets, and they wouldn't drop the nets to let you out before 8 o'clock in the 
morning," McEwen said. "There were all kinds of albacore out there but very few 
boats could or would fish them because you had to leave so late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the good boats were requisitioned during the war so they could make 
fireboats out of them, including the boat I was running. I ran a passenger 
vessel from Mormon Island in Wilmington to Cal Shipyard, and I also ran a twin 
Diesel water taxi to the Channel Islands when they were building bases up 
there. Only two of us were allowed outside to make those trips. We carried 
Corps of Army Engineers and high-test aviation gas. No piers. We had to roll 
everything overboard, put a line on it and snake it through the surf." 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, McEwen and the late Pop Leavitt bought a boat, the Fisherman, 
and started running trips in 1947. They operated Pacific Landing until 1971, 
when Long Beach needed the property for the Gerald Desmond Bridge. McEwen moved 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a far cry now from the early days of sportfishing," McEwen said. "It was 
a tough business, but the fishing was great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, we have all the electronics, with fish finders and navigation 
equipment and air-conditioning, but we don't have the fishing we had then. It 
seems we're having to go farther out all the time. Sportfishing needs more 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large part of (the problem) is overfishing commercially. Certainly, the 
sport boats have put a big dent in the population. But the biggest single thing 
has been the gill-netters in the Micronesian South Pacific. Just absolutely 
annihilated them. Monday we had five bluefin tuna and two big yellowfin tuna. 
Three out of those seven fish had net marks on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pollution has certainly hurt. We've cleaned up our ocean a lot in the last 10 
years. I don't see the Styrofoam cups and beer cans floating around like I used 
to. But the United States coastline and the world as a whole needs to find a 
better way of disposing of sewage other than dumping it in the sea. The ocean 
is like a big room. All you're doing is sweeping it from one corner to the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 SAC, now headed by Bob Fletcher, with Nott still pulling an oar as president 
emeritus, has helped sportfishing by fighting the domestic and international 
political battles to keep the industry afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has unified sportfishing and done for the group as a unit what none of us 
could ever do as individuals," McEwen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another boost has been the recent tuna bite, but the boats still have to find 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was just explaining to the crew, we've been running a day and a half and 
(usually) fishing outside, trying to get the big bluefin," McEwen said. "We've 
been pretty successful at it, except (one day) we got into a big school of fish 
and landed only five out of 30, 35 hookups, although the smallest fish of the 
five was 164 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 On the next trip, McEwen, noting that half his passengers had light tackle, 
polled them on their preference: bluefin or yellowfin. Yellowfin won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those slick, hot, glassy days with no current and the fish 
would lay down underneath you and wouldn't bite," McEwen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is always tomorrow, and the intermittent El Nino currents that 
brought warmer water in recent years are expected to return in 1995, McEwen has 
been told. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks very much like we could have another very big tuna year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it's no time to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the SAC Casino Night fund-raiser Nov. 5 at Ports O' Call in San 
Pedro are $35, with sales limited to 300. Details: (619) 226-6455.

LONG BEACH STATE SUSPENDS COACH, SEVEN RUNNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State has suspended Coach Andy Sythe and seven members of the 
combined men's and women's cross-country team for an incident stemming from a 
preseason initiation ritual involving alcohol, school athletic officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sythe, six female athletes and one male will not be allowed to participate 
Saturday when the 49ers compete in an invitational at Cal Poly Pomona.With only 
three female runners eligible, the women will not have enough members to 
qualify for team scoring. Seven men remain eligible, enough to possibly gain 
points as a team. First-year assistant Gwendolyn Loud probably will coach the 
team Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The athletic department only became aware of the initiation incident on Sept. 
28," Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said in a statement. "After conducting a 
thorough investigation, we believe this incident represents a very serious 
violation of university policies that cannot be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Sythe would not comment when reached at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions are the result of an incident in August involving current and 
former team members and alcoholic beverages at the team's preseason training 
camp, conducted near Trinity Lake in Northern California, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sythe, in his sixth season as coach, didn't participate in the incident and 
didn't have knowledge of it when it occurred. However, he has been suspended 
for failing to report the matter to athletic department officials in a timely 
manner upon his being made aware of the incident, O'Brien said. JASON REID

ANGELS, DAVIS CLOSE TO CONTRACT ACCORD; BUSINESS: PROPOSED DEAL WOULD COVER 
THREE YEARS FOR AN ESTIMATED $11.25 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE AUTRYS MIGHT BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OTHER OWNERS WOULD SAY ABOUT THE OFFER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels are close to a deal with designated hitter Chili Davis on a 
three-year contract worth about $11.25 million, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract still must be presented to owner Jackie Autry for approval, but 
each side was optimistic Tuesday that a deal could be completed within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective and understanding of the situation, everybody is in 
agreement where Chili belongs," said Adam Katz, who along with Tom Reich 
represents Davis. "We're approaching an agreement in a philosophical way. There 
are no major disagreements." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I think we're close. I think it can 
be resolved, one way or the other, in the not-so distant future. We just have 
to be awfully careful. The dollars we're talking about really extends this 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have committed $16 million to eight players for the 1995 
season, must make a decision today whether to offer arbitration rights to 
Davis. They are inclined not to offer Davis arbitration rights, sources said, 
for fear Davis would earn $4.5 million to $5 million for the 1995 season. They 
prefer paying Davis a contract that would average $3.75 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis would become an unrestricted free agent if the Angels do not offer him 
arbitration rights by today's deadline. The Angels could still re-sign Davis, 
but they likely would be competing with at least three or four American League 
teams for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody in this organization wants to bring Chili back," Angel 
President Richard Brown said. "Certainly, Chili would be a prize in anybody's 
lineup. Without Chili, it leaves a power void in our lineup. But it's still 
very, very difficult to do something under the current economic system." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi traveled Tuesday to the Autrys' home in Palm Springs for a 2 1/2-hour 
meeting to discuss, among other matters, the signing of Davis. Bavasi considers 
Davis the Angels' top priority if they are to be competitive in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys, however, have voiced concerns about the signing of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 They are attempting to sell a minority interest in the club, and are worried 
that prospective buyers would not want to be responsible for Davis' contract. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is the concern that their peers would frown upon such a lucrative 
contract while baseball is on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, outfielder/designated hitter Bo Jackson and utilityman Rex Hudler 
filed for free agency Tuesday. Bavasi said he would attempt to re-sign both 
players.

REDSKIN OWNER ISN'T RESTING ON HIS LAUREL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke's quest to move his team to Maryland 
-- and block Baltimore's attempts to attract the Rams -- has continued, despite 
a zoning officer's recent decision to reject Cooke's application to build a 
78,600-seat stadium in Laurel, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, we have been offered a number of sites in Maryland within the 
Baltimore/Washington Corridor (to build a stadium)," Cooke said in a statement. 
"We are assessing their value to us while we take immediate and positive steps 
toward complying with Hearing Examiner Robert Wilcox's decision regarding 
Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first choice with the modifications required by the Wilcox decision 
continues to be Laurel and Anne Arundel County." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL owners approved the Redskins' move to Laurel in September, but Wilcox, in 
denying several zoning exceptions Cooke needs to build the stadium, said the 
property, located about 20 miles south of Baltimore, "is too small for the 
proposed use." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore officials, who are competing with St. Louis and Anaheim for the 
Rams, believed the decision dealt a serious setback to Cooke's hopes of 
controlling the Washington and Baltimore markets, and in turn may ease the 
Rams' fears of possible litigation from Cooke should they decide to move to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke plans to appeal the decision, but Maryland state Sen. John Pica said 
"even if everything went his way, he wouldn't be able to break ground (in 
Laurel) until 1996." The Rams are expected to make a decision by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orange County's Save the Rams Task Force would love to team with the 
NFL on a joint venture to build a stadium in Southern California, the league 
does not appear to be in any hurry to pursue such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aiello, NFL director of communications, said Tuesday the league has not 
commissioned a feasibility study or appointed someone to spearhead a plan that 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue believes would go a long way toward keeping the 
Raiders and/or Rams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 2 Tagliabue went public with the idea, in which the league would enter 
into a partnership to build a stadium that would serve as site of the Super 
Bowl on a rotating basis. The Rams are being courted by St. Louis and 
Baltimore, and there have been reports that the Raiders are considering a 
return to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a germ of an idea and hasn't been taken much farther than that," Aiello 
said. "We don't know what's going to happen in L.A., but we want to maintain a 
presence there." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh Steinberg said he sent a letter to Tagliabue 
promoting Anaheim Stadium as a possible site for a stadium/entertainment 
corridor project but has not heard a reply.BALTIMORE (MD)

JUBILANT SPROULE NOW AN IRON WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a dedicated triathlete would describe swimming, biking and running for 
nearly 13 hours in intense heat and strong winds as "one of the best feelings 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Sproule is now officially a dedicated triathlete. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old from Ventura finished her first Ironman Triathlon world 
championship Saturday in a time of 12 hours 45 minutes 54 seconds. Sproule was 
11th in the 18-24 age group and 999th of 1,500 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the most excellent race," said Sproule, whose longest race previously 
was a half-triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired dentist Jack Perrodin, 65, of Chatsworth was second in the 65-69 age 
group and 1,143rd overall with a time of 13:50:40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the conditions, it was OK," he said of his effort. "The wind was pretty 
tough on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Perrodin won the 55 age group in 1984 and finished second in the 60 age group 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Ilagan, 51, of Thousand Oaks dropped out 93 miles into the bike race 
because of dehydration and a digestion problem. She passed out and required six 
hours of medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a protein drink before the race and that was a mistake," she said. "I 
was really down because I'm not a quitter, but the lesson I learned was 
valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions were brutal during the world championship race, held along Hawaii's 
Kona Coast. Wind gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. and a blazing sun with 85% humidity 
made this perhaps the most difficult Ironman in its 16-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind blows so hard and it's so unpredictable," said Paula Newby-Fraser of 
Encinitas, the women's champion for the fourth consecutive year. "It takes the 
strongest of people with the most resolve and absolutely crumbles them." 
</P>
<P>
 Newby-Fraser's time of 9:20:17 was her slowest since 1987. Greg Welch of 
Australia won the men's race in 8:20:27. 
</P>
<P>
 Sproule was anxious before the race about the mental and emotional highs and 
lows she might face. She stared down those demons and crossed the finish line 
in high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a smile on my face the whole time," she said. "There were no emotional 
lows." 
</P>
<P>
 The swim was difficult because all 1,500 competitors took off at once, 
crowding the water. "It was like swimming in a washing machine," Sproule said. 
"People were on all sides and all I could see was white bubbles in front of my 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiff head winds at times made the bike race the most difficult segment. But 
after climbing a steep hill to begin the marathon, Sproule felt home free. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really forget how long you've been out there," she said. "I looked at my 
watch and realized I'd gone for 10 hours. Yet I felt good. It was an amazing 
sensation."

CSUN'S BEAUREGARD TO BE ARRAIGNED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge lineman Jonathan Beauregard is scheduled to be arraigned 
at 9 a.m. today in San Bernardino Municipal Court on two counts of attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old senior was arrested Aug. 29 and has been free on $15,000 
bail.He remains on the football team, although a broken finger has sidelined 
him the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is accused of shooting his former girlfriend, 21-year-old Dunyella 
Darshell Smith, and her male acquaintance, 26-year-old Von Thompson, in 
Beauregard's hometown of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard allegedly shot Thompson in the arm and chest and Smith in the hip 
as she tried to flee. Thompson, a security guard, was wearing a bullet-proof 
vest at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Thompson and Smith were sitting in Thompson's truck, 
parked outside a bar, when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, an offensive tackle, hid news of the arrest from coaches and 
teammates for more than a month.  
</P>
<P>
 After Northridge administrators learned of the incident earlier this month, 
they declined to suspend Beauregard from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Burt has said that Beauregard technically has not violated team 
rules.

SUNS MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES PLAYING A DOUGHNUT OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They have two All-Stars at forward, two at guard, two more coming off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But at center? 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns have Joe Kleine, who was their third-string center last season, and 
Danny Schayes, who was so far down the Laker depth chart he didn't have a 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns traded Mark West to open the salary slot for Danny Manning. They had 
hoped to sign Robert Parish for $850,000, but the Charlotte Hornets paid $2 
million for the 41-year-old former Boston Celtic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns could have kept Oliver Miller, but when he received a 
$2.5-million-a-season offer from Detroit, they told him to take a hike. Miller 
had been unable to crack the 275-pound barrier and had problems off the floor, 
including an arrest during a wild party after the Game 7 loss to Houston last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miller's agent telephoned last summer, Sun boss Jerry Colangelo wouldn't 
even take the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Colangelo: "When you look at centers around the league, once you get 
beyond (Hakeem) Olajuwon and Shaq (O'Neal), and (Patrick) Ewing and (David) 
Robinson, you've got another little slot with (Alonzo) Mourning and (Rik) Smits 
and (Dikembe) Mutombo and then the rest, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I like to have one of those centers I mentioned? Of course I would. My 
attitude is, you do the best you can and the most you can to get things done. I 
didn't have a chance to get a center and at the end of the year, Paul 
(Westphal, the Suns' coach) wasn't using any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Westphal started Kleine in the Suns' first exhibition, but the 6-foot-8 A.C. 
Green, who guarded Olajuwon during last spring's playoff series, will probably 
play more center than Kleine and Schayes put together. 
</P>
<P>
 Green is no shot-blocker, but he can hold the fort until the double-team 
arrives. MARK HEISLER

DANA PARSONS: PROPOSITION 187 MORE THAN JUST A 'MAD AS HELL' MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On days when I wake up on the right side of the bed, the predicted passage of 
Proposition 187 hardly fazes me. On those days, its passage seems no more 
harmful than people voting for Ross Perot for President in 1992. They knew he 
wouldn't win, but if it made them feel better to blow off some steam in the 
voting booth, then God bless America. 
</P>
<P>
 People may know that Proposition 187 will pass, but will it be enacted in any 
meaningful way? Not even its supporters seem to know for sure, which tells you 
something about the commitment behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Will school officials actively target children of illegal immigrants, assuming 
they even know which parents those are, and expel them? No school official I've 
met would. More to the point, the consensus among educators is that some court 
would immediately stop them from carrying out that part of the proposition, 
because it violates existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Will hospital personnel and social workers refuse services to illegal 
residents? No one seems sure of how that would happen, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Will those same professionals report suspected illegal residents to the 
authorities, as the proposition requires? Doubtful, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that, what's the point of Proposition 187? Why not dismiss it as nothing 
more than a "mad as hell" measure and simply roll over and go back to sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it demands more attention, if only because the latest polls 
indicate that 60% of the registered voters support it. We're not talking about 
a radical fringe, or even the national constituency of 20% who voted for Perot. 
You can't ignore an issue when 60% of the electorate supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what is it that Proposition 187 supporters are trying to say? 
</P>
<P>
 The convenient comeback is to say that the measure is racially motivated. I 
won't play that game, because it's arrogant to say that all or even most of its 
supporters back it for racist reasons. Yes, it's the height of stupidity to say 
that none do, so that argument merely goes round and round all day. Sure, I ask 
myself if 187 supporters would turn in an illegal Finn with as much relish as 
an illegal Nicaraguan, but they each must answer that question for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other niggling details get in the way of the racism argument. The first is 
that assimilated Americans have over the decades been equal opportunity 
naysayers when it came to immigrants: our ancestors railed against the 
white-faced Irish, German and Italians with the same gusto people now have for 
the Asians and Latinos. The other pertinent fact is that Latinos tell pollsters 
they're as upset with illegal immigration as are Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's take the 187 supporters at their word, that they're genuinely upset that 
"illegal" residents get services. Inherent in that argument is that these 
"resident frauds" are costing us lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, resident fraud is not much different than doctor fraud, welfare 
fraud, insurance fraud, workers' comp fraud, auto body repair shop fraud, 
Pentagon fraud and whatever fraud you want to toss in. Proposition 187, with 
its severe sanctions not reserved for the other frauds, almost seems to be 
saying that we don't mind being ripped off, but it really irritates us when a 
non-legal resident does it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but it's supporters say, there's a clear distinction between the legal and 
non-legal resident. As a law-and-order guy, I'd agree with that argument in the 
abstract, but the distinction becomes increasingly fuzzy, especially in 
Southern California where the "contribution" of the non-resident is well 
documented. We know they provide services and perform labor and pay taxes and 
spend income in ways that don't distinguish them from legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not naive enough to think that every illegal immigrant comes north to 
work, or that none has found a way to rip off the system, but I would merely 
add those numbers to the fraud departments listed above. No better, no worse. 
By and large, the immigrants are here for jobs and, other than for a piece of 
paper, are indistinguishable from the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all part of the trail of logic that will lead me to vote against 187. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yet, I'm angry too. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm angry because it has polarized the state for no good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm angry because the proposition probably never would have surfaced had not 
the state's economy slumped in recent years. State Department of Labor 
statistics show that 14.5 million people were employed in the summer of 1990, 
compared with 14.2 million this past summer. The unemployment rate went from 
5.4% to 8.3% the last four summers. If those statistics showed economic growth, 
do you think anyone would have dreamed up Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm also angry because we take pride in being a country where laws are created 
in a deliberative process by elected representatives, and instead we get 
something like this, devised by people unknown to the general public and who, 
for all anyone knows, couldn't get elected dogcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm angry because the government let us down on immigration control, and 
Proposition 187 is the result. All mixed in with smatterings of fair play and 
cost-savings are doses of racism, hypocrisy and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 When all is said and done, that will be the legacy of Proposition 187: It made 
everyone mad about something.

OXNARD SEEKS $14-MILLION LOAN TO HELP LURE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard will apply for a $14-million federal loan to help businesses move to 
the city, despite having to pledge some annual federal grants as security to 
qualify for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing Tuesday on the risks and benefits of the loan, offered 
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Oxnard City 
Council unanimously voted to submit the application, citing the opportunities 
the money would create. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to aggressively pursue the type of jobs we want in Oxnard," 
said Councilman Tom Holden. "I think it's a very exciting opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Kinney of Oxnard's Economic Development Corp., which contracts with the 
city to lure business to the area, suggested that Oxnard apply for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses want to move to the city but lack the necessary funds, he 
said. To revive Oxnard's lethargic economy, the city needs to loan those 
businesses the money they need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been making (small) loans to businesses here . . . for 10 years," 
Kinney said. "The loans have all been repaid." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by HUD, the $14 million could be available in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Loans would have to be repaid within 20 years, but if individual loan payments 
were not delivered on time, HUD would withhold future Community Development 
Block Grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received $2.8 million in CDBG funds for 1994-95. Those funds must 
be used to eliminate urban blight or to benefit low- and moderate-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the cities that have applied to the loan program, none has ever had its 
funds taken away, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But low-cost housing advocates, who recently pressed the city to use more CDBG 
funding to build dwellings for low- and moderate-income residents, said they 
were concerned that the businesses could default and HUD would withhold money.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Macri-Ortiz of the Channel Counties Legal Services Assn. said Oxnard 
needs to draft a set of rules to govern the loan process and ensure that the 
city does not play favorites with the money or find itself in a bad deal. 
</P>
<P>
 She warned that the city was putting itself in a dangerous position, 
essentially mortgaging its CDBG funds to insure loans to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the father that goes in and signs the daughter's car loan," 
Macri-Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to vote on each loan application to ensure that they 
receive enough scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance was worried that any jobs 
created through the loan program would be undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard should not use money to create minimum-wage jobs with no benefits," 
McCarthy said. "What the citizens of Oxnard need are higher-paying jobs with 
more benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy and Macri-Ortiz said the city should use some of the $14 million to 
fund low-cost housing. If there is no housing for their workers, businesses 
will not want to move to Oxnard, McCarthy said.  
</P>
<P>
 The money from the program would be used to help businesses move to Oxnard and 
to buy industrial land in the city that could be resold to a manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Macri-Ortiz warned that the city may get stuck with land nobody wants, losing 
its CDBG money and paying HUD for a worthless purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like buying a dress just because it's on sale, only to stick it in your 
closet," she said.

ATTACKS ALONG BOARDWALK STIR FEAR IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The spiked iron bars that separate her condominium pool from the Ventura 
Promenade took on new significance for the 64-year-old woman Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in six days, innocent victims have been violently attacked along the 
boardwalk that runs from the Ventura County Fairgrounds to the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're barricaded here," the fenced-in woman said in frustration, glancing 
periodically toward the boardwalk and requesting that her name not be used for 
fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the woman's condominium Monday night, a U.S. Army sergeant on a 
moonlit jog was beaten and shot near the heart after struggling with as many as 
15 suspected gang members, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, they said, he was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Gabriel Ochoa, 48, a records clerk who jogs regularly, was starting to 
run along the boardwalk just after 10 p.m. near Figueroa Street when 10 to 15 
suspected gang members demanded money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he told them he had no money, the suspects began to hit and kick Ochoa, 
who fought back until one of them fired a small-caliber handgun at him, Sgt. 
Bob Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wounded in the chest, Ochoa was able to run west toward Figueroa 
while the suspects scattered, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long afterward, police caught two suspected gang members on the north side 
of the Ash Street pedestrian bridge that spans the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a 17-year-old Ventura boy, had been named on a previous felony arrest 
warrant for failing to appear in court, authorities said. He and the other 
suspect, a 15-year-old Ventura boy, were booked into Juvenile Hall in Ventura 
on suspicion of attempted murder and attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa, who has spent five years at the Army Armory in Ventura, was released 
Tuesday from Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was lucky," said Walter Shelton, his supervisor at the Armory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Ventura man on a family outing by the pier thwarted a carjacker 
who threatened to drive off in his car with his baby still in her infant seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, the father disarmed the knife-welding suspect and fought him before 
the man ran off. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that same night, three joggers on the boardwalk were accosted by the 
same suspect before they ran from him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Ainsley Laing, 35, a resident of Indonesia on vacation in Ventura, 
stopped while jogging along the Promenade and said, "I won't run at night, not 
after what I've been hearing about this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Strollers, runners and others who were visiting the Promenade Tuesday said 
they were a little more careful because of the attacks, a little more apt to 
look over their shoulder. Many said they would not be out after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very nervous about coming down here now," said Stan Wallman, 67, of 
Ventura, who was walking with his companion, Sophia Simkover, 72. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love coming down here at the end of the day, but when daylight savings 
time ends and it gets dark soon, we'll stop coming," Wallman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer Glen Taylor, 45, his wet suit dripping in the bright sunlight, said, 
"If I see a group of people, especially when it's dark, I avoid them." 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Don Andre, 45, said the city should have never built the boardwalk 
because it draws transients, gang-bangers and other "evil dudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Anderson, who supervises the city's major crimes division, said those who 
victimize people along the boardwalk, particularly gang members, "have no sense 
of responsibility, no sense of the value of life."

NAVY MAY MOVE OUT OF COMPLEX; CAMARILLO: SOME CITY OFFICIALS FEAR SURPLUS 
HOUSING IN MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD GO TO AGENCIES THAT HELP HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy is studying whether to continue using a 315-unit townhouse complex in 
Camarillo, sparking concerns among city officials that the site could 
eventually be turned over to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results of a two-year study, the 51-acre parcel could be 
declared surplus in 1996 and, by federal law, made available to other federal 
departments and then to area homeless agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the image of a massive center for the county's homeless in a middle-class 
enclave has city officials concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want (the property) to be used to satisfy the homeless needs of the 
entire county," Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said. "We want to be ahead of the 
curve and in control. We don't want to have this thing dictated to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said the city, now a member of a countywide housing authority, might 
even consider establishing its own agency to set controls on development at the 
site near the intersection of Las Posas Road and Ponderosa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would enable us to have direct control over the management of the 
facility," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Craven's colleague on the council, Mayor Ken Gose, said that he, too, would 
want to see strict controls over the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in the 'not in my back yard' theory. I think that if we can 
accommodate the homeless and help give them a hand, we should," Gose said. "At 
the same time, we have to protect the rights of the residents who live nearby." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials, however, said there is no certainty that the service will give 
up the site, known as Catalina, and that it has just started a review of 
available housing for sailors stationed at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station and the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme. The 
housing compound is shared by both naval bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is signaling that we are reviewing our housing needs," Navy 
spokesman Alan Alpers said. "Depending on the outcome of that review, we may or 
may not find ourselves in a position where we need to declare Catalina surplus. 
Either way, we are a long, long way from that point." 
</P>
<P>
 With the completion of nearly 400 new housing units at the two bases, the 
Catalina complex may indeed become surplus, depending on how the military 
"drawdown" and next year's round of the base closings affect staffing at the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said that about 1,200 service members and their families live 
in the compound in the city's north central section, a neighborhood of neatly 
kept, stucco and wood single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, homeless advocates say that if the Navy does give up the parcel, it 
will be one of the largest plots of federal land ever relinquished, aside from 
those properties abandoned through previous rounds of the base closure process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a potentially significant piece of property," said Laurel Weir, 
policy director for the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir and Carolyn Briggs, executive director of the Area Housing Authority of 
Ventura County, warned that even if the Navy gives up the land, the federal 
McKinney Act requires that the parcel first be offered to other Defense 
Department agencies and then any other federal agency before it can be turned 
over to local homeless agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen overnight," Briggs said. "But, this could be a dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Briggs said that the site would likely lend itself to housing low- and 
moderate-income families who would live in the townhouses on a transitional 
basis or perhaps on a rent-to-own arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get the property, it will be very highly managed," Briggs said. "It's 
not the kind of place suited necessarily for a big shelter. We would want to 
work very closely with the neighbors and the city on this. It's not like the 
Navy will move out one day and 315 U-Hauls will be seen there the next." 
</P>
<P>
 But Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said the city does not like the idea of 
having such a large social services facility in the middle of the middle-class 
town of 56,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something we are particularly relishing, I can assure," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little added that an amendment to the McKinney Act, now on President Clinton's 
desk, would give localities more control in dealing with surplus military 
property within their jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping (the amendment) will help us, if the president signs it," Little 
said. "At this point our residents shouldn't panic, but we are keeping an eye 
on this situation."

TRASH INCIDENT SPURS CRY OF DIRTY POLITICS 
</P>

 Call it Dumpstergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics can be a dirty business, and things just got a little dirtier in the 
race for the 18th state Senate District, Republican candidate Steve MacElvaine 
said Tuesday. The district covers western Ventura County as well as Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine was referring to an incident involving two paid employees of his 
Democratic opponent, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell. San Luis Obispo police said 
they questioned the two men Friday after they were seen rummaging through a 
trash dumpster late at night near MacElvaine's San Luis Obispo campaign office. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said he believed the two men were looking for campaign information 
both from his office and that of Republican congressional candidate Andrea 
Seastrand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why else would they go through a trash dumpster with flashlights at 10:30 at 
night?" MacElvaine said. "Nixon lost the White House 20 years ago by pulling 
stupid stunts like this." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell and his two aides -- Jerry Wooledge and Geoffrey A. Weg -- did not 
return phone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gavin Payne, O'Connell's campaign manager, said the allegation that the 
aides were looking for campaign files was absurd. Payne said Wooledge was 
searching for a checkbook he had lost earlier in the day at a Bank of America 
branch that shares a parking lot with MacElvaine and Seastrand's campaign 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went back to look for it after he got off work," Payne said. "It's as 
simple as that. I'm mystified as to why they are making a big deal about this. 
We don't care about what's in Andrea Seastrand's trash or Steve MacElvaine's 
trash. That's not what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Luis Obispo Police Department contacted the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and the district attorney about the incident, but authorities have 
decided not to file any charges, Lt. Joe Hazouri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of any criminal violation," Hazouri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Wunder, a Seastrand campaign aide who reported the incident to police, 
said he was returning to Seastrand's office shortly after 10 p.m. Friday when 
he saw two men rummaging in the dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than confront the men directly, Wunder said he drove to the campaign 
office where he planned to call police. But Wunder said when the two men saw 
him they jumped into their car and took off. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he followed in what quickly turned into a high-speed chase. Wunder 
called police from his car phone, and the chase ended a short time later when 
police intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he witnessed the men going through the trash dumpster, Wunder said 
police gave him the option of making a citizen's arrest or referring the case 
to the district attorney's office. He said he chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Wunder questioned why the two men fled if they were only looking for 
a checkbook. He said he believed the men were looking for information to use 
against MacElvaine or Seastrand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if there's nothing illegal about what they did, it's certainly slimy," 
Wunder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Seastrand, who is running against Democrat Walter Capps in the 22nd 
Congressional District, issued a press release Monday demanding an apology from 
O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is this type of cynicism that stabs at the very heart of the political 
process," Seastrand said in her statement. 
</P>

CIVIC AUDITORIUM GETS A FINAL FINE-TUNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As colliding cymbals rang in a brassy crescendo, soundman Shawn Edlund stood 
before several hundred colored buttons and tried to figure out how to patch 
Microphone 24 into Amplifier 3 on Channel 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in layman's terms, how to make the Conejo Symphony Orchestra sound really 
stupendous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 27,000 watts up there," Edlund said, gesturing toward the stage. "We 
can bring up a lot of power." 
</P>
<P>
 But with their energy, as well as their notes, bouncing off every angle of the 
Civic Arts Plaza's jagged walls, the musicians will need little help from 
amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilled to be performing, at long last, in a professional concert hall, 
orchestra members thundered through a blazing rehearsal of Shostakovich's 
"Festival Overture" earlier this week. They will return to the purple-hued hall 
tonight for another run-through before Friday's official opening of the Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, technical crews will scurry around the auditorium testing 
acoustics and adjusting amplifiers in a frenzied bid to tweak Thousand Oaks' 
prized auditorium into tip-top shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly complex," said Gary Mintz, the city's haggard-looking 
technical production manager. "There's just hours and hours of work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the grand opening careening ever closer, that workload has jumped 
dramatically this week. Stagehands need to learn the special effects, ushers 
need to memorize the seating charts and musicians need to adjust their playing 
to match the theater's stunningly clear acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 Percussionist Adam Wells, for example, said he must keep reminding himself to 
relax. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Symphony Orchestra's former home, the gymnasium at Cal Lutheran 
University, musicians had to play in broad, sometimes blaring strokes to reach 
audience members in the back row of hard-backed chairs. In the Probst 
Auditorium, however, they can tone down the volume and focus on nuances -- 
knowing that all 1,800 spectators will hear every note. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the gym, you would bang, you would saw, you would blow," Wells said, 
mimicking the frantic aggression of drummers, violinists and trumpet players 
struggling to be heard. "Here, you just think and it happens. It's not 
necessary to overplay." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The acoustics are so good, symphony director Everett Ascher said, that when he 
was standing in the balcony during a recent rehearsal, "I could swear the 
triangle player was next to me, tapping on cut crystal." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of precision scares, as well as thrills, the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the auditorium have told of unwittingly eavesdropping on private 
conversations, which echo through the hall every bit as clearly as symphonic 
music. That legendary reverberation has put singer Bruce Vandervalk slightly on 
edge, as he prepares to join a 250-member chorus Friday night in belting out 
Beethoven's "Ode to Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to sing very carefully and pronounce the German as best I can," 
Vandervalk said. "If you sing a wrong vowel in here, everyone will be able to 
tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Aiming for a flawless performance, symphony conductor Elmer Ramsey listens 
intently to every note of every rehearsal. Stopping his musicians frequently, 
he asks one to hold a note longer, another to move to a different chair, 
another to aim for a softer sound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the massive sound board, Edlund and other technicians fiddle 
with the controls to even out the music. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not plan to touch the board much during the symphony's portion of the 
opening night concert; the 75 musicians and 250 singers should provide a fairly 
balanced harmony. But sound technicians will need to adjust the microphones 
during Broadway star Bernadette Peters' second-act performance. 
</P>
<P>
 And although they have a rough outline of her show, they will not be able to 
rehearse until Peters arrives at the Civic Arts Plaza, most likely Friday 
morning. Still, technical production manager Mintz is confident his crews will 
pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's going to work," Mintz said, dropping into a plush purple seat, 
exhausted. "Of course it is. I'd go out and drink myself to death right now if 
I didn't think it was going to work."

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; LAPD BEGINS SWITCH 
TO NEW RADIO SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of coping with an electronic Tower of Babel, the Los Angeles 
Police Department has embarked on a plan that will, for the first time, give 
officers the ability to speak via radio to any other officer in any other 
agency, division or nearby city. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, officers are given a radio with only eight channels. 
Officers in the same division and those in adjacent areas are often -- though 
not always -- given radios with the same channels.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it might sound mundane, the channel gap is a serious problem, said 
Sgt. Kurt Miles, the officer in charge of the radio technology unit. 
</P>
<P>
 During a riot, earthquake or any other situation in which officers have been 
sent to areas outside their usual territory, they often found themselves deaf 
and mute, in radio terms, unable to communicate with anyone but their 
compatriots in the home territory, who usually had nothing to do with the 
problem at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has ordered 3,000 Motorola Astro Saber radios -- at a cost of $7.7 
million -- that give each officer 250-channel capability. Officers will have 
access to any of the city government's allotted 57 channels, with room left 
over to plug into the frequencies used by other cities, the L.A. County 
Sheriff's Department and other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it from an officers' safety standpoint," Miles said. "They can 
have contact with anybody from any point in the city. It creates a flexibility 
to pull officers from any section of the city and move them to any area, making 
them a valuable resource wherever we need them." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, one sergeant explained, a particular tactical scene or crime 
situation can have its own frequency, safe from interruptions at key moments by 
stray chatter about other events from outside officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio is a bit smaller than the current models, about half the size of a 
sheet of notebook paper and an inch thick. Officers carry one on their bodies 
and one in the car, with the car model having a bit of extra power. 
</P>
<P>
 The new radios also are digitized, meaning increased clarity and an end to 
officers' fears that their conversations will be monitored by reporters, 
amateurs with scanners -- or, worse yet, the criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In digital mode, the officers have the capability of talking back and forth 
in a completely secured environment," Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said the department is building a new system to handle the digital 
communication devices. The new "radio backbone," will change the whole system 
used to transmit sounds from one officer to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Digitized radios do not transmit the sound of the voice itself, as current 
analog radios do, Miles said, but change the voice to a digital signal -- such 
as those by which computers communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The receiving radio translates the digitized signal back into voice sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It increases clarity, it eliminates a lot of the background noise," he said. 
"The filtering device can eliminate a lot of the garbage that floats along with 
your voice through the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
 The department has just begun soliciting bids to replace all the radio towers, 
computers and repeaters (devices that bounce signals over the mountains and 
around the city) with digital equivalents, Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the system switches over, the officers have been using their new radios 
in the old-fashioned analog mode. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the department has been handing out the new radios to one 
division a month; four divisions of the LAPD's 18 have so far been switched 
over. Miles said he expects all the units to be handed out by October, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's Van Nuys division received 300 radios about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential is going to be great," said Van Nuys Sgt. Alicia Wolin. "It 
just has broader capabilities. We're now more in tune with current technology, 
which makes our jobs a little bit easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said all the feedback his office has gotten has been equally positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love the capability of being able to talk on so many frequencies," Miles 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They can listen to outside agencies that border their divisions and they are 
able to talk to any other entity within the Police Department -- that has been 
a giant step."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENTS MULL SCHOOL CHOICES AT 
COLLEGE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by her father, 15-year-old Michelle Jordan tromped through the 
Thousand Oaks High School gym, bumping elbows with about 2,000 other 
college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm claustrophobic!" the Newbury Park High School junior said, gripping an 
armload of glossy college brochures as she bulldozed her way through the 
student throng. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to College Night -- the Conejo Valley Unified School District's annual 
event where about 100 college representatives tout their schools to Thousand 
Oaks youths. School counselors have sponsored the event for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to familiarize children with colleges throughout the United 
States and get them to think about where they want to go to school," said 
Carole Krieger, a counselor at Newbury Park High. "This gives them a chance to 
see what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the nearly 18,000 students in the district go to college. 
Officials say events like the one held Monday night help bolster that 
statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, kids were waiting in line to get in -- and it's not a 
football game or a basketball game or a rumble," Assistant Supt. Leean Nemeroff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 College Night provided students a plethora of information about schools near 
and far, big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just kind of taking everything," Michelle said, picking through the 
materials she collected on fashion design programs at various colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in school, you were on your own," said Michelle's dad, Tim. "This 
is good; it's giving them an idea. So much of the time, kids just go through 
(school) and don't know what they are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For Westlake High School senior Eric Guenther, 17, College Night was a 
last-minute introduction to college, since applications for UC and Cal State 
campuses are due next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea where I want to go," Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High senior Julie Hansen perused brochures from about six 
colleges she is considering attending next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much last minute," she said of her college quest, "but more about 
learning the administrative process, to make sure I have everything I need." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the colleges represented Monday night, recruiters from Cal Lutheran enjoyed 
the shortest trip to the Thousand Oaks High campus -- about a mile -- while 
others traveled from the Midwest and the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge recruiter Gigi McGuire handed out an off-beat promotion 
-- bumper stickers announcing CSUN's recovery from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have questions about the status of our campus," she said. "It 
has become part of our job to explain what is going on." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: APPEALS BOARDS PAY STRUCTURE CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Individuals serving on the county's Assessment Appeals Boards will now be paid 
$50 less for meetings under four hours and $50 more for meetings that exceed 
the four-hour limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, board members are paid $150 per meeting, regardless of the length. 
</P>
<P>
 County Clerk Richard Dean estimated the change in compensation would save the 
county about $7,500 a year, because most meetings are shorter than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, three-member appeals boards are composed of Supervisor John K. Flynn 
and Jane Tolmach, George Longo, Randy Churchill, Pat Schleve and Bob Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and businesses that believe their property has been unfairly 
appraised for tax purposes may seek to have it altered by the appeals boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards are scheduled to meet twice a week but only convene when appeals 
have been filed. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A farmer Tuesday set ablaze 400 tons of orange tree trimmings in east Ventura, 
sending smoke throughout the area and prompting calls to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials said the controlled burn, at Foothill and Aliso Canyon 
roads, was the largest of several in the county Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 100 tons of orange tree trimmings went up in smoke on Bardsdale Avenue 
near Fillmore, and smaller fires were set near Ojai and in Fillmore, Ventura 
County Fire Department spokesman Charles Carranza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department received about six calls from observers asking about the 
east Ventura fire, according to Carranza. Other residents reported white ashes 
on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Field of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control Department said smoke 
from the fires -- which were permitted by the county -- was not expected to 
affect air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll disperse rapidly and won't be a problem," Field said. IRA E. STOLL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY OKS INCREASE IN FEES, NEW CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and owners of mobile-home parks could soon be charged $36 a year per 
space for the county program that regulates their rent, as part of a large 
package of fee increases and new charges that the County Board of Supervisors 
agreed to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue that the fees bring should make up for a $517,000 reduction in the 
budget of the county Resource Management Agency, which includes environmental 
health, planning and the Air Pollution Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 During a presentation to the supervisors Tuesday, Thomas Berg, the agency's 
director, said the fees will allow the county to charge the people actually 
using services, which are now subsidized by all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and businesses will pay for consultations with county planners and 
for research on illegal property divisions. Also, production companies will 
have to pay more to film in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the county will collect fines from businesses that violate 
laws on weights and measures, such as grocery stores using incorrectly 
calibrated scales. Those violations are now settled in court, with fines are 
paid to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new fees, the county agency will also cut three positions, 
Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors approved all of the increases without objection except for the 
charge to mobile-home park residents and owners in unincorporated areas of 
Ventura County. Supervisor Susan K. Lacey argued that some residents would be 
unable to afford the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4-1 for the fee, which must be approved in a final vote, 
scheduled in two weeks.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; JUDGE DISMISSES SUIT AGAINST POLICE 
OFFICER

<P>
 A former Simi Valley police lieutenant did not falsely arrest a fellow officer 
in connection with a rape investigation two years ago, a Ventura County judge 
has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge William Peck dismissed Paul Nolan's lawsuit against Simi 
Valley police and former Lt. Robert Klamser. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck ruled Thursday that Klamser had probable cause to arrest Nolan on Nov. 
18, 1992, in connection with the alleged 1989 rape of a Simi Valley woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told authorities that Nolan responded to a call to her house June 
18, 1989, then returned later to the home and raped her. Nolan was charged with 
one count of rape but not prosecuted because the victim refused to testify in 
court, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was fired in December, 1992 -- one month after his arrest -- because of 
complaints that he was too aggressive and unprofessional, court records say.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by a series of deadly accidents, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors will lobby Caltrans to improve safety along the stretch of 
California 126 known as "Blood Alley." 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Supervisor Maggie Kildee, the board agreed Tuesday to send a 
letter to the California Department of Transportation, pressing for 
construction of a concrete center divider. 
</P>
<P>
 State transportation officials have resisted the measure in the past because 
many residents, businesses and farmers in the area need to cross the 
thoroughfare and because the highway is in the midst of a widening project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem there are some particular lengths of the highway where the 
safety of the people using it may need to be foremost," Kildee said. "Over and 
over again, people cross over that center line and are hit head-on in the 
opposing lane."  
</P>
<P>
 The curving highway that runs between Ventura and the Los Angeles County line 
has become notorious for dozens of fatal or serious crashes over the years, 
most near Piru and Fillmore. The most recent accident occurred Sunday near Fish 
Hatchery Road when two men were killed and three other people injured in a 
head-on collision. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLAN TO SELL LEMON ORCHARD PROCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dismissing the threat of a petition drive and the impact of their own 
development policies, the Ventura City Council has voted to forge ahead with a 
campaign to sell the city's eastside lemon orchard.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted Monday to order an appraisal on the property and hire a 
consultant to write a request for development proposals, directed at 
prospective builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because three council members have conflicts of interest on the issue and one 
councilman was out of town, only Mayor Tom Buford and Councilman Steve Bennett 
voted for the appraisal and the proposal requests. Councilman Jim Monahan 
opposed the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials warned the council that their efforts could be hampered by a 
save-the-greenbelt petition, which could hold back any proposals for the site 
for at least 1 1/2 years. The city could also be restrained, officials warned, 
by the council's development policy, which stipulates that no more housing 
allocations be awarded until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett and Buford disagreed with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a mistake to say we would wait," Bennett said. "We're all walking 
around wondering what is this thing worth. I think we should all get a taste of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have said they will allow a developer to construct 400 houses 
on the parcel, if the developer donates land and seed money for a large 
eastside park.  
</P>
<P>
 But the lemon orchard is on land designated for agricultural use until 2010, 
and the petition could make it difficult for the city to develop that property 
and any other land within the agricultural greenbelt. The county's election 
division is counting the number of signatures on the petition to see if it 
qualifies as an initiative for the November, 1995, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would give city voters the right to approve or disapprove 
development on any property designated as agricultural until the year 2010. To 
permit development on the orchard now, the council has to order an amendment of 
the city's Comprehensive Plan. CONSTANCE SOMMER

<P>
 Declaring one of California's most contested ballot initiatives "not a nice 
thing to do," Ventura City Council members have passed a resolution opposing 
Proposition 187, a ballot measure aimed at stemming the tide of illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not nice to do to people," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, who asked that 
the issue be brought before the council."It's mean. It's cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle joined Councilmen Gregory L. Carson, Steve Bennett and Mayor Tom Buford 
in voting for the resolution Monday. Tuttle said the initiative is inhumane 
because it would deny essential services such as some health care and education 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Jim Monahan and Rosa Lee Measures opposed the resolution 
because, they said, they did not think the council should take positions on a 
state issue.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Monahan also spoke at length about how people should expend their 
energies supporting legal immigration. He then taunted Carson after Carson 
declared his support for the anti-187 resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you are saying you support illegal immigration?" he asked. "Is that what 
you are saying?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no response. I didn't think it was worth responding to," Carson said 
later. "Comments like that, they sort of speak for themselves."

 Ever wonder why Laguna Niguel's city motto is "Sea Country," even though the 
South County community doesn't touch the ocean? 
</P>
<P>
 And why the Ritz-Carlton -- Laguna Niguel hotel is actually located within the 
city of Dana Point? 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1960s, realtors touted the Laguna Niguel planned community as "Sea 
Country" because the development stretched to the ocean south of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1980s, residents of Laguna Niguel's coastal section, known as 
Monarch Beach, voted to incorporate with Dana Point. So the Ritz-Carlton hotel 
became part of Dana Point in everything but name. And the city known as "Sea 
Country" became landlocked. Today

 Retiring Supervisor Thomas F. Riley will be honored by the Mental Health Assn.

 As part of its Neighborhood Watch program, the city will loan citizens 
electric engravers to make their personal possessions less attractive to 
burglars and easier to recover if stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Operation Identification, the city will make the engravers available 
during the week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Operation I.D. involves the marking of property with an identifying number as 
a means of discouraging burglary and theft," said Yomar Cleary, who is 
coordinating the program for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The engravers are available at City Hall, 33282 Golden Lantern. There is no 
charge for the equipment, but a $10 deposit will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary recommends marking valuables with a driver's license or California 
identification card number. Large items such as televisions, camera equipment, 
small appliances and tools should be marked. For further information, call 
Cleary at (714) 248-3517. FRANK MESSINA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN, 27, SENTENCED FOR TERRORIST THREATS 
</P>

<P>
 A man convicted of making terrorist threats against an Oak View woman he knew 
from junior high school was sentenced to 16 months in state prison Tuesday and 
told to stay out of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew James Towler, 27, pleaded guilty in January to making terrorist 
threats against Lisa Plott, the wife of county Fire Capt. Norman J. Plott.In 
exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to dismiss several other charges 
against Towler, including one misdemeanor count of stalking. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James M. McNally sentenced Towler to the shortest prison 
term possible, but added that he must stay out of the county upon his release. 
</P>
<P>
 Towler's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily, said McNally has 
no authority to enforce such an order. But he said state corrections officials 
could take the judge's advice and set parole guidelines that prohibit Towler 
from returning to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Towler was raised in the county and still has some family members who live 
here. He lives in Northern California, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant was arrested Nov. 29, 1993, after being spotted peeking into the 
mailbox of the victim, who attended junior high with Towler but had not seen 
him for more than a dozen years. The harassment began in 1990 with annoying and 
threatening phone calls and persisted for several years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily said Towler suffers from schizophrenia, which caused him to fixate on 
the victim. "It's just one of those unfortunate things where his mental illness 
went unchecked," Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 With good-behavior time credits for his pre-sentence jail stay of nearly 11 
months, Towler probably will be released within a few days, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Towler will move back to Northern California when released, Daily said. DWAYNE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BUS AGENCY URGED TO CUT ITS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to send a letter to South 
Coast Area Transit, the city's bus service for 20 years, pressing the bus 
agency to cut its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members listened to a report by the city's traffic department that 
concluded that Oxnard should explore alternatives to SCAT, which gets about 45% 
of its local funding from the city, or press the agency to cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was prepared at the request of Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who 
believes that Oxnard is spending too much money on public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommended that the council either: 
</P>
<P>
 * Analyze how much it would cost to have service provided by a private 
company, the city or another agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draft a letter to SCAT requesting that the agency prepare a cost-cutting 
plan by March. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to SCAT says Oxnard's budget shortfalls have forced the city to 
re-evaluate its services and cut spending. As a joint powers authority 
dependent on Oxnard and other member cities for funding, SCAT should also be 
cutting down, the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky criticized Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, who serves as vice president of 
SCAT's board of directors, for saying that the agency may need to cut bus lines 
throughout Ventura County to pare its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The look into our relationship with SCAT was not to cut services," Plisky 
said. "I don't want the public to be concerned about services." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez countered that budget cuts usually result in a reduction in services, 
citing Oxnard as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1973, SCAT annually carries nearly 3 million passengers in Ventura, 
Port Hueneme, Ojai, Oxnard and unincorporated parts of Ventura County. About 
40% of the ridership comes from Oxnard. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER DICK PICK DIES AT 56; OBITUARY: THE FOUNDER OF PICK SYSTEMS 
INC. IN IRVINE, HE CREATED AN INNOVATIVE DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM USED ON 
250,000 MULTI-USER COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

<P>
 Computer pioneer Richard A. (Dick) Pick, who created software that today is 
used by about 3 million people worldwide, has died of stroke complications. He 
was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick, a Newport Beach resident, was founder and chief executive officer of 
Pick Systems Inc. in Irvine, the company that perfected and sold the novel 
software used primarily on business computers. He suffered a stroke Oct. 6 and 
died Monday at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of the industry's true legends," 
said Brian Stone, who was chosen as acting chief executive officer of Pick 
Systems. "Dick's foresight and intelligence leaves a lasting legacy for us 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Pick, a UC Berkeley physics graduate, began his computer industry career at 
TRW in El Segundo, where he was hired to help write a computer program that 
would keep track of an Army helicopter project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army, as it turned out, decided to scrap the helicopter project before the 
program was finished. The unfinished program became public domain, and Pick 
added a few of his own ideas to create a computer database management system 
that he believed he could copyright and market. 
</P>
<P>
 He licensed the enhanced system to Irvine computer maker Microdata in 1973 and 
formed Pick Systems in 1982 to expand efforts to market the system. 
</P>

ELECTIONS 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; BEILENSON AND SYBERT EVEN IN FUNDS FOR 
FINAL STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As their hotly contested congressional race enters its final, three-week 
stretch, U. S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and his GOP 
challenger, Rich Sybert, are nearly matching each other dollar for dollar in 
campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports released Tuesday show that the Beilenson campaign had 
$207,593 on hand as of Sept. 30, while Sybert had $203,840 for their showdown 
in a district that includes most of Thousand Oaks and portions of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this parity, the reports show Sybert amassed a campaign war chest this 
year of $662,000, including $421,000 he lent to his own campaign. With receipts 
this year of $275,000, Beilenson has raised less than half what Sybert has 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two men met in a debate Tuesday night before a crowd of about 
450 at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, clashing over their finances 
and other issues: proposals to limit the terms of elected officials, 
Proposition 187 and whether the federal government should pay for abortions for 
poor women. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert praised term limits as the best way to get rid of "career politicians," 
while Beilenson opposed them, saying such limits would increase the power of 
entrenched lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson opposed Proposition 187, which denies services to illegal 
immigrants, as a "naive attempt" to deal with immigration problems, while 
Sybert said that he supports it as necessary to laying the legal groundwork to 
challenge existing federal laws and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the congressional district that covers the rest of Ventura County, Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has amassed nearly $200,000 more to spend in the 
final stretch of the fall campaign than Democratic challenger Kevin Ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial statements show that Gallegly had $199,552 in campaign cash as of 
Sept. 30. He pledged to spend whatever is needed to win reelection. 
"Complacency is one thing I've never been accused of in my life," the 
congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready said he has raised several thousand dollars since the Sept. 30 financial 
statement, which reported only $158 in his campaign account. He said he will 
have enough to run a credible campaign. "Money doesn't determine the outcome of 
elections, voters do," Ready said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, was virtually 
unknown in the 24th District that includes Thousand Oaks until he began to wage 
his campaign to unseat Beilenson last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has boosted his name recognition among voters with a steady stream of 
campaign literature issued during the GOP primary in June. Beilenson, 61, now 
acknowledges that he faces a tough fight to win a 10th term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On the financial front, Beilenson -- as he has for years -- refuses to take 
contributions from political action committees, or PACS, that usually represent 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he is part of a small group of independent-minded members in 
Congress who refuse to take such contributions, which he believes are designed 
only to influence congressional votes. His finance report reflects his total 
absence of PAC money. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sybert has received nearly $40,000 from industry-related political 
action committees. But he claims the PAC money represents significant business 
interests showing confidence in his ability to spur economic growth in the 
congressional district.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sybert report shows contributions from three oil company PACs (the UNOCAL 
Political Awareness Fund, the ARCO PAC, and the Chevron Employees PAC) and 
several food industry-related organizations (the National Cattlemen's Assn. 
PAC, the Food Marketing Institute PAC, the American Meat Assn. PAC, and the 
National Restaurant Assn. PAC). 
</P>
<P>
 He also received money from PACs run by the Los Angeles city police union and 
by Mayor Richard Riordan's former law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In individual contributions, Sybert got money from six attorneys from the law 
firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, where he had practiced business 
law before becoming the director of Wilson's office of planning and research. 
Beilenson also acknowledged that he is still heavily dependent on campaign 
contributions from residents in the Westside of Los Angeles. Beilenson 
represented an almost exclusively Westside district before he decided to run 
for the San Fernando Valley-based 24th District. In the 23rd Congressional 
District that covers most of Ventura County and Carpinteria, Gallegly raised 
$94,935 from July to September, leaving him with $199,552 in campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
 About 82% of Gallegly's most recent donations came from individual 
contributors, including $500 from former U. S. Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, $500 
from Erica Huddy, a major stockholder and program manager of KADY-TV (Channel 
63) in Oxnard, and $1,000 apiece from two "homemakers" in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know them," Gallegly said of Isabel F. Rubert and Rosa Fonalledas, 
who list addresses in San Juan or a nearby suburb. He also said he has no idea 
why either would donate $1,000 to his campaign, but speculated that they 
appreciate his efforts to cut the size of the federal government overseeing U. 
S. territories. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17% of Gallegly's contributions came from PACs. These contributions 
included money from agriculture, real estate, and banking interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In mounting his challenge to Gallegly, Democrat Ready raised $9,000 from July 
through September, and promptly spent much of it on office expenses. That left 
his fledgling campaign strapped for cash as of Sept. 30, the close of the 
campaign finance reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the largest donations to Ready were actually in-kind contributions 
from Democratic political consultants and groups supporting his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are running a very frugal campaign," Ready said.

SIMI VALLEY TRUSTEES LOWER ANNUAL CHARGES FOR RIDING SCHOOL BUSES; EDUCATION: 
BOARD ALSO GOES ON RECORD AGAINST PROPOSITION 187. BUT A JUNIOR HIGH'S DRESS 
CODE SPARKS MUCH OF THE FIREWORKS AT MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At a volatile meeting Tuesday night, the Simi Valley school board voted to 
lower a $300 fee for riding the school bus and passed a resolution opposing the 
statewide ballot initiative that would keep illegal immigrants out of the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the more than 200 parents and students crammed into the City 
Council chambers saved their fiery comments for a topic not even scheduled for 
a vote: Valley View Junior High School's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress codes "don't protect the greatest safety of all time, the safety of 
free speech," said Steven Stout, a 12th-grader at Simi Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bus fees, the school board voted 5 to 0 to lower the annual charges by 
as much as $100 in an effort to promote bus ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will now pay $200 for the first child who rides the bus and $150 for 
the second child. Previously, annual fees for bus service were set at $300 for 
the first child and $200 for the second child. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for additional children will remain the same: $100 for a third child and 
$50 for a fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said Tuesday they expected the new policy would need some 
fine-tuning, and defended their decision to charge for bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased to see we are making the system more user friendly," Trustee 
Doug Crosse said. "We will still need to polish and refine this system." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted in June to levy bus fees beginning this school year in 
an attempt to generate about $190,000 for the financially troubled school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Since bus pass sales have raised only about $46,760 so far, district officials 
recommended that the board lower the fees to encourage ridership. Last month 
dozens of parents protested the new policy at a board meeting, but Tuesday no 
one addressed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over Proposition 187, however, drew a string of speakers, most of 
them supporting the board's resolution to oppose the measure that would deny 
illegal immigrants access to public schools, non-emergency health care and 
other social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the ballot measures a "witch hunt" of illegal immigrants, 16-year-old 
Lauren McAuliffe urged the board to oppose the initiative formally. "I think we 
can all imagine what will happen to our schools if this racist bill is passed." 
</P>
<P>
 But a handful of parents, including school board candidates Glenn Woodbury and 
Norm Walker, said the board should not take a position on the statewide 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're telling the children of this district it is OK to break the law," 
Coleen Ary, a Simi Valley parent, said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ballot measure passes, officials estimate Ventura County schools could 
lose about $50 million in state and federal funds, and districts would have to 
spend about $6.5 million in administrative costs, mostly to verify the 
immigration status of children and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour of public comment, the board approved the resolution on a 4-1 
vote, with Crosse casting the lone vote of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The most volatile issue erupted later during the meeting, when the board 
addressed Valley View's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Simi 
Valley Unified School District earlier this month, alleging that the dress code 
violates students' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed on behalf Valley View ninth-grader John Spindler, who was 
sent home from school for wearing patriotic T-shirts that violate the school's 
strict dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 John's mother, Ellen, requested that the school board discuss the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the dress code is now the subject of a federal lawsuit, some 
school board members said they were not at liberty to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not, however, stop parents and students from airing their opinions on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems what they want are robots, not students," said 14-year-old Cynthia 
Gurrola, a ninth-grader at Sequoia Junior High School.

DISABLED-RIGHTS ADVOCATES CRITICIZE ARTS PLAZA'S WHEELCHAIR ACCESS; DESIGN: 
CITY STAFF MEMBERS INSIST THE NEW THEATER MEETS OR SURPASSES ALL U.S. STANDARDS 
FOR ACCESSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Blasting the Civic Arts Plaza as a death trap, two disabled-rights advocates 
presented Thousand Oaks leaders Tuesday with a list of alleged defects in the 
new auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Phyllis Ellis, who have long accused the city of ignoring disabled 
residents' needs, said Thousand Oaks' 1,800-seat main theater inadequately 
serves wheelchair-bound patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 From life-threatening exit routes that could be blocked in a power failure to 
annoying wheelchair seating shunted to the fringes of the auditorium, they 
cited questionable design features. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staff members repeated their position that the building meets or 
surpasses all federal standards for accessibility for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 And another disabled-rights activist praised the Civic Arts Plaza as safe, 
comfortable and welcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a lot of theaters, and this has more (amenities) than I've ever 
seen before," said Mike Taylor, a member of the city's disabled access appeals 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who uses a wheelchair, added: "To me, this is a wonderful 
convenience." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Ellises, however, the theater is a virtual house of horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 As they toured the auditorium Tuesday -- John Ellis snapping photos while his 
wife, Phyllis, maneuvered through the rows in her motorized wheelchair -- they 
vowed to press for a federal investigation into the Civic Arts Plaza's design. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 on their hit list: the small, black electric lift used to transport 
wheelchairs from one seating level to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Civic Arts Plaza has a backup generator, the Ellises said they 
feared an earthquake or other disaster could knock out power for hours -- 
shutting down the lift and stranding disabled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way for people to get out," John Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of that danger, the federal government plans to outlaw 
electric lifts in municipal buildings by modifying the Americans With 
Disabilities Act, according to Liz Savage, an expert on disabled-access 
standards who works in the attorney general's office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifts will be banned because they can break down or fail during power 
failures, Savage said. Lifts can also be inconvenient, and disabled people 
sometimes need help using them. "New construction is supposed to maximize 
independence" for disabled people, Savage explained, "and lifts don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new ban on electric lifts will not take effect for several months, she 
said. Even then it will apply only to new construction, so the Civic Arts Plaza 
can continue to use an electric lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' director of building and safety, Barry Branagan, has defended 
the lift as state-of-the-art technology. In a total blackout, he said, frail 
and disabled audience members would simply have to rely on a helping hand from 
ushers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said multistory office buildings usually lack wheelchair ramps as well. If 
the elevators go on the fritz, disabled people must somehow make their way down 
the stairs. "Mostly what happens," Branagan said, "is that people help other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Backing the city's decision to use a lift, Taylor said he found the 
mini-elevator a wonderful boon for wheelchair users. As he rattled up and down 
in the noisy lift, he marveled: "You've got plenty of room, everything is safe, 
you can't get your wheels caught, and nothing feels flimsy." 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled rights activists also clashed on the issue of wheelchair seating. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Phyllis Ellis complained that the theater reserves only aisle and 
back-row seating for wheelchairs -- so disabled patrons cannot buy 
front-and-center seats. They also protested that the space allocated for 
wheelchairs is cramped. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor said he could enjoy the show from any vantage point in the theater. 
"How much more room do we need?" he asked, wheeling in and out of a third-row 
aisle seat. "You can't expect to have everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The disputes over the Civic Arts Plaza's accessibility came during a two-hour 
workshop Tuesday morning, when Taylor and Phyllis Ellis taught the city's 11 
professional ushers how to help disabled visitors around the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their tips: Look disabled patrons in the eyes and talk to them directly. 
Do not assume all wheelchair-bound people are deaf -- address them in a normal 
tone of voice. If they shift into a regular auditorium seat for the show, stash 
their wheelchair nearby and assure them it will be readily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you express a look of confidence, helpfulness and understanding, that will 
go a long way," Phyllis Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety Director Branagan offered his own advice for disabled 
patrons -- ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who need special services need to alert us ahead of time so we can 
make arrangements to serve them," Branagan said. "We'll do anything anyone asks 
of us. That's our commitment."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; BUMPS IN AN ANTI-CRIME SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With crime high on the public's list of priorities, law enforcement agencies 
have been making commendable efforts to cooperate with each other in reclaiming 
troubled neighborhoods. One such effort in Santa Ana hit a snag, however, when 
charges against six suspects apprehended during Operation Roundup, a 
high-profile drug sweep, had to be dismissed. Although having to drop the 
charges proved embarrassing, the situation offers a cautionary tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, charges against four men wrongly identified as selling drugs to an 
undercover informant were dropped. The week before, a suspect was released 
after it was confirmed that he was in state prison at the time he was alleged 
to have sold drugs in Santa Ana. Previously, charges against a sixth suspect 
were dismissed after it was determined he had been misidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later said that an informant sent out to buy drugs on the streets of 
Santa Ana stole from police, lied about it and helped misidentify the six who 
were later exonerated. Clearly, police, the FBI and prosecutors need to be on 
guard against unscrupulous informants and take extra care to be able to 
corroborate what informants say or do.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities still say they believe they can successfully prosecute the more 
than 100 Operation Roundup cases now under review as a result of the 
misidentifications. According to FBI reports, the informant had been dispatched 
to build rapport with members of the Sixth Street gang, which had a grip on 
Santa Ana's 3rd Street neighborhood for years.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point last spring, the agencies actually halted the operation because 
of concerns about the informant's reliability. Prosecutors now must attempt to 
get jurors to look beyond the informant and see the larger picture of a 
troubled neighborhood. Prosecutors need to have strong cases that will hold up 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperative effort of the FBI, Santa Ana police and the district 
attorney's office has been a worthy attempt to ease crime in a troubled 
neighborhood. The dismissals prompted a worthwhile review of all the cases in 
the gang and drug sweep, and they act as a reminder that authorities need to 
take extra care in these tricky investigations.

HOW SOCIETY TREATS (MISTREATS) HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently your paper carried two stories relating to the treatment of the 
homeless. The first dealt with a good Samaritan facing a felony charge in San 
Francisco for feeding a homeless person, for which the city has so far made 720 
arrests and has expended $5 million hassling the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The second story pits Msgr. Joseph Carroll of San Diego's St. Vincent de Paul 
Village for Homeless against Councilman Juan Vargas who maintains the village 
attracts the shiftless and hurts the neighborhood. High on booze or drugs, the 
homeless and shiftless are attracted with free food, he maintains, enabling 
them to wallow in their addiction as well as hurting the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Leads one to wonder to what better use the fair "City by the Bay" could have 
put the $5 million. How many meals, how many shelter beds? How much good could 
have resulted from all that money? 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to be more of society's eagerness to make the problem of the 
homeless just go away, as if calling the ranks of the homeless "invisible" will 
make them so. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Costa Mesa soup kitchen where I have worked on Fridays these past three 
years, and at the one in Santa Ana for five years before that, many of the 
people being fed are in fact people who are out of work, who have just enough 
to pay their rent, but not enough to buy food. Because they own a car and other 
meager possessions they're ineligible for the usual social programs and so we 
see them: some with briefcases, in laundered shirts and pressed clothes looking 
for work, and glad for a hot, free meal. There are young families too, some of 
the small children with washed faces, some not, but all hungry for the food, 
which we dispense without any questions. What we see mostly are the "working 
poor," all victims of a sick economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on San Francisco, which has made it a crime to feed the homeless. Shame 
on those whose concern for a "neighborhood" would justify letting an innocent 
child go hungry to sleep at night. Shame on those wastrels responsible for 
using wrong thinking to dissipate $5 million of the public's as well as the 
homeless' money.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: ATTACK ON EDITOR OF VIETNAMESE NEWSPAPER IS AN ATTACK ON 
FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BRODY, Jeffrey Brody is a journalism professor at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times poll found that more than half the Vietnamese 
living in Southern California favor normalizing relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, thousands of Vietnamese Americans have returned to 
their homeland to visit relatives, especially during Tet, the lunar new year. 
When they go back, they visit socialist Vietnam, one of the poorest countries 
in the world, as ambassadors of the free enterprise system and representatives 
of the American way of life. The disparity between the Vietnamese and their 
refugee brethren is startling: The per-capita income in Vietnam is about $300 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 After President Clinton lifted the U.S. trade embargo, many Vietnamese 
Americans journeyed to north Vietnam and south Vietnam seeking business 
opportunities. The first United States-Vietnam trade show, exhibiting scores of 
American goods, was organized in Hanoi last April by Vietnam Investment 
Information & Consulting, a San Diego-based, refugee-owned firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the experience of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, this type 
of commerce may do more to undermine the Communist regime in Vietnam than the 
rhetoric of "retaking the homeland" that the right-wingers espouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against this backdrop that the attack against Yen Do, the erudite editor 
of the largest Vietnamese-language newspaper in the United States, appears to 
be an act of desperation. Do recently stepped down after 300 right-wing 
immigrants marched in front of his Orange County office, threatening a boycott 
of the Nguoi Viet Daily News if he did not resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Do, a moderate voice in the refugee community, was being punished for 
exercising free speech; his offense in the eyes of hard-line, anti-Communist 
refugees was defending a physician who supports trade with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old editor rankled right-wing hard-liners by suggesting that 
recent criticism of Dr. Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of 
Commerce in Orange County, had more to do with business than politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Do broke the code of silence in Little Saigon by telling a New York Times 
reporter that protests against Pham were motivated by competing physicians who 
wanted to discredit the doctor and steal his patients. Do played down the 
influence of the anti-Communists in Little Saigon -- suggesting, as an 
influential poll has shown, that Orange County's Vietnamese community, the 
largest in the world outside Vietnam, is becoming more open toward relations 
with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Times published Do's remarks last month, he came under attack. Do 
refused to apologize but resigned to protect the 12,000-circulation newspaper 
that he started 16 years ago in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The editor has good reason to fear for his life. A few years ago, extremists 
firebombed one of his delivery trucks because a television station affiliated 
with the Nguoi Viet newspaper inadvertently broadcast a picture of Vietnam's 
Communist flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Do joins a number of Vietnamese journalists who have been attacked in 
McCarthy-like fashion and redbaited by right-wing extremists. Some refugees 
have paid for their First Amendment rights with their lives. Five Vietnamese 
journalists have been slain by purported death squads in the United States 
since 1981. None of the murders have been solved. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attack against Do occurs at a time when relations between Hanoi and 
Washington are thawing. Clinton lifted the embargo against Vietnam in February, 
and talks are underway to restore diplomatic relations. Refugee hard-liners, 
who oppose renewed relations with Hanoi, have been as unsuccessful in 
persuading Washington to reignite the Vietnam War as they have been with their 
own people. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremists know that support for their cause is waning. The days of 10,000 
people storming a convention center and rallying behind resistance fighters in 
Little Saigon are over. Even Nguyen Cao Ky, the flamboyant former South 
Vietnamese premier, supports peaceful relations with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 By resorting to mob rule, threats and intimidation, the extremists undermine 
their cause. The right-wing anti-Communists in the Vietnamese community show 
that they have as much contempt for freedom of speech as do Communists in 
Vietnam. They expose themselves and show that while they oppose one form of 
dictatorship, they are far from being democratic themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mob rule has triumphed over freedom of the press in Little Saigon.

CLIPPERS WEIGHED DOWN, OUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurry back Stanley Roberts, Coach Bill Fitch and the Clippers need you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers could have used Roberts, who has practiced only once after 
reporting to training camp overweight and out of shape, in Tuesday night's 
120-104 exhibition loss to the Lakers before 18,052 at the Pond. It was the 
largest crowd in the 25-year history of the franchise that played in Buffalo 
and San Diego before moving to Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who ballooned to 345 pounds last summer while recuperating from 
Achilles' tendon surgery, is down to 328 pounds, but he still isn't ready to 
play. He hasn't been in uniform for the Clippers' three exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get him in shape," Coach Bill Fitch said. "It's a matter of time. I 
told Stanley 10 days ago that if he wanted to be nagged, get himself a wife. I 
told him 10 days ago, if he wanted to be a successful professional, he's going 
to have to support himself and be a self-starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not putting him out on the floor until he reaches a conditioning factor 
both with the trainer and the strength and conditioning coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers used four centers against the Lakers, Bob Martin, Matt Fish, 
Robert Werdann and Elmore Spencer, who returned after walking out of practice 
Monday night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 With Roberts sidelined, the Lakers out-rebounded the Clippers by 31-20 in the 
first half as they took a 61-48 halftime lead. The Lakers ended the game with a 
60-50 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, Spencer, and Werdann didn't have any rebounds in the first half while 
Fish had one. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker forward Cedric Ceballos had 22 points, including 12 in the third quarter 
as the Lakers opened a 25-point lead. He made 11 of 15 shots as the Lakers won 
for the third time in three exhibitions.

 Jim Rome wants another Jim Everett interview, but not a rematch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Last April on ESPN2, Everett shoved a table into Rome and jumped on him after 
Rome persisted in calling the former Ram quarterback "Chris." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get Everett back on my show for a long time," Rome said. 
"Unfortunately, the indications are that he doesn't want to talk to me again." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Joe Tutino also failed in recent attempts to have Everett, whose 
Saints lost to San Diego in New Orleans last week and play the Rams on Sunday, 
do a telephone interview on Rome's XTRA radio show. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everett came on TV because he wanted to say some things about the Rams," Rome 
said. "He never got to because the interview was cut short. I'd still like to 
hear what he has to say about this old team and so would a lot of other 
people." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always regret the incident," Rome said. "I've gotten into jocular banter 
with a number of athletes. I didn't think Everett was becoming angry. He was 
smiling. It was a bad read on my part. I made a mistake." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the ratings for Rome's TV and radio programs have increased, his 
contracts have been extended, and he has had a number of job offers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think Everett is the best thing that's happened to my career," 
Rome said. "But I like to think I could have achieved the same success without 
that." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What would Rome call Everett if he ever got to interview him again? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Jim." . . . 
</P>

 Few NFL games on Monday -- or any other day of the week -- have been as 
entertaining as the one between Joe Montana's Kansas City Chiefs and John 
Elway's Denver Broncos. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ever think a 3 1/2-hour game with 24 penalties could be so delicious? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I wish Dan Dierdorf would shut up once in a while and let the action speak for 
itself. . . . Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer was correct in taking 
disciplinary action against his star linebacker, Derrick Thomas, after Thomas 
was an hour late for a team meeting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But a stiff fine would have been sufficient. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Schottenheimer benched Thomas for the first quarter and a couple of plays 
of the second quarter, the coach made his entire team suffer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I still can't understand why defenses generally don't pressure quarterbacks 
during the so-called two-minute drills. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's the time, more than any other, that the passer should be harassed. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer should realize that the tactic of trying to draw defensive 
linemen offside on short-yardage fourth downs doesn't work anymore. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Overshadowed by the Art Shell-Jeff Hostetler festivities in Miami on Sunday 
was a terrific performance by Raider defensive lineman Jerry Ball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ball, 29, has returned to the form that earned him three Pro Bowl berths as a 
Detroit Lion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Theismann says Deion Sanders is the only impact defensive player in the 
NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The way he was delivering left hooks to Andre Rison on Sunday in Atlanta, the 
185-pound Sanders might also be the only NFL player who could be a 
cruiserweight contender. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A rookie with a three-year, $460,000 contract, Gus Frerotte from Tulsa, will 
replace a rookie with an eight-year, $19.25-million contract, Heath Shuler from 
Tennessee, as the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback Sunday against the 
Indianapolis Colts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman, 45, sent Mick Jagger, 51, this telegram before the Rolling 
Stones' concerts in Las Vegas last weekend: "Good luck. The MGM Grand is a 
great place for old-timers to perform." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Jerry West for refusing to give in to the unrealistic contract 
extension demands of Sedale Threatt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When thoroughbred racing resumes today at Santa Anita, it will end the longest 
break in the Southern California schedule since July -- two days. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: Chicago Cubs fire 11th manager in 12 years. Reaction: Who do they 
think they are, the Angels? . . .

BASEBALL LABOR; TALKS TO BE RESUMED BY USERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's labor talks will resume in Washington today with what is expected 
to be mostly a procedural session with special mediator William J. Usery. Daily 
negotiations are not likely to begin until next week and there is no indication 
of a change in positions by either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any reason to believe Bud Selig has changed his mind one bit, 
but hope springs eternal," union lawyer Eugene Orza said Tuesday in reference 
to the acting commissioner and the owners' quest for a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig confirmed that there has been no change in the owners' proposal and said 
he would honor Usery's desire for a gag rule on negotiating specifics. Selig 
said the mediator has already been in contact with both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of catching up to do and he's doing that aggressively," Selig 
said. "I've talked to him a half-dozen times already. He's very tenacious, very 
hands on, and I think there'll be a lot of meetings once he gets going." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, 17 more players filed for free agency Tuesday, among them Bo 
Jackson and Rex Hudler of the Angels. The Dodgers picked up the 1995 option on 
Jeff Treadway but did not offer arbitration to pitcher Kevin Gross, who had 
free agent repeater rights and now becomes an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, said the club retains interest in 
re-signing Gross but not through arbitration, a process in which the Dodgers 
would be unable to hold the line on his $2.7-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not closing the door on Kevin, but we recognize he has other doors now 
as a free agent," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's negotiating meeting with Usery, management lawyers Richard Ravitch 
and Chuck O'Connor will be accompanied by 11 of the 12 members of Selig's 
original negotiating team: general counsel Wendy Selig-Prieb of the Milwaukee 
Brewers, owner Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, owner Jerry McMorris 
of the Colorado Rockies, CEO John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, president 
Andy MacPhail of the Chicago Cubs, president David Glass of the Kansas City 
Royals, owner Drayton McLane of the Houston Astros, executives Stan Kasten and 
Bill Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves, executive vice president David 
Montgomery of the Philadelphia Phillies, and retired president Stuart Meyer of 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 President Paul Beeston of the Toronto Blue Jays had a previous commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said six or seven members of the players' negotiating committee would 
attend the first negotiating session since Sept. 9 and only the fourth since 
the strike began on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been some speculation that Usery will be the means by which 
the owners save face and eventually back off of the salary cap, an attorney 
familiar with the situation said the owners still seem determined to implement 
their proposal unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides are in a box they can't get out of," he said. "The players will 
never approve a cap, and the owners have already wiped out the season and World 
Series. They aren't going to change directions now."

 Nebraska quarterback Brook Berringer should have full medical clearance and be 
able to use the entire playbook Saturday when the third-ranked Cornhuskers play 
at Missouri, Coach Tom Osborne said. . . . New Mexico State coach Jim Hess, who 
has suffered temporary blackouts over the past two weeks, isn't expected to 
need surgery for his problems, university officials said. The school said 
doctors believe they were caused by a blood clot near his heart or a small hole 
between the left and right atriums of his heart. . . . Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner 
has accused Western Athletic Conference officials of knowing "who was supposed 
to win the game." Wagner's comments followed a 14-3 loss to Utah.

 Safety Sammy Knight approached star level in the Trojans' 27-20 victory at 
Stanford on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson has compared sophomore Knight to former Trojan secondary 
greats Ronnie Lott and Dennis Thurman, but until Saturday he didn't always have 
his aggressive game under control. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Stanford, he had seven unassisted tackles and four assists.

 Tailback Shawn Walters' 234-yard game against Stanford was his second 
200-yarder this season. He ran for 207 against Baylor Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, with 712 yards, has a chance to become the first Trojan to register a 
1,000-yard season since Mazio Royster in 1990 (1,168).

 The NCAA season record for 200-yard games is eight, by USC's Marcus Allen, in

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: LOBSTER POACHERS STUCK IN HOT WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of lobsters were spared after three incidents this month, but six men 
have landed in hot water for putting them through it. 
</P>
<P>
 In two instances, warden Chris Graff of the Department of Fish and Game saved 
the crustacean. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Oct. 10, Graff spotted two divers swimming near buoys 
attached to commercial lobster traps off San Clemente and confronted them when 
they reached the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They protested their innocence, but Graff later spotted several spiny lobsters 
on a second-floor balcony of an apartment he had seen Timothy S. Ellis, one of 
the divers, enter earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Graff knocked on the door, someone opened it, then quickly slammed it in 
Graff's face, but not before he was able to see lobsters being prepared in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Graff went to the side of the building and saw a woman stuffing lobsters into 
a bag. She then tossed them down to Ellis, who sped away in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Graff gave chase, but lost Ellis in traffic. When Ellis eventually returned, 
without the lobsters, he was greeted by Graff and sheriff's deputies, who 
persuaded him to divulge the whereabouts of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen lobsters, 10 of which were undersized, were found in a vacant lot 
about a mile away. All were alive and eventually set free.  
</P>
<P>
 Four more, however, were found in the apartment, fully cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis was booked and charged with interfering with an officer involved in an 
investigation and with 10 counts of possessing undersized lobsters. A second 
diver is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graff wasn't through playing protector of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to the beach at dusk, he noticed a skiff moving from location 
to location. 
</P>
<P>
 He approached the five people on the boat at the launch ramp at Dana Point 
Harbor and found, wrapped in a nylon net and hidden from view, 33 live 
lobsters, including 28 "shorts." 
</P>
<P>
 The lobsters were set free, but four Westminster men were arrested. A 
12-year-old aboard was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Cong Van Le, 40, and son Dinh Van Le, 21, and Mien Van Le, 23, and Hao Van 
Nguyen, 18, were charged with numerous violations, including poaching from 
commercial traps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the third incident, another indication that stealing from traps is a threat 
to legitimate lobster fishermen, DFG wardens arrested Richard A. Craig, 27, of 
Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Wardens Dan Sforza and Marty Maytorena, with the cooperation of commercial 
fishermen, tagged four lobsters, put them in a trap and sent it to the bottom 
off Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 After several hours of watching, using night-vision scopes, they saw two 
divers swimming near the buoy. On the beach the wardens encountered Craig and 
his 13-year-old son, with two of the tagged lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 They confiscated Craig's diving gear and cited him for poaching, using an 
illegal method of taking lobsters and petty theft.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't sound like much, one or two lobsters, but it's like stealing 
someone's paycheck," Sforza said. "The average, legal-sized lobster weighs 
about 1.25 pounds and will bring $7.50 a pound, so two (lobsters) represent $20 
income to a lobster fisherman." Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- The increasingly popular junior pheasant hunts will take place at 
six Southland and Eastern Sierra locations in the next several weeks. The DFG 
is sponsoring the hunts, designed to spark an interest in the sport among 
youngsters, and volunteers from local hunting-conservation groups help ensure 
the program's success. The six hunts are at Eagle Peak Ranch near Julian, Oct. 
29; San Jacinto Wildlife Area near Lake Perris, Nov. 12; Raahauge's Pheasant 
Club in Norco, Nov. 19; Imperial Valley near Calexico, Dec. 10; Palo Verde 
Valley near Blythe, Dec. 10, and Lone Pine Pheasant Club, Dec. 31. Prospective 
hunters must be at least 16 and possess a junior hunting license -- at a cost 
of $5.80 -- to be eligible for draws held in the days before each hunt. 
Details: (310) 590-5158. 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER FISHING -- Recent winds and rough seas might have put an end to the 
tuna bite at the outer banks. Boats are reporting limited success, catching 
mostly skipjacks. Rockfish and calico bass will soon dominate the local fish 
counts. The bite south of the border, however, has yet to let up and skippers 
are hoping for a bite that will last well into November. 
</P>
<P>
 BOATING -- The annual Long Beach Boat Show begins a five-day run today at the 
Long Beach Convention Center and Downtown Marina. The event features more than 
400 boats, including the 70-foot Shift of Ipswich, a schooner once owned by 
James Cagney. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Former President George Bush has been stalking the "gray ghosts" 
of the Florida Keys. Bush participated in the recent George Bush Bonefish 
Tournament and caught one of eight of the elusive fighters, a 12-pounder. . . . 
Larry Green, a widely known Northern California outdoor reporter, died of an 
apparent heart attack at 57. Green, the "Fisherman's Forecaster" for San 
Francisco radio station KCBS, wrote for several outdoor publications.

FISHING REPORT: DESIRE FOR A LATE SNACK COSTS LUNKER CATFISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With cooler days and nights, Southland catfish will soon disappear into the 
depths and remain there in a state of sluggishness for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But some are apparently trying to fill up first. As a result, some are hanging 
from a chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest, a 55-pound hybrid channel-blue catfish, was more fortunate, being 
caught and released at Irvine Lake by Ken Schenewark of Long Beach. Schenewark 
outdid his brother, Damian, who a week earlier had caught and released a 
48-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Another giant catfish wasn't as lucky.  
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Dawson Jr. of Riverside pulled a 50-pounder from Corona Lake, breaking 
the lake record by 10 pounds, and filled a lopsided stringer of five fish 
totaling 66.7 pounds.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; YIELDS RISE ON INFLATION CONCERNS 
</P>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lingering concerns about the dollar and comments by a Federal Reserve Board 
official that economic growth remains surprisingly strong sent Treasury bond 
yields higher in quiet trading Tuesday. But shorter-term securities were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 7.86% from 
7.82%, pushing its price down 15/32 point, or $4.68 per $1,000 in face value. 
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.86% from 7.82% on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rebounded slightly against key currencies Tuesday but was well 
short of making up Monday's loss that followed a slim victory by German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But with little other news to trade on, bond traders 
said concerns persisted that a weak dollar would prompt foreign investors to 
move out of U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's driving the market is the dollar," said Frank Sanella, 
senior money market analyst at Technical Data in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Board Governor Susan Phillips said in an address at 
a savings bank conference that the U.S. economy is growing at a rate that 
continues to surprise many analysts. Phillips' comments reignited worries about 
an overheated economy, which could foreshadow higher inflation and prompt the 
Fed to increase interest rates to curb price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation and higher rates reduce the value of fixed-income investments like 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 With no economic reports to influence the market and a new supply of two- and 
five-year notes coming next week, dealers refrained from major moves. Traders 
said the impact of the Fed official's comments was exaggerated because of light 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street meanwhile, stocks were mostly lower, weakened by investor 
apprehension over the higher interest rates that undermined strength from 
improved corporate earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-quarter earnings reports released during the day lifted some individual 
stocks, but the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average finished 6.39 points 
lower at 3,917.54. The Dow average had fallen as much as 20 points around 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, decliners continued to lead on Tuesday by about 3 to 2, 
on Big Board volume totaling 259.74 million, up from Monday's 239.49 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the market's woes, the weak dollar raised the possibility that the 
Fed could be forced into an interest rate hike to bolster the greenback whether 
the economy warranted it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the dollar finished at 1.503 German marks, up from 
Monday's a two-year low of 1.499 marks. Against the Japanese yen, the U.S. 
currency rose to 97.75 yen, from 97.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies reporting earnings results Tuesday dominated the most active list. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chase Manhattan rose 3/4 to 35 3/4 and Citicorp rose 1 1/4 to 44 1/8. Wells 
Fargo shares eased 1/8 to 149 3/8. All three reported hefty earnings increases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris slipped 1/4 to 61 1/2 after its earnings just barely exceeded 
Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues were generally strong and kept the Nasdaq to a narrow 
decline. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.97 point to 764.81. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer rose 1 5/8 to 41 3/8 and Sun Microsystems rose 1 7/8 to 32 
1/4. Both companies reported stronger-than-expected earnings late Monday. Intel 
finished up 1/16 to 58 1/4 on solid third-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sun Microsystems rose 1 7/8 to 32 1/4 on surprisingly strong third-quarter 
earnings. Dell Computer was a notable exception to the trend, falling 1 1/8 to 
41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch gained 7/8 to 35 1/4. The brokerage house reported 
third-quarter earnings of $1.10 per share, in line with Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Overeas markets closed mixed. In Europe, London's Financial Times 100-share 
average x fell 34.9 points to 3,085.3, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average 
closed at 2,084.76, down 6.12. Meanwhile, Tokyo's Nikkei average gained 34.11 
points to end at 19,992.40. In Mexico, the Bolsa index closed off 30.96 points 
at 2,725.01.

COLLECTING CONTROVERSY; THE CURIOS AND FIGURINES OF A RACIST PAST ARE HOT 
PROPERTIES. FOR SOME AFRICAN AMERICANS,THEY INSPIRE OUTRAGE; FOR OTHERS, A NEW 
SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT.

<P>
 In the harsh light of present-day, they are at once angering and sobering. 
Artifacts of an unsettling past. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark whites of eyes and impossibly wide smiles glint from pools of black 
lacquered porcelain. Red head rags, patched together hand-me-downs. A silent 
parade of dancing pickaninnies and benevolent Uncle Toms. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others arranged for display: table services adorned with bronze-skinned 
figures slumbering beneath shady sombreros; postcards depicting a placid 
Japanese homemaker smiling, busy at her task. 
</P>
<P>
 Curios from a less-enlightened age? Possibly. Antiques? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 One can find newly refashioned retro images like these at hip Melrose 
boutiques transforming Mammy and her notorious peers into refrigerator magnets 
or greeting cards "authenticated" with bawdy messages in dialect, just about as 
easily as the antique versions, in endless incarnations at flea markets or 
antique malls. 
</P>
<P>
 It proves this: simply assigning these images to a sepia chapter from an 
unfortunate past would be erroneous. Readily available, and commanding high 
prices, they live on, very few even moderately transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how benign, these monuments to stereotypes, whether breezy off-color 
jabs or imbued with the hot hate of racism, are enshrined in the homes of the 
very people who were the target of their ridicule. And it is this curio that 
perplexes, oftentimes more than the antique pieces that ultimately rust, fray, 
fade or shatter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the gallery space of pop star Anita Baker's plush Michigan mansion, African 
statues cohabit with mammy cookie jars and "Tom and Auntie" salt and pepper 
shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent African Americans known for their prodigious collections of 
black memorabilia that many would still view as offensive include Whoopi 
Goldberg, Julian Bond and Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 And what to make of this unexpected move? Pop singer Gladys Knight breathes 
new life into the racially loaded image of Aunt Jemima, wrapping her sultry, 
Grammy-winning voice around the pancake jingle, "Now you're cookin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Some call these images "Blackabilia," others "Derogatory Collectibles." In her 
new book, "Ceramic Uncles & Celluloid Mammies: Black Images and Their Influence 
on Culture" (Anchor), Patricia A. Turner dubs them "contemptible collectibles" 
-- these images so persistent and so impervious to the prevailing mood of 
political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 What these images mean to those who collect, sell and currently manufacture 
them ranges as widely as the product available. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most asked questions I get is, ' Why do you do this?' " says 
Regina Jackson, a Northern California-based collector who travels selling 
everything from authentic Jim Crow signs to reproductions of vintage product 
advertisements. Her card plainly states her mission: "Mammy Pleasant Black 
Collectibles: Let Us Embrace Mammy's Past/Her Strength Lies Within Us All." 
</P>
<P>
 The message, like the products themselves, inspire potent emotional responses, 
Jackson admits. But along with shock or undiluted anger, Jackson hopes the 
images she peddles might inspire a sense of illumination. 
</P>

 "The main reason I sell what I sell is that it's really helped me come to 
terms with who I am," says Jackson, who is African American. "I grew up 
wondering why my hair won't grow? Why is it so nappy? Why is my butt so big? 
And then dealing with the racism in the race? The light-skinned sisters here, 
the dark-skinned sisters there -- and I was in the middle. I didn't feel real 
good about myself . . . my history or anything," Jackson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I was an adult and had gone through some personal changes in 
my life that . . . I realized how strong I am and how much I can endure. I 
looked at the things in my house, my collection, and I said: 'My God, there's 
my strength. I've been walking on these people's backs.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who subsequently "fell in love with (her) blackness," sees something 
else looming behind portrayals of blacks so many simply write off as tasteless, 
offensive, or downright hateful: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem a lot of people have is what this woman looks like. And I 
just saw beyond the heavy buxom woman with the red head rag . . . and I started 
thinking about what this woman did for us. And I just saw her in a whole 
different way. And I think we need to get back to what that woman did. She was 
a nurturer, a provider. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty who believe that is not a necessary journey. Others say 
they've been there -- if not physically, psychically -- and don't care to ever 
go back. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jackson sets up her colorful tables at flea markets or jazz festivals, or 
even her collectible-cluttered living-space, she can read the subtlest of 
reactions. Those who give it a quick look and keep stepping; the traces of 
anger simmering or tears gathering in the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson can empathize, remembering her own early reactions to the caricatures: 
"When I looked at these things, I saw them as sort of a visual prison." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she admits, she's not always up for the raw reactions. "There's a whole 
lot of us who walk by, head up in the air, talking about: 'Oh my God, why does 
she have that stuff out here?' So many people say, ' That is not my history!' I 
was willing to take the risk because I had something to say. I had something to 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson, who's been cursed out and branded a sellout, understands that it 
isn't just for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people this is an emotional booth, be careful coming in here. And the 
thing about it is, (these images) can't hurt me anymore and I'm so proud of it. 
I'm so proud of the people who had to walk the streets at that time. And that's 
why I do it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Like Jackson, Monrovia High School Assistant Principal Casey Johnson collects 
not only for the historical and educational value, but as a way of confronting 
some long-stowed emotional baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in a small town in Alabama in 1950, Johnson admits that the pieces scare 
up poignant images of the past: the bombing of a Birmingham church, the "For 
Colored Only" signs at the Dairy Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he's drawn to the items for two reasons. "In order to know who 
and where you are, you have to know what you came from," he explains. "We have 
a tendency to see it only in the negative. (But) black people were used to 
advertise a plethora of items, I'm just enthralled by how entrenched we were in 
American country -- from soap and postcards to pancakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The collectibles also give Johnson a chance to share a tangible history with 
his niece and nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It offers a link and . . . new awareness to the past. By learning you have an 
opportunity to define what you are about. It gives me a sense of 
self-definition. I can now define who I am as a man, and as an African American 
male." 
</P>
<P>
 Because, Johnson adds, "It helped me to be able to (see) how far I'd come, so 
I could appreciate my own personal growth and the progress that my race has 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This passion to carefully collect what others find offensive or contemptible, 
as a tool for empowerment, isn't particular to African Americans. A New York 
Times Magazine feature last year, headlined "Evil for Sale," reported on 
several Jewish collectors who deal in Nazi memorabilia. Said one: "With the 
Nazi stuff, it's a matter of feeling victorious. . . . You may have killed my 
relatives, but I own you now." 
</P>
<P>
 But for others the collecting is neither catharsis nor enrichment, the 
artifacts sources of neither strength nor inspiration. The impulse is more 
about not forgetting a deplorable past. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Turner, UC Davis associate professor, keeps her goods in boxes. 
Finding a place for them in her home is about as dicey as understanding their 
place in society -- and their tenacious reshaping of the culture. To her 
reading, Knight's revival of the Jemima image is further evidence of these 
symbols' awesome staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 The '60s, Turner points out in her book "Ceramic Uncles," saw the retreat of 
some of the more heinous images. But slowly they've reappeared or taken new 
form -- from the enduring television mammies of "Beulah" and "Gimme a Break" to 
the big-screen cliche of chauffeur and fix-it man from "Lilies of the Field" to 
"Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the dawning of the '80s, a nostalgia mode kicked in, Turner believes. 
"I think the whole of American society . . . was reinventing the past in a warm 
and fuzzy kind of way that was real appealing, and that made it a little bit 
more acceptable for these products to appear with these icons." 
</P>
<P>
 Determining why their popularity has increased among African Americans becomes 
a shade more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Black people, Turner says, will give you a range of reasons. And although the 
"why" people collect varies wildly, as does what is personally derived from the 
pieces, the motivations are strikingly similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about how excited my relatives would be when blacks first showed up 
on television," Turner recalls, "and it really didn't matter that it was 'Amos 
and Andy,' it was just confirmation that there were blacks in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner believes that a direct line can be drawn between the thirst to collect 
these objects and the limited access to "genuine" black history. "You become 
convinced because of movies . . . that real black women were like (the buxom 
mammy) in the era of slavery . . . (historically) few households had that 
figure in it. It's a fiction. She didn't exist in that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some kind of reality, Turner acknowledges, is better than nothing. "Ralph 
Ellison got it right with 'The Invisible Man.' Not to see yourself at all, 
that's the bottom . . . but the ideal would be something that spoke to the 
three-dimensional aspects of who we've been." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Breye, whose Museum in Black's front-space sells African masks, 
fetishes, jewelry and sacred pieces, has built a back-room library-cum-museum 
overflowing with black memorabilia -- labels for such delicacies as "Negro Head 
Oysters" and "Uncle Remus Syrup," ceramic figurines of sloe-eyed African 
porters, docile Uncle Toms with a horseshoe of snowy hair. There are ashtrays 
the shape of blatantly anatomically incorrect lips, cast-iron mammy doorstops, 
pickaninny draft catchers. 
</P>
<P>
 His sentiments lie a world away from Johnson's or Jackson's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find them to be very offensive," Breye says flatly. "But it is a sad 
chapter in American history." He is always looking for something that might 
fill some gap -- primarily "anything exceptionally offensive or exceptionally 
old. The high end of the degradation, this needs to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite, or quite possibly because of the painful aspects, this history is a 
necessity for the younger people to see, Breye says. "Otherwise they may never 
even know that it did exist. . . . I think we fail to look back into the past, 
and we fail to say to ourselves, never again." 
</P>
<P>
 Breye's concern is not born out of paranoia. One look at the surfeit of modern 
reproductions -- from blue greeting cards to mammy trivets -- proves that there 
are still impulses and intentions left to examine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enormous difference if people are making them now," says New 
York-based collector and writer Jeff Weinstein. "In a world where a tremendous 
civil rights struggle has been fought, the way in which these images are 
understood must be different to any eye. You can only think that people are 
surpassingly ignorant or greedy or sometimes both. The historian will want the 
genuine article. To reproduce them is beyond comprehension. What possible 
service could that serve?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery Sims, associate curator of 20th Century Art at New York's Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, sees the items' popularity, among blacks especially, as an 
indication of something larger, reverberations of a movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every group has to live with their stereotypes. Like Steppin Fetchit," Sims 
says. "You can reject it or you can examine it. Look forward and see the 
subversion in his behavior. By dragging his feet he's slowing progress. And 
there's a great sense of personal power in that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way she sees those images as coded messages of subversion, 
retooled activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "For blacks, there's always been a post-civil rights black aesthetic. Kind of 
a fashion statement. We're reclaiming cornrows, braids. You see those images in 
black memorabilia. Or in Patrick Kelly's fashions. If you look at the average 
young brother in dreads, old people think it's awful, that he's wearing that 
'pickaninny hairdo.' But these remembrances are kind of a natural kind of 
straightforward representation of who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 History, Weinstein says, always changes objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way that you beat these monsters is look them in the face and laugh 
at them. I hope that this can happen. But you shouldn't be destroying these 
objects, so that the impulse that produced them will never happen again."

A CELESTIAL EVENT FOR A PREMIER STARGAZER; CELEBRATIONS: A GALAXY OF 
SCIENTISTS, JOURNALISTS, ARTISTS AND 300 OTHERS SALUTE CARL SAGAN ON HIS 60TH 
BIRTHDAY -- AND ON HIS CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO SPACE EXPLORATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As parties go, it was out of this world, a truly heavenly event. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate his 60th trip around the Sun -- as his wife and co-author Ann 
Druyan poetically put it -- Carl Sagan's closest colleagues and kin decided to 
host a gala birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sort of fete do you stage for America's most famous astronomer, a 
pedagogue who has turned the planet into his classroom, a writer who limes pop 
science books with almost Asimovian energy, a debunker of the fraudulent and a 
champion of international comity, a one-man early warning system against the 
dangers of nuclear winter, a star professor so recognizable he can't walk a 
street from Tokyo to Tadzhikistan without people asking for his autograph? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came when a galaxy of scientists, diplomats, artists, journalists 
and about 300 other "friends of Carl" descended upon Cornell University -- not 
only to toast Sagan, but to talk learnedly for two days about some of his 
favorite themes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, as geologist Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of 
Sciences and President Jimmy Carter's science adviser, dryly noted, an occasion 
where the collective "intelligence quotient was higher than the cholesterol 
quotient." 
</P>
<P>
 As any event linked with the Sagan name would have to be, last week's 
proceedings had their share of the wondrous and mind-expanding, such as the 
speculations by the Jet Propulsion Lab's director, Edward C. Stone, about the 
origins of life in the organic soups of such forbidding places as Saturn's 
giant moon, Titan, and the vivid descriptions by UC Santa Cruz radio astronomer 
Frank Drake and Harvard physicist Paul Horowitz of the search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in the faint radio whispers from deep 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the birthday itself, which actually occurs Nov. 9 (when Upstate New 
York's notorious cold and snow would have made such a party harder to stage), 
Sagan has plenty to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences gave him its highest medal 
-- the Public Welfare Medal -- for "communicating the wonders of science" to 
the public. That partly made up for what Caltech black-hole theorist Kip Thorne 
called its "shameful decision" in blackballing probably the country's most 
recognizable scientist from membership. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sagan's latest book, "Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future 
in Space" (Random House), is about to appear in bookstores. And in the midst of 
the festivities here, word came from Hollywood that Jodie Foster had agreed to 
play the lead role of the radio astronomer who discovers the first indication 
of extraterrestrial life in the film version of Sagan's science-fiction novel, 
"Contact." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an icon of modern society and science," said Wesley Huntress, NASA's 
associate director for space science, politely forgetting the space agency's 
occasional pique over Sagan's loudly proclaimed preference for robotic 
exploration of space instead by its favored manned missions.  
</P>
<P>
 At the party, there were there no allusions to Sagan's well-known temper, such 
as his recent threat to sue Apple Computer when some of its engineers playfully 
called the in-house prototype of a new computer "Sagan," or to the recent 
brouhaha at Cornell, when a conservative student magazine announced a mock "I 
Rubbed Shoulders with Carl Sagan" contest. This was a not-so-sly reference to 
the irritation of some Cornell faculty and students at the frequent absences of 
their celebrated David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences and 
director of Cornell's Laboratory for Planetary Studies because of far-flung 
lecturing and writing commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the plain-spoken Caltech geologist Bruce Murray, a former JPL director 
and co-founder with Sagan of the 100,000-member Planetary Society, glancingly 
took note of such storms by saying he admired Carl for how he "can take abuse 
in a world-class way." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there was tribute to Sagan's international impact. Russian space 
scientist Roald Sagdeev -- who sealed the end of the Cold War in a very 
personal way by marrying political scientist Susan Eisenhower, President Dwight 
D. Eisenhower's granddaughter -- spoke of how the Kremlin listened to Sagan, 
whose books are widely read in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Ronald Reagan came to Moscow, Sagdeev recalled, Mikhail 
Gorbachev urged him to endorse a joint Soviet-American manned expedition to 
Mars. Reagan welcomed the idea, Sagdeev said, until he was told that it came 
from Sagan, perhaps the most vociferous opponent of Reagan's "Star Wars" 
program. "End of this project," Sagdeev said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was lots of good old Saganesque fun, such as the mocking denunciations 
by the magician, peripatetic skeptic and MacArthur "genius" fellow James (the 
Amazing) Randi of spoon-bending psychics and scientific gobbledygook. 
</P>
<P>
 The party-goers -- who included Sagan's five children from his three marriages 
and his first wife, Lynn Margulis -- were hard pressed to find appropriate 
gifts for a man who has the universe at his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 One young Cornell undergraduate offered a poetic tribute describing how Sagan 
had opened her eyes to the stars -- those "pinpricks of infinity," as she 
lyrically put it. Both Cornell's astronomy department and Greek friends came up 
with identical offerings: busts of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, otherwise 
known as Venus -- her namesake planet was the subject of Sagan's doctoral 
thesis at the University of Chicago more than three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the most far-out present came from JPL astronomer Eleanor Helin. 
Exercising the privilege of a discoverer, she named a small, seven-mile-long 
asteroid circling the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter as 2709 Sagan. 
It is traveling close to a somewhat larger rock already named 4973 Druyan. 
Which promoted Helin to add with a twinkle: "They'll be eternal companions." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the high-powered competition, Sagan was clearly the star of his own 
party. In rolling cadences, before an SRO audience in Cornell's cavernous 
Bailey Hall, he delivered a passionately felt homily on the self-centeredness 
of the human species that was, oddly enough, coming as it did from the lips of 
this quintessential skeptic, almost biblical in message and tone. ("You know, 
there is more than a touch of the preacher in Carl," said the Very Rev. James 
Peter Morton, the dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a tiny blue dot projected on a huge screen above him in the 
darkened auditorium, Sagan identified it as a photograph of Earth taken by the 
Voyager spacecraft in one last backward glance as it left the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the voice coming from the podium, there was nary a sound in the 
hall, not a cough or a whisper. "Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, 
the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are 
challenged by this point of pale light," Sagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. . . . There 
is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this 
distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to 
deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue 
dot, the only home we've every known."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: PREDICTABLE? NO WAY -- BUT YOU KNEW SHE'D SAY THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Am I getting predictable? 
</P>
<P>
 Do I say only nice things about Democrats and only nasty things about 
Republicans? Would I condemn violence only on the part of an anti-abortion 
activist and ignore violence perpetrated by the forces of pro-choice? 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh, I hope not. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, readers have accused me of hypocrisy for not defending Arianna 
Huffington's right to take a leading role in her husband's U.S. Senate 
campaign. After all, didn't I rush to defend Hillary Clinton's high profile 
during Bill's presidential campaign? So, some readers wonder, why don't I 
support Arianna? 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show: I support Arianna Huffington running her husband's 
campaign 1 , 000%.  
</P>
<P>
 If I were going to condemn Arianna -- whose Picasso biography I immensely 
enjoyed, by the way -- it would be for her inane ideas about charity, her 
obfuscation of her ties to "wayshower" John-Roger, and her 
"pay-no-attention-to-the-woman-behind-the-curtains" pose. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna and Mike Huffington have denied what former campaign workers say is 
her deep involvement in her husband's campaign. This speaks to a certain lack 
of candor and an odd defensiveness on the part of both Huffingtons. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton's detractors might put it: "It's the integrity, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 But there I go again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, readers are predictable too. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a regular correspondent who likes to deface my columns and send them 
back to me, but -- and here is the predictable part -- only when I write about 
abortion, immigration or gay rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, I opened a piece of mail and a neatly clipped recent column of 
mine came fluttering out. The column was one in which I questioned the motives 
of people who pine for "the good old days," which, after all, weren't so great 
for whole bunches of people. 
</P>
<P>
 My correspondent had defaced the column with a red felt-tip pen. All my words 
had been crossed out, and a few swastikas added for . . . what? Extra 
decoration, I guess. Above and below my name, the reader had written in a 
delicate hand, "Satan's Little Whore." 
</P>
<P>
 (For the record, I have no personal relationship with Satan. I don't even like 
heavy metal. And although I would prefer being called "petite," "little" 
works.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I want to thank that reader, whoever you are, for you have given me a 
fabulous gift, the book title I have long been searching for. If you had 
identified yourself in your missive, I would have thanked you personally. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I'll just have to see you in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of predictability is something that -- you should pardon the 
expression -- bedevils the columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't want readers to assume they know what you're going to write on a 
given topic because if they already know what you're going to say, they'll just 
skip to the horoscope. Still, being human, I am not immune to the power of 
reverse psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, a reader sent me a copy of a wire-service brief that had 
appeared in his local newspaper (and The Times, although he had missed it), and 
dared me to write about it. The two-paragraph item began, "A man picking up his 
wife at a Louisiana abortion clinic shot at a demonstrator who had yelled, 
'You're killing your baby.' " (After one shot, the gun jammed; the protester 
was unhurt.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be very interested to see how you handle this one," wrote my un-fan, 
"since you have breathed fire on pro-lifers for such a long time. But, then, 
I'm equally sure you won't touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah? Take that back! 
</P>
<P>
 I am horrified that anyone would shoot at anyone else. I think that the 
gunman, who was arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder, 
should face trial and the decision of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 I also think that if anti-abortion activists had not engaged in a systematic 
campaign of murder, bombing and other kinds of terror, it is very likely that a 
man taking his wife to exercise her legal right to an abortion would not be 
fearful enough to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But you probably knew I'd say that.

'90S FAMILY; POLICE OFFICER, PARENT . . . AND EXPERT JUGGLER

 Like thousands of other Los Angeles police officers, Sgt. Donna Roller heard a 
broadcast call to duty shortly after the Northridge earthquake. But there was 
just one tiny problem -- or, rather, three tiny problems -- that Roller had to 
attend to first: Rachel, 9 months, in diapers; Zachary, 2, sucking a pacifier, 
and Tyler, 4, clutching a teddy bear named Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember dropping the children off in their pajamas at the baby-sitter's, 
who had a tent pitched in the front yard of her house," said Roller, a single 
parent from Santa Clarita. "I thought to myself, how can I leave my kids in a 
place like this with glass and debris everywhere, the Earth shaking every 15 
minutes and no running water, gas or electricity?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roller's dilemma illustrates the double dose of stress many officers cope 
with: an ever-more-dangerous job combined with trying to fit flexible, 
affordable day care into an unpredictable work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for officer-parents was exposed during the city's recent string of 
disasters, when traditional day-care centers and baby-sitters could not handle 
the increased demands brought about by the riots, fires and earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted the Los Angeles Women Police Officers' Assn. to take action. 
Supported by Chief Willie L. Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan, the nonprofit 
support group is sponsoring a celebrity benefit on Saturday at Union Station in 
hopes of raising $150,000 to launch a 24-hour child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that the pilot Downtown center will be the first of four 
facilities that will serve children of LAPD employees as well as those of the 
Los Angeles City Fire Department during public emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-care horror stories abound within the LAPD. After the Jan. 17 
earthquake, some employees sent children out of state to stay with relatives; 
grandparents were flown in to baby-sit. Single parents have accepted reductions 
in responsibility and rank in order to care for their kids. And when 
baby-sitters suddenly take ill or have transportation problems, police 
employees frequently have no choice but to miss work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Lorrie Bostic of the Southeast Division quit the force to take care of 
her three small children. But recently, when her youngest entered preschool and 
she was ready to resume working, she found herself back at the Police Academy 
undergoing training as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Bostic's experience prompted her husband, Cmdr. Michael Bostic, to volunteer 
for the child-care project committee. "Everyone sees this as a women's issue 
and it's really a parent issue," said Michael Bostic, who is in charge of 
juvenile operations. "I honestly believe that we are losing a lot of good 
female officers because of a lack of child care." 
</P>
<P>
 These losses come at a time when the LAPD is under pressure to recruit and 
keep more female officers. On-site child care is seen as a way to achieve those 
aims, as well as cut absenteeism and even improve productivity. "You can't do 
your best when you are worried about your family," said Lt. Paulette Herman, 
president of the women officers group. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first weekend following the 1992 riots, Sgt. Lita Abella took her 
then-toddler, Christian, along to the Wilshire Division station, where officers 
watched him for an hour while she worked as watch commander. There have been 
other "totally desperate" times when Christian has spent eight-hour shifts at 
his mother's station, playing at the computer or typewriter or sitting at the 
front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Christian's birth four years ago, Abella, a 14-year LAPD veteran, had 
worked patrol assignments throughout various metropolitan divisions. 
Motherhood, she said, forced her to make a drastic career change and transfer 
to an administrative position with more stable hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Hernandez, meanwhile, leaves her Riverside home at 4 each morning and 
travels to Orange County to watch her 15-month-old granddaughter, Katie. The 
grueling commute allows Katie's mother, Officer Joanna Linfield of Internal 
Affairs, to be in her Downtown office by 6 a.m. "If it weren't for her, I 
really don't know what I would do," Linfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the riots, Linfield was sent out to work at a command post in 
South-Central during the day while her husband, Sgt. Don Linfield, worked the 
Central Division night shift. "We literally passed each other on the road," 
Linfield recalled. "We would toot our horns at each other and wave out the 
window and that was the only contact we had for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Joanna Linfield helped coordinate nearly 100 witnesses for 
acquitted Rodney King beating defendant Theodore Briseno's disciplinary 
hearing, in which he was ultimately terminated from the LAPD. Some of the 
sessions, Linfield said, went on until midnight. Such unpredictability creates 
a challenge for employees who need day -- and often night -- care for their 
young families. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the riots, I didn't see my kids for 21 days straight," Roller said. "I 
would leave the house at 4:30 a.m. before they woke up and wouldn't get back 
until 8:30 p.m. With a child-care center, I'd be able to take my lunch and 
visit. If one of the kids wasn't feeling well, I could bring them their 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD plans to dedicate its first child-care center to Officer Tina 
Kerbrat, mother of two young children, who was killed in the line of duty in 
1991. "She symbolizes the sacrifice of the women and mothers who put the needs 
of the community first," said Herman, of the women officers association. "We 
need to support these families."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; 'SELLING' A CHILD COULD GET TRICKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When children enter grade school, education begins -- for parents who want to 
learn what one mother calls "tricks of the trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to achieve an edge for their children in the sometimes 
bewildering world of public schools, where classes are large and diverse, the 
quality of teachers varies and personality often plays a role in success. 
They're afraid their shy children might disappear into the woodwork, their 
bright children won't get challenged, their slow children won't get the time 
and understanding they need. How to proceed? 
</P>
<P>
 In the comedy movie "Serial Mom," the solution was to bump off the offending 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Real-life solutions are more benign, but parents should be warned that the 
competition starts early and can be quite shrewd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has to make your child's need stand out," one mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents become their children's agent, trying to "sell" shy kids to busy 
or cold teachers. Others become school career managers, trying to customize 
their children's education with requests for specific teachers or gifted 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 While many volunteer in the classroom or give money and supplies with only 
altruistic motives, others do so to keep an eye on the teacher. Parents who 
want something in return must be "flagrant and subtle at the same time," says 
one mother. "Flagrant in what you do for them and subtle in what you want in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an extremely delicate relationship and an extremely delicate 
negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a few parents are shameless in offering presents or bribes. 
"I've seen some hire their kid's teacher as a tutor," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts in kindergarten. In affluent neighborhoods, as many as 40% of all 
boys are "redshirted," or delayed in entering kindergarten by parents hoping to 
gain a maturity edge, says Annette Lareau, associate professor of sociology at 
Temple University in Philadelphia. "But when they all try to do it, they lose 
the advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 The most common goal is to get a specific teacher, although some acknowledge 
that a teacher who was wonderful for one child might not be for another. The 
best approach, says California PTA board member Sheila Benecke, is never to 
mention a specific teacher's name, but rather to ask the current teacher in the 
spring semester conference to request one for the fall based on mutually agreed 
upon strengths and weaknesses of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran grade-school parents say power plays are a mixed bag. One mother says 
her biggest mistake was to tell the teacher that if she didn't lighten the 
homework load, she would tell the principal. The teacher agreed to a compromise 
solution, homework in advance, but later punished the child with a reduced 
grade, the mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mother says she wore herself out pleading with a teacher to move her 
son to a more challenging class. Then, she says, "I wrote a letter to the 
principal. I said I want my child moved. I didn't give a reason. I said I know 
my rights. He got moved." Now she says she always writes letters with copies to 
board members. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother says she tried to humanize her shy daughter to a teacher who 
"clearly had favorites that did not include my daughter." When that didn't 
work, she says she made up stories to her daughter about how the teacher had 
praised her work and effort in class. "She started to sparkle to the teacher 
and the teacher responded." By the end of the year, her daughter had earned a 
reputation as the teacher's pet. "I had to laugh," the mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 When parents' and teachers' personalities clash, sometimes it's best to simply 
lie low. "My son had one teacher I could not abide," one woman recalls. "I 
really avoided any meetings, I was not sure I could keep the edge out of my 
voice. I told him he was on his own with this one." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Lareau says, children of highly motivated parents do well in 
school anyway. Those who would benefit more from parental involvement are those 
who get it the least.

'90S FAMILY; WHO'S MINDING THE SITTER?; IS THE BABY-SITTER A NANNY FROM HELL OR 
A MARY POPPINS? MORE PARENTS ARE HIRING DETECTIVES AND SCREENING AGENCIES TO 
FIND OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIAN MARINO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The young parents knew something was amiss: Ever since they had hired a new 
baby-sitter two months earlier, their toddler had suffered recurring diaper 
rash and their telephone bills were unusually high. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a tiny camera concealed in a kitchen light, their suspicions 
were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sitter was on the phone 95% of the day. She didn't even take a break when 
feeding the little girl," said New York private detective Joseph Cialone, who 
exposed the neglectful nanny on video. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investigator Nicholas Beltrante of Alexandria, Va., got the goods on 
another sitter before his clients had a chance to hire her. A background check 
revealed two out-of-state theft convictions, including a break-in at the home 
of a past employer. 
</P>
<P>
 While most child-care providers are trustworthy, with clean records, some 
conceal undesirable qualities or shadier pasts that make them unsuitable for 
many lines of work -- most of all watching children. A growing number of 
nervous parents are hiring professional investigators like Cialone and 
Beltrante to weed out potential Nannies From Hell from the Mary Poppinses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a building trend . . . (that) began about seven or eight years ago," 
said Ralph Thomas, executive director of the National Assn. of Investigative 
Specialists in Austin, Tex. "All you have to do is sit down and read the 
newspaper and see the horror stories. It makes people think." 
</P>
<P>
 A random sampling of private investigators shows more have been devoting part 
of their practices to investigating child-care providers in recent years. At 
the same time, businesses have cropped up to help working parents make the 
right baby-sitting choices or to keep tabs on sitters after they are hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltrante said he's handling about 25% more child-care cases this year than 
last and expects even more next year. Many of his clients are working parents 
employed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing demographics are partly responsible for this growing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, you were able to leave your children with your mother, or a sister 
or an aunt, but many people don't have extended families they can count on. 
There are also more working mothers," said Cialone, whose Flushing, N.Y., 
agency I on U Inc. gets several dozen child-care cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, 55% of women with children ages 6 and under are in the work force 
today, and most rely on outsiders to watch their kids. Only 20% use relatives, 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more people looking for nannies than there are nannies available," 
said Dana Friedman, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a New 
York-based nonprofit research firm. "Most (nanny) agencies don't do a good job 
screening . . . because most of them are just looking for warm bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Sachs, president of the International Nanny Assn. in Norfolk, Neb., and 
owner of the placement agency Philadelphia Nanny Network Inc., said the 
professional group has a list of recommended practices for nanny agencies to 
follow, but it has no policing authority. She admitted that some agencies do a 
better job of screening applicants than others. 
</P>
<P>
 She advised parents: "One factor you should consider is the (agency's) fee. 
You have to realize you're going to get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean the better agency is the higher-priced agency . . . but it is 
a factor to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Sachs said her nanny agency typically uncovers a criminal record in less than 
1% of the applicants it screens and a bad driving record in about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 What most independent investigative services promise is a thorough screening 
of job applicants within a week, including a verification of their identity and 
checks of their criminal background, driving record and credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information doesn't come cheap. Flat fees for most private investigators 
run between $250 and $500, Thomas said. Expect to pay more, usually between $50 
and $65 per hour, if results must be expedited or if other information needs to 
be checked out, such as references or multi-state court records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most require permission from the person being investigated, although some 
admit to having run checks without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ChildCare Registry Inc., based in Danville, Calif., charges $140 for a 
pre-employment screening that uses a New Jersey private investigator to check a 
candidate's criminal, civil and driving records, along with his or her 
educational background. 
</P>
<P>
 Many professional nannies also order checks of themselves and keep updated 
copies on file for future employment references, said Ellen Tauscher, a former 
Wall Street investment banker who founded ChildCare Registry two years ago. 
Tauscher said business is brisk, with an average 450 inquiries a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Information Network in Annandale, Va., offers another service -- a 
telephone hot line that tells callers where they can get the same information 
that private investigators get. The cost is $3.99 per minute, with each call 
averaging six minutes; DIN also can do the investigating for you for about 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of this is public information anyway," with the exception of credit 
reports, and even those can be accessed with an individual's permission, said 
co-owner Frank Dillon, a former Air Force spy who started the company in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon noted that half the states have centralized police data bases that can 
be publicly accessed, while all states maintain computerized records of motor 
vehicle violations. County courthouses will also keep records of criminal and 
civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, for example, can say if someone has 
been convicted of a crime in that state. The Illinois Department of Motor 
Vehicles keeps records of moving violations for four years, license suspensions 
for seven years and drunken-driving convictions indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of privacy concerns, private citizens and most businesses don't have 
legal access to the most comprehensive criminal records, compiled by the U.S. 
Department of Justice and maintained by the National Crime Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other limits. While job applicants may come up clean in one county 
or state, their records might be overlooked elsewhere if they failed to mention 
they had moved. That includes arrests during vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, arrest records of their spouses or live-in companions wouldn't be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 50-state patchwork quilt and it's a mess," Tauscher said. "The sad 
thing is parents can't do all this checking. Many are financially strapped as 
well as time-strapped."

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; CREATIVE GENIUS WHO WAS FUELED BY A DEEP-SEATED ANGER; 
MAD AS HELL: THE LIFE AND WORK OF PADDY CHAYEFSKY BY SHAUN CONSIDINE ; RANDOM 
HOUSE $25, 304 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Precious few writers can be conjured up by a single phrase from their work: 
"To be or not to be," "Call me Ishmael," "Do not go gentle into that good 
night." But a streetwise boy from the Bronx named Paddy Chayefsky muscled his 
way into the company of Shakespeare, Melville and Dylan Thomas with one 
enduring line from the motion picture "Network." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Chayefsky was mad indeed, and in more than one sense -- Shaun Considine's 
accomplished biography of the late Paddy Chayefsky allows us to see that the 
writer was both afflicted with and inspired by volcanic anger and a certain 
kind of lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paddy has something I call divine madness," observed Peter Finch, the actor 
who spoke the famous lines in "Network." "There's a manic quality in his work 
that I adore." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us also remember Chayefsky for other memorable work in motion 
pictures: "Marty" won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and contributed its own 
distinctive catch phrase to the popular culture: "Whaddya wanna do tonight, 
Marty?" "The Americanization of Emily" is a cult classic, and Chayefsky remains 
the only screenwriter to win three Academy Awards: "Marty," "Hospital" and 
"Network" were each honored with an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Considine, an admiring and compassionate biographer who hails Chayefsky as "a 
plenary artist," depicts him as a man driven not only by genius but also by an 
ambition to redeem himself from the self-doubt and even self-loathing that 
plagued him throughout his troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the Bronx in 1923 to a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia, 
Chayefsky came of age in the superheated environment of Depression-era America. 
At first, his skill at the well-spoken word was put to use not on the stage but 
on the mean streets of New York, where his gift of gab allowed him to survive 
the unfriendly attention of neighborhood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a sudden, biting summer squall, he let loose with a rapid, nonstop, 
brilliant, absolutely incisive commentary on everything that stood or moved on 
Tibbett Avenue," Considine writes of young Chayefsky. "The linguistic storm, 
charged by a rich, pungent vocabulary, mesmerized and captivated the hostile 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chayefsky was also afflicted with fear, despair and anger that sometimes 
spiraled downward into depression. An early adolescent rejection at a school 
dance -- "He's too short and fat," said one girl as she passed him over -- 
became an emblem of the barbed anxiety that triggered "dark dreams" that 
persisted even to his deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Considine fancies that Chayefsky was, like the Jekyll-and-Hyde scientist in 
"Altered States," something of a split personality, and he summons up two 
incarnations of the man, calling one by his given name, Sidney, and the other 
by the more familiar nickname that Chayefsky picked up when he saw combat in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paddy was a persona," recalls Dan Chayefsky, Paddy's son, "whereas Sidney was 
the vulnerable being he was born with." 
</P>
<P>
 From Considine's chatty account emerges a portrait of Chayefsky as an 
ambitious man who invented himself as an artist in an era when no one had yet 
figured out the rules of the game. Chayefsky managed to distinguish himself as 
a playwright, a screenwriter and a television scriptwriter -- and often with 
the very same story. "Middle of the Night," for example, started out as a 
television production, went to the legitimate stage, and ended up on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hungry young playwright, Chayefsky would pitch jokes to Milton Berle at 
Lindy's delicatessen for a quick five or 10 bucks. Later, when he was flush, 
Chayefsky became a regular player at floating poker games on both coasts; 
Chayefsky tended to chatter at the table, Considine writes, but fellow player 
Neil Simon kept a poker face. And he achieved a moment of self-redemption when 
the short and fat Chayefsky conducted a flirtation with the sublime Kim Novak 
on the set of "Middle of the Night" -- but she quickly dumped him in favor of 
Cary Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddy, of course, gets most of the attention in "Mad As Hell," but Considine's 
book also serves as a star-studded and wholly absorbing history of the 
entertainment industry in New York and Los Angeles during a particularly 
tumultuous but also fecund period. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop-culture buffs will appreciate Considine's loving attention to the 
so-called Golden Age of Television and the making of Chayefsky's movies, all of 
it told with sharp insight into entertainment industry politics, a frank 
interest in who did what to whom, and a genuine passion for the antics of 
writers, actors, directors, producers and assorted moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Considine allows director Sidney Lumet to explain in rather 
charming technical detail exactly how he shot a nude scene in "Network" in 
which Faye Dunaway straddles William Holden so that certain specified features 
of Dunaway's anatomy would not be seen on the screen. And he gives the final 
budget for "Altered States" right down to the last dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altered States," as it turns out, was Chayefsky's last and most troubled 
project. "On 'Altered States' it was a constant inner battle between my father 
and his ego," recalls Chayefsky's son. The ego won, and the man himself was a 
casualty; barely two years later, at the age of 58, he was diagnosed with the 
cancer that killed, but we might as well call it terminal anger.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: DEBATES: HE SAID, SHE SAID, SO WHAT?

 "Michael, you mindless, mewing moron."  
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne, you insidious insider and flip-flopping flotsam."  
</P>
<P>
 "Pete, you teetering, two-faced twit."  
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen, you sanctimonious, soft-on-crime simpleton." In a California 
election season dominated by a zinging cross-fire of political spots, rare live 
television encounters between candidates can resonate out of proportion to 
their true value, assuming a blustery life of their own despite their 
irrelevance. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash back to Friday night's gubernatorial debate on TV between incumbent Pete 
Wilson and challenger Kathleen Brown, the state treasurer. Aired nationally on 
C-SPAN and on a modest statewide network that included KCET-TV Channel 28 in 
Los Angeles, was this a mismatch or what? 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates were questioned by a panel of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the Republican, frequently stumbled, appearing nervous and tired. He 
was a sluggish and unfocused monotone, a dull, bland, uncharismatic minimalist. 
Not a good performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Brown, on the other hand, was lively, crisp and incisive. She was 
commanding, confidant. She was forceful and well-prepared. Right on cue, she 
was dramatic when she had to be, tailoring her responses to the TV format and 
its pre-arranged time constraints. Whereas Wilson had to be cut off on occasion 
when he ran out of time -- making him look confused and even amateurish -- 
Brown's debate blueprint coincided with the camera. She was superbly coached, 
punching home her messages, maximizing her opportunities by consistently ending 
her monologues on strong points only seconds before her time expired, as if 
guided by an internal clock. An excellent performance from a candidate trailing 
in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 So? 
</P>
<P>
 So . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you saw Brown or Wilson as triumphant (such judgments are highly 
subjective), it's absurd to believe that television debates or forums 
necessarily indicate a candidate's qualifications for office. They don't. 
Although it's widely accepted that these events are indispensable for informing 
the electorate, they indicate only how good or bad candidates are in front of 
the camera in a given instance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's much more to be gained, potentially, from having foes sit with a 
single questioner in a more intimate setting, as Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) and Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) did recently on a 
"Larry King Live" hour regarding the tight California race for U.S. senator. As 
for illumination, though, this CNN event was as low on wattage as the 
Wilson-Brown debate, dimmed by King's passivity and reluctance or inability to 
pointedly challenge either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wilson and Brown, political observers say that both candidates did 
their share of fudging the truth when it came to defending their own positions 
and characterizing the opposition's. So on the integrity barometer, the debate 
appeared to be a wash. If you do concur that Brown had a better night in front 
of the camera, though, it means only that she gave the better performance, not 
that being more comfortable on television necessarily made her the better 
candidate. If Wilson had outshone her, the same would apply to him. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the very qualities that usually win favor in such TV debates -- the 
quick quip, the practiced delivery, the dramatic pause followed by the 
memorable sound bite (as in Brown's "Don't read his lips, read my plan!") -- 
are relatively unrelated to effective governing. They are related to theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, weighing matters thoughtfully before making a decision is crucial 
to governing or being a good legislator. But catch a candidate doing that in 
one of these televised debates and he or she is finished, automatically 
relegated by pundits to the rubble heap of fuzzy-headed incompetents. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson or Brown had bent to pressure by flipping out and pulling a Captain 
Queeg, chattering out of control while nervously massaging a handful of ball 
bearings, then you would have had something. But neither did. TV debates, to 
say nothing of political ads, yield no such spontaneity. Even the most 
persuasive ones are long on image, short on usable information. 
</P>

 DECENT DAN: Monday's live, satellite interview crackled across the airwaves. 
"I think you got another bestseller here," KCBS-TV Channel 2 
anchor-turned-literary critic Tritia Toyota assured CBS News anchor Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather apparently felt no hypocrisy in using a noon newscast on his network's 
Los Angeles station to promote his new book that laments the "Hollywoodization 
of the news." He also decries the "sleazing of news." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not exempt himself or his employer from this indictment. "I include 
myself in this criticism, and do not exclude CBS News from it," he said. As for 
"over-coverage of the Simpson case," in which CBS has been a participant, he 
said, "We should stop what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, of course. What's puzzling here, though, is that if Rather is so 
distressed about the "sleazing of news" -- was he including the rink-side 
exclusives with Tonya Harding by his co-anchor, Connie Chung? -- why doesn't he 
use his influence to help end it at his own network? In addition to co-anchor, 
he is, after all, managing editor of the "CBS Evening News," as well as anchor 
of "48 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather said he hoped his book would encourage "those wee, small voices within 
ourselves" crying out for better journalism. Alas, there seems as much chance 
of that as of Channel 2 interviewing NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings 
when their books come out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 INQUIRING MINDS: Tongues are wagging about tabloid TV shows allegedly opening 
their wallets for exclusive rights to a videotape of the 1985 O.J. 
Simpson-Nicole Brown wedding. According to the show biz paper Variety, such a 
tape could bring up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such interest? In addition to the marriage ceremony, says Variety, the 
alleged tape includes the bride in her underwear getting dressed for her 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this is anything more than wild rumor remains to be seen. In any case, 
my own reliable sources inform me that "Hard Copy" is offering $3.5 million to 
anyone who can produce a videotape of Princess Di in her underwear getting 
dressed for a date with Joey Buttafuoco.

MUSIC; STAPLES TAKES THE LEAD WITH PACIFIC SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As new concertmaster of the Pacific Symphony, which opens its 1994-95 season 
tonight in Costa Mesa, Sheryl Staples will play both Follow the Leader and Lead 
the Followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many different things that the concertmaster is called on to 
do," said Staples, 25. "But from the standpoint of interpreting the conductor's 
gestures, the concertmaster is almost a secondary figure for the orchestra to 
watch. If there's ever a question in the players' minds about what they're 
seeing on the podium, it's traditional to look to the concertmaster for some 
sort of clarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in this case, St.Clairity. Music director Carl St.Clair will conduct the 
world premiere of Frank Ticheli's "Pacific Fanfare," James Hopkins' "Songs of 
Eternity" and Mozart's Requiem, K. 626. The concerts tonight and Thursday 
feature soprano Korliss Uecker, mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella, tenor David 
Hamilton and bass Brian Matthews as vocal soloists, and the Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 Staples' appointment came after a yearlong search, but the orchestra didn't 
have to look very far. Staples has a high profile in Southern California, 
having served as concertmaster for the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra, Japan 
America Symphony, USC Symphony Orchestra and Young Musicians Foundation Debut 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she noted, "I had a history with the Pacific Symphony that brings things 
full circle": Staples was the 19-year-old soloist in Tchaikovsky's Violin 
Concerto in 1988 at the orchestra's summer "Tchaikovsky Spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Her new job with the Pacific won't put an end to her solo and chamber-music 
careers. (She appears regularly at the La Jolla and Santa Fe chamber-music 
festivals.) "The Pacific Symphony has about 20 weeks of performing during the 
season," Staples said. "That's a nice amount for me. If I were joining a 
full-time orchestra, it would limit all that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might also limit her teaching activities. Staples is one of the youngest 
faculty members at USC, where she earned her Artist Diploma, and at the nearby 
R.D. Colburn School of Performing Arts, which she attended as a W.M. Keck 
Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't expect her age to be a problem in her new capacity at the Pacific 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just attempt to be as professional as I can and do my job," Staples said. 
"Usually that, and a little bit of time, has earned the respect of any people 
initially not comfortable with a younger person sitting in front of them in the 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could ask the same question about being a woman," she pointed out. "I 
realize times are different now than 50 years ago, but I approach it the same 
way, as a non-issue, and it's never caused a problem for me. If I went into 
rehearsal in shorts and a tank top and my hair up in a ponytail, that would 
draw attention to it -- that would not go over so well." 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the selection process might also help ensure Staples' acceptance 
among her peers. She was chosen from among nine finalists, each of whom had 
served as guest concertmaster last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "An audition for any other position in the orchestra takes place behind a 
screen; it's completely anonymous," she explained. "In the case of 
concertmaster, the music director already has people in mind, and they're 
invited to audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players usually either have that kind of leadership role in mind or not," she 
continued. "Not everybody wants to be leading. Not everybody wants to be a 
business executive. There's a lot of pride just to be playing well. . . . To my 
knowledge, nobody in the orchestra was trying out for that position." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staples studied violin from the age of 9 with Robert Lipsett; she singles out 
Jascha Heifetz as a role model. "He's just king of the violin as far as I'm 
concerned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for part of the year at least, she'll take her cue from St.Clair. She was 
flattered by recent comments the conductor made, in which he cited "a very 
strong musical connection" with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've described the relationship . . . as something like a conversation," 
Staples said. "If you are in a conversation, you can tell very quickly if 
you're on the same wavelength. You sit down with someone you don't know, either 
things are clicking or they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 * Carl St.Clair leads the Pacific Symphony in works by Mozart, James Hopkins 
and Frank Ticheli tonight and Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 8 p.m. $14-$41. Student/senior rush, 
$8. (714) 755-5799 or (714) 740-2000 ( Ticketmaster).

A DO-IT-YOURSELF MUSICIAN; STUDIO WIZARD DAVE EDMUNDS PREFERS TO ROCK ON HIS 
OWN -- AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Edmunds is a firm believer in the adage that if you want something done 
right you should do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Welsh rocker scored his biggest career hit in 1970 with the single, "I 
Hear You Knocking." Edmunds' elaborate reworking of the Smiley Lewis R & B 
chestnut wasn't quite a do-it-yourself job: He relied on a bass player and a 
second guitarist to round out a production that included his own drumming, his 
own multiple layers of guitars, and his own echo-drenched singing that sounded 
as if he'd funneled his voice through a bullhorn. But some of his other 
early-'70s recordings were indeed all his own work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Edmunds began to emphasize collaborative music-making, as 
he hooked up with the corps of sharp English roots-influenced rockers he dubbed 
Rockpile. He also began serving others with his studio know-how, producing 
successful records for the Everly Brothers, the Stray Cats, the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds and k.d. lang. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few years ago, Edmunds decided to go back to his beginnings as a 
do-it-yourselfer. He retreated to the spare bedroom of his Los Angeles home for 
six months in 1992-93, didn't let anybody else have a hand in what he was 
doing, and emerged with his current album, "Plugged In." 
</P>
<P>
 The album displays Edmunds' acumen in a wide range of roots-rock and pure-pop 
styles, from the hard-hitting chug of the ZZ Top-like "Chutes and Ladders" to 
the country twanging of "The Claw" by Jerry Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Standing at the Crossroads," Edmunds approximates the sound of Levon Helm 
fronting the Band in one of its more lighthearted moments. On the biggest 
production number, "Beach Boy Blood (in My Veins)," he overdubbed his voice 19 
times to get a facsimile of the elaborate harmonies of Brian Wilson and 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds, 51, likes the results and says he will continue to record in solitude 
for the foreseeable future (he has company for his tour, though: at the Coach 
House tonight, he'll be backed by a three-man band). 
</P>
<P>
 "I love working at home," Edmunds said in a recent phone interview from New 
York City, where he was awaiting a club date with pal Joe Walsh and a 
sitting-in appearance with the "Saturday Night Live" band. "I wouldn't like to 
go back to doing it the regular way in a professional studio. I think this is 
it for me from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief obstacle to solo recording, Edmunds says, was something he calls 
"decision fatigue," which sets in when there are no other musicians or 
engineers to bounce ideas off of during the recording process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a decision in everything: Which guitar should I use? Which amp? When 
you get decision fatigue," he said, "you have to take a break and come back 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds said he usually dealt with such brain-weariness not by switching on 
the TV, but by doing studio scut-work such as sweeping up and calibrating his 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when a creative mood struck, the machinery was already fine-tuned and he 
could rock ahead without having to wait out the frustrating technical delays 
that musicians often face when they are itching to nail down a spontaneous 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds learned his craft at a studio in Wales that a friend of his set up in 
a drafty converted barn on a dairy farm.  
</P>
<P>
 "It started as a little studio with just two mono (recording) machines," 
Edmunds recalled. "As the studio expanded and they added more equipment, my 
knowledge went with it. It was an apprenticeship." 
</P>
<P>
 The only real gap in Edmunds' resume has been songwriting. While he writes 
some of his own material, including two of the songs on "Plugged In," he has 
relied mainly on songs from outside writers, drawing upon the country, R&B and 
roots-rock traditions, or culling songs from such notables as Graham Parker, 
Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe (who was part of the Rockpile consortium that 
released one album of its own and also served as the studio band for solo 
albums by Edmunds and Lowe). 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds says that he has never tried deliberately to turn himself into a 
songwriter. If he has made any conscious effort, he said with a laugh, "It was 
not enough. It's not a matter of effort and will. There's like a gift that 
comes to you. I'm more concerned about the quality of the songs (on my albums) 
than (I am about) who wrote them. There's too many bad songs out there, and too 
many people writing songs who aren't songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a special craft. Nick Lowe is definitely a tunesmith. My love is 
production, making records, engineering, tinkering around in the studio. I'm 
not so swept away with the idea of songwriting, especially when I listen to 
(songwriters) who are swept away, like Chuck Berry and John Lennon." 
</P>
<P>
 The stage isn't Edmunds' most comfortable habitat, either. "I don't see myself 
as a natural performer, an extrovert who's always ready to go leaping on stage. 
I'm introverted, and that doesn't make for the best show-biz type." 
</P>
<P>
 He does, however, "start getting itchy" when he has been off the stage too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he returned to touring with a band comprising three players he 
hadn't previously worked with: bassist John Regan and drummer Jamie Oldacker, 
both of whom also play with Peter Frampton, and guitarist Bobby Bandiera, who 
has played with Southside Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his first tour this decade as a solo artist (Edmunds did preside in 1990 
over a touring troupe known as the Dave Edmunds Rock & Roll Revue, which also 
included co-headliners Dion DiMucci, Graham Parker and Kim Wilson. He also 
played in Ringo Starr's "All Starr Band" on its 1992 tour). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Edmunds said, he toyed with the idea of trying to re-form 
Rockpile. The band broke up in 1981, mainly because of Edmunds' displeasure 
with its manager, Jake Riviera, and the way Riviera had handled the contract 
for Rockpile's first and only album, "Seconds of Pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to regroup, Edmunds said, "we would have had to resolve the problem 
that broke us up in the first place. I talked to Billy (Bremner), Terry 
(Williams) and Nick. For a couple of days I had the idea. Now I've lost all 
interest in the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds teamed again with Lowe in 1990 as producer of Lowe's enjoyable but 
overlooked solo album, "Party of One." He thinks it is unlikely they will 
collaborate again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very much enjoy working with Nick, but as long as he's with Jake (Riviera, 
who continues to manage Lowe), I'm not going to work with him. I just don't get 
along with" Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the few sour notes the upbeat Edmunds strikes in conversation. His 
career has demonstrated his ability to get along with a wide variety of 
musicians, many of them his all-time favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played with all three surviving Beatles, starting with Paul McCartney, 
whom Edmunds backed for the filming of McCartney's 1984 box-office bomb, "Give 
My Regards to Broad Street." Rounding out the band were Ringo Starr and Chris 
Spedding, another noted British guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds and George Harrison were neighbors for a time during the '80s, and 
struck up a friendship. "George is a great person, a unique person. We sat up 
at 3 in the morning in his house playing Beatles songs. I put together a 'Carl 
Perkins and Friends' show for HBO, and George came out and did it." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Chuck Berry surprised Edmunds by turning up at his St. Louis 
concert, joining him for an unplanned encore of "Roll Over Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with just about all my living heroes," Edmunds said. And he 
doesn't worry that his music will be remembered more for openly reflecting the 
influence of those heroes, than for a groundbreaking, innovative sound that 
could be called Edmunds' own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never take music that seriously," Edmunds said. "I'm just having fun, doing 
what I want. I like singing, I like playing guitar like Chet Atkins or Jerry 
Reed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he continued, the enthusiasm rising in his typically pleasant but 
low-keyed voice. "I get paid for it. I don't have to wake up in the morning and 
punch the clock, and I've been doing it for 25 years. It's been fantastic." 
</P>
<P>

TV RATINGS; ROSEANNE'S TV BIO: FEW VIEWERS SEEM TO CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While her work remains appreciated, apparently there is a limit to how much 
the world wants to know about Roseanne. Viewers in nearly three times as many 
homes tuned in to watch the actress perform in her popular ABC sitcom last week 
than to see a TV movie on Fox about her seesaw life. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, "Roseanne: An Unauthorized Biography," ranked 91st among 94 
prime-time network programs on the ratings list released Tuesday by the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Fox had nine other shows among Nielsen's 15 lowest rated, it did 
have one bright spot in "Beverly Hills, 90210." Now in its fifth year,the drama 
was the most-watched program in its Wednesday time slot last week, beating 
comedies on ABC and CBS and "The Cosby Mysteries" on NBC. Among all programs, 
it ranked 29th nationally and 7th locally. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, after winning the previous week, fell back to third, a tick behind NBC, 
while ABC recorded its third victory in the four-week-old season. NBC is the 
big surprise, showing the most ratings growth among any of the networks and 
boasting the two highest-rated newcomers, "ER" and "Madman of the People."

 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: HORTON ISN'T DOWN ABOUT REBUILDING 
HIS PITCHING STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Horton knew he would have his work cut out rebuilding the Cal State 
Fullerton pitching staff for the upcoming baseball season. He just didn't 
expect the job to be this big. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, the Titan associate head coach who handles the pitchers for Coach 
Augie Garrido, faces an even more demanding challenge after the NCAA ruled last 
season's Big West pitcher of the year, Matt Wagner, ineligible last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was the only starter back from the team that shared the conference 
championship, won the NCAA regional tournament at Oklahoma State and reached 
the semifinal round of the College World Series before being eliminated by 
Georgia Tech. Now, Horton is really starting from scratch. But he's not 
dismayed going into the final week of fall workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think we have the makings of a solid pitching staff," he said. "I 
just don't know if it's going to be as effective as some of the ones in the 
past have been. I don't think we've been left without one returning starter 
since I've been here, though." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things Horton and Garrido are considering is moving top relief 
pitcher Ted Silva into a starting role when the season begins in late January. 
Silva, who pitched for the U.S. national team last summer, had 13 saves with a 
4-4 record and a 2.29 earned-run average last season. He is the team's most 
proven returning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different role, but there's no reason he can't do it," Horton said. 
"He was a starter as well as a relief pitcher in high school. Although the 
endurance factor is different, his arm is strong enough to be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Horton also is encouraged by the practice performance of junior right-hander 
Jon Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon has had an outstanding fall," Horton said. "He's showed signs of what we 
hoped he'd be doing all along. He's finally hit the level of consistency that 
we've been looking for the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward has been troubled by injuries in the past. "He's had a series of back, 
knee and arm troubles," Horton said. "This fall he's been relatively 
injury-free and that's probably been a big factor. His mechanics are more 
consistent, and his endurance has been better. He's really excited again. In 
the past, some of his frustrations wore on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward still is bothered by a slight tear in cartilage in one knee and might 
have arthroscopic surgery to be certain everything is all right. "If he has 
that, he would only be out about six weeks, and he will have time to recover 
before we resume practice Jan. 3," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said pitching this summer for Anchorage in the Alaskan Collegiate 
League helped Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did well there, and he's continued improving during the fall," Horton 
said. "We've been working with him lately on getting the ball to move more." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Silva and Ward take over two of the starting spots, the Titans still 
will be looking for more pitching help from transfers Tom Dillon, Mark Chavez, 
Steve Cardona and Tom Dixon. "If some of those transfers don't come along to 
play a significant role for us, we could be in trouble," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big West Conference expansion that will add Idaho, Boise State, North Texas 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo when Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State leave the 
conference in 1996 won't mean much change for baseball other than reduction in 
the number of conference teams by one. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four new schools, only Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has a baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Long range, however, Garrido said he favors a regional federation for 
baseball, rather than competition strictly along conference lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after all the dust settles, they can eventually address what is best 
for baseball," Garrido said. "The NCAA has been putting increased emphasis on 
keeping the student-athlete in school as much as possible, and to reducing 
travel for financial reasons, so a federation approach may be the best answer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The injury problems continue to pile up for Titan soccer Coach Al Mistri. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Jaime has a broken rib from a collision in Sunday's loss to New Mexico, 
and J.B. McCormack is sidelined because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also will be without Alfred Partida in Friday's game at UCLA because 
of a red card given him in the New Mexico game. The Titans also play at UC 
Irvine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be going into the most difficult part of the season in our weakest 
condition of the year," Mistri said.  
</P>
<P>
 The men's team is 8-5-1 after beating Nevada Las Vegas, 3-0, and losing to New 
Mexico, 4-2, last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's team, which is 4-5-1, also has had some injury problems. 
Goalkeeper Jennifer Bryant has a foot injury and her backup, Heidi Clauss, has 
a dislocated thumb, but both are expected to play in today's game at UC Santa 
Barbara. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two Titan baseball players, outfielder Mark Kotsay and catcher Brian Loyd, are 
scheduled to play in the "Field of Vision and Dreams" charity all-star baseball 
game Oct. 30 at Blair Field in Long Beach. The event, in which some top college 
players from the area will meet a team of pros, will benefit the Children of 
Promise Foundation. It conducts programs for fatherless boys. The event has 
been approved by the NCAA . . . The Titan women's basketball coaching staff 
will conduct a coaching clinic beginning at 9 a.m. Saturday in Titan Gym. Coach 
Deborah Ayres will conduct the clinic with help from former coach Maryalyce 
Jeremiah, now associate athletic director, and assistant J. Kelley Hall . . . 
"Midnight Madness" that opened basketball practice for the men's and women's 
teams Friday night at Fullerton attracted an estimated 1,000, most of them 
students.

AGOURA'S BARRUS SERVING IMPORTANT ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two years, Agoura High's Heather Barrus waited for her chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior backed up her older sister, Tammy, as the setter on the Charger 
girls' volleyball team, and also became a serving and defensive specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy is now a freshman at Cal State Bakersfield and Heather is the setter for 
the defending Marmonte League champions. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday night, Heather Barrus excelled at what she had practiced. Her 
serving, including five aces, led Agoura to a 15-7, 15-10, 15-12 victory over 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a first-place tie with Newbury Park and enables Agoura (9-2, 
8-1 in league play) to control its own destiny in the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
 The match started well for Newbury Park. The Panthers jumped to a 6-0 lead 
behind two kills and three blocks from middle blocker Kara McKeown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers called a timeout, got a sideout on the next play, then turned the 
ball over to Barrus. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Newbury Park managed a sideout, Agoura had taken a 7-6 lead -- and 
all of the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that went through my mind was that I had to take care of the 
ball," Barrus said. "I served well before, I had the confidence even though we 
were down." 
</P>
<P>
 After a sideout, senior Blair Thomas served four points and the game was 
essentially over. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (9-2, 7-2) never recovered from the change in momentum. McKeown 
finished with five kills and 10 blocks. Christine Arguijo, one of Newbury 
Park's top hitters, was shut out in the first game and finished with seven 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something out there made us fall apart and I still don't know what it was," 
Newbury Park setter Kari Norberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura took the lead in the second game behind the serving of Barrus and the 
play of Blair Thomas, who finished with a team-high 10 kills, and Maegan 
Thomas, who had eight kills and nine blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers rallied to within 11-10, but sophomore Tahleen Varian had three 
kills on the next four balls to give Agoura a 14-10 lead. After trading 
sideouts, Varian's ace clinched the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura had four aces in the final game, two each by Barrus and Maegan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park rallied from a 13-8 deficit to pull to within 13-12, but the 
serve came back to Barrus. Two balls and one ace later, Agoura had avenged its 
only league loss, a five-game defeat last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time we were the ones who kind of fell apart mentally and physically," 
Barrus said. "I was looking forward to this since they beat us."

DIGEST: SPRINGMAN NAMED COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Springman, a former assistant at Pepperdine University, has been hired as 
baseball coach at Oak Park High. Springman succeeds Mike Bolyog, who resigned 
in June after three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park also announced that Zoran Lomic will move from girls' to boys' soccer 
coach. Ted Eggleston, a former youth coach, will replace Lomic as girls' coach. 
Football 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of Peter Forlano of Notre Dame High is improving, but the player 
remains hospitalized after undergoing brain surgery last week, Forlano's mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano, a starting senior tackle, was admitted to St. Joseph Medical Center 
in Burbank on Oct. 7 after experiencing dizziness, numbness of the right arm 
and blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors determined that Forlano was struck by a severe bacterial sinus 
infection, Alice Forlano said. But he has regained movement of his arm and his 
condition continues to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High receiver Billy Miller said doctors prescribed a few days of rest 
for his sore left knee, but he expects to play in Friday's key Marmonte League 
game against Royal. Miller injured his knee last week against Newbury Park. 
Cross-Country 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team has dropped from second to 
fifth in The Harrier magazine's national poll. Hart has moved from 23rd to 
13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' girls' team is ranked 15th.

 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Brown rushed for 244 yards in 15 carries in the Toreadors' 
62-7 rout of El Camino Real. It was Brown's second consecutive 200-yard game. 
Said Brown, who combines power with great speed: "The holes were opening up." 
Taft Coach Troy Starr was more effusive. "He's the elite back. Since he came to 
this school two years ago, people have been stacked up against him and he just 
consistently gets his yards. He's without a doubt one of the top running backs 
in the country."

SIDELINES: ON SOLID GROUND, UCLA'S TORING IS LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of UCLA's top water polo players will miss the rest of the season because 
of an injury he sustained while . . . walking. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Toring, a sophomore from Simi Valley, broke his left leg Monday night when 
he tripped exiting a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those freak things," Bruin Coach Guy Baker said, "Everyone's 
walking out the door, Jimmy trips and several guys fell down. At first, 
everyone thought he was joking, but it was no joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Toring, a graduate of Harvard-Westlake High, led UCLA with 46 steals, was 
second with 40 goals and third with 21 assists as a freshman. This season, he 
has 11 goals for the fifth-ranked Bruins (11-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Toring played with the U.S. National team at the World 
Championships in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanted: Soccer player. Must be female. Experience preferred, but not required. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested? Call Robyn Wolfe, Oxnard College's first-year soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
 When the former Cal State Dominguez Hills All-American took over the women's 
program in August, half the team she inherited had junior college experience. 
That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad: There were only four players. 
</P>
<P>
 After some scrambling, Wolfe increased the roster to as many as 12 players. 
Then it fell to its current 10 -- one short of the minimum allowed to play. One 
of the 10 had never kicked a soccer ball until she joined the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Four games into the season, Oxnard had one tie and three losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, the Condors defeated Santa Monica, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big relief," Wolfe said. "After we scored every goal, I've got to say, 
it was an event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they know we can win -- even with 10 players." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: The Harvard-Westlake water polo team ducks no team. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Southern California Invitational last week, Harvard-Westlake (11-2) 
played three top-ranked teams and another which is likely to be No. 1 soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines defeated Riverside Poly, the top-ranked team in the Southern 
Section's Division V, and beat Clovis West, No. 1 in the Central Section.

MEXICAN BANKS FACE NEW THREAT IN INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION; FINANCE: ANALYSTS 
SAY THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO OPEN DOORS TO FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS COULD ALSO 
FUEL GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government's blessing for international banks to enter Mexico for the 
first time in nearly six decades may be good for economic growth -- but it 
means trouble for dozens of Mexican banks already caught between a flat economy 
and ferocious domestic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 foreign competitors who got charters to open their doors in Mexico are 
expected to make $3.25 billion in new loans available next year, providing 
consumers and businesses a much-needed respite from tight credit and high 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the central part of a financial reform that also led the government 
Monday to permit 16 foreign brokerages and a dozen international insurance 
companies to set up shop, competing with important affiliates of Mexican banks, 
which are part of European-style financial conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorizations for non-bank financial services -- such as G.E. Capital, 
Chrysler Financial Corp. and Ford Motor Credit -- which could cut into domestic 
banks' consumer lending business -- are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the government's action was expected, competition from the likes of 
Citibank, Bank of America, Fuji Bank and Dresdner Bank was a sobering thought 
for the nation's bankers as they start a three-day national convention today at 
the resort of Cancun. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, investors who paid the government high prices to acquire the banks 
privatized three years ago have watched as more than a dozen budding domestic 
financiers received authorizations to compete against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to recoup their initial investments in the face of growing 
competition, combined with inexperience, a laggard economy and the lack of 
sophisticated credit rating services have brought many of Mexico's banks to the 
brink of crisis, bankers and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad loans are a "heavy burden" for his members, Roberto Hernandez, outgoing 
president of the Mexican Banking Assn. recently told reporters here. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, bad loans account for up to 14% of bank portfolios and more than half 
of capital at even the best-run banks. At two -- Banco del Oriente and Banco 
Obrero, the labor federation-run bank -- the value of bad loans exceeds 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad-loan portfolio is not only putting pressure on the banks' liquidity, 
but affecting the institutions' solvency," according to the Mexico City 
consulting firm GEA. 
</P>
<P>
 Baring Securities analyst Laura Berdeja called sour loans "the key risk for 
all Mexican financial groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Problem loans have already led authorities to seize two troubled financial 
groups this year and a once-respected banker, Carlos Cabal Peniche, is a 
fugitive from justice in one extreme case. Further, the percentage of loans 
gone sour is rising, according to National Banking Commission statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portfolio quality has constituted an important drag on banks' earnings and it 
is a factor largely within the banks' control, unlike the economic 
environment," according to Berdeja. 
</P>
<P>
 Negligible economic growth has made repaying loans harder for companies that 
have borrowed. The government has tried to step in through a special program 
that lets small businesses repay lapsed loans over 12 to 16 years at interest 
rates as low as 14.75% -- incredibly easy terms in Mexico, where a long-term 
loan is three years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, GEA warns that such programs are only stop-gap measures. "Economic 
recovery and the reduction of interest rates are the fundamental factors in 
resolving the problem" of bad loans, according to GEA analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrialists still complain that tight credit and high interest rates 
undermine their ability to compete on world markets. Those high charges are in 
part the result of high interest rates demanded by investors, but also reflect 
wide margins, or spread between the interest rates banks pay depositors and 
what they charge borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican banks were accustomed to an average margin of 8.3% as recently as 
December and many clearly cannot survive as they are now structured on the 
current average margin of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 As international banks and other financial institutions enter the market, 
margins are expected to shrink further. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the midst of the banking purge we are starting to see, there will be those 
who cannot resist the force of globalization, open competition and the change 
in vision of the banking business," said Samuel Garcia, a financial columnist 
in the independent newspaper Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hardest hit will be the mid-size and smaller banks without a market 
niche or regional orientation, analysts said. Those are the same banks that 
have suffered the most from aggressive lending policies that created the 
portfolio crisis, according to a recent Baring Securities report on Latin 
American banking. 
</P>
<P>
 The result will be increased pressure for mergers, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because international banks initially will be confined to a total of 8% of the 
total market and 1% per foreign bank, their impact will be limited at first. 
Most are expected to concentrate on business lending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreign competition in the corporate and institutional businesses has been 
present in Mexico for many years," Berdeja pointed out. However, she added that 
international banks will probably increase the business they do in pesos, 
including more sophisticated types of loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also noted that Mexico is still "underbanked," with available credit 
remaining below that of other countries. Once the Mexican economy recovers, 
banking should grow at least three times as fast as other sectors, Baring 
Securities predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to BofA and Citibank, U.S. institutions granted banking charters 
included J.P. Morgan, Chemical Bank, Republic National Bank of New York, 
NationsBank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of Boston, First Chicago and American 
Express. Declining Profitability 
</P>
<P>
 The profitability of most Mexican banks has fallen sharply as a flat economy, 
stiff competition, poor government oversight and inadequate technology caused 
the proportion of bad loans to skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in profitability from December, 1993, to June, 1994, of Mexico's 
three largest banks, expressed in profit as a percentage of total capital: 
</P>
<P>
 Banamex: -6.8% 
</P>
<P>
 Bancomer: -28.6 
</P>
<P>
 Serfin: -9.1

STEAM HEAT; TEST OF WILLS BETWEEN 2 GEOTHERMAL FIRMS COULD GET EVEN HOTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the takeover battle between the nation's two largest geothermal companies 
continues to escalate, California Energy Co. will probably have to boost its 
offer for Magma Power Co. to more than $1 billion if its hostile bid is going 
to succeed, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the proposed union of two little-known but prosperous geothermal 
companies, the largest survivors of a government-sponsored effort that began in 
the late 1970s as an effort to foster the growth of "alternative energy" 
companies that harness wind, solar and steam power for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest has been a test of wills between an aggressive company from 
Nebraska with a California name and a staid utility in San Diego with strong 
ties to Dow Chemical. The fight has also put a spotlight on changes sweeping 
the entire electric power industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilities are going down the same path toward deregulation and free-market 
competition as trucking, airlines and other once-protected U.S. industries. 
Power companies large and small could soon be competing for customers, who 
ultimately will be able to shop around for the best electricity and gas rates. 
</P>
<P>
 And because current fossil fuel-generated power costs less than half what 
geothermal does to produce, and because government-mandated subsidies for 
alternative energy producers are slowly melting away, geothermal companies face 
a bleak future in the United States, despite the enormous technological 
advances made by Magma Power and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, the $840 million California Energy has offered for Magma shows 
there is life yet left in the geothermal industry in overseas markets such as 
the Philippines, where fossil fuels are scarce, and Indonesia, where they are 
exported to generate foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia alone is expected to build 3,000 megawatts of geothermal generating 
capacity over the next decade -- as much as currently exists in the United 
States, according to Kidder Peabody geothermal expert Bill Short. And both 
California Energy and Magma Power expect to play strong roles in developing 
that power. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every unit of opportunity for geothermal domestically, you have 10 units 
internationally," Short said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exploitation of overseas markets was a major factor in California Energy's 
proposal to buy Magma Power for $35 a share in cash and stock. By combining, 
the two companies could compete more efficiently, California Energy Chairman 
David Sokol said when the offer was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the battle has heated up steadily. Magma Power's board formally 
rejected the unsolicited offer and advised shareholders to turn a deaf ear to 
its suitor. Last week, California Energy stepped up the pace by initiating a 
proxy fight that would force a special shareholders meeting at which it could 
present its case directly to Magma investors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the two companies traded lawsuits in federal court in Nevada, where 
Magma is incorporated. California Energy accused Magma Power of violating its 
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders, while Magma Power accused 
California Energy of violating disclosure laws relating to its proposed 
acquisition and proxy solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power, which runs seven geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley that 
generate enough power to light a city of 250,000 people, is also taking its 
case directly to Wall Street and large investors, saying it is worth more than 
$840 million, mainly because of its international prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial analysts, including UBS Securities' Daniele Seitz, say 
California Energy will probably have to bump its offer to $40 a share if its 
tender offer is to succeed. "At this point, shareholders see this as an 
underwhelming bid, a bit shy," Seitz said. "They are waiting to see whether 
California Energy means business."  
</P>
<P>
 Sokol said in an interview that his company "won't go to $40. . . . But we've 
been willing since Sept. 19 to sit down and negotiate all terms of our 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Omaha in 1991, 
in part to be near its largest shareholder, general contractor Peter Kiewit & 
Sons, which owns a 43% stake. Because its six energy plants are in the Mammoth 
and Yuma areas, the company retained California in its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power is 21%-owned by Dow Chemical, whose engineers helped the company 
solve the riddle of harnessing superheated brines, which flow in subterranean 
currents a mile below the Imperial Valley at temperatures of 550 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Dow has lowered its stake in Magma from 41% two years ago, the two 
companies maintain strong links. Several of Magma Power's current and past 
executives, including Chief Executive Ralph Boeker, are former Dow Chemical 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Both California Energy and Magma Power are highly profitable, thanks in part 
to the federal and state subsidies for alternative energy companies in the 
1970s. The government's goal was to reduce a dependency on foreign oil and to 
foster environmentally clean power.  
</P>
<P>
 New laws mandated that utilities such as Southern California Edison sign 
contracts of up to 30 years to buy geothermal, wind and solar energy, paying 
the projected cost of fossil fuel power. Over the initial 10 years, utilities 
were to pay at a fixed rate based on the hypothetical cost of a barrel of oil, 
which was projected to rise as high as $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of rising, the price of fossil fuel declined to about $17 a barrel 
level, the current price. Now, as the 10-year fixed-price periods are ending, 
the contracts with geothermal producers are being repriced to reflect actual 
power costs. The result will be a dramatic drop in revenue for Magma and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Southern California Edison is now paying producers such as Magma 
about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour for its geothermal power. If the contracts 
were adjusted today to reflect the cost of natural gas, the price to Magma 
would drop to about 2.7 cents, according to Don Fellows, manager of non-utility 
power purchases for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power can now produce power at about 5.7 cents a kilowatt-hour, Boeker 
said. But that's still about twice the cost of power produced by natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the low price of natural gas, we haven't been able to do 
anything," said David N. Anderson, executive director of Geothermal Resources 
Council, a trade association of geothermal companies based in Davis, Calif. 
"We're not bringing in anyone new into the business. Jobs are not growing."  
</P>
<P>
 According to Anderson, the number of U.S. geothermal developers and producers 
has dropped to 10 from more than 25 in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the geothermal energy industry is not going to disappear, said Jan Hamrin, 
a principal in the environmental consulting firm Hansen McOuat Hamrin & Rhode 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a national interest in ensuring that geothermal survives, in 
structuring a new utility industry that brings down electric rates but which 
hedges against future risks of escalating oil prices," Hamrin said. Geothermal

THE CUTTING EDGE; NOBEL PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON GAME THEORY; ECONOMICS: THE AREA OF 
STUDY IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A BIG ROLE IN THE FCC'S UPCOMING RADIO WAVE AUCTION. 
</P>

 First MCI and Nextel said they were hitching up while Sprint was reportedly 
talking to Nynex and Bell Atlantic. Now word is out that Sprint wants to join 
with Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant, while Nynex and Bell Atlantic 
would hitch up with MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 What are they doing, playing games? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and it isn't musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The peculiar mating dance is a preparation for the Federal Communications 
Commission's December auction of billions of dollars worth of radio wave 
licenses for new communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the highest profile demonstration yet of an increasingly visible 
branch of economics called game theory. Game theorists from leading 
universities helped design the rules of the auction, and nearly all the 
prospective bidders have hired game theorists to help them play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, three scholars shared a Nobel Prize for their contribution to 
the theory, which expands upon classical economics by examining how economic 
players influence one another's decisions. Game theorists are now using their 
complex mathematical equations to help guide decision-making in fields ranging 
from Treasury bill auctions to negotiation strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been exploding in the last couple of years," says Barry Nalebuff, 
professor at the Yale School of Management. "It's an incredibly powerful tool." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so much of modern science, game theory was born of the often-sinister 
calculations of the Cold War. John von Neumann, the mathematics genius and 
computer pioneer who helped invent game theory while working at Rand Corp. in 
the early 1950s, advised both Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. 
Eisenhower to drop the atomic bomb on Russia before the enemy made the first 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harsanyi, a UC Berkeley mathematician who was one of the Nobel Prize 
winners, did his most crucial work in the 1960s, helping advise the federal 
government on disarmament talks. Harsanyi developed models to deal with game 
theory's biggest weakness -- the assumption that all players have access to the 
same information -- and that has made it possible to apply the theory to 
broader situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Russia knows a lot about its own army, it doesn't know much about the 
other side," Harsanyi says. "It's the same in business." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until business schools began teaching game theory in the 
mid-1980s that it began to be applied to the machinations of corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Game theory tries to explain behavior that classical economists consider 
irrational, such as predatory pricing. A classical economist would argue, for 
example, that it doesn't make sense for a national retailer to drive a local 
competitor out of business if he could make more money by keeping his prices up 
and sharing the market with the new entrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it happens, and game theory explains why with a concept called 
"signaling."  
</P>
<P>
 "By taking a Rambo strategy of fighting to the bitter end, they get a 
reputation for being tough," says Paul Milgrom, economics professor at Stanford 
University. That deters competitors from challenging the chain in other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concepts have been widely adopted by the Department of Justice and were 
included in the department's new merger guidelines released in 1992, says 
Preston McAfee, professor of economics at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 For companies, game theory has proven especially useful in takeover 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving to acquire Medco, the mail order distributor of low-priced 
generic drugs, drug maker Merck hired a game theorist to study the impact of 
health reform on its drug prices both with and without Medco. Yale's Nalebuff 
advised General Reinsurance of Stamford, Conn., on a bid for Cologne 
Re-insurance of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 General Reinsurance was worried that it was being used to extract a higher 
price from a rival bidder, General Electric. Nalebuff advised his client to use 
its clout as a competitive bidder to change the rules. The company refused to 
participate in the bidding unless there was only a single round of bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he suggested unconditional bids that forced a quick response and gave 
General Electric little time to come up with counter offers. The rules gave an 
equal chance to the smaller bidder, and General Reinsurance won the contest in 
a quick, one-week decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Game theorists can come up with solutions not suggested by conventional 
analysis. A satellite manufacturer recently asked a game theorist for advice on 
dealing with price wars in the business. Customers were inviting 
representatives from the two competing U.S. satellite makers to sit in a room 
and bid against each other for each new order. Selling prices invariably fell 
close to cost. The consultant's advice? Charge the customer for participating 
in the auction. If the satellite companies didn't participate and no auction 
took place, he noted, the customer would lose by having to pay a far higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Where game theory is weakest is in dealing with complex issues. Increasingly, 
that is the case in politics, where "rational choice" proponents from economic 
and math fields are joining political science departments to try to analyze 
complex political systems. Critics say the analysis must be so simplified to 
use game theory that it offers little insight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works best in a system where you have reasonably predictable outcomes," 
says Boris Rosovsky, a USC mathematician who previously taught at the 
University of Moscow. "The pursuit of a jet fighter by another jet can be 
formulated in game theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Another such area is in auctions that have well-defined rules and a limited 
number of players -- such as the FCC radio wave auctions. Last fall, when the 
FCC announced auction rules, it made frequent reference to the work of game 
theorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies, who have an enormous stake in the outcome, didn't know 
what to make of the theories. So they rushed out to hire the academics as 
consultants.  
</P>
<P>
 The FCC then turned to UC San Diego economist John McMillan to sort through 
the responses and come up with the best auction formula. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan suggested an approach proposed by Milgrom in which hundreds of 
licenses would be auctioned simultaneously. With each player able to see the 
other bids, there was less danger of underbidding by companies afraid of paying 
too much. By not publicizing the names behind the bids, the FCC made collusion 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction format, however, made it possible for bidders to see at once what 
combination of properties they are likely to win. This encourages the formation 
of alliances. Game theory consultants are now busily advising telephone 
companies on partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic's interests, for example, are to join with the player who has 
the most to gain from the licenses and therefore is likely to bid the highest 
price -- thus turning a competitor into an ally. MCI is the best bet, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the game theorists' predictions for alliances? They believe in 
brinkmanship, so count on deals being made and broken right up to Oct. 28, when 
companies must declare their partners. Then look for a new round of negotiation 
as the spoils are divided.

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN TRIAL OF S&L CHIEF; BANKING: FORMER COLUMBIA SAVINGS 
CEO THOMAS SPIEGEL, CHARGED WITH 45 COUNTS, IS A MAJOR GOVERNMENT TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an echo of the 1980s, jury selection began Tuesday in the criminal trial of 
Thomas Spiegel, the once high-flying thrift executive who federal prosecutors 
say systematically looted millions of dollars from Columbia Savings & Loan of 
Beverly Hills before it was seized by regulators in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel, a major player in the cast of the long-running S&L debacle, is the 
biggest government target to come to trial since Charles H. Keating of Lincoln 
Savings & Loan. But Spiegel's prosecutors face a different problem, local 
lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in the Keating case, where the government could portray the defendant 
as a villain and small investors as his victims, the alleged victims in the 
Spiegel case are the taxpayers, noted Paul Turley of the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office, who helped lead the successful Keating prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the prosecution "doesn't have a little old lady to put up on the 
stand and testify that she has lost her life savings," Turley said. "Instead, 
Spiegel's (alleged) fraud hurt the nameless, faceless U.S. taxpayer. That 
doesn't really stir up the jury's emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel, now 48, faces 45 felony counts ranging from bribery and fraud to 
misuse of Columbia's funds. If convicted on all counts, he could spend the rest 
of his life in prison and face fines in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel, dressed in a navy blue shirt and royal blue tie, looked confident and 
relaxed as U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi summarized the federal 
charges against him for a group of about 50 potential jurors in a Downtown Los 
Angeles courtroom. When asked beforehand whether he'd beat the charges, Spiegel 
smiled and replied, "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 A memo filed by Spiegel's defense team paints him as a brilliant banker who 
built Columbia into an S&L powerhouse only to have it crushed after the federal 
government ordered all of the nation's thrifts to dump their junk-bond holdings 
in 1989. Item by item, his attorneys seek to legitimize such actions by Spiegel 
as the use of Columbia funds to buy a condominium and to build a gun 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 But a pretrial memo from lead prosecutor John F. Walsh indicates that the 
government will attempt to paint Spiegel as a greed-driven banker who used 
Columbia as a tool to line his own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although defendant Spiegel was by a considerable margin the highest paid 
savings & loan executive in the United States, receiving salaries and bonuses 
of between $5 (million) and $10 million each year, those millions were simply 
not enough in his mind . . ," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel became Columbia Savings' president and chief executive in 1977. After 
the deregulation of the S&L industry in the early 1980s, the thrift began 
investing heavily in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds -- nearly all of which 
were purchased through Drexel Burnham Lambert and its infamous "junk bond 
king," Michael Milken -- and its profits began to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's earnings peaked at $194 million in 1986, and Forbes magazine named 
it the best-run large S&L in the nation. Spiegel earned $9.03 million that 
year, making him the highest-paid executive in the history of the thrift 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spiegel's huge pay drew the ire of federal regulators, who called it 
"unreasonable." He was allowed to keep the money but agreed to have his future 
compensation reviewed by experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel never paid himself that much again. The stock market crash in October, 
1987, sent the value of Columbia's junk-bond portfolio tumbling, and its 
earnings fell in lock-step. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift's finances continued to deteriorate, and it lost a staggering $591 
million in 1989. Spiegel, under pressure from regulators, resigned effective 
Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia was seized a year later at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of Spiegel's resignation, thrift regulators had launched a secret 
investigation after they became suspicious of Columbia's spending on vacations, 
plane trips, guns and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Although attorneys for both sides declined to discuss their strategies in 
advance of Friday's scheduled opening arguments, the government's memo 
indicates that many of the 45 felony counts that Spiegel faces are tied to that 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, for example, the prosecution alleges that Spiegel secretly 
accepted for himself -- instead of for Columbia -- a so-called "equity-kicker" 
from Drexel Burnham with a potential for him to earn $7 million on his $132,000 
investment in exchange for helping to persuade Columbia to invest nearly $100 
million in one of Drexel's deals. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, the prosecution alleges that Spiegel caused Columbia to loan and 
invest nearly $30 million in a luxury auto dealership owned by one of his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also says he used Columbia funds to purchase a $1-million Palm 
Springs condominium for his exclusive use and had the thrift pay tens of 
thousands of dollars for more than 40 firearms, including assault weapons and 
at least one Uzi submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said he has about 30 witnesses and more than 300 letters, checks and 
other pieces of evidence to prove that Spiegel illegally "used Columbia 
Savings' funds as if they were his own" over a four-year period beginning in 
1986 -- about the same time that Spiegel began taking heat from regulators over 
his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But lead defense attorneys Brad D. Brian and Richard Marmaro maintain that 
Columbia was forced by the government to mark down and sell its entire 
portfolio of high-yield junk bonds in a market still shaking from the '87 
crash, causing it to become insolvent just one year later. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense notes that Spiegel and his family, who owned more than half of the 
thrift, suffered major losses from Columbia's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also says that Spiegel eventually turned all of his profits from 
the Drexel-related investment over to Columbia after learning that it should 
have been approved in advance by its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palm Springs condominium was purchased as "part of Columbia's very 
successful investment in . . . numerous properties" in the area, the defense 
claims, and the firearms purchases were legitimate and are being raised "solely 
to inflame passions and prejudices over the hot-button issue of guns."

JAMES FLANIGAN: NOW MAY BE THE TIME TO BET ON A STRONGER DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Change amid paradox. Now may be the time to bet on the U.S. dollar gaining 
strength, even though global currency markets are still beating the greenback 
down in defiance of a strengthening American economy and increasingly 
competitive U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment in those markets may be about to turn as U.S. trade figures improve 
and the realization dawns that the economy can continue to grow for some time 
without sparking grievous inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean further rises in the stock market, declining interest rates 
for a while and, thus, better news in the bond markets. It also should mean a 
dollar exchange rate that rises above 100 yen and 1.50 German marks, the low 
points to which the U.S. currency has fallen this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the view of some smart people who look a little ahead to global 
economic conditions in early 1995. "The cycle is turning now as other economies 
recover the ability to buy more U.S. exports," says currency expert Edward M. 
Bernstein of Washington's Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a watershed period in the international economy," says economist 
Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, the New York investment firm. "As 
uncertainties about trade and policy are resolved, economic fundamentals will 
reduce the U.S. trade deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 A dollar recovery could begin today, when the Commerce Department is expected 
to announce a slight improvement in U.S. trade figures -- a gap of less than 
$10 billion in imports over exports in August, following an $11-billion trade 
deficit in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, traders could sell the dollar and send its value even lower, 
because currency markets are not entirely logical. Witness Monday, when traders 
dumped dollars to buy German marks after the narrow reelection of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's ruling party. Their emotion was relief that Kohl did not lose to 
the Social Democrats and thus could continue reform of Germany's sclerotic 
economy, racked by 10% unemployment and grossly non-competitive industrial 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But such assumptions were false, say economists in Frankfurt. "Reform will 
proceed very slowly now; Kohl may be forced into coalition. That's why German 
stock and bond markets did not rise after the election," says economist Rainer 
Veit of Deutsche Bank Research. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the weak dollar and strong mark, that had nothing to do with Germany but 
"was due to homemade psychological factors in the United States," says Veit. 
</P>
<P>
 What are those psychological factors? "Widespread lack of confidence in the 
Clinton Administration's handling of the economy," says Alan Shapiro, chairman 
of the finance department at USC's School of Business Administration. That lack 
of confidence led foreign investors to reduce their purchases of U.S. stocks, 
bonds and Treasury securities this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And that produced a vicious circle: U.S. interest rates had to rise to attract 
investment to fund the trade deficit, which will grow to more than $100 billion 
this year (from $32 billion in 1992) because the U.S. economy was growing while 
others were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. consumer is still the strongest economic factor the world has," says 
one currency trader, noting strong demand for U.S. cars. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that active consumer sparked fears of inflation, which spurred yet 
higher interest rates, in turn hurting bond markets, business recoveries and 
hiring plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But now cooler analysis is coming to bear. Investment experts note that 
automobile plants are operating at a high rate of capacity but without 
bottlenecks. Widespread computerization is enabling industry to produce more 
with less input; productivity is rising, but not prices and wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that U.S. industry is awesomely competitive just as economies in 
Europe and Japan are starting to grow again and developing nations in Asia and 
Latin America -- which now take $250 billion, or 38%, of U.S. exports -- are 
accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
 So the dollar will recover against the mark and yen and other currencies. And 
that will encourage more foreign investment in U.S. stocks and bonds and allow 
Americans to travel abroad again. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a new turn of the cycle won't solve the underlying problem, which is 
that volatile currency fluctuations add costs to doing business worldwide. 
Clearly, a new agreement limiting those fluctuations is needed, says Edward 
Bernstein, 89, one of the architects of the 1944 Bretton Woods monetary 
conference that set up the postwar system. 
</P>
<P>
 And beyond currency agreements, a new understanding is needed to replace 
outdated notions that evaluate world commerce through trade deficits and 
surpluses. "Trade today is not a nation-state business," says Alvin Toffler, 
author with Heidi Toffler of "The Third Wave" and "War & Anti-War in the 21st 
Century." Rather it's a multinational exchange of ideas and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Toffler cites the example of a Malaysian entrepreneurial company, Technology 
Resources of Kuala Lumpur, that has created a satellite network through a 
partnership with a Ft. Wayne, Ind., company partly owned by Dan Quayle. That 
partnership then secured satellite launches from Russian space facilities and 
ground stations in the Tonga Islands of the South Pacific. "Malaysia, U.S., 
Russia, Tonga," says Toffler, outlining the dawning new world of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the old world of flawed understanding and fluctuating 
currencies, the dollar is a good bet to recover.

 General Electric Co. reported a 13% rise in profit in the third quarter 
following double-digit gains in many core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The industrial-financial services conglomerate earned $1.37 billion, or 80 
cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $1.21 billion, or 
71 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The results included a previously announced $85 million third-quarter loss at 
Kidder Peabody & Co., GE's troubled brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, GE's third-quarter revenue rose 9% to $16.15 billion from $14.86 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said revenue rose at seven of its 12 businesses 
and it reported double-digit gains in operating profit -- notably plastics, 
motors, appliances and information systems. The aircraft engine unit saw its 
profit fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At GE Capital Services, the company's financial services arm, earnings for the 
quarter rose 7% to $526 million.

 First Interstate Sees California Recovery in '97: Adding its voice to the 
chorus of good news about California's recovery, First Interstate Bancorp 
predicted in its annual forecast that the state will recover by early 1997 the 
700,000 or so jobs lost in the last four years of recession. California is 
already climbing out of the recession, with non-farm jobs expected to grow 0.8% 
on average in 1994, 1.4% in 1995 and 2.14% in 1996, the bank holding company 
reported.Even Southern California, beset with defense industry layoffs, has 
turned the corner, with annual non-farm job growth of 0.4% expected in 1994, 
1.4% in 1995 and 1.9% in 1996. Statewide, the unemployment rate should fall to 
about 8% by the end of the year from nearly 9% now. In addition, the company 
said housing construction, home prices, retail sales and personal income will 
all increase next year. ECONOMY

 Citing lower costs related to defaulted real estate loans, Wells Fargo & Co. 
on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of $217 million, up 32% from the 
same period last year.Earnings translated to $3.86 per share, compared to $165 
million, or $2.74 per share, for the same quarter in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The per-share earnings increased 41% because of the company's continuing stock 
repurchase program, Wells Fargo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the gain in net income came from cutting the loan loss provision from 
$120 million in the third quarter of 1993 to $50 million in the most recent 
quarter, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Net charge-offs in the third quarter came to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Net interest income was the same for both quarters, $656 million.

WORKERS' COMP TRIALS OPENED TO MORE PARTIES; LABOR: STATE SUPREME COURT PAVES 
WAY FOR DOCTORS, THERAPISTS TO PARTICIPATE IN CASES. MOVE MEANS COSTS COULD GO 
UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Doctors who treat injured workers have won an important legal victory -- while 
employers and insurers were dealt a potentially costly setback -- by the 
California Supreme Court's refusal to reconsider an appellate court ruling 
benefiting a controversial Beverly Hills medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision left standing by the high court deals with technical but possibly 
far-reaching issues in workers' compensation trials. In effect, the case 
strengthens the legal hand of doctors, therapists and other "lien claimants" 
seeking payment for services provided to injured workers by enabling them to 
participate fully in patients' cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, issued without comment by the Supreme Court last week, stems 
from a case brought by Beverly Hills Multispecialty Group. Bills totaling 
$158,000 submitted by the medical practice were branded fraudulent and 
disallowed by a Long Beach workers' compensation judge in a sweeping decision 
in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also accused the patients treated by Beverly Hills Multispecialty -- 
10 workers laid off by El Segundo-based International Rectifier Corp. -- and 
their lawyers of conspiring with the doctors to commit insurance fraud by 
submitting bogus claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Multispecialty challenged the judge's decision, arguing that it 
was unfairly prevented from doing such things as cross-examining witnesses, 
raising objections or otherwise fully participating in the workers' trials. The 
suit challenged a common workers' compensation court practice of treating 
doctors and other lien claimants as secondary participants who were not 
entitled to the same rights as the injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Multispecialty argued that this practice denied the medical 
group the opportunity to demonstrate that it treated the patients and submitted 
its bills in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the California Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the medical 
practice, but the defendants -- including Argonaut Insurance Co. and the state 
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board -- appealed to the California Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Lispi, the lawyer for Beverly Hills Multispecialty, said his client's 
court victory "peeled back the veneer on this putrid workers' comp system that 
purported to provide due process." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," Lispi said, "they will conduct themselves more like a court, and 
jurisprudence will refresh the California workers' compensation system, and 
we'll be able to distinguish the claims and claimants who are fraudulent versus 
those that just look that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance lawyers, however, said the decision will encourage further 
litigation, worsening the backlog in the workers' compensation courts and 
leading to higher settlement payouts by insurers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
 What the courts did "was add another party to the (trial) proceedings, which 
can only increase the frequency of litigation and extend cases," said Barry F. 
Evans, a lawyer for Argonaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Multispecialty and its principals, including medical director 
James Showghy, are among a group of defendants named in a lawsuit filed in 1992 
by Ticketmaster Inc. The suit claims that the defendants submitted phony stress 
claims, overcharged for services and provided unnecessary treatment.

U.S., JAPAN HONOR AT&T WITH 2 AWARDS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE COMPANY WINS THE 
FEDERAL BALDRIGE AWARD. IT IS SECOND U.S. FIRM TO GET JAPAN'S DEMING PRIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In honors that company officials say underscore their leadership in the 
burgeoning telecommunications field, AT&T won two of the world's most 
prestigious business awards Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the long-distance carrier's Consumer Communications Services 
unit in Basking Ridge, N.J., won the federal government's Malcolm Baldrige 
Award for excellence in quality management among service companies. Also 
honored in the service category was GTE Directories Corp. of Dallas, a 
telephone book manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's honor was AT&T's third Baldrige award in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a decision that was scheduled to be announced today in Tokyo, 
AT&T Power Systems -- which produces devices to power computer and 
telecommunications equipment -- became only the second U.S. firm to win Japan's 
prestigious Deming Prize for Quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Receiving these awards is like winning the World Series and the World Cup on 
the same day," said Robert E. Allen, AT&T chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 "The information industry is a leading global industry and we are very proud 
for being recognized as the world-class leader," said Joseph P. Nacchio, 
president of AT&T's consumer services unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting so good that people now expect to pick up the phone and make a 
long-distance call and have it go through" every time, Nacchio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nacchio and Curt Crawford, president of AT&T power systems, said they 
plan to trumpet their awards in future marketing efforts, but both emphasized 
that the benefit of the award was the incentive it provided AT&T employees to 
excel and improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wall Street is usually unmoved by such events, the awards could help 
secure long-distance market share, said Betty Massick, an analyst at S.G. 
Warburg & Co. in New York.

 "Anytime you can put a 'Good Housekeeping' seal of approval on any consumer 
product, you get higher (sampling) rates and greater visibility," said Richard 
Nespola, a Leawood, Kan., telephone consultant.

 Though the Baldrige and Deming awards aren't well-known outside the business 
community, they are highly coveted, even though it can cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to apply for the honors.  
</P>
<P>
 Established by Congress in 1987, the Baldrige Award, named after the late 
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige, is loosely modeled after the older 
Deming Prize. That award was established in 1951 by the Union of Japanese 
Scientists to honor W. Edwards Deming, an American whose quality methods 
reportedly helped Japanese companies achieve commercial success after World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of Japanese companies, including Toyota, NEC and Matsushita, have 
previously won the Deming Prize. But Florida Power & Light, which won in 1989, 
was the only other U.S. company besides AT&T to win.

MATSUSHITA-MCA TALKS END WITHOUT RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg met Tuesday 
afternoon in San Francisco with senior executives from Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., but failed to reach accord on the degree of control sought by 
the entertainment subsidiary.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issues were discussed but nothing was resolved," Sheinberg said Tuesday 
night from his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the executives' effort to meet privately, Japanese news reporters were 
spotted outside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Masaharu Matsushita reportedly spoke with Wasserman in San 
Francisco but did not sit in on the meeting, which was chaired by Matsushita 
President Yoichi Morishita. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of buying back 51% of the company was apparently not broached by 
the MCA executives, despite heated media speculation. The issue of control was 
the focus, rather than any specific discussion of ownership, according to a 
source familiar with the talks.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Matsushita proposed the meeting several weeks ago, apparently to 
deal with worsening relations with the MCA unit. In September, Matsushita 
rebuffed MCA executives who were excited about a proposal to join ITT Corp. and 
Dow Jones in a bid for CBS.

 FCC Ordered to Reconsider Integrated Operation: The Federal Communications 
Commission must review the permission it gave regional Bell companies to offer 
electronic voice mail, other information services and telephone service under 
one roof, a federal appeals court ruled. The FCC has not yet shown why the 
public benefits of combined operations, which it has allowed for nearly a 
decade, outweigh the costs, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The 
court had reached the same conclusion in 1990 in response to an earlier FCC 
decision. The ruling should have no immediate effect on the so-called Baby 
Bells or their customers, because the companies are likely to seek another 
emergency FCC order allowing combined operations to continue, said a regional 
Bell source who asked not to be identified.

 CBS TV Movie Exec Quits: Trevor Walton, vice president for motion pictures for 
TV and miniseries at CBS Entertainment, resigned after repeated clashes with 
his boss, CBS Entertainment Executive Vice President Larry Sanitsky.Walton, who 
oversaw made-for-TV movies at CBS, had been on the firing line in recent weeks 
as several of the network's TV movies have performed poorly in the ratings. 
However, executives attributed Walton's resignation more to a difference in 
style with Sanitsky. The executive vice president has come under criticism for 
his dealing with some producers.

<P>
 Lingering concerns about the dollar and comments by a Federal Reserve Board 
official that economic growth remains surprisingly strong sent Treasury bond 
yields higher Tuesday, putting new pressure on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 In a late selloff, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 7.86% from 
7.82% Monday, and shorter-term yields also inched up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials eased 6.39 points to 3,917.54 in moderate 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said markets were still on edge about the dollar's latest slide. The 
buck rebounded slightly against key currencies Tuesday but was well short of 
making up Monday's losses, which followed a slim election victory by German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's driving the market is the dollar," said Frank Sanella, 
senior money market analyst at Technical Data in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the dollar finished at 1.503 German marks, up from 
Monday's two-year low of 1.499 marks. Against the Japanese yen the U.S. 
currency rose to 97.75 Tuesday from 97.65 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the bond market's late nervousness was attributed to comments made 
by Federal Reserve Board Governor Susan Phillips in an address at a savings 
bank conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the U.S. economy is growing at a rate that continues to surprise 
many analysts. Some bond traders viewed that as code for Fed concerns that 
credit still hasn't been tightened enough to slow the economy to an acceptable, 
low-inflation pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, trading activity was light in the bond market, so the effect of 
Phillips' comments was exaggerated, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks mostly drifted for a second day. Third-quarter earnings 
reports released during the day lifted some individual stocks, but the broad 
market couldn't get its motor running, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered winners by about 3 to 2 on the Big Board, on 
moderate turnover of 260 million shares. Among broad indexes, the S&P 500 lost 
1.30 points to 467.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Earnings set a good tone early in the day with better-than-expected results 
from banks," noted Philip Orlando, senior vice president at First Capital 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among leading banks reporting quarterly earnings, Chase Manhattan rose 3/4 to 
35 3/4, Citicorp jumped 1 1/4 to 44 1/8 and Wells Fargo eased 1/8 to 149 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, Apple Computer surged 1 1/2 to 41 1/4 and Sun 
Microsystems rocketed 1 7/8 to 32 1/4. Both companies reported 
stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech stocks advancing included IBM, up 1 1/4 to 74 1/2, and Microsoft, 
up 1 1/2 to 56 5/8. But Lotus slumped 1 3/8 to 34 11/16 after saying quarterly 
earnings estimates from some analysts are too high. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indonesia Satellite Corp., the largest Asian initial public offering ever to 
be listed overseas, rose 16% on the NYSE on its first day of trading. The 
state-owned telecommunications company, known as Indosat, shot up to close at 
37 1/8 from its offering price of 32 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Overeas, London's FTSE 100 index fell 34.9 points to 3,085.3, while 
Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed at 2,084.76, down 6.12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tokyo's Nikkei average gained 34.11 points to end at 19,992.40. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed off 30.96 points at 2,725.01. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, cotton prices rallied to four-week highs Tuesday as 
steady rains flooding southeast Texas and parts of the cotton-rich Delta region 
threatened crops not yet harvested. 
</P>
<P>
 December cotton futures jumped 1.28 cents to 69.92 cents a pound, its highest 
close since September 20 at the New York Cotton Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The cotton market has been in retreat from a May 3 high of 86 cents a pound 
since it became apparent that U.S. farmers would produce a bountiful crop this 
year. Counterbalancing that were poor crops in major producing countries such 
as China, India and Pakistan and steady demand for cotton apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 The rains that have drenched Louisiana for the past 10 day could hurt farmers 
who had not yet harvested, experts said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: AMEX DELISTINGS SEND SIGNAL: TIME TO RAISE STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Stock Exchange suddenly is talking tough about quality -- as in 
the quality of the mostly small, often speculative companies whose stocks it 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise announcement last week, the New York-based Amex said it had 
begun delisting procedures against Conversion Industries of Pasadena and one of 
its affiliates, Beta Well Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Delistings by stock exchanges are rare enough, but the Amex's decision is all 
the more remarkable because it is punitive in nature. Citing unspecified 
"disclosure" problems with Conversion and Beta, the Amex is essentially telling 
the companies it no longer wants their business. The exchange hasn't delisted a 
company for cause since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Conversion and Beta do wrong? The Amex won't say exactly, pending a 
hearing Monday at which Conversion and Beta will plead their cases. But the 
Amex's new chairman, Richard F. Syron, makes it clear that the alleged failure 
of the companies to follow Amex rules involves serious infractions. Delisting 
is "not something done casually," Syron said. "I did not come in and say, 'Go 
find me two (companies) to hang.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The latter statement is a reference to Syron's ascension to Amex's top post on 
April 1, and subsequent Wall Street speculation that he wants to clean up the 
Amex's image as a home for a lot of lousy little firms of questionable 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Amex -- whose roots as a formal stock exchange extend back to 
1911 -- has plenty of legitimate stock listings, including entertainment giant 
Viacom, toy maker Hasbro and the New York Times Co. And the exchange has 
successfully carved an important niche for itself since 1975 as a leading stock 
options trader. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Amex, with 873 listed companies currently, has long struggled to 
compete with the vastly larger New York Stock Exchange (which has more than 
2,300 companies) and the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market (with 4,600 companies). 
To stay in business, some Wall Streeters contend, the Amex has been virtually 
forced to accept a lot of chaff -- marginal firms that couldn't go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always get my best ideas on the Amex," says one "short seller" -- a 
professional trader who profits by betting on specific stocks to decline.  
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old Syron, who left the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston to take the Amex post, argues that the exchange's image is "a bum rap." 
Nonetheless, he said, "we've got to change that image from the inside out." 
</P>
<P>
 The inference is that the Amex needs to do a better job of policing itself, 
and perhaps must set higher internal standards for investor protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle for business among the three principal stock markets, Syron 
notes, there are only two important competitive issues. One is service to the 
listed companies, meaning the trading liquidity offered and the quality and 
efficiency of the pricing mechanism for the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On that count, with the electronic Nasdaq market named Tuesday as the target 
of a federal probe into alleged broker price fixing, the Amex (and NYSE) 
"auction" systems -- where a human "specialist" serves as a traffic cop for all 
trades -- may get an automatic image boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The other key issue, Syron says, is fairness to the investor -- the ability of 
the market operator to guard against the listing of companies that are less 
than honest, or outright frauds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fairness has to do with what kind of risks you take with what kind of 
companies," Syron said. Beyond some basic standards, he's not interested in 
regulating the "business risk" of Amex stocks, he said. In other words, if a 
company is small and speculative, the business risk should be apparent. "That 
kind of risk is core to capitalism," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But regulatory risk is another matter, Syron said. If a stock is listed on the 
Amex, its investors should be able to assume that the exchange holds the 
company to high standards of disclosure about the business and its progress, or 
lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have companies with business risk, but then we have to be extremely 
vigilant" about reducing regulatory risk, Syron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, how tough can Syron afford to be in trying to change the 
Amex's culture? As an ex-Fed official, he is expected to be more of a cop and 
less of a promoter than the previous chairman, former Congressman James Jones. 
But the Amex's image problems predate Jones, extending back to the term of 
Arthur Levitt Jr. from 1978 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt, now chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is a champion 
of investor protection today. Yet some Wall Streeters say Levitt could not 
raise the perceived quality of the Amex as a place to list a stock in the '80s. 
Hence, Jones' entry in 1989 found the Amex starving for business, prompting 
Jones to focus heavily on attracting new listings -- some of dubious quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Syron, by sanctioning two delistings this early in his term, seems to be 
signaling that he's willing to give up quantity for quality. Speculators may 
not appreciate that, but true investors probably will.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: 
COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; BASIC RULE FOR PCS: BE PREPARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Personal computers are generally reliable, but the truth is, they aren't 
nearly as reliable as they need to be if you're using them for anything truly 
important. So, as any good Boy Scout will tell you, the only solution is to be 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic rules for PC disaster prevention are pretty simple, and you've 
probably heard many of them before. But -- tell the truth -- you're probably 
not doing what you ought to be doing. So here's a little refresher course. 
Think of it as taking medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The first rule is the most obvious, but still the most important: Always have 
your critical data files backed up.  
</P>
<P>
 If your business is in your computer in the form of bookkeeping files and 
customers' lists and an inventory database, you need a rigorous tape backup 
system. One reliable method is to make full copies of your hard disk in daily 
rotation on several tapes, at least one of which you take off premises 
afterward. Think how you'd feel if a fire melted your computer equipment along 
with your business. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, there are programs you can run on your computer that may help stave off 
problems, or at least give you an earlier warning if something is wrong. One is 
Norton Utilities, the first of the utility programs that became famous by 
letting people retrieve files they had accidentally erased. An alternative is 
PC Tools. Over the years, some of the more popular utility functions have been 
included in MS-DOS, but there is still room for the extra features these 
utilities provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer viruses aren't a big danger if you aren't swapping disks full of 
programs with your friends or downloading files from careless bulletin board 
service operators. But sometimes even shrink-wrapped software from the store 
can come infected, so it's a good idea to have an anti-virus program running on 
your computer as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I have mixed feelings about anti-virus programs. I sometimes have to 
temporarily disable them if I'm loading a new program, particularly a Windows 
program. Upgrading an existing program usually causes my anti-virus program to 
go nuts. On balance, though, I think the protection is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The last important task is to keep a log of hardware and software changes you 
make to your computer, including printouts of the major DOS configuration files 
config.sys and autoexec.bat. You'll also want to note the contents and 
circumstances of any error messages or apparent system failures you incur. The 
context in which a problem occurs may be the best clue to what really went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these are basic steps that will help you be prepared when an emergency 
strikes. If, for instance, your hard disk crashes, the inconvenience will be 
minor if you have to have a replacement installed then restore your files from 
the tape backup made the night before. Hard disk crashes are pretty obvious and 
easy to diagnose. So are monitor failures. 
</P>
<P>
 But some problems seem inexplicable and defy repair attempts. We once had a 
computer that died at approximately six-month intervals. The manufacturer stood 
behind the warranty, eventually replacing every component inside the case at 
one time or another, including three motherboards. When the last motherboard 
also failed, we insisted on a new machine, provided somewhat reluctantly. That 
was more than two years ago and there hasn't been a problem since. Was the 
problem the computer case itself? Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers are exceedingly complex and they are getting more so. When you add 
in the increasing complexity of today's software, you have myriad ways in which 
software conflicts can mimic hardware problems and vice versa. Sometimes these 
difficulties will defy even the diagnostic programs you or your repair shop 
might have. The only solution is persistence, patience -- and a good set of 
backup tapes and disks.

Q&A; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; A SCOTT COOK'S TOUR OF 
THE FUTURE OF PERSONAL FINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Scott Cook showed the world that a David like his Intuit Inc. could take on a 
Goliath like Microsoft Corp. and win handily. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a decision that stunned many technology watchers, he has thrown his 
lot in with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. Microsoft agreed last week to pay a 
whopping $1.5 billion in stock to buy Intuit, publisher of the popular Quicken 
personal finance software. The goal of Gates and Cook is to be the essential 
software link in the multibillion-dollar personal finance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, whose company is based in Menlo Park, Calif., talked about the proposed 
deal and his vision of a world in which everyone will routinely use electronic 
media to pay bills, transfer funds, buy stocks and shop for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You were whupping Microsoft at the personal finance game. What prompted you 
to sell? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We weren't looking to sell. But when Bill called me, he had started 
responding to the things we are trying to do. We want to change for the better 
the way people manage their financial lives and help them make much better 
decisions. . . . Now we're able to do that in many more areas and many more 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Gates would put you in charge of electronic commerce, but ultimately you 
would be answering to him. How will you feel about being No. 2 to your former 
rival? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I guess there are some CEOs who are into a power and control thing. I'm not 
one. I had no problem bringing in Bill Campbell, and he's the CEO. I don't feel 
I have any divine right on decision making around here. We want the best ideas. 
Second, Microsoft is a company with a tremendous track record for giving their 
operating units autonomy. They don't force all the decisions through some sort 
of funnel. There are strategy reviews every six months, but other than that he 
expects you to run the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. To allay potential antitrust concerns, Microsoft is selling its Money 
personal finance program to Novell Inc. But the purchase of Intuit would give 
Microsoft control of 70% of the market. Are you worried that antitrust 
questions could derail the deal? 
</P>
<P>
 A. In fact, there are many competitors. What we basically do is the automation 
of financial services, and in financial services there are hundreds of 
companies that are very keenly aware of the role of technology in automating 
financial affairs. Charles Schwab and Fidelity both have their own software 
that does things that Quicken does plus allows you to do your own trades. 
Schwab gives theirs away free. Plus banks, such as Citibank. Visa has just 
signed up with Managing Your Money (a money management tool). EDS, the huge 
computer giant, is doing electronic banking for any bank that wants it. This is 
a wild and woolly free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are you a threat to banks? A Forrester Research survey found that bankers 
fear that software companies' services could bypass them. 
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't understand where that's coming from. No bank has told us that yet. 
It must come either from banks who are misinformed or uninformed or don't know 
what we're doing. All the banks we're talking to don't have feelings like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will you work with banks? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We're not a bank. How can we take money from them? Take NPCI (National 
Payment Clearinghouse Inc., a service bought by Intuit that bank customers use 
to tap into accounts and pay bills). They're not a bank. They serve banks. . . 
. They link banks and we link banks to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Describe your vision of electronic financial management. 
</P>
<P>
 A. You have to start with the way the world is today. Most people don't feel 
very good about the way their financial lives are managed, particularly the way 
decisions are made about insurance, investing, college, mortgage refinance, 
that sort of stuff. Twenty-five years ago, there weren't that many options or 
decisions. If you went to a bank, they had one flavor of mortgage. Today 
there's a plethora of mortgage choices -- different rates, negative 
amortization, positive amortization, different point levels. Today there are 
4,000 mutual funds. It's very confusing. . . . As a result, we've got the 
option to help people make good, sound decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also hard today for financial institutions to have the close relationship 
with their customers that they'd like. Branch offices aren't staffed with the 
kinds of people you can develop a relationship with. We can change that. Not 
only can we help consumers make much better decisions about their finances, 
what we're building will provide financial institutions with a deep and rich, 
close relationship with their customers. For example, the information on the 
financial institutions' complete line of products and services can be available 
at customers' fingertips, whenever they want it, 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week, in the privacy and convenience of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When customers want to sign up for something today, you have to send them an 
application. They have to handwrite the application. There's a lot of 
opportunities for customers to forget or become interested in somebody else. In 
our vision, a person can immediately apply. Another advantage is for 
self-directed customers, ones who want to make decisions themselves, which 
increases the convenience and lowers the cost. Richer relationships, lower 
costs, increased convenience. This is what we are building the technology to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What accounts for the extraordinarily high valuation for Intuit? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It was a heavily negotiated price, but no surprise. What we're doing is 
very big and very important. We're not the only act in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How does it feel to be worth more than $300 million? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I put my hose on the same way. The true test is, it doesn't make any 
difference to my kids. 
</P>

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: 
COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; LAB WORKS TO INSTILL LOYALTY IN A FIREARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The stories are all too familiar: A child finds a gun and uses it; a policeman 
is killed with his own gun. Firearm injuries are the second-leading cause of 
death for Americans ages 10 to 34, and many firearm deaths involve stolen or 
borrowed guns. Now Sandia National Laboratories, with funding from the Justice 
Department, is investigating so-called smart-gun technologies that would 
prevent anyone but the gun's owner from firing it. 
</P>
<P>
 A sensor that releases an internal lock only when it recognizes the gun owner 
could prevent a police officer from being shot by someone who grabs the 
officer's gun, or the accidental shootings of children playing with their 
parents' guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the Albuquerque, N.M., laboratory are looking into a number of 
ways to help a gun recognize its owner. One would require the owner to wear a 
magnetic ring that would be recognized by a device in the gun's handle. The 
hand of the person holding the gun would also have to conform to the shape of 
the gun's individually designed handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach involves a remote-controlled radio frequency sensor that 
would arm or disarm the gun. Fingerprint or palm print sensors and 
voice-activated sensors are also under consideration.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of the Fog: Anyone stuck on Interstate 5 in dense fog knows how dangerous 
that situation can be. Motorists on a heavily traveled stretch of Interstate 75 
in south Georgia face the same problem. But soon these motorists will have some 
high-tech help: a fully automated fog detection and warning system developed 
jointly by the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Georgia Tech 
Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a network of fog sensors, speed monitoring devices, weather instruments 
and an on-site central computer, the system will continuously monitor 
visibility in a chosen area. The fog sensors consist of a light source and 
receiver aimed slightly off the line of sight of each other. Under conditions 
of good visibility, the light beam will miss the receiver, but when fog is 
present, the particles will scatter the beam, causing light to enter the 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will also control four electronic message signs along the road that 
will warn motorists of a fog hazard, call for reduced traffic speeds when 
appropriate and provide detour information if conditions warrant closing the 
highway. Installation of the sensors is expected to begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart Batteries: You're sitting in an airplane, finishing up a critical 
report, when suddenly your portable computer's battery runs out. Wouldn't it be 
nice, you think, if you'd gotten a clear warning so you could have saved your 
data before the system shutdown? Even better, what if your word-processing 
program was aware of the battery's impending failure and automatically saved 
data for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A smart battery that can do all this is not far off. Such a device is 
essentially a rechargeable battery equipped with specialized hardware that 
provides present, calculated and predicted battery life information to a 
computer. Duracell and Intel have announced two specifications for smart 
batteries. Now SystemSoft Corp., based in Natick, Mass., is developing a smart 
battery software suite that will display information about batteries, including 
the chemistry, capacity, battery status and remaining percentage of battery 
life.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; RACIST 'MAIL BOMB' MESSAGE 
HITS 20,000 COMPUTER USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20,000 computer users across the country received an electronic "mail 
bomb" Monday when someone apparently broke into a Texas college professor's 
Internet account and fired off a racist message to addresses culled from 
several sites on the global network. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident -- which brought death threats and other angry responses from 
hundreds of recipients who thought it came from Grady Blount, a professor of 
environmental science at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi -- reflects the 
vulnerability to intrusion of many computer systems on the network. 
</P>
<P>
 It also underscores the fragility of the emerging social system on the 
electronic frontier, where the much-touted cheapness and simplicity of 
distributing information can be easily abused. Unsolicited mass mailings, 
whether from stolen or legitimate accounts, are not hard to orchestrate.  
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for this kind of thing is the price you pay for the relative 
inexpensiveness of the Internet," said Jeff Olenchek, a University of Wisconsin 
system administrator whose network was compromised in the break-in. "You pay 
your initial fee but it's free to send an e-mail message." Internet users at 
college campuses in Mississippi and Colorado were also affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Netcom, a San Jose-based Internet service provider, estimates that about 3,000 
of its subscribers received the mail, which was signed "Crusader" and included 
the phone number of the white supremacist National Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you burn down your own neighborhood when a court decision doesn't go 
your way, don't worry: Truckloads of money will soon arrive to build you new 
breeding colonies -- er, I mean houses, apartments, community centers, swimming 
pools, etc.," the message read in part.
