BALLET CAN BE BUTCH; MARK MORRIS, BY JOAN ACOCELLA (FARRAR STRAUS GIROUX; 
$27.50; 306 PP.)  
</P>

By Paul Kafka, Paul Kafka, winner of the 1993 Times Book Prize for first 
fiction, is an accomplished ballet and modern dancer.

<TEXT>

 Modern dance, since its earliest heroic days, has suffered from a chronic and 
painful irony deficiency. Anyone who has politely daydreamed through concerts 
in which well meaning young people in unitards walked, ran and occasionally 
danced through 40 or more minutes of anonymous electronic noise, is invariably 
shocked and delighted by the Mark Morris Dance Group. Morris, a 37-year-old 
choreographer and dancer, dispenses with both synthesizers and small talk. His 
works are movement operas to complex scores in which difficult themes -- 
suffering and redemption, the nature of love -- are explored with patience and 
humility. But what most clearly distinguishes Mark Morris' work from that of 
his predecessors and most of his contemporaries is that his performances are 
orchestrated by peals of audience laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Acocella, author of "Mark Morris," describes the Christmas party that 
opens "The Hard Nut," Morris' updated "Nutcracker," this way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stahlbaum living room is a perfect suburban fright: white vinyl couch, 
white plastic drink caddy, white plastic Christmas tree. . . . Mrs. Stahlbaum 
is a big, fussy, hyper-femme redhead -- she is played by a man, Peter Wing 
Healey. . . . As for the Stahlbaum children, the eldest, Louise, is a horny 
teen-ager in go-go boots; the youngest, Fritz, is a truly loathsome little boy. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 While all this is certainly a welcome addition to the much belabored 
Ballanchine choreography, which in our time haunts American ballet in much the 
same way that annual alumni giving haunts university life, there is the danger 
that Morris' "Hard Nut" will sink to the level of kitsch parody. It does not. 
Morris' grounding in ballet, Balkan folk dance, classical flamenco and what he 
himself calls the "several flavors" of modern dance technique available in New 
York, is eclectic even by the standards of today. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Acocella's book, "Mark Morris," is to conventional dance biography what 
"The Hard Nut" is to "The Nutcracker," and has the same invigorating impact. 
Acocella has written about dance for 15 years, but her background is in 
comparative literature. She does not confine herself to the backstage haunts of 
traditional dance criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 A thorough analyst of the structure of Morris' long dances, Acocella is also 
an insightful cultural historian who situates Morris in the context of 
contemporary dance and of modern dance throughout our century on both sides of 
the Atlantic. More ambitiously, Acocella places Morris in that impossible to 
describe American world -- two parts TV, one part school or office life, one 
part family romance -- which is all around us. In Acocella's devoted but never 
wide-eyed biography, Mark Morris becomes exotically ordinary. We begin to 
understand how rare a thing has happened here. 
</P>
<P>
 Acocella has three stories to tell, really: the first, a life story; the 
second, a critical account of 10 years of choreography; the third, a tale of an 
innocent abroad. Her opening chapter is a brief, horrifying account of Mark 
Morris meeting the press for the first time in Belgium: 
</P>
<P>
 As a French journalist once put it, (Morris) was part diva, part truck driver. 
. . . There was much about him that was effeminate, and he had the usual fun 
with this. (During his first season in Brussels, Belgium's Queen Fabiola 
attended one of his performances. "Vive la Reine!" people shouted as she came 
through the foyer. "I thought they meant me," Morris later said to a reporter.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, rather unnervingly, he was also very butch -- a big hairy 
guy who lumbered around noisily and waved a beer bottle at you as he spoke. . . 
. He was asked what he thought of Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, the leader of 
Belgium's young, anguish-ridden dance-theater movement. "All you have to do 
here," he said, "is not wash your hair for a week and then sit on stage and act 
depressed and you've got it. 'Magnifique! Formidable!"  
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, life did not at first go smoothly for young Mark in the Old 
World. He was, at age 32, artistic director of his own company with a budget of 
several million dollars a year from the aptly named Theatre Royal de la 
Monnaie, Belgium's state opera house. Morris must have been saying to himself, 
"This is not our rented Soho loft space. How did we get here?" As if in answer, 
Acocella begins Chapter 2, the biography proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark was born is in Seattle in 1957. Acocella writes of his childhood with a 
Dickensian appetite for the picaresque and the anecdotal. Maxine Crittendon 
Morris, Mark's mother, says, "I always picked my boyfriends for how they 
danced. . . . That's how I got together with (Mark's father) Bill." When Mark 
was eight, Maxine took him to a performance of Jose Greco's flamenco troupe. 
"That night he decided that he too would . . . be a (flamenco) dancer." 
</P>
<P>
 By 13, according to Mercer Junior High classmate, cartoonist Lynda Barry, Mark 
had the lifestyle of a bohemian. "It was clear that he was staying up way too 
late. You could see it in his face. He looked like he never slept. And it 
looked like the thing that was keeping him up was exciting." Mark Morris was 
spending six evenings a week with the Koleda Folk Dance Ensemble, a locally 
grown Balkan folk dance commune. "I fell in love with the group," Mark says. 
</P>
<P>
 In her book, Acocella often returns to this moment in Mark's life. His 
aesthetic of movement, his insistence on rhythmic, athletic dance, was shaped 
by the Koleda Ensemble. The folk dancers, all at least 10 years older than 
Mark, became his intimate circle. A profound sense of well-being, of enclosure, 
forged Mark's philosophy of composition and performance -- his love of 
community, his belief in transcendence through shared experience. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13, Mark was also a scholarship student and part-time teacher at Verla 
Flowers Dance Arts, where the versatile teacher had taken his dance education 
firmly in hand. Mark choreographed 20 dances in high school. His father, Bill, 
had taught him to read music when he was 7. Since then, Mark played piano badly 
but inexhaustibly. He graduated high school, spent six months in Madrid before 
deciding that he didn't want to be a Spanish dancer after all, returned to 
Seattle for a year and a half, then flew to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1976 to 1980, Morris danced with Eliot Feld, Lar Lubovitch, Hannah Kahn, 
and Laura Dean. In 1980, he began to present his own work while still dancing 
with Dean and Lubovitch. He worked his up through the usual strenuous channels 
for young choreographers -- a concert at the rented Cunningham studio in 1980, 
the next year a two-night spot at Dance Theater Workshop. But he gathered 
momentum quickly. In 1983 Morris choreographed nine dances, then 10 more in 
1984. That year he appeared at the New Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of 
Music where he performed a 23-minute solo, O Rangasayee, in the tradition of 
Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis. He wore a "dhoti or loincloth, (and had) the 
soles of his feet and the palms of his hands stained red, in the Indian 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was "handsome and large, (and) possessed of a brilliant technique." His 
group danced Championship Wrestling After Roland Barthes, which Acocella 
characterizes as a "brilliant pop study of the teeth-gnashing, floor-pummeling, 
Kabuki-like histrionics of TV wrestlers." The evening was a huge success. 
Morris had demonstrated his range as a performer and a choreographer, who broke 
new ground for dance while drawing upon the treasures of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But how did he get from Brooklyn to the opera house in Brussels? Despite 
Acocella's careful development, there is an air of necromancy about Mark 
Morris' story. On the surface, it's simple. Morris friends with theater 
director and fellow prodigy Peter Sellars; Peter Sellars pals around with 
Brussels opera house director, Gerard Mortier. Mortier quarrels with longtime 
Belgian favorite and opera dance director, Maurice Bejart, who leaves for 
Lausanne in a huff with all his dancers. Sellars quietly suggests Morris as a 
replacement. Mortier, in a tight spot, watches one Morris dance concert in 
Stuttgart, takes Morris out to dinner, and offers him the dance directorship of 
the Monnaie. It's a kind of modern dance "Beverly Hillbillies," with Morris as 
Jethro, Mortier as banker Drysdale and Brussels as Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath the surface, the story is a frightening and moving one. Mark and 
his friends -- the company in 1988 was made up of close friends . . . underwent 
a painful translation from their adopted New York home to a new and deeply 
conservative city, which reviled them. In the process, they pulled together as 
they never had before. Eventually their tightknit frontier community was torn 
apart. Morris discovered resources that he had only glimpsed before and became, 
during three years of hard labor, one of foremost choreographers of our time. 
But this transformation had enormous costs for Mark and those he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Mark Morris," Acocella's ambitious and scrupulously researched critical 
biography, has a flaw -- and for me it does not -- it is this: She insists on 
writing at length about dance. While aware that the sensational Mark Morris, 
the story of his catastrophic arrival and triumphant departure from Brussels, 
will keep us reading, Acocella refuses to let any of us ignore the dancing for 
the dancer. Six of 11 chapters, set squarely in the middle of her book and 
illustrated with dance photography, are about Morris' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Body" explains the choreographer's unique movement vocabulary and the 
technique that he and his group -- a term intended to convey the collective 
nature of the dance ensemble, rather than the hierarchical company -- developed 
together. "Love and Sex" discusses dance and gender, arguing that Morris is the 
first major choreographer to give women and men solo roles that are not limited 
by false gander idealizations. Morris puts it simply: "My guys are articulate 
and my gals are brutish. And they're both both. They can all do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The third of the dance chapters explores Morris' spiritual identity, his use 
of liturgy, and his religious dances; the fourth chapter discusses Morris' 
fusion of narrative and abstraction, elements of composition which in 
contemporary modern dance are, sadly, often viewed as incompatible. Acocella 
shows that, in the work of a powerful literalist and symbolist like Morris, 
narrative and abstraction are inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth dance chapter concerns Morris' reliance on highly structured, 
rhythmically textured music, from Couperin to Nancarrow, and his unusual 
preference for vocal scores of all eras. This chapter becomes a fascinating 
essay on the uneasy marriage of music and movement, Acocella pointing out that 
many of the founding mothers and fathers of modern dance believed they had to 
free dance from music altogether. Morris is, she thinks, a neoclassicist 
mistaken, at times, as a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her final dance chapter "Irony and Sincerity," focuses on Mark's penchant for 
thematic indirection. Acocella persuades us that while ironic, even campy, Mark 
Morris is never frivolous. His dances, which defamiliarize our tired world with 
Swiftian humor and power, are the most solemn of revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Mark Morris is 37. Acocella ends her book with a blessing. "It is 
wonderful," she writes, "to think what he may do." And wonderful, too, to 
travel with Joan Acocella through Mark Morris' first, fleet-footed years.

DANCING IN THE LIGHT; DANCING SPIRIT: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, BY JUDITH JAMISON WITH 
HOWARD KAPLAN (DOUBLEDAY: $25; 264 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Deborah Jowitt, Jowitt, principal dance critic for the Village Voice, is the 
author of Time and the Dancing Image (UC Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 15 years, beginning in 1965, Judith Jamison was the crowning jewel of the 
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Five foot 10 with long, long limbs and 
cropped hair, Jamison looked like a Masai Amazon. When Jamison rushed into 
Ailey's famous "Revelations," brandishing a white parasol, and started a 
sinuous, exalted treading across a river of silk, audiences saw not just a 
Southern Baptist metaphor for salvation, but an African river goddess. And in 
"Cry," the solo that Ailey made for her in 1972, she transformed herself from a 
woman bowed down by drudgery or writhing under loss into the blazing 
incarnation of freedom and joy. Despite her sizable gift for comedy, she was a 
natural born archetype. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, various choreographers she worked with, and fellow performers have 
all praised her musicality and the generosity of her dancing. Back in the Ailey 
company's bad old days of station-wagon tours and splintery stages in small 
towns, others may have stinted; she never did. One of her great gifts as a 
dancer was her ability to make every movement look as if she had just made it 
up herself and believed in it utterly. When Ailey died in 1989, she disbanded 
her own "Jamison Project" -- with some regrets -- and brought her spirit, her 
integrity, her knowledge of the Ailey repertory, her great talent as a coach 
and director, and her developing skills as a choreographer to the leadership of 
that company. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the new responsibilities, she has also found time (with Howard 
Kaplan) to produce an autobiography. Perhaps she wanted to update the biography 
that Olga Maynard wrote in 1982; perhaps she wanted to shape the events of her 
life in her own way. 
</P>
<P>
 Autobiographies by performing artists seem to fall into three broad 
categories. There are the rare ones that qualify as important literary 
achievements (Hildegard Knef's "The Gift Horse" and Paul Taylor's "Private 
Domain" come to mind). There are the "have-I-got-some-nasty stories-to-tell" 
sort that have everyone the author ever knew quaking months before publication 
(Gelsey Kirkland's "Dancing on My Grave" certainly had this effect). Books that 
fall into the third category -- and Jamison's is one -- fill the account of a 
life with gracious thank-you notes to family, teachers and colleagues past and 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jamison fans, Ailey fans and dance aficionados who will want to read 
"Dancing Spirit" will find no sour stories, backstage melodramas or critical 
analysis of choreography. As the title of Jamison's book implies, her stance is 
visionary, even devotional. It might have been written for young would-be 
dancers; that it be particularly inspiring to young black dancers poised 
between trying for Broadway and television or a concert career, was, I think, 
one of her hopes. Jamison paints a world in which total commitment, hard work, 
a tolerance for pain and a certain amount of selflessness pay off. She was tall 
for a female dancer, and her height, like her blackness, led to her 
occasionally being discriminated against, but she suppressed any bitterness by 
strengthening her commitment to excellence and her faith in God. Under her pen, 
choreographers and dancers emerge, for the most part, as nature's ladies and 
gentlemen, and Alvin Ailey as a hero. She hasn't a truly unkind word to say of 
anyone, and doesn't care for unkindness in others. When someone she took on as 
rehearsal assistant was rude the other dancers, she went off to one side and 
cried, then fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments of anger or disappointment are firmly massaged away. Everything turns 
out to have been for the best. She gets "bumped" from the "Fix Me Jesus" duet 
of "Revelations" in favor of Consuelo Atlas who has a more flexible back 
(leading to the virtuosic excesses that marred performances of this duet for 
years); Jamison says gamely, "Alvin never explained, but that's where faith 
came in. I got mad but I had faith that he knew what he was doing." She 
respects choreographer Ulysses Dove for paying no attention to the fact that 
she had four steel pins in her hip when he choreographed "Inside," "technically 
the hardest solo I ever danced." Any story lurking between this line and "But 
shortly after 'Inside,' I retired" remains untold. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison's words on performing are, as you'd expect, wise. Of comedy roles she 
says, "You've got to make the funniness within the shape of the movement." Over 
and over, in various ways, she defines talent as a gift from heaven and the 
dancer's job as a mission: "Dance from the top of your head to the bottom of 
your feet. There is no step that is not justified. Even when you're stationary, 
you must be moving and alive. Even static sculpture has movement. You may be 
standing still but you're moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasional flashes of wit and impudence make one wish for less of her 
Sunday-best voice, and for more of the Jamison who remembers regretfully eyeing 
her favorite biscuits while her grandfather prayed interminably over a 
Thanksgiving feast: "You could have bounced those biscuits off the wall before 
we were allowed to eat them." (Jamison's childhood memories contain the book's 
most vivid descriptions.) Thrilled by all the backstage help at the Vienna 
State Opera, where she appeared in John Neumeir's "Josefslegende," she exults 
endearingly, "It's called Diva Time!' ' I'd like to know more about those 
raucous games of bid whist she had with colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison was not nobly served by her collaborator Howard Kaplan nor by her 
editor at Doubleday in terms of the book's structure. Loosely chronological, 
"Dancing Spirit" nonetheless circles back and jumps forward enough to create 
frequent feelings of dej a vu . Bits of deja vu . Bits of dance history 
inserted for the reader's edification (say, to explain who Enrico Cecchetti is 
when Jamison talks of her ballet training) don't come in her voice. On the 
other hand, certain rehearsal jargon is never explained (for instance, the 
"staccato port de bras" in the opening section of "Revelations"). Stories that 
surely would have made a point if Jamison had sat you down and told them to you 
sort of peter out. Sightseeing in the Nairobi game preserve: "While we were 
outside the vehicle, our guide pointed out a cheetah in fairly close proximity. 
But when we got back in the Land Rover, the motor failed. After a couple of 
false starts the motor kicked in and we were on our way." Jamison the dancer 
would never have allowed a drama like this to get away from her.

TRUTH AND TOMFOOLERY IN THE TROPICS; THE WAR OF THE SAINTS, BY JORGE AMADO, 
TRANSLATED BY GREGORY RABASSA (BANTAM BOOKS: $22.95; 357 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bondo Wyszpolski, Bondo Wyszpolski is book critic for the L.A.-based journal 
News From Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Amado wrote his first novel in 1931 when he was 19-years-old. The title, 
"Carnival Country," could be applied to the body of work he's been amassing 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Brazilian novelist who gave Dona Flor two husbands (one living; 
one dead, but livelier), and he's still mixing wry, ribald poetry with literary 
soap opera. Even now, Amado remains idealistic, boyishly romantic, a jester and 
a humanist whose compassion for the downtrodden is unstinting. What makes it 
all rather fun is that Balzac seems to be whispering into one ear while Henry 
Miller whispers into the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's "The War of the Saints," a novel so loud you can find it with the 
lights out. Over and around the story line, Amado has thrown together a one-man 
shindig for his beloved Salvador da Bahia. In the author's hands, this former 
capital of Brazil is like a chessboard; each piece, each character, is moved 
with gusto and a roaring generosity. Host or author, party or novel: good 
question, for everyone Amado has ever shaken hands with seems to put in an 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The author confines his story to 48 hours and drops it into the early 1970s, 
during the gloomy nadir of Brazil's 21-year-long dictatorship. Not that there's 
any constraint in Amado's writing; he's just too zestful for that. Anyway, Dom 
Maximiliano von Grudin, director of the Museum of Sacred Art in Bahia, has 
assembled a jewel of an exhibit and acquired the loan of a priceless statue -- 
Saint Barbara of the Thunder -- which is transported down the Paraguacu River. 
However, "Before Master Manuel and Maria Clara had finished mooring the sloop 
and managed to lift out the saint, the saint herself got down from the litter, 
took a step forward, smoothed the folds of her cape, and walked off." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery of the saint's disappearance and Dom Maximiliano's dark night of 
the soul (he'll tussle with humility and self-pride before Amado's through with 
him) are the first of several subplots already swimming off, to emerge 
periodically until the end of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other subplots will sashay across the dance floor of love gained or 
regained. When their parents died, Mariety went to live with congenial Aunt 
Gildete, Manela with strict Aunt Adalgisa. Or, as Amado says, "in the lottery 
of orphanhood, it was Mariety who had won the grand prize." This sets up Manela 
as our sympathetic Juliet, her Romeo being the taxi driver Miro, poor but pure 
and brazenly Brazilian. Couple number one. 
</P>
<P>
 The second couple is Manela's Aunt Adalgisa and Uncle Danilo, an ex-soccer 
champ who rarely stands up to his wife and who'll only stand up for Manela when 
Adalgisa dumps her into a convent. That's a story in itself. Danilo and 
Adalgisa have a stalled-on-the-tracks 20-year marriage, but we'll see what a 
splash of Afro-Brazilian religious ritual can do about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, there's the young and untainted Father Abelardo Galvao gently pursued 
by Patricia das Flores, an aspiring actress and a knock-out, it appears, in 
both body and brains. An actress and a priest? Oh, my, what possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of these instances Saint Barbara will play a key role. Amado goes to 
great lengths to decorate the stage, and he won't be rushed: there's usually a 
payoff 200 pages down the line. He relishes his diversions and he lovingly 
dotes on his characters. Those in search of a straightforward, snappy narrative 
are advised to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Amado has listened well to the song of the land and the song of its people, 
but this depiction of Bahia is closer to "Peter Pan" than to Hector Babenco's 
"Pixote." For example, Amado's captains-of-the-sands, those abandoned 
youngsters who roam the waterfront, are not quite the lovable rascals he 
portrayed 50 years earlier. To his credit, he treats them all like 
grandchildren -- neglecting to let on that in the city of Bahia some 80% of its 
inhabitants are underemployed, or not employed at all. 
</P>
<P>
 What he says instead is: "Anyone who wants to know more about these matters of 
saints, voodoo, candomble , macumba , possessions, mixed blood, and orixas 
should try to put a little money together and take a trip to Bahia, the capital 
city of dreams." Hmmm. All that's lacking is the color insert and the travel 
coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 The War of the Saints is undermined somewhat by its diversions and its asides, 
which -- and here's the dilemma -- are not only funny but provide color and 
rhythm. Ultimately, they tend to deflect the main thrust of the novel, leaving 
behind handsome vignettes that -- mostly -- will soon disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 A mixed blessing, all this, with blessing decidedly emphasized. As a prose 
stylist whose flourishes descend with the accuracy of a Bob Hope punch line, 
Amado is quite an entertainer. His stereotypes, his tomfoolery and his 
formulas, trotted out again and again, may prevent his acclaim as a great 
novelist, but Amado is every bit a child of tropical Brazil. It pulsates in 
virtually every line. Whistling in disbelief -- and we'll do a lot of that -- 
is no deterrent to our wanting to find out what happens next.

 "Guns for Hire" (by Miles Corwin, Nov. 28) was right on the mark. As both an 
Orange County deputy district attorney who has prosecuted armed private 
security guards for the negligent discharge of a firearm and a reserve Los 
Angeles Police Department officer, I can attest that private security guards 
are generally undertrained. After handling several of these cases, I believe 
that the Department of Consumer Affairs needs to re-evaluate its licensing 
guidelines. As society becomes less tolerant of crime, its tolerance for 
less-skilled "officers," even those who violate the law, will inevitably 
increase.

 I have worked as a security officer for most of the last five years while 
going to school and working on my own business. It is a great job to have if 
you need a place to sit and study while earning money, and it is true that it 
will continue to be one of the fastest-growing fields.

<P>
 But most of the jobs are taken by lower-income workers who will be making just 
above minimum wage. Add to that the lack of benefits, the increase in crime and 
the minimal training most officers receive and you can see why the use of 
security officers for a job the police should be doing is, at best, a Band-Aid 
approach.

 A bill that I have proposed in Congress will cure a central anomaly currently 
found in the private security industry by requiring states to establish minimum 
training requirements for both armed and unarmed guards, including classroom 
and on-the-job training and qualification on a supervised weapons range. In 
many states there are no requirements for training of security officers, and in 
14 states an employer can put an armed guard to work with absolutely no 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 The private security industry is one where price cutting and low wages are the 
norm. Unscrupulous operators forgo reasonable training and continue to pay the 
lowest wages so that they can increase profit margins at the expense of public 
safety. I believe that my bill will do a great deal to rid this industry of 
shady operators and enhance the professionalism of private security officers.

 Another story about crime and its unfortunate consequences. When are we going 
to get mad as hell and not take it anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 Do we need more security guards, police, jails? Definitely not. How about a 
little more responsibility and a lot less passing the blame? I feel for honest, 
hard-working security guards such as Evan Elko, who was shot on the job. We 
need to get serious about the death penalty immediately. If we do not, there 
will be a lot more Evan Elkos.

 It seems that our whole society is now living in fear, and people would do 
just about anything to survive. But the gang members are also out there to 
survive. Security guards are not the answer. By hiring them, we are showing 
that we are afraid, and this is exactly what the gang members want. To them, 
it's a power trip.

 Kudos for publishing "On Willow Creek" (Nov. 28). Rick Bass' writing is in 
keeping with the best of the American nature writers, starting with Emerson and 
continuing with Edward Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of essay speaks for nature and against cement-paved malls and 
freeways, and will do more for the conservation of water and earth than a lot 
of technical data. It goes straight to the heart.

 I was deeply touched by "On Willow Creek." I was born in Dallas, Tex., and 
raised in Garland. I am a fifth-generation Texan, and at one time there was 
even a town called Pyle's Prairie, after our family. "On Willow Creek" could be 
my story. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I have now lived in Los Angeles for almost 14 years. I hate this 
place and the way it steals people's souls. I think that, all things 
considered, I have fared well all these years and remain pretty much intact. I 
am convinced that a large part of the reason for that is the Texas mind-set I 
was given. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been greatly misunderstood by many people who have mistaken my "Texas 
pride" for some sort of arrogance or bigotry, when the reality is I have not 
fully understood this attitude myself. You explained a large part of who I am 
in a way that I have never been able to voice. I am very grateful for that.

 "On Willow Creek" is no "Walden Pond," and a Thoreau he may never be, but 
writer Rick Bass is good. He makes you feel like dropping everything 
materialistic and heading for the hills. Or at least the nearest park.

RICHARD EDER: TRAPPED IN PARADISE; MAKE ME WORK, BY RALPH LOMBREGLIA (FARRAR 
STRAUS GIROUX: $20; 211 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bindings once deformed the feet of Chinese girl-children so that, grown up, 
they could squeeze into tiny shoes. Wasp-waist corsets macerated the innards 
and constitutions of Victorian women. High starched collars immobilized men's 
heads and dispositions -- stiff-necked they strutted into World War One -- at 
the start of this century. A monstrous load of iron rendered the medieval 
knight unfit for much more than sitting a drayhorse and lumbering straight 
toward an equally unmaneuverable antagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Successively, our civilizations locate a good, improve it, specialize it, and 
improve it still more until it is an armor that drags our humanity down. Ralph 
Lombreglia writes in an odd mix of parody and melodrama of characters who 
submit to the deformities they are confined in, paradoxically, by today's 
technological and cultural unconstraints. A mother schemes to run away from her 
grown son, rendered abusive by drugs and a world that avoids instilling values 
in its young. A scriptwriter in a high-tech video firm is unable to commit to 
his girlfriend until he sees their two images blown up into a giant hologram. 
An ex-Hippie, her counterculture rusting dangerously away in the Vermont woods, 
is given a hand by a Polish immigrant imbued with something like the old-style 
American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not that Lombreglia is particularly conservative; he is just on the 
rebound from what he sees around him. Fortunately he is made extensively of 
Silly Putty. His rebounds, at their best, are extravagant and far-fetching. It 
is in his soberer moments, exploring the straight line of a moral or a plot, 
that he flounders. He flounders oftener in "Make Me Work" than in his splendid 
first collection, "Men Under Water." Lombreglia is all treble obbligato; when 
he tries for resonance and undertones they seem patched in. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the best stories take us back to Paradise Productions: that splendid 
outfit, teetering between postmodern agility and utter chaos, that also figures 
in the previous collection. It makes promotion films for high-tech Cambridge 
entrepreneurs, usually on a moment's notice. It is staffed by Dwight, its 
leader; Anna his wife -- half nightingale, half mother hen; the virtually 
bodiless Professor who seems entirely built of algorithms; Nemesto, an inventor 
freak; and Walter, the scriptwriter. Paradise is nonstop all- nighters, gourmet 
takeout, and hysteria alternating with lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a light-hearted model of what can befall brilliant people who live 
entirely in their brilliance. In "Late Early Man," Anna's nine-month pregnancy 
is put on hold while she helps her team film a belt-sander derby; a race, that 
is, in which various belt-sanders are set to scuttle around a track laid out in 
a factory loft. It is a grand, sociable affair, with lots to eat and drink; and 
when Anna goes into labor, Dwight, caught up in the promotion, asks Walter to 
take her to the hospital. They promptly get stuck in rush-hour traffic on the 
highway in front of the factory. Walter borrows a Wall Street Journal from a 
neighboring car and does the delivery, while Dwight watches with binoculars 
from the factory window, and calls up his emerging baby via the car's cellular 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic absurdity builds like "Hellzapoppin"; the moral irony is delicately 
touched upon. It sounds more strongly in "Heavy Lifting." The Paradise team is 
preparing a show for a client who is raising venture capital for a private 
takeover of the space program. The high point is a giant hologram of a 
moon-shot video; however, Anna's baby has been playing with the tapes. What the 
investor audience gets is a taped argument between Walter and his girlfriend -- 
she wants him to move in with her, he hesitates. Seeing her projected 30 feet 
high, and in front of a cheering audience, he wavers no longer. Private passion 
may not be quite real; it needs the certification of electronic imagery and the 
public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Lombreglia's balance between his characters, zany but disturbingly 
credible, and his disconcerting moral message is gracefully achieved. None of 
the other stories quite manages such a balance. The author constructs an artful 
and ironic situation, only to dull it with action that is variously stagy, 
commonplace or overly elliptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa, the disk-jockey protagonist of "One Woman Blues Revival," has lived 
through her bright and free Seventies, slowed down in the Eighties, and come to 
ground working for a shaky radio station in Vermont. Her husband, an Elvis 
freak, has split to run a record store; she holds valiantly to tradition by 
playing classic rock and blues while a 20-year colleague who plays groups with 
such names as "Brain Bandage." Funky and free has become faded and afraid. She 
is lonely. Her cabin in the woods is leaks and is infested with raccoons. It 
rains all spring. She drives an old Toyota: "never-say-die vehicles . . . but 
hers was saying die." "All the stray garbage signals of the world had found 
their satellite dish, and its name was Lisa," Lombreglia writes. 
</P>
<P>
 The portrait is funny and compassionate; the story is over-arranged. A Polish 
garage-man fixes her car, gets rid of her raccoons, makes friends with her dog, 
chases away her pesky ex-husband, loves her blues music and loves her too. He 
also resembles the father who threw away her baby bottle and has preoccupied 
her ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Another persuasive portrait is found in "A Half Hour with God's Heroes." 
Josephine works long hours in an Italian restaurant. Her ex-husband is in jail 
for armed robbery; her son steals money from her along with her television set, 
VCR and toasters. Without telling him, she is preparing to sell her house and 
move to Florida. Following her mother-in-law's advice she drives to a Catholic 
shrine to buy a statue of St. Joseph to be buried in her yard. It is supposed 
to ensure a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The battered but determined Josephine is affecting; so is her alliance with 
her mother-in-law, who went through hell with her own husband and her own son. 
"The bad genes of men wove themselves through human generations like a 
corrosive thread, tainting the goodness of women. That was the thing you had to 
remember when you married a guy," Josephine thought. "You were really marrying 
his father. And when you had a guy's son, you were having the guy." After this, 
the story turns ordinary. Josephine tries to bury the statue in her frozen 
yard, gets a visit from her apparently reformed son, and is bilked once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces in the collection are stagy, with didactic notes creeping in. 
Several are revenge stories. A white boy, feeling excluded by a black playmate, 
gets him and his family in trouble without quite meaning to. A monstrously 
egotistic composer who seduces his students finds the latest of his "proteges" 
allied with his wife against him. A man who has stolen a friend's girl sits 
helplessly, years later, in the chair of his friend's barber shop and gets a 
peculiar and humiliating haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombreglia fixes his characters and their plights in a comic web of disquiet. 
Stuck, their legs waving loopily, they are revealed as partly silly and partly 
us. When he lifts them out of the web and tries to reveal them differently -- 
by means of their stories -- they lose distinction. The author's mastery is in 
the still shot that suggests motion without depicting it.

COVER STORY: 'LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DANCE'; A DECADE LATER, GEARY AND FRANCIS STEP 
INTO OLD ROLES WITH NEW HABITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, Libby Slate is a frequent contributor to TV Times and Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charley Brown's near Universal Studios may seem like just another place to eat 
in the Valley. But back in the summer of 1992, when it was still Reuben's, the 
restaurant was the setting for one of the most significant lunches in recent 
soap-opera history. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that Tony Geary and Genie Francis, who 10 years earlier had left 
their phenomenally popular roles as Luke and Laura Spencer on ABC's "General 
Hospital," met to catch up. They had seen each other only twice in the 
intervening years. 
</P>
<P>
 He had appeared in features, TV movies and stage productions at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center and elsewhere after departing his Emmy-winning role on 
"General Hospital." She had been featured in the miniseries "North and South" 
(Books I and II) and the series "Bare Essence," and was fresh from a two-year 
stint as incest victim Ceara Connor on ABC's New York-based "All My Children." 
</P>
<P>
 Geary already had returned to "General Hospital" in 1991, playing Luke's 
look-alike cousin Bill Eckert. ABC, anxious for an almost certain ratings 
bonanza -- the couple's 1981 wedding remains the highest-rated soap event ever, 
watched by 14 million viewers and garnering a 52 share -- had been pursuing 
Francis for a year. But the actress had been reluctant to call a halt to a 
burgeoning New York theater career to rejoin the soap. 
</P>
<P>
 At that fateful lunch, though, Geary recalls, "We talked about playing Luke 
and Laura again. We knew that sooner or later we wanted to work together again. 
We became very excited about the idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Francis: "We did an improv together to see if those people were still in 
us. That lunch made me feel like this could be a wonderful thing, a fulfilling 
acting challenge, and that I shouldn't turn my back on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, at last year's Daytime Emmy Awards came the announcement that 
Luke and Laura, whose romance had landed them on the cover of Newsweek a few 
weeks before their wedding, would indeed be returning to "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 And return they did, on Oct. 29. They were the owners of a diner in British 
Columbia, a continent away from the show's fictional Upstate New York setting 
of Port Charles. And they're parents of a 10-year-old son, Lucky (Jonathan 
Jackson). 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the path back to Port Charles required as much maneuvering 
off screen as on. "There had to be new writers and a great story," says Geary, 
46, who cites battles he had had with the show's writers over the continuing, 
confusing changes they made in Eckert's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily, it was, 'Let's get a story that's good, one that we believe in. 
With Luke and Laura, the stakes have to be very high -- there has to be an 
adversary. These aren't characters who sit around talking about their 
relationship. These are eccentric characters who drive the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'We need a heavyweight (writer),' and we got one in Claire Labine. 
She's brilliant. They worked on the story for months." Labine, a multiple Emmy 
Award-winning writer-producer who created the now-departed "Ryan's Hope," was 
brought on board after ABC dismissed the previous "General Hospital" writing 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Once taping actually began, "There was plenty of nervous tension," says the 
31-year-old Francis of the role she first played at age 14. "I was scared. It 
was important to do it right. I was afraid people would say, 'Luke and Laura? 
So what.' But I was welcomed back warmly. I was surprised at how comfortable it 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from Bill to Luke provided a different sort of comfort for Geary. 
"People laugh when I say this," he says, laughing now himself, "but I asked 
them to move my dressing room. A room became available that's exactly 63 steps 
closer to my car! You save miles every week. I'm also closer to the elevator. 
So much time is usurped by learning lines, every minute counts." 
</P>
<P>
 On a less mundane level, both feel that they bring more depth to their roles 
now. "We are 10 years richer in our lives," Geary says. "The trust factor we 
had, the ability to listen to each other with our hearts, minds and 
imaginations has always been there. But now, Genie is a formidable young woman 
who really knows her craft and business. It's a joy working with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, now a real-life wife (to Jonathan Frakes of the syndicated "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation"), welcomes the chance to break Laura out of her 
ingenue status, particularly in playing a mother. And, she says, the chemistry 
between the two, which had been so unmistakable the first time around, is still 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pleasant surprise for me is that when I look into Tony's eyes, he's still 
100% present, sharing everything that's going on," she says. "Acting with him 
is like a beautiful dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Geary also had a revelation. "It was a surprise to me how much energy this 
takes," he says. "Bill was low maintenance. But Luke burns at a higher flame. 
I'd forgotten how much he loves life. I'm 10 years older -- he almost burned me 
out then! Being a little more mature now, shall we say, I do have a better 
sense of pacing. But I fall asleep easily at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the ABC brass are resting easily as well: The day that Luke and 
Laura aired for the first time, the ratings shot up almost 24% from the 
previous week's 6.1/22 share, to an 8.0/27 share. The show, which had been 
finishing third or fourth of 10 soaps, came in second that week with a 6.6/23 
share, and has often finished second since then. The actors are pleased, of 
course, but say their focus remains on their work rather than Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also gratified that fan reaction has been positive but not -- unlike 
10 years ago -- overwhelmingly frenzied. "I think it's doing a slow build," 
Francis says. "Tony and I were talking about that. We said, 'What are we?' It's 
almost as if the characters are mythological to modern-day folks. It feels only 
warm to me this time, though. Last time I was too young, and not ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Geary, who makes a cameo appearance as Luke with Francis' Laura on 
Tuesday night's episode of ABC's "Roseanne": "Luke and Laura have a life force 
of their own. They've lived in the audience's hearts (for the past decade), 
without our even wearing the clothes. So it's sort of like picking up where we 
left off." 
</P>
<P>
 "General Hospital" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on ABC. "Roseanne" airs Tuesday at 
9 p.m. on ABC.

REGRESSIVE PLEASURES; PATRICK O'BRIAN'S HIGH-SEAS ADVENTURE SERIES OFFERS 
REFUGE FROM THE CRAZINESS OF MODERN LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, John Balzar is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ned Ludd is said to have been an apprentice stocking maker in England 175 
years ago. In a fit one day he grabbed a hammer and smashed his newly invented 
knitting frame to pieces. They called him a half-wit, though you can decide for 
yourself if this is a fair characterization of the man whose name came to 
symbolize the idea that technological advancement is not necessarily or always 
for the good. 
</P>
<P>
 Encyclopedia references suggest the Luddite movement was quickly wiped out by 
the British Army -- an example to the billions of us born since that progress 
is a one-way street and you'll be trampled if you go against traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luddite sympathizers have stubbornly hung on all these years, nursing 
their gripe with the cult of efficiency. You may know them as the people who 
would like to heave their desktop out the window, but cannot, because their 
hands are crippled by carpal tunnel syndrome. They ask what is to be gained 
when dishes must be washed off before inserted in the dishwasher, and recognize 
each other on the streets by the stains on their fingers from leaky fountain 
pens. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recent years, these American Luddites have bought more than a 
half-million copies of the eccentric novels of Patrick O'Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are not a devotee, a brief introduction: O'Brian writes of the Georgian 
England of two centuries ago. His novels about Royal Navy Capt. Jack Aubrey and 
sidekick physician/naturalist Stephen Maturin have been called some of the best 
historical fiction of our age, his duo the most compelling since Sherlock and 
Watson, their high-seas adventures spellbinding. With this winter's publication 
of "The Wine-Dark Sea," the series now numbers 16 volumes and 4,500 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Luddites grasp still another, if only whimsical, appeal to the books: In these 
works it is wholly plausible to escape the ending spasms of the 20th Century, 
to forget the great, heralded, chaotic coming of the Information Age and to 
lose oneself comfortably in the delights of the past, when clocks still ticked 
and never so fast as to numb us. 
</P>
<P>
 In O'Brian's hand, people possess time; it does not propose to possess them. 
Thus reflection and rumination, those lost joys, lead the mind to the strangest 
of wonders. Conversation is lifted by eloquence, erudition and subtlety instead 
of debased by slogan and amplified by volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Honor, silly thing, is a virtue; the sharing of a meal an everyday treasured 
ritual. Friendships last a lifetime; society cherishes its heroes but has not 
yet invented the celebrity. It is still possible to travel the world and to 
discover. Specialization has not made the free-ranging mind obsolete. The 
search for meaning is broader than free-market consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as told through these tales, cynicism has yet to clap onto the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brian has been described by interviewers as a man lost in history. So surely 
it must delight him to sprinkle through his tales that absurd old Navy maxim, 
"Hurry, there's not a minute to loose." As in: Hurry, if you send your letter 
with that outgoing ship you might get an answer in six months. Or, hurry set 
that extra topgallant staysail and we can increase speed from four knots to 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 No time to lose? Surely, the Luddite will tell you to much of it is gone 
already. But contrary to that perverse dictum of progress, Patrick O'Brian 
allows us to turn the clock back. Excerpts from "The Wine-Dark Sea": 
</P>
<P>
 "A purple ocean, vast under the sky and devoid of all visible life apart from 
two minute ships racing across its immensity. They were as close-hauled to the 
somewhat irregular north-east trades as ever they could be, with every sail 
they could safely carry and even more, their bowlines twanging taut: they had 
been running like this day after day, sometimes so far apart that each saw only 
the other's topsails above the horizon, sometimes within gunshot; and when this 
was the case they fired at one another with their chasers." 
</P>
<P>
 "In his role of virtually omnipotent captain Jack could be deaf to a hint, 
particularly if it reached him indirectly: Stephen was less well placed, and 
two days later when Dutourd, having wished him a good morning and having spoken 
of the pleasure it had given him to linger on the quarterdeck all the time they 
played, went on to say, with an ease that surprised Maturin until he recalled 
that wealthy men were used to having their wishes regarded, 'It would perhaps 
be too presumptuous in me to entreat you to let Captain Aubrey know that it 
would give me even greater pleasure to be admitted to one of your sessions: I 
am no virtuoso, but I have held my own in quite distinguished company; and if I 
were allowed to play second fiddle we might embark upon quartets, which have 
always seemed to me the quintessence of music.' "

MORE 'SOUND AND FURY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clash between the deaf community and those who would help restore hearing 
to the deaf has been unnecessarily polarized in recent years, and Michael 
D'Antonio's article ("Sound and Fury," Nov. 21) did little to soothe the 
acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochlear implant technology is not primitive.Rather it is the most 
sophisticated and technologically advanced medical device ever applied, and its 
benefit has been repeatedly demonstrated for more than 20 years. When the sound 
from the implant is combined with lip reading, even the least successful 
cochlear implant user experiences significant improvement in the ability to 
communicate.

 When my daughter was born deaf in 1967, we began, before her first birthday, 
with hearing aids (the only amplification available), parent classes and oral 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as an oral adult, her achievements include Pomona College and the 
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Tufts/Harvard) and the Presidential 
Management internship with the federal Department of Health and Human Services. 
Her other languages are Spanish, French, Hebrew and Italian. She has presented 
papers at international conferences in Japan and Russia. Recently her name was 
placed on the register for an appointment to the U.S. Foreign Service, where 
she may join the subculture of diplomats. All of this has been possible because 
we began with amplification and oral communication and, for her, it worked.

 We of the Otavalan community, the Centro Cultural MUYUY and the Community of 
Quichua Art and Culture (CACUQ) thank writer Jonathan Kandell for his interest 
and goodwill ("Shuttle Capitalism," Nov. 14). However, as the inheritants of a 
historical process of self-determination of our peoples, we find the article 
limited.For example, take a deeper look at our socioeconomic work and our 
political work, with our single focus being the struggle for the fundamental 
rights of all humanity: liberty and self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 We would like the world to know that we are Nations-Cultures that, despite the 
ethnocidal and genocidal practices used against us, continue to resist. We 
strongly urge you in the cementing of the bases of a new society, where 
equality and freedom of all peoples is the rule.

 I enjoyed Ann Japenga's "Grunge 'R' Us" (Nov. 14) immensely, and thank her for 
her attempt to understand.But she needn't have written an elegy. The

<P>
 In 1981, Thaao Penghlis went head to head with Tony Geary's Luke Spencer as 
the diabolical Victor Cassadine on "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was as the suavely mysterious, sophisticated Count Antony DiMera, whom 
he played 1981-85 on NBC's "Days of Our Lives," that Penghlis left an indelible 
stamp on daytime viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 During his eight-year absence, Penghlis starred as master of disguise Nicholas 
Black in the revived but failed "Mission: Impossible" series, co-starred in 
such miniseries as "Memories of Midnight" and "Sadat" and had a brief run on 
the now-defunct soap "Santa Barbara." He returned to "Days" on Oct. 22. Last 
seen on "Days" disappearing into the fog, crying his wife's name, his character 
returned by opening a door and announcing, "I'm back," followed by a 
freeze-frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing that the show's producers were interested in having him back, 
Penghlis, a Sydney, Australia native of Greek descent, orchestrated his return 
as carefully as that of his character. "I was looking for something to keep me 
in one place for awhile -- I'd been traveling a lot," he says. "I wanted to 
meet with the producer, Ken Corday, so I dressed to the nines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I wanted to meet with the writers, so I dressed in another Armani suit. 
It was a game on my part, and on theirs, too. I wasn't coming back as an actor 
desperate to have a job. I like the idea of going from one (medium) to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving $20,000 to choose his own wardrobe, a longtime habit, he 
reported for work. It took some time to rediscover the character's rhythms and 
responses, he says. He also discovered that the show had undergone some changes 
during his time away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one less rehearsal, so the show is faster now. Sometimes we shoot two 
shows in one day -- maybe 14 scenes, back to back. You don't have time to do 
your best work. Occasionally, you say, 'I'm sorry, I can't go on,' or flub a 
line, so they have to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 With years of varied acting experiences now behind him, Penghlis is quicker to 
make suggestions to producers than he was the first time he played the role. He 
feels he has been emboldened by life experiences, which he refers to frequently 
as a "journey" both figuratively and literally: He climbed Mount Sinai, for 
instance, and has been supporting his mother through a battle against breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at things differently. I touch things differently," he says. "This 
year, with my mother coming so close to death, I've learned the fragility of 
existence. That wakes you up. The character is played more sensitively -- I'm 
not afraid of feelings. When I do a scene with Alice Horton (the show's 
matriarch, played by Frances Reid), colors come out of me, of warmth, caring, 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Penghlis is now trying his hand at writing a non-soap project. "I don't know 
how much longer I'm going to be an actor -- I get bored doing something too 
long," he says. "But some of the greatest experiences I've had were on 'Days.' 
"

 "Days of Our Lives" airs weekdays at noon on NBC. LIBBY SLATE

 RETURN TO PARADISE by Breyten Breytenbach. (Harcourt Brace: $22.95; 224 pp.) 
Breytenbach, poet first, ANC activist second, spent seven years, from 1975 to 
1982, in prison in his native South Africa.Afrikaner-born, his marriage to 
Yolande, a Vietnamese woman living in Paris, did not meet with the approval of 
the South African government, and from 1960 to 1973, he was not allowed even a 
visit to his homeland. In 1973, a famous poet, he was allowed to return for a 
three-month visit, but was arrested and convicted of terrorism for a 
clandestine trip in 1975. "A Season in Paradise" and "True Confessions of an 
Albino Terrorist" were written after these visits, respectively. "This book was 
written on the wing," writes Breytenbach in the Preface, and that is how it 
reads as well. He is on the balls of his feet like a street kid, looking over 
his shoulder, jabbing the air, giving us partial information about his friends 
and enemies and his role in their lives. He writes at one point that words in 
Africa are used "to ensnare time, to delay it, to annul it, to perpetuate it," 
and again, this is how it feels to read his prose. A poet-friend explains that 
"one should use illusion to pin down reality," advice he probably took, but 
that's just shadow-boxing.In the end, we don't really know who or what 
Breytenbach is running from. He cannot, however, obscure his Afrikaner "respect 
for nature and animals." As in his poetry, the beauty and the fury are plain 
and raw. Everything else is language and flight.

 For I can snore like a bullhorn

<P>

</P>
<P>
 and Fergus will only sink deeper

 into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash, 
</P>
<P>
 but let there be that heavy breathing 
</P>
<P>
 or a stifled cry anywhere in the house 
</P>
<P>
 and he will wrench himself awake 
</P>
<P>
 and make for it on the run -- as now, we lie together, 
</P>
<P>
 after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies, 
</P>
<P>
 familiar touch of the long-married, 
</P>
<P>
 and he appears -- in his baseball pajamas, it happens, 
</P>
<P>
 the neck opening so small he has to screw them on --  
</P>
<P>
 and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, 
</P>
<P>
 his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child. 
</P>
<P>
 In the half darkness we look at each other 
</P>
<P>
 and smile 
</P>
<P>
 and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body --  
</P>
<P>
 this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making,

 sleeper only the mortal sounds can awake, 
</P>
<P>
 this blessing love gives again into our arms.

 MY DAY: A Tale of Fear, Alienation and Despair by Marvin Heiferman and Carole 
Kismaric. (Chronicle: $6.95 ) This is a truly cynical little book, proving once 
again that good sarcasm can come in small packages. It is a day in 
black-and-white pictures, a really mediocre, middle-class day, complete with 
personal hygiene products, The Office and The Date. Heiferman and Kismaric have 
captured, out of the corners of our eyes, the little details that make up our 
generic, disconnected, product-driven lives. Again, this is not Angst, it is 
despair. Sure, you might laugh, but that is because you are sick, very sick.

 TELLING TIME: Angels, Ancestors, and Stories by Nancy Willard. (Harcourt 
Brace: $12.95; 226 pp.) These are stories about writing stories, many of which 
were told at the Breadloaf Writers' Conference to fellow storytellers.Each has 
a rubric, a riddle, a metaphor hovering over the story like a guardian angel. 
In one, Adam and Eve recount their losses for an insurance agent, including the 
loss of poetry; in another, Miss Gatherer and Miss Experience lead two 
different lives in the same writer. In "The Skin on What We've Said," Willard 
gives us the same two "nuggets of advice" she's given her students: "Show, 
don't tell; and write from what you know." 'Looking for Mr. Ames" is a lovely 
elegy for a professor of creative writing, and in "Truth's the Devil Who Told 
Me," Willard presents the poem as riddle, in which it is not by solving the 
riddle so much as writing it that we live. Here, as elsewhere, she writes from 
what she knows, but she shows just a little bit more than she tells.

 When is a hospital not a hospital? 
</P>
<P>
 When it's being used as a filming location for a TV show, of course. Then it 
might easily be transformed into a television station, as happened on an 
episode of ABC's "Matlock." Or, on Fox's "Melrose Place," it may become a 
marriage counselor's office or a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a kitchen at Queen of Angels has even been turned into a permanent 
morgue set, with the appropriate doors, stainless-steel walls and gurneys. "We 
get a lot of demand for morgues; people die all the time on TV," notes Scott 
Osberg, executive vice president of Real to Reel, an agency that finds and 
represents hospitals as well as mansions, middle-class homes, warehouses and 
other location sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the right building or area in which to film not only enhances a 
production's quality, but also can save producers thousands of dollars in set 
construction or rental fees. In prime-time television, that mission falls to 
program location managers and to such agencies as Osberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 The daytime soaps leave their studios rarely, but for a recent Catalina shoot 
for CBS' "The Bold and the Beautiful" the producers and director did the 
location scouting. It's a job that requires an artistic bent coupled with 
puzzle-solving abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say someone asks for a police station," says Jim McCabe, location manager for 
most of ABC's recent "Columbo" films, one of which airs Sunday at 9 p.m. "Your 
initial response is to find a look-alike, not a real one -- a real police 
station is not dramatic at all. You also need to ask: Is it in a big city? A 
small city? Is it upscale?" 
</P>
<P>
 Location managers are under the gun to find sites quickly. For each episode or 
TV movie, they receive a script and breakdown of the "practicals," industry 
jargon for non-studio locations. After consulting with the project's producer, 
director and production designer, they visit prospective sites and/or contact 
location agencies, in either case returning with photographs to be approved by 
that creative team. 
</P>
<P>
 Various factors determine which candidates are selected. Among them: asking 
price and filming suitability. Are the doors wide enough for the equipment? Can 
scenes be shot from more than one angle? Is the neighborhood noisy? 
</P>
<P>
 The style of the show is also considered. For "Columbo," McCabe says, star and 
executive producer Peter Falk "likes a certain look. Expensive. Columbo likes 
to cross swords with powerful, vain people. So Peter likes certain features 
about his locations: long hallways, big rooms and vistas, to give a big feel to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, NBC's new action-adventure series "Viper," which premieres Sunday, 
has posed a stylistic challenge for location manager Tony Saenz. The futuristic 
show stars Dorian Harewood as the disabled Julian Wilkes, who transforms a 
roadster into the high-tech, crime-fighting Viper. James McCaffrey plays Joe 
Astor, a former criminal reprogrammed to drive the vehicle. The show's 
producers favor what Saenz calls a "design" look, rather than nondescript 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
 The mezzanine of downtown Los Angeles' posh Rex restaurant, for instance, 
became a villain's office, while the classic Art Deco Bullock's-Wilshire 
building turned into a bad guy's lab. Rather than just an ordinary apartment 
for McCaffrey, Saenz found a streamlined Art Deco building in Silver Lake; 
Harewood lives in Frank Lloyd Wright house in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz, who has two assistants because the show also does second-unit stunt 
filming, is most proud of the vacant building he spotted while driving through 
downtown Los Angeles. The former Sun Chemical building, which had never been 
tapped for location use, now functions inexpensively as the show's main set, 
the Metro Garage (initially called the Project Garage). 
</P>
<P>
 After places are chosen, location managers become more involved in the filming 
and scheduling, and take care of such business as obtaining contracts, filming 
permits and signed consents from residents and office-building tenants. They 
also arrange for cast and crew parking and hire police and fire personnel. When 
filming gets under way, they try to be on the set when the crew arrives and 
leaves, remaining throughout the day for difficult situations. 
</P>
<P>
 On neighborhood shoots, Saenz says, "We're the first people (residents) see. 
We have to have the wisdom of Solomon to try to keep everyone happy. And if the 
crew says something to the neighbors and a war starts, then we have to be Henry 
Kissinger." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a script will contain a scene impossible to film. By and large, 
Saenz says, "The writers' imaginations are big. Their job is to be creative. 
Mine is to make whatever they've written happen on camera." 
</P>
<P>
 "Viper" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC, then moves to its regular times 
lot, Fridays at 8 p.m. "Columbo" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on ABC.

THREE ON THE TOWN: UNEASY STREET; WHEN THE GIVING GETS TOUGH, THE HOMELESS ARE. 
. .STILL HOMELESS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nothing in the etiquette books offers any help in an encounter like this: 
</P>
<P>
 I recently drove out of the newspaper's parking garage, a half-block off Skid 
Row, and turned up the alley. It was just light enough to see, so with only the 
two of us there, the homeless man and I naturally saw each other. 
</P>
<P>
 And then we looked away. The man was defecating in the alley. Pretending that 
no one's privacy had been transgressed was the only civility that could be 
salvaged from the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tiled and paneled chambers of City Hall, two blocks from where that man 
crouched in the twilight, the policy debate natters on: Public toilets or not? 
Homeless encampments or not? 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, we who navigate city streets each day must devise our own homeless 
policy, one panhandler, one street person at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 I have learned to walk wide of the man who sleeps in the ivy next to my vet's 
office. He cradles a yard-long sharpened stick, and when he is startled, he 
rears up with it in present-arms position. Everything about him -- clothes, 
skin, hair -- is sooty gray. Neighbors leave clean clothes and food, but he 
pokes around in the trash behind a doughnut shop instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside my own office, a woman sometimes waits after midnight with a girl no 
more than 5. "Mommy, I'm hungry, mommy, I'm hungry," the child repeats as 
people approach. Sometimes I give them money; sometimes I think I should call 
Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours earlier, on the same street, a man hunts cans and bottles. I carry out 
the stuff my office-mates discard. In our symbiotic minuet, I drop it in the 
trash, and he retrieves it. The recycling makes me happy; the money makes him 
happy.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet none of this satisfies. Like the homeless, the rest of us are sometimes 
frightened, often frustrated. Over the holidays, I read the "Principles on 
Panhandling" flyer from the Los Angeles Coalition to End Homelessness. It 
quotes two rabbis and Martin Luther King Jr. on charity and points out that 
Buddha and St. Francis lived on alms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Principles" balks at recommendations to give money to homeless agencies 
instead of homeless people. "Principles" must despise those life-sized dolphin 
statues the CHANGE program has set up outside movie houses and the trailer 
being shown inside, telling people to drop their spare change in the dolphins 
rather than give it to panhandlers who, a spokeswoman for the charity says, 
"could go use it for drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Principles" deplores aggressive begging but declares "Say No to Panhandling" 
campaigns are a "big lie." Street people need money, not referrals to services 
that are already too crowded and hard to reach. It says: "We do not, nor should 
we, differentiate between a homeless person asking for change from a Girl Scout 
asking for change." 
</P>
<P>
 But I do. We all do. I do it every time I reach for my pocket to give to 
someone who says "Excuse me" instead of someone whose request carries an 
implicit, menacing "or else." Every time I hand change to someone who looks 
more likely to use it for a sandwich than a bottle, I decide who is the 
"deserving poor." 
</P>
<P>
 I do it every time I slip a bill into the hand of an aging, ailing person and 
not a young, able-looking one. I do it when I give money to a woman instead of 
a man because I think that being a homeless woman must be one burden too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, I had coins to spare for one woman who hung around a corner 
near the office. She was quick with a compliment whether you gave her money or 
not. "Fabulous tie," she told an editor. "Green is your color," she said to me. 
</P>
<P>
 But I haven't known what to do since I heard she paid someone $5 to beat the 
living hell out of a man who she said was "poaching" on her corner. Would I be 
subsidizing criminal malice? Or is she just the smallest of small businesses, 
and is the hired thuggery to maintain the monopoly on her "territory" simply 
the competitive system at its most desperate? 
</P>
<P>
 And what has happened to this place, that I can come near to believing that?

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF MALE NUDES IN AMERICA: Stories by Dianne Nelson (Georgia: 
$19.95; 137 pp.) These stories, in which traveling with or without, running 
away from or to men figures prominently, won the Flannery O'Connor Award for 
Short Fiction.Indeed, she's from Utah, but Nelson has a flat-mouthed southern 
humor that reads a lot like wisdom. In "Paperweight"' the narrator is obsessed 
with a man named Prentice, who, at one point, follows her out to her car, 
"complicating the darkness." In "In the Shadows of Upshot-Knothole," the 
narrator's mother is described: "Even ten miles off and blowing toward her, 
trouble was about as discreet as an ocean liner full of singing drunks." In 
"Ground Rules," Lewis Houser and his son Nathan steal Nathan's little brother 
from Lewis' ex-wife Alta, hiding in the back yard, snatching the baby, and 
crossing the "line into the sweet, big grain belt of Kansas." Kansas is also a 
character in several stories, a place where "the sky veers suddenly into your 
path, deep and unavoidable."

 THE EVOLUTION MAN or How I Ate My Father by Roy Lewis (Pantheon: $18; 214 pp.) 
It's the chilly end of the Pleistocene, and our hero is Ernest, the eldest son 
in an upwardly mobile, modern stone-age family.Edward, the father, pushes the 
family to evolve, bringing fire down from the mountain and his brood down from 
the trees, a step which Uncle Vanya greets with contempt: "You'll be extinct, 
the whole pack of you, in no time. You've had it. Yah! I'm going back to the 
trees! You've overstepped the mark this time, Edward! That's what the 
brontosaurus did, too!" There's Wilbur, excellent at flint-napping from an 
early age; Oswald, the great hunter; Alexander, the artist and discoverer of 
cave-painting; William, the youngest, with a penchant for domesticating 
animals; Mother, who discovers cooked meat and who, like every ape-woman, 
"wants a decent place in which to bring up her family . . . basically this 
means a cave'; various aunts and uncles, and our narrator, who basically means 
well but is the first to tire of his father's prodding, and to exhibit Oedipal 
symptoms. It's the beginning of the end, artfully told and laugh-out-loud 
funny. "The Evolution Man" has been out of print for several decades, and we're 
glad it's come down from the trees.

 PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION by D.M. Thomas (Scribners: $22; 278 pp.) Thomas has 
a wonderful way of presenting his characters from the inside out; not just on 
the analyst's couch, but flayed and gutted.It takes at least 10 genteel pages 
of dialogue before we realize that the backdrop to this novel is Auschwitz, and 
that these characters spend their days doing unspeakable things, so that their 
dream-lives, without the insult of every-day normalcy, seem quite logical. A 
young Jewish inmate with a rudimentary knowledge of Freudian theory treats an 
S.S. officer for severe headaches and nightmares. Civilized and normal battle 
it out with perverse and sadistic, in this and just about every human 
interaction in the book. But the perverse and sadistic triumph over history, 
bubbling up in the lives of these people, their friends and relatives, five 
decades later, in the second half of the novel, set in London. The backdrop for 
these modern lives are the paintings of Edvard Munch, "Madonna," 'The Lonely 
One," 'Puberty," Embracing Couple, and "The Scream." Weaving around these 
paintings characters hurt and betray each other and are haunted in their 
different ways by the Holocaust. As in "The White Hotel," Thomas' images of sex 
and death leap from the flood undammed by Freud and Jung and Hitler.

 A LITERARY FEAST edited by Lilly Golden (Atlantic: $23; 273 pp.) It's such a 
wonderful genre, food writing, one of the few in which the more tangents the 
writer takes, the better.Usually when writers write about memorable meals, it's 
with a deep, calm pleasure, and I like to think it brings out a generosity, a 
luxuriousness, just as eating that fine meal did for the tight-lipped 
townspeople in Isak Dinesen's "Babette's Feast" (included here). Some of the 
writers in this collection are the real pros: M.F.K. Fisher, Peter Mayle, and 
cher maitre, A.J. Liebling. Others are the creators of famous meals in 
literature: Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. One cannot help 
but notice three recurring variables: money (having it or not having it -- both 
of which can contribute to good eating), appetite (as a metaphor for living 
life), and Paris, which, in geography or memory, is never very far away.

FOCUS; THE BUZZ ON COFFEE TALK; TASTER'S CHOICE GIMMICK OF A CONTINUING 
COMMERCIAL WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we last left off, the couple looked out at the Eiffel Tower in their 
Paris hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun sets, he marvels at the view, and the cup of coffee he's drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that all?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 They kiss, and the screen fades to black. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the folks at Taster's Choice left viewers hanging. That was six 
months ago, a lifetime in an era of short-attention spans. For more than three 
years, the couple's coy romance has tantalized viewers, even if it means 
waiting longer than a week to find out what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cluttered world of TV spots, these serialized commercials are a rarity. 
But with a touch of innuendo and romance, Taster's Choice has made it work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing is, even though people don't know it is coming on the air, 
they are just as caught up in it as they would be a soap opera or a regular 
program," says Heidi Noorany, product manager at Nestle, which owns Taster's 
Choice. "People are bombarded with media messages, so this was definitely very 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Taster's Choice have climbed 10% since the first spot. In the last 18 
months, the company got 1,500 letters. And 15,000 people entered a contest last 
summer in which they suggested what should happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest spot will debut on "Mad About You" this week. The only clue that 
Nestle will offer: The romance takes an unexpected turn, one that will allow 
the story line to continue for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans to stop it," Noorany says. "We'll go on as long as the 
public likes it." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, played by British actors Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan, first 
debuted in Great Britain in 1987 to advertise Nescafe Gold Blend, a similar 
instant coffee. They became such a sensation there that a book was published, 
and plans were once in the works for a movie based on the couple. So 
McCann-Erickson, Nestle's advertising agency, sought similar success in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "We didn't know it would go beyond the first episode" in the United 
States, Noorany says. "But we were immediately inundated with calls from 
viewers, wondering what would happen next." 
</P>
<P>
 The chemistry has worked so well that many viewers assumed the couple were 
married in real life. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both have extremely happy home lives of our own," Head says. "But there is 
a spark I see on camera that you don't notice on the set. It's quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Both actors have appeared on talk shows, and with only five minutes, 25 
seconds of air time so far, they're instantly recognized on the street. One 
amused man handed Maughan a jar of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will come up to me and say, 'You're the woman!' " says Maughan, who 
lives in Los Angeles with her husband, actor Trevor Eve. "I'll go into a 
supermarket and people will direct me right to the coffee aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads also helped them gain roles in movies and on stage. Maughan had a 
supporting role in "Another Stakeout" last summer, and has directed stage plays 
on visits back to London. Head, who lives in London, appears in the upcoming 
Showtime movie "Royce," with Jim Belushi. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercials have done so well because there is a heightened expectancy," 
Head says. "But then you think 'looking forward to an ad?' It's ridiculous. 
It's a commercial. But it is very successful marketing, and it's not overkill." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the product gets lost in the story. A narrator invites consumers to 
"Savor the sophisticated taste of Taster's Choice." The couple often take a sip 
of coffee. In the most recent spot, the woman meets the man on the streets of 
Paris, and almost immediately hands him a jar. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was laundry detergent they were passing, it probably wouldn't work, 
Noorany says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that when people drink coffee, it is often on a date, when they 
are talking in a conversation," she says. "It really plays a role in getting to 
know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been few copycats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are things that are very hard to carry off," says Steve Rabosky, 
creative director at Chiat/Day Inc. Advertising, responsible for the Energizer 
bunny campaign. "People don't normally watch a commercial for a plot." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's a matter of matching the right product with the right story 
line. The latest Energizer ads borrow from the great movie cliffhangers, 
featuring evil villains and Western heroes (including the Lone Ranger), special 
effects and monsters, providing plenty of comic foils for the bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I approached the production like a movie," says Frank Oz, the famed Muppeteer 
who directed the spots. "There is that feel to it, but the challenge is that 
you have to do it all within a matter of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 In one spot, which debuted in November, the executives of the fictitious 
Supervolt Batteries plot to destroy the bunny. The Supervolt chairman, with 
pointy eyebrows, shows King Kong a sign that reads "bunny equals banana," and 
gets the famous movie beast ready to crush the bunny. Then, "To be continued" 
flashes on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you watch a commercial and don't remember the product," Rabosky 
says. "But here, the bunny is central to the premise. It's a no-brainer for the 
consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Taster's Choice ads, the audience need only wait within the same 
commercial break to find out what happens next: King Kong climbs up the Empire 
State Building, trying to catch the bunny at top. But Kong is stopped when a 
femme fatale shuts a window on his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, the bunny keeps going and going and going ...

NO HOME ON THE RANGE; VIRGIN OF THE RODEO, BY SARAH BIRD (DOUBLEDAY: $21; 342 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pam Houston, Pam Houston is the author of a short story collection, Cowboys 
Are My Weakness (Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Sarah Bird's third novel, "Virgin of the Rodeo," 29-year-old Sonja Getz 
leaves her home and the oppressive adorability of her German mother to search 
the Texas rodeo scene for her father, an Apache trick roper by the name of Gray 
Wolf, who didn't stick around long enough to see the day Sonja was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonja quickly finds an accomplice, another trick roper named Prairie James. 
He's a down-and-out alcoholic has-been with a heart of gold. Once at the top of 
the trick roping circuit, Prairie now finds himself the practitioner of an art 
form that is no longer appreciated, and he moves from town to town, picking up 
whatever scraps the evil rodeo boss, Casey Dakota, will throw his way, filling 
in for cancelled acts at the rodeo equivalent of Off-Off-Broadway, little known 
events put on by cowboys and cowgirls several times removed from rodeo's 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 What is wonderful about "Virgin of the Rodeo" are these unconventional rodeos: 
the all-black rodeo in Jordan, Tx.; the National Woman's Finals Rodeo; the 
Gallup Intertribal Rodeo and Fair. In the scenes that take place at these 
rodeos, Bird allows us to see a side of Texan counterculture few of us knew 
existed, and these bronc riders and steer ropers put on a much better party 
than their white male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the characters we meet at those rodeos are: Tuffy Branch, the 
red-headed, hot-tempered female bull rider with her dirty house full of 
illegitimate children; Jackson, the soft-spoken alligator wrestler from 
Florida; and even Tracy Daines, the All-World champion cowgirl with the prissy 
straight-brimmed hat, who doesn't want the cowboys to think she's stronger than 
they are. All Bird's secondary characters are sharply drawn, authentic and well 
rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Sonja Getz and Prairie James. At 
least not for the first several chapters of the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonja (who changes her name to Son in the first chapter, a name she says is 
more "Horzo" -- robust and elemental) is a large young woman and unpopular, a 
social outcast who has lived with her mother way too long and who uses a 
graduate-school, English-department vocabulary to defend herself against 
America's "idiotic standards of beauty imposed upon us by a cosmetics industry 
bent on transforming women into powdered puppets." Her rantings are funny at 
first, but eventually tiresome; and Bird doesn't take enough of an emotional 
risk with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie James is even less sympathetic than Sonja, and, at the novel's 
opening, even more of a cliche. And by the time I have listened to him 
fantasize about prostitutes on three continents, by the time I have watched him 
fart, belch, spit up, pass out and masturbate, the inevitable question arises: 
Why am I being forced to read about this man? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about halfway through, Bird's approach to her two main characters 
changes. During a scene in which Tuffy Branch's daughter Boots gets injured -- 
the novel springs back to life every time Tuffy comes onto the page -- Bird 
manages to humanize Sonja and Prairie quickly and effectively. In the space of 
a few pages they transform from caricature to character, and from that point on 
the book rolls forward with humor and suspense and a kind of "Monkey Wrench 
Gang" rompishness that makes it eventually (in spite of what I would 
characterize as a too sweetly uncomplicated ending) an entertaining read. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ending is only a symptom of the problem at the center of the book 
which is that Sonja has a real-life dilemma: she's obsessed with her father, a 
man she has never laid eyes on, and she uses her obsession as an excuse for 
everything that's wrong with her life. By treating this subject as lightly as 
she does, Bird misses an opportunity to investigate some rich and complicated 
territoy. She's chosen to write a kind of bastard daughter's madcap adventure, 
which would have been more satisfying if we'd gotten a little further into the 
daughter's -- and perhaps even the father's -- head. 
</P>
<P>
 If the subject were saving the planet from the industrial machine, or keeping 
the free world safe from a tyrannical dictator, or fighting the elements in 
hopes of securing the world's biggest emerald, then I would be happy with the 
novel's tone and its resolution. I wouldn't miss, so much, the dark and 
complicated emotional honeycomb that I believe goes with the territory of 
daughters abandoned by their fathers, I wouldn't need to feel the impossiblity 
of resolution that occurs when father and daughter, for the first time, come 
face to face. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is strange and refreshing to simply laugh at a subject that so often 
confounds and depresses me. I have a feeling that if Sarah Bird were here she'd 
say I was being way too serious. And perhaps she would be right.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In George Lucas' ingeniously structured 1973 American Graffiti (KTLA Sunday at 
6 p.m.), we get the romance of rock 'n' roll and the sweet, painful humor of 
nostalgia on the last night of summer, 1962. The cast evokes a reverie all its 
own: Four ex-high school buddies -- Richard Dreyfuss as the brain, Paul Le Mat 
as the brawn, Ron Howard as the straight arrow and Charles Martin Smith as the 
wise guy -- unknowingly witness the end of an era. Co-starring Cindy Williams, 
Harrison Ford, Candy Clark and a mob of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Dreyfuss and Suzanne Somers (the girl in the classic white T-Bird), 
the old crowd assembled again in More American Graffiti (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m.) 
for actions that center on the New Year's Eves between 1964 and 1967. The 1979 
movie succeeds in showing a media-saturated generation, but what is disturbing 
is the trivialization of the '60s period, which has so much meaning to so many. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Eastwood's 1986 Heartbreak Ridge (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) has Eastwood 
playing to the comic hilt a crusty Marine sergeant leading some raw recruits in 
the invasion of Grenada; some wry commentary on modern war and warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1983 Mr. Mom (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.) finds a fired 
Michael Keaton becoming a house-husband when his wife (Teri Garr) lands a job. 
It's nothing special but was a big hit, thanks mainly to its stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Drop Dead Fred (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) has a great story idea -- a 
distraught young woman (Phoebe Cates) recovering the "imaginary friend" of her 
childhood who runs amok and creates endless chaos. Unfortunately, it lacks that 
certain wild dreaminess required to make fantasy or whimsy ignite on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1988 Hero and the Terror (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), Chuck Norris 
makes a determined effort to balance his martial-arts displays with serious 
acting, only to be tripped up by an underdeveloped script. He plays a crack 
L.A. cop whose lover (Brynn Thayer) is a psychiatrist who has treated him for 
recurring nightmares in the wake of a near-fatal encounter with a huge 
Neanderthal-like serial killer, who now has escaped from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dead (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) is an 1987 exquisite grace note to the 
career of the late John Huston. His final film is an impeccable adaptation of 
the James Joyce classic in which the elderly Morkan sisters' annual Feast of 
Epiphany party in their Dublin townhouse is an occasion for wit and liveliness 
-- and a bittersweet, collective reflection of life's losses.

 Like Dr. Doolittle before him, zookeeper Dan Winfield not only walks with the 
animals, he can talk with them too. You'll meet them all this week on The 
Mighty Jungle, a live-action family comedy premiering on the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan (Francis Guinan of "Eerie, Indiana"), his wife Susan (Charlene Fernetz) 
and their two children live in what seems like a normal suburban neighborhood. 
But an equatorial rain forest surrounds their home, part of an experiment that 
hopes to prove wild animals can live together in captivity without the 
restraints of cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan's menagerie consists of puppets, animatronics figures and real animals.

 Vinnie, a New York sewer born-and-bred crocodile, is an animatronics animal

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; THAT OLD-TIME RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By R. Daniel Foster

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in a pew at Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newhall, I find myself 
thinking in Latin. Odd, since I haven't been to Mass since I attended Holy 
Childhood Catholic Church in St. Paul, Minn., where I was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, out of curiosity, I am back at Mass and, seemingly, back in time. Queen 
of Angels, founded in 1983, ignores the sweeping, populist changes of Vatican 
II. Here, the priest faces the crucifix -- not the congregation -- the Mass is 
in Latin, confessions are heard only in the privacy of the confessional and 
women still cover their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new church is more like a social club," says Father Dominic Radecki, the 
church's pastor. "Confessions are more like psychology sessions now. We still 
view the Mass as a mystical, supernatural event where the real presence of God 
is felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other Southern California Catholic churches more or less share Radecki's 
philosophy. The Vatican and the L.A. archdiocese generally ignore the rebels, 
says Radecki. "They don't want to give us too much publicity," he says. "People 
might find out there's an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics come from as far as Bakersfield and San Diego to attend the church, 
with its congregation of 250. "Before Vatican II there were moral absolutes," 
says longtime parishioner Myrna Migala. "Now it's 'Let your conscience be your 
guide.' " Others are more blunt: "The teachings of Vatican II are like 
quicksand," says Dick Jamison. "I don't want to go to Hell because of them." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a heady morning. Driving back to Los Angeles, I consider Radecki's 
sermon, which covered the definitions of mortal and venial sins. I add up the 
numbers and discover I've committed three mortal and 17 venial sins since last 
Tuesday. I start to think in Latin again as the radio blasts R.E.M. One phrase 
repeats itself like a mantra: mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. R. Daniel 
Foster

 When thousands of fan letters start pouring in each week, what's a star to do? 
Contact a mail wrangler, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
 These businesses -- there are no more than 10 in Los Angeles -- are hired by 
studios and celebrities to field fan letters. Lots of fan letters. As many as 
2,000 a day at Canoga Park-based Mail Pros, which has seven people reading the 
mail. And Mail Mann of Sherman Oaks has six people scouring three or four bags 
of mail every morning. The wranglers respond with letters, postcards, glossies 
-- depending on what the star or studio wants and how much they are willing to 
spend.  
</P>
<P>
 Though neither company will identify specific clients, Mail Pros' Joyce 
Hoffner says her firm works with stars from "Melrose Place," "Baywatch" and 
"Days of Our Lives." "Marriage proposals, invitations to parties, bar mitzvahs, 
confirmations," says Hoffner, "we get everything." It's a rare letter that 
actually gets to the star, but, she adds, one with lots of personality might 
get a note recommending that the star read it. "Humorous mail," she says, "is 
always good." Lauren Lipton

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; THE FLAMENCO KING

<TEXT>
<P>
 If it hadn't been for Carmen Amaya and Roberto Amaral's mother, there would be 
a lot less flamenco in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaral was 14 when his mother took him to see Amaya, the legendary flamenco 
dancer, perform. "I couldn't take my eyes off her," he says. "I didn't 
understand what I was seeing, but I knew immediately that I wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 30 years and many trips to Spain later, Amaral is arguably the leading 
figure in Los Angeles' flamenco scene. His 9-year-old Fuego Flamenco is the 
oldest exclusively flamenco dance troupe in town. And at his Roberto Amaral 
Dance Studio in Van Nuys, a steady influx of students keeps the 
instructor/performer/choreographer on his shock-absorbent heels six days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he says, there are two flamenco clubs in town: El Cid restaurant, in 
Hollywood, and La Masia, in West Hollywood. "Flamenco was very popular here 
during the '50s and '60s. There were a lot of clubs and a lot of great artists 
coming through town. In the '70s, it started dying down. But since then, you've 
had movies like 'Carmen' and groups like the Gipsy Kings (who, Amaral says, 
play rumbas, a slightly different form of music), as well as the Olympics and 
Expo in Spain to revive interest." Not to mention the flamenco-flavored records 
of popular New Age guitarist Ottmar Liebert. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaral, who is of Brazilian and Mexican descent, has had little formal 
flamenco training. He began studying it at 15, spending two years learning the 
basics at a local school. After high school, he went to Spain and "experienced 
the real thing for the first time." Amaral says he learned "the spirit of 
flamenco on the spot" as an itinerant dancer with various companies in Spain 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I begin with a very pure form of flamenco," he says of his 
choreography. "From there, I create and expand, and that's what makes it a 
personal statement." Martin Booe

A COMMITMENT TO CHANGE THE WORLD; NO PLACE LIKE UTOPIA: MODERN ARCHITECTURE AND 
THE COMPANY WE KEPT, BY PETER BLAKE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $27.50; 384 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elizabeth Hawes, Elizabeth Hawes is the author of New York, New York: How 
the Apartment House Transformed the Life of the City. (Knopf) She writes 
frequently on the arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Blake is one of the truth-tellers of modern architecture. As the titles 
of his last books indicate -- "God's Own Junkyard," and "Form Follows Fiasco" 
-- he has never attempted to disguise his distress at the deterioration of the 
American landscape. Now, in a personal memoir, Blake revisits the early 
idealistic days of his profession and recalls the colleagues who shaped the 
modern movement. His title, "No Place Like Utopia: Modern Architecture and the 
Company We Kept," speaks of his pride, his passion and his sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Blake is not only a candid memoirist but a well-connected one; 
for half a century he sat in medias res in modern architecture. Born in Germany 
in the 1920s, transplanted to London and then New York in the 1930s, 
apprenticed to Serge Chermayeff and later Louis Kahn, appointed the curator of 
the department of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art at a time when that 
place was the world's center for the visual arts, editor of the publication 
Architectural Forum in its astonishing golden years, Blake sustained a long 
hybrid career as an architect, writer and editor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the postwar years, he traveled across the U.S. to survey the major cities; 
in the '50s, he designed international exhibits in West Berlin and Moscow 
(where Richard Nixon shook a political fist at Nikita Khruschev in the model 
kitchen); he built a first house on Long Island that opened up like a pinwheel 
to the sun and the sea. This retrospective is not about Blake's career, 
however, but about its context, and it is not driven by ego but by principle. 
"Those of us who decided, in those tense years before World War II, to become 
architects, knew what this meant," he says. "It was a commitment to help change 
the world, nothing less." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a heroic task, and these were heady times, which Blake captures in an 
easy and anecdotal continuum of people and places he knew: Mies van der Rohe, 
Marcel Breuer, Philip Johnson, Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen, Alvao Aalto, Paul 
Rudolph, Louis Kahn, Greenwich Village's Jumble Shop, where the new architects 
socialized with the new artists and the hangers-on, MOMA, one of the 
established outposts for the architectural avant-garde, Del Pezzo's restaurant 
on West 47th Street, with its own Round Table, the offices of the 
"Architectural Forum," the voice of new architecture and design; also New 
Canaan, Conn., where Breuer and Johnson built their own houses, and Amagansett, 
Long Island, where Le Corbusier painted and made sand castings on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake calls Le Corbusier Corbu, his Hungarian nickname, for they were all an 
intimate band of believers -- as clannish as the New York School painters or 
the radical writers, he says -- and he describes his contemporaries exactly as 
he saw them: Frank Lloyd Wright, "who lied like a trooper (and) would have been 
boring if he stuck to the facts; Kahn, a gentle, impractical dreamer before he 
was a master of poetic vision; Saarinen, "good at winning"; Johnson, 
outrageous, arrogant, cutting, bitchy, brilliant, "by far the most interesting 
and most knowledgeable commentator on the contemporary scene." Johnson pervades 
his text, much as he pervades this century; and his amazing glass house, which 
everyone of import in the arts came to visit, (and on which Saarinen once 
inscribed a letter with a cake of soap) still seems to represent the magic of 
the modern aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fervent and idealistic, the Modern Movement was not merely the new 
"international style" as MOMA had described it in its historic exhibition of 
1932, but improved housing and ideal cities like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse. 
And modern architecture, more than an art form or "walk-in sculpture," was the 
language of equality, democracy, social justice and, in the new postwar phrase, 
urban renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 If it looked different from the forms of the past, that was because 
mass-produced, industrial, modular building technology produced architecture 
that was "as neat and clean as a jet, as expressively articulated as a 
suspension bridge or a jeep or a stripped-down sports car, and as logically 
modular as a computer grid." Blake notes that "everything we saw about us in 
the modern world also seemed to fit in, neatly and often uncannily, with the 
Cubist vision of Picasso and Braque, with the spatial definitions created by 
Rietveld and Oud, with the exciting structures dreamed up by El Lissitzky and 
Leonidov. We had absolutely no doubt that we were on the right track. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the political and social upheaval of the 1960s; the publication in 
1963 of Jane Jacob's book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," which 
illustrated that "Life is really more interesting than Utopia," as Lewis 
Mumford put it and challenged the whole modern notion of urban design; and two 
years later, Robert Venturi's "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture," 
which argued the validity of popular imagery in architectural form, and 
effectively ushered in the Postmodern Modern. ("The Parthenon is a Duck," which 
meant that both the Parthenon in Athens and the Big Duck, a poultry store on 
Long Island, expressed their purpose with clarity and effective imagery, became 
a slogan of new times.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Postmodernism in the U.S. was simply the latest manifestation of that old 
American malaise: a vast inferiority complex in all matters cultural and 
historic," Blake concludes now. It was followed, in the '80s, by 
Deconstruction, "a style that favored unbuildable structures." Blake is still 
mystified at the loss of faith and ideals that resulted in the "corruption of 
modern architecture", disdainful of "name architects" who design buildings as 
sales gimmicks or private jokes and sorrowful that architecture is once again 
elitist. "There is no need for despair just yet," he says. "But it is a close 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 "No Place Like Utopia" is one architect's manifesto -- informed, opinionated 
and impassioned. It is also a chronicle of the century, of the vision in the 
'20s and '30s, of the explosion of energy in the '40s and '50s, and the 
disillusion and dissolution of the '60s, '70s and '80s, and it is rich with 
stories that reflect the culture. There is a touch of magic realism in the fact 
that Marcel Breuer found the inspiration for the tubular steel chairs that 
marked the beginning of modern furniture in the handlebars of his milkman's 
bicycle, and a cosmic truth in the fact that activists such as Hans Knoll and 
Eero Saarinen died young. That the publisher Henry Luce and the art dealer 
Betty Parson and the painter Jackson Pollock figure into Blake's story of 
modern architecture speaks to the overlapping, interlocking nature of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In one particularly fervent passage, Blake suggests that Pollock's work was 
more closely related to the work of poets like Whitman, writers like Kerouac 
and architects like Wright than to the painters he professed to admire. 
Sometimes "No Place Like Utopia" reads like an allegory, but in the end, it 
stands as its own significant saga.

A BREATHTAKING WORLD; THE BROTHERS, BY FREDERICK BARTHELME (VIKING; $21; 262 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Shields, David Shields is the author of the novels Dead Languages and 
Heroes and a collection of linked stories, A Handbook for Drowning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is often said, with some justification, that most novelists have, finally, 
only one story to tell and that, in book after book, they ring endless changes 
on a single essential narrative. Over the last 10 years, Frederick Barthelme 
has been exploring -- with escalating precision, wit and emotional power -- the 
same material (marriage, divorce, middle-aged male ennui), the same territory 
(Southern suburbia) and similar characters (over-educated protagonists in 
dead-end jobs and their wry, weary wives, ex-wives and sassy young girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Barthelme's new novel, "The Brothers," his seventh book, is told from the 
astringent point-of-view of Del Tribute, who moves from Houston "to Biloxi 
because he'd been given a condominium, outright, by his ex-wife's rich father, 
a going-away present. It was less than a month since the divorce papers were 
final." When he arrives in Biloxi, Del discovers that his brother, Bud, has 
left to pursue an exceedingly vague "movie thing" in Los Angeles. Waiting for 
the tenant of his condominium to move out, Del stays with and comes perilously 
close to falling in love with Bud's wife, Margaret.

 The real romance of the novel, though, is between Del, a 44-year-old stereo 
salesman, and Jen, a 24-year-old exhibitionist and satirist who surfs Compuserv 
for mordant wire service stories for "Blood & Slime Weekly," her one-page 
"Hi-Speed Terrorzine" that she posts around town. Jen is a wonderfully spirited 
and funny character. In her combination of youth, beauty, sensuality and 
intelligence she sometimes seems a little too perfect, less a person than a 
fantasy figure: "She was a soldier in no army, bought no belief system but her 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bud returns from Los Angeles, he and Del and Margaret and even Jen make 
much ado throughout the rest of the novel about Del's earlier flirtation with 
Margaret. This proves to be something of a MacGuffin, as the issue is never 
really explored or resolved but instead only sporadically reiterated, and "The 
Brothers" is not best read as a thoroughgoing examination of a relationship 
between two brothers. To the extent that this book is about sibling rivalry, 
though, it defines that rivalry in starkly Darwinian terms: Del's ascent is 
Bud's descent. The final image of the book is of Bud, gone slightly mad, 
"swinging left and right, rocking back and forth, his sheet-wrapped head 
bobbing like an enormous Q-Tip against the little black sky." 
</P>
<P>
 As Del says toward the end of the book, speaking to Jen about the weird wire 
service articles she culls but referring indirectly to the novel's apparent 
aesthetic: "There isn't any story. It's not the story. It's just this 
breathtaking world, that's the point. It's like the story's not important -- 
what's important is the way the world looks. That's what makes you feel the 
stuff. That's what puts you there." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel's true subject is Del's attempt to reclaim his presence in the world 
by seeing it as breathtaking, as beautiful. In the opening paragraph, "(i)t'd 
quit raining, and the sunlight was glittery as he crossed the bridge over the 
bay, but his fellow travelers didn't seem to notice the light." When Del and 
Jen are at the Singing River Mall, "Del thought it was beautiful. 'Nobody 
really gets this,' he said. 'Nobody sees how gorgeous this is or knows why.' " 
At another point, Del says about storms that "(t)hey transform everything 
instantly. It's like suddenly you're in a different world and the junk of your 
life slides away and you're left with this rapture, this swoon of well-being 
and rightness. You get the world in its amazing balance." 
</P>
<P>
 This swoon of well-being and rightness -- the world in its amazing balance -- 
is what Barthelme's protagonists, from his debut story collection, "Moon 
Deluxe," to his most recent novel, "Natural Selection," have explicitly been 
seeking. Del, like the protagonist of Richard Ford's "The Sportswriter" -- to 
which this book bears a slight resemblance -- believes that he can be content 
if he can learn to skate lightly on the surface of things. When he waxes 
self-righteously philosophical, Jen, his instructor in the ineluctable modality 
of the visible, teases him back to reality: "Whoa. It's Deepman. Deepman in the 
window." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Del remains somewhat prone -- as do so many of Barthelme's 
protagonists -- to curmudgeonly media critiques and Rush Limbaugh-like pinnings 
for the way things once were and are supposed to be, the Jen-cure, in general, 
takes. The final two chapters offer an instructive contrast between Del and 
Bud. Bud defines his own mini-breakdown in terms of the fact that he can no 
longer respond to "the scent of (a woman) as she passes you in an aisle, the 
light trace of her skirt grazing your thigh, or her blouse on your forearm as 
you reach for a magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 For this reader, a passionate Barthelme fan, "The Brothers" lacks "Moon 
Deluxe's" verbal and psychic pyrotechnics, "Two Against One's" emotional rigor, 
"Natural Selection's" structural perfection. Here, the protagonist's yearnings 
are granted more than explored. Perhaps familiar chords are getting struck too 
routinely. Nevertheless, "The Brothers" offers the new and genuine pleasure of 
seeing a Barthelme protagonist tantalizingly close to celebrating the world. 
Never has the world, in a Barthelme novel, looked so lovely, more worth 
celebrating. By the end of the book, "(i)t was one of those nights when the air 
is like a glove exactly the shape of your body."

 THE HARPERCOLLINS WORLD ATLAS (HarperPerennial: $10; 136 pp., paperback 
original); THE 1994 INFORMATION PLEASE ALMANAC Otto Johnson, senior editor 
(Houghton Mifflin: $8.95; 1024 pp., illustrated, paperback original); THE 
UNIVERSAL ALMANAC 1994 John W. Wright, general editor (Andrews & McMeel: 
$12.95; 716 pp., illustrated, paperback original); THE WORLD ALMANAC AND BOOK 
OF FACTS 1994 Robert Famighetti, editor (World Almanac: $8.95; 976 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). Four reference books for readers seeking new 
information about the new world order during the new year.The "World Almanac" 
is the most comprehensive of the group, but the bleak, gray pages of facts in 
small type make it the least appealing visually. The less complete "Universal 
Almanac" feels more user-friendly: The bolder graphics and more open lay-outs 
look less intimidating. "Information Please" offers such pleasantly off-beat 
listings as a selection of obscure words that turn up in crossword puzzles. The 
constantly shifting political boundaries of the modern world must complicate 
life for atlas publishers. The new volume from HarperCollins features bright, 
up-to-date maps of a united Germany and a divided Soviet Union. Regrettably, 
the text reads like a high school geography paper, which renders the book less 
useful than many slightly dated competitors.

 FLORIDA STORIES: Tales From the Tropics edited John & Kirsten Miller 
(Chronicle: $10.95; 176 pp., paperback original). This erratic collection 
includes excerpts from factual and fictional works set in the Sunshine State. 
Joan Didion finds Miami as bleakly depressing as Los Angeles, while Isaac 
Bashevis Singer focuses on the city's superficiality: "A planned hedonism. But 
the boredom of the desert remained. No loud music could dispel it, no 
garishness wipe it out . . . the swampland refused to give way." Zora Neale 
Hurston recalls turn-of-the-century life in America's first incorporated black 
town; Dave Barry laboriously attempts to find humor in a visit to Disney World. 
Many of these selections will make Angelenos a little more appreciative of 
Southern California's mixed charms.

 SNAPSHOT POETICS: A Photographic Memoir of the Beat Era by Allen Ginsberg 
(Chronicle: $12.95; 95 pp.) . Ginsberg may not rank as a great photographer -- 
many of the pictures in this striking collection are little more than snapshots 
-- but he knows so many important literary figures intimately, he's able to 
capture them in vivid, revealing portraits. The young Jack Kerouac radiates the 
same energy as his prose, while the sepulchral visage of William S. Burroughs 
seems to crumble over the years, like a ruined temple. Equally striking is 
Ginsberg's own transformation from a skinny nerd in horn-rims to a Buddha-like 
figure, serenely contemplating his own image in a mirror.

 KLONDIKE PARK: From Seattle to Dawson City by Archie Satterfield (Fulcrum: 
$15.95; 196 pp., illustrated, paperback original). On August 16, 1896, four 
miners discovered gold in Bonanza Creek, precipitating a stampede of would-be 
prospectors into the Yukon Territory, a region geography and climate made 
virtually inaccessible. Satterfield guides the reader along the most popular 
trail, which ran from Seattle to Dawson City in the Klondike via Skagway and 
White Horse, peppering his account with colorful anecdotes. This entertaining 
history offers an introduction to the string of parks and preserves the U.S. 
and Canadian governments will open in August, 1997, along the historic route 
that lead a few to great wealth and many to great hardships.

 THE WINTER MURDER CASE by S.S. Van Dine (Otto Penzler/Macmillan: $6.95; 174 
pp.) . Originally published in 1939, but long out of print, "The Winter Murder 
Case" was the last Philo Vance mystery. As a detective, Vance resembles the 
suave Nick Charles, rather than the hard-boiled Sam Spade: He smokes Regie 
cigarettes and seems at home in the posh household of the millionaire-emerald 
collector Carrington Rexxon. "Winter Murder" remains a diverting yarn, 55 years 
after its initial appearance, and aspiring crime writers should study Van 
Dine's no-nonsense afterward, "Twenty Rules For Writing Detective Stories."

SPECIALTY BESTSELLERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was thrilled to see an African-American bestseller list. As a visitor from 
New York City, I was glad to see the Times acknowledge the cultural diversity 
of Los Angeles readers. As previous letter writers have stated, we are all 
Americans, but I might add that our cultural differences add spice to the 
"melting pot." 
</P>
<P>
 In future, you might have a Latino section. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it quite interesting that some of your obviously white readers were 
offended by the small amount of print given to the African-American section. 
It's a pity that they should be so insecure. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRISTOPHER DAVIS, NEW YORK CITY 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: The African-American bestseller list we reprinted Nov. 28 was 
produced, as we explained at the bottom of the list, by an organization called 
Blackboard African-American Bestsellers in cooperation with the American 
Booksellers Assn. Blackboard polls African-American specialty bookstores 
nationwide to produce a monthly list. We intend to reprint various bestseller 
lists that reflect specialties of the book market (children's books, science 
fiction, Christian, audio, etc.) on an occasional basis, and would entertain 
suggestions for other interesting lists. WARS JUST DON'T 'HAPPEN' 
</P>
<P>
 Tell John Balzar ("Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War," Book 
Review, Oct. 17) that wars don't "happen." They are not earthquakes or 
hurricanes. They are man-made disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 TANJA WINTER, LA JOLLA A WAR ON WORDS 
</P>
<P>
 The mutilation of language continues. John Balzar reviewing "Crusade: The 
Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War" parrots the Bush 
propaganda-rationalization regarding the "combat-hardened fourth largest army 
in the world." As Bush did, Balzar omits mentioning how that colossal menace 
had attempted for eight long years to overrun its neighbor Iran, and had failed 
to get past the border. Wow! "Hitler!" "Goliath!" "Awesome military might!" 
Hooey. 
</P>
<P>
 What is inexcusable is the continued misuse of the word war to describe 
(dignify?) what was undeniably a massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Both language and reason were mutilated for that exercise of "the arrogance of 
power" -- Bush's infamous "I had no choice" being a ludicrous but chilling 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 If author Rick Atkinson and reviewer Balzar were to witness Mike Tyson 
smashing Pee Wee Herman into a bloody, mangled pulp, would they refer to what 
they saw as a fight ? 
</P>
<P>
 No. When Balzar uses the phrase "lopsided conflict" he moves closer to the 
truth. But he assures us, "Still, it was war." Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians who misuse language, whether by carelessness or intent, distort the 
reality of events. Unfortunately, the distortion eventually becomes "history." 
</P>
<P>
 Any who persist in referring to that massacre as a war, or who regard 
Schwarzkopf as admirable, surely must yearn for the spectacle of a man killing 
ants with a sledgehammer. 
</P>

 JAMES B. KENNEDY, REDONDO BEACH MORE WAR 
</P>
<P>
 Re William Broyles, Jr.'s excellent review of "A History of Warfare" (Dec. 
19), to quote Bill Mauldin, erstwhile satirist and cartoonist of WWII: "In war 
there's two groups, there's them that's been shot at and them that ain't." 
</P>
<P>
 KEITH R. MATZINGER, CAMARILLO A NOSE FOR PROSE 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for the best line in the Los Angeles Times Book Review in years, to 
whit: "Clio smells." So did the novel, and so did the review of Susannah 
Moore's "Sleeping Beauties" (Nov. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 LEONORA HOLDER de AVILA, LONG BEACH A FAIR TO REMEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 The review of "World of Fairs" (Nov. 14) meant nostalgia time for me, but one 
element was missing, namely any reference to World War II. Ever since the war I 
have considered it peculiar that so many nations contributed to the 
make-believe of the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940, while they were gearing 
up for war or hiding their heads in the sand -- whichever applied. And in 
particular, the review omits mention that the fair ran a second year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, in the daytime, the fair was like the Los Angeles County Fair 
multiplied a thousand times. After the sun went down, the lights of the 
beautiful Belgian building reminded one that Belgium itself was in hiatus. Oh, 
the Germans were not there on the streets, but their specter hung over the 
grounds, to be sure. So the nostalgia is bittersweet.

 Ethnic diversity isn't just a fact of life, it's a fashion theme for spring. 
These days, Eurocentric clothing pales in comparison to the lively wardrobes of 
the global village. When designers showed their Spring '94 collections 
recently, worldly influences were the rule rather than the exception. Walking 
down the runways of Milan, Paris and New York were ideas seemingly collected 
from the ends of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Complice's Caribbean cruise line was an extravagant spread of calypso blouses, 
reggae T-shirts, tropical prints and turbans. Krizia's China-watching led to 
white pantsuits with frog closures and jumpsuits worn with fieldworker jackets 
in smoky provincial prints. After decades of dreary Mao suits, the Chinese 
might be their own best customers when these stylish clothes cross their 
borders. (Anne Klein has an in-store shop in Shenzhen; Fred Hayman plans a 
boutique within Ed Finkelstein's second American Place store, opening this 
month in Guangzhou. And Esprit and Benetton are making inroads in China as 
well.) 
</P>
<P>
 While some designers chose to be purists, others went for cross-cultural 
looks. Jean-Paul Gaultier's punk-Hare Krishna collection, for example, mixed 
saris, Chinese-calligraphy-print leggings, combat boots and nose rings. Ralph 
Lauren brought together American, British, Dutch and Vietnamese fashion 
classics: His models wore T-shirts, military apparel, clogs, sarongs and 
rice-paddy straw hats. 
</P>
<P>
 For the runway, of course, designers always push ideas to the extreme. In the 
real world, women understandably want to tone it down. So a rib-knit sweater 
and long, madras sarong might be tame enough for weekend afternoons. A big 
white shirt with frog fasteners would look more Asian when topped by a cropped 
silk vest or more familiar when teamed with a pair of black leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 The season's smartest ensembles, however, drew from several looks at once, 
testing the audience's knowledge of world geography, military history, native 
costume and the nightclub scene. If fashion is a game, this season we're 
playing Jeopardy.

 With its sugar-white walls, arched windows and chopped parapets, this Silver 
Lake house might look right at home in Morocco. But its zany mosque-style dome 
and minarets give it away as the kind of revival folly popular in 1920s Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 John Copeland, who bought the place in 1989, was drawn to its Old California 
spirit and its elements of Islamic design. Indoor and outdoor rooms flow 
together like the patterns in a Persian rug, offering privacy and freedom. 
Wishbone doorways frame sweeping views, and French doors flood the house with 
natural light. 
</P>
<P>
 Having acquired the house in a dilapidated state, Copeland, executive director 
of the Virginia Robinson Gardens in Beverly Hills, has meticulously restored 
tiled walls and beamed ceilings. He has also added tile to fireplaces and 
kitchen cabinets, and hand-painted decorative borders around doors and at the 
base of stairways. 
</P>
<P>
 To furnish his ornate aerie, Copeland began with his collection of vintage 
California pottery. Over time, he has added flea-market finds, such as inlaid 
Moroccan tables and old Persian and Turkish rugs, which he restores himself. 
"Character, age and history are very important to me," he says. "Even with all 
the humor of this house, it harks back to the reign of centuries-old Islamic 
architecture. That's an inspiration in itself." SUSAN HEEGER

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES.: PLAYING THE WRONG TUNE; 
MIRAMAX'S HEAVY-HANDED MARKETING OF NO. 1 (SORTA) 'PIANO' HAS CRITICS STEAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If a little movie company can claim to have rewritten the book on how to make 
a mountain out of an art-house picture, it's Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, it was so successful in creating a buzz over "The Crying Game," 
"Enchanted April" and "Passion Fish" that the independent distributor actually 
garnered more Oscar nominations for its pictures than any major Hollywood 
studio. (The company has since been acquired by Disney.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Miramax's marketing practices (which a handful of other studios have also 
appropriated) are starting to irritate many of the very same people who've long 
championed its releases and helped make them hits -- the critics. And the movie 
in question is "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day following the announcement of the New York Film Critics Circle 
awards, Miramax's ad for "The Piano" in the New York Times ran with a headline 
"Winner! Best Picture" followed in tiny type and in parentheses by "runner up." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Fine, president of the 27-member New York critics group and critic 
for Gannett Suburban Newspapers, called Miramax and complained. Miramax, he 
said, ran similar misleading ads the previous year with "The Crying Game" and 
no one commented, but this year, many of the New York critics decided that they 
wanted to make the distributor aware its advertising practice wasn't 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York critics had in fact awarded "Schindler's List" its award for best 
picture of 1993, though it did give top awards to "The Piano" in the actress, 
director and screenplay categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax changed the "Piano" ad the following week by removing references to 
the New York film critics altogether, but leaving an accolade for "best 
picture" -- again with "(runner up)" in small type -- from the Los Angeles Film 
Critics, which also gave "Schindler's List" its top prize and also acknowledged 
publicly that "The Piano" had received the second highest number of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Sheehan, president of the L.A. group and critic for the Orange County 
Register, said he had been unaware of the ads until someone at Universal 
Pictures, the producers of Steven Spielberg's Holocaust movie "Schindler's 
List," called to complain to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan said he then called Miramax and asked that its ads be not so 
misleading. The L.A. critics had given New Zealand director Jane Campion's 
movie five awards: director, actress and screenplay and ties for first place in 
the best supporting actress and cinematography categories.  
</P>
<P>
 "This prize mongering is unseemly," he said. "(Miramax) has a good picture, 
it's got plenty of awards . . . this gimme, gimme, gimme stuff reflects poorly, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent ad says "Best Picture, L.A. Film Critics Assn. (runner up)" -- 
omitting the word "winner." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Miramax said, "After hearing that Universal was unhapy 
with the ads, we voluntarily changed the ads and deleted the word 'winner' and 
called the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics to let them know. . . . We 
note, however, that other film companies, including TriStar, New Line/Fine Line 
and Savoy continue to use the word 'winner' and the New York Film Critics 
Circle runner-up status in their ads." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, just as Miramax was coming under fire for its practices, other 
studios were jumping on their advertising bandwagon. Fine Line Features, 
distributors of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," for example, is using the 
technique. (Sheehan says it has gone even further -- by inventing a new 
category, "best adapted screenplay," an award the group does not have.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Deutchman, president of Fine Line, acknowledged that his company 
intentionally ripped off Miramax's idea, which he admitted was unseemly but 
effective, but had not received any complaining phone calls from critics -- 
yet. "If anybody asks us to stop, we'll be glad to," he said.

 An Islamic house doesn't always come equipped with a classic garden paradise, 
as John Copeland found when he purchased his exotic hideaway. In fact, instead 
of the water-cooled Edens favored by the Persians, his own outdoor rooms were 
initially barren and dark.Immediately, he went to work on the courtyard, laying 
tiles, planting shade greens and building that arid-world necessity, a bubbling 
fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, after dismantling a makeshift gazebo that had been erected on a 
balcony, Copeland designed two plein-air salons: The first, where the gazebo 
once stood, is a viewing terrace with a carpet, chairs and two flower-filled 
pots. The second, more of an outdoor conservatory, features a lush container 
garden, a dining table, a wall fountain, layers of rugs and a panoramic city 
vista edged with borrowed palms and Italian cypresses. His little palace, after 
all, has finally come into its paradise. SUSAN HEEGER

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE ODD COUPLING; GRUMPY 
GEEZERS VS. CANTANKEROUS COOTS

 Movies whose stories focus on senior citizens are rare -- so it seems doubly 
shocking that Warner Bros. decided to release two of them within a week of each 
other during the highly competitive Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just any two films about the Social Security set: Both "Wrestling 
Ernest Hemingway" (which opened in limited release on Dec. 17, to go wider in 
January) and "Grumpy Old Men" (opened wide on Christmas) center on a pair of 
older men working out issues of friendship, aging and loneliness. Both feature 
Oscar winners and nominees in their casts: Robert Duvall and Richard Harris in 
"Wrestling"; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in "Grumpy." Both "Grumpy," which 
is on 1,200 screens, and "Wrestling," which is on only three, averaged more 
than $3,000 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? Warner Bros.' marketing executives declined to be interviewed for 
this story. But the films' directors have a few ideas -- and neither seems 
upset about the timing.  
</P>
<P>
 "They saw them as two completely different movies," says Randa Haines, who 
directed "Wrestling." "They really have nothing in common in terms of story." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Petrie, director of "Grumpy Old Men," says: "Frankly, I was nervous. 
But Warner Bros. convinced me that they would get very different releases. 
They're saying, 'Here's a Christmas movie with a wide release and here's 
another, more dramatic, more substantial film with a more limited release that 
will break bigger in January or February at Oscar time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Haines consciously made a film that treated the elderly in a manner that broke 
with recent film conventions: "So often, you see older people used as an easy 
joke, as though they've crossed a boundary and become a different kind of human 
being. That's not true. We don't talk down to or make fun of these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise, Petrie says, is not that both films are coming out at the same 
time but that both films got made at all. "I was afraid that, because they were 
making hers, they would scrap 'Grumpy Old Men,' " Petrie admits. "I don't know, 
if I was a studio head, if I'd take the risk. (But) from a demographic and 
marketing point of view, statistically, the over-50 set doesn't go to the 
movies. Films targeted at an older audience are a harder sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Observes Haines: "Maybe it's a good sign that they don't think they can only 
make one old-person movie, the way they say, 'We can only have one woman's 
movie.' There's always an appetite for a movie like this, that people tell each 
other about." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the studio hopes," Petrie says, "is that people will say, 'Hey, 
I liked 'Wrestling Ernest Hemingway'; let's go see 'Grumpy Old Men.' They hope 
the films will complement each other -- rather than cancel each other out."

 In Italy, I can go back to the same restaurant or trattoria two, three, even 
10 years later and expect to find the same waiter, the same cooks and the very 
same menu at the same time of year. Here, restaurants change -- their names, 
their owners, their cuisines -- virtually overnight. Chefs change places as 
fast as in a game of musical chairs, and everything seems to be in season year 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, when Piero Selvaggio opened a second restaurant on Pico Boulevard, 
this consummate Italian restaurateur had a startling idea: deconstruct the 
sacrosanct Italian sequence of courses and zero in on the most interesting 
part, the primi , or first courses. In the early days at Primi, $25 bought a 
series of 10 little dishes orchestrated to change with the season and the 
whimsy of the chef. This was high-class grazing, Italo-Los Angeles style. And a 
meal at Primi resembled an album of vivid snapshots collected from all of 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, Primi is different. The menu has reverted to a more 
traditional format. Now you can order from a menu that reads antipasto, primi 
-- and yes, secondi or main courses, some very substantial ones, I might add, 
like the lamb alla cacciatora braised with a red-wine reduction or the 
succulent falling-off-the-bones osso buco served in a rough-textured sauce with 
soft pillows of gnocchi on the side. But it also offers a particular American 
flexibility in picking and choosing your way through the menu. In Italy, you 
might have to work up the courage to insist on no main course. Here, I assure 
you, the waiter is not going to raise an eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because at Primi, the casual sidekick to his more formal restaurant, 
Valentino, Selvaggio encourages his customers to eat exactly what they want to 
eat. And after the thrill of Primi's initial premise wore off, what they wanted 
more than a parade of brilliant, small tastes was sophisticated trattoria 
cooking, traditional dishes "revisited," along with a few surprises from the 
talented young chef Enrico Glaudo thrown into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 If you feel like a classic insalata caprese of tender mozzarella, fresh tomato 
and basil leaves followed by a bowl of the deep and seductively flavored 
brodetto of baby octopus -- no meat, no dessert -- no problem. Or if you want 
grilled chicken or shrimp on top of a Caesar salad or some other such 
concoction, the cooks may groan, but they'll do it. Risotto made without 
butter? That's for the very brave to request. (Such an idea cuts a northern 
Italian chef to the quick.) 
</P>
<P>
 When you order pasta at Primi now, instead of four or five exotically stuffed 
tortellini or ravioli, you get an entire plate of hand-pleated green and white 
farfalle or dusky garganelli infused with squid ink, perfectly cooked and 
sauced. The pasta special one night, penne sauced with mascarpone, peas and 
shreds of prosciutto, doesn't sound exciting, but it was faultlessly executed 
and immensely satisfying. I had just about despaired of finding pasta in this 
country treated with such respect and simplicity.  
</P>
<P>
 At lunchtime, it can be hard to get a table because the restaurant functions 
as the de facto commissary for the 20th Century Fox studio down the road. 
Everyone arrives in a rush at 1 p.m. Manager Donato Poto seems to know every 
other party and whether they prefer the main dining room or the garden room. 
The first offers a mirrored ceiling (beware, those of the artfully concealed 
thinning hair) and a view of the cooks at work behind a wooden sculpture the 
staff has dubbed " osso buco " for its resemblance to a veal shank. The garden 
room somehow manages to be considered hip despite its resemblance to a parking 
lot set with tables and partially covered with a quilted cloth roof.  
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, every other table seems to be splitting the straightforward Caesar 
salad of torn romaine tossed in a pungent, balanced dressing. But grilled 
scallops on a bed of salad drizzled with olive oil would make more sense with 
darker, more assertive greens. The soup of beans, barley and corn tastes as if 
it was hastily assembled, the flavors barely developed. 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes evident that few people actually order more than one course when 
the waiter clears away everything after our primi . There is a long gap before 
our main entrees come; the kitchen is overwhelmed with orders. When the 
old-fashioned lasagna with Bolognese sauce arrives, it is gummy and overcooked, 
but the handmade ravioli stuffed with porcini and tossed with a lightly 
fragrant tomato-and-basil sauce is quite wonderful. And the thick, grilled tuna 
steak in a sauce flecked with tomato and hot pepper is accompanied by chewy 
grains of couscous, a reference to the Arabic influence in Sicilian cuisine.  
</P>
<P>
 The real virtues of the restaurant's Italian cooking are best appreciated at 
dinner, when the pace is less frenetic, the lights are dimmed and the 
atmosphere is relaxed and informal. Each of my evening meals has been 
beautifully paced and we've ended up lingering for hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the best dishes on the dinner menu are the antipasto of duckling 
crespella , a tender crepe filled with sumptuous duck meat and glazed with 
sweet and sharp Cremona mustard, and the warm branzino (sea bass) carpaccio in 
a creamy light tomato sauce studded with corn. The rustic soup of bitter 
chicory stirred into a rough puree of vegetables and fava beans is terrific.  
</P>
<P>
 A couple of times, we had the time -- and the appetite -- for the secondi : an 
enormous platter of shrimp and scampi cooked in their shells (heads on) in 
brandy sauce and a breaded pork chop in a boldly tart lemon sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The taste of the food is so authentic that it's easy to see why Italian 
winemakers on tour head straight for Primi, where they know they'll finally get 
some food that really tastes like home. Having eaten my way through most of the 
menu at Primi, I feel the same way. Piero Selvaggio and Enrico Glaudo have won 
my heart -- my Italian heart -- and next time I won't even open the menu; I 
will ask the chef to make whatever he wants. 
</P>

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Piero Selvaggio has a passion for wine like few restaurateurs in the country. 
The 10-page Primi wine menu, a little brother of that found at Valentino, has 
more than 100 wines featuring a number of tiny producers found only at 
Selvaggio-owned restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the list offers 12 wines in half bottles and five by the glass, 
all excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 What I like best about this list, though, is Selvaggio's first page, listing 
18 wines that he terms "best buys." There are some superb values, such as 1991 
Clos du Val Chardonnay at $25 and 1982 Mondavi Cabernet at $34. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a creation as this gives the diner tremendous flexibility, permitting 
purchase of a glass of 1992 Tiefenbrunner Pinot Grigio, $4.50; a half bottle of 
Mumm Cordon Rouge Champagne, $19; a bottle of 1990 Spottswoode Sauvignon Blanc, 
$22, and a half bottle of 1987 Beaulieu Vineyard Private Reserve Cabernet, $20. 
</P>
<P>
 I ran into Piero the other day and asked him about a red wine at Primi that I 
hadn't heard of but that seemed too good to be true (unfortunately, it has 
since been removed from the list): 1971 Paradiso from Enologica Valtellinese, 
priced at $25. Piero just shrugged and said it was a nice, older wine. Then he 
smiled slyly and said, "But that's on the next-to-last page. I hope you didn't 
miss what's on the last page." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to an imposing list of Italian reds, including famed wines 
from Solaia, Ornellaia, Tignanello, Ca' del Bosco and a dozen more. And no, I 
didn't miss it. Dan Berger

ON THE RECORD: A LISTENER SEARCHING FOR THE REAL TCHAIKOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some comments in a recent "On the Record," incidentally remarking on 
Tchaikovsky's predilection for "whining" in his later, best-known symphonies, 
seem to have struck a nerve among readers, one asking why I so "hated" 
Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hate involved. Rather, the hardly unique feeling of having had 
enough of music that has been omnipresent for so long. This writer's comments 
were, however, based more on remembered reactions than current experience. In 
other words, it was time to go back for some more listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were predictable to a degree, led by the feeling that the last 
three symphonies had outstayed their welcome and should be, if not put to 
pasture, given a long rest. At the same time, there was the growing feeling 
that the first three symphonies, although gaining in popularity -- and getting 
the respect from conductors that has long eluded these works -- remain 
undervalued, if no longer under-recorded. No whining, screaming or 
breast-beating in the lot. Rather, a degree of lyric freshness and simplicity 
unduplicated in the later, darker creations. 
</P>
<P>
 The total going was made more than interesting by the arrival of a new set of 
the Tchaikovsky six, with various shorter works, from Yuri Temirkanov and the 
Royal Philharmonic (RCA Victor 61821, six CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 We could wish that Temirkanov's other orchestra, the more idiomatically 
attuned St. Petersburg Philharmonic, had been employed. But Temirkanov does get 
the Londoners to play his way, a Russian way, with use of expressive string 
slides and a good deal more vibrato and rubato than is fashionable in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Temirkanov's tempos are on the slow side, but never lacking a strong rhythmic 
pulse. Thus, there's always a feeling of motion, even thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow movements tend to be more lingered over, with a wealth of expressive 
detail exposed than is common among less experienced -- perhaps less 
affectionate -- practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, and obviously this is a broad generalization, these readings are 
marked by shapeliness and emotional balance, but not to the exclusion of heat, 
as in the finale of the Fourth, or in the penultimate movement of the 
"Pathetique," which has great cumulative power. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most conductors, Temirkanov leads the first three symphonies with 
breadth and lyric grace, e.g., the adagio of the exquisite No. 1 ("Winter 
Dreams") is surely one of the slowest recorded but rhythmically so firm that 
only the clock makes one aware of the time elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riccardo Muti's reissued (as EMI 67742, 5 CDs, mid-price) set of the six 
numbered symphonies and "Manfred" first appeared in the 1970s, when it created 
quite a stir for its swiftness, lean sonorities and lack of sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Muti was out to clean up Tchaikovsky's act by banishing the bathos usually 
overemphasized in Nos. 4, 5 and 6. Noble idea, but taken to such extremes that 
the scores' innate weightiness and pathos were eliminated, to their detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Tchaikovsky filtered through a neoclassical sensibility that regards 
textural clarity and rhythmic momentum as end-alls: an approach so much at odds 
with the music that much of it emerges more thin than detailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Muti's orchestra, the Philharmonia of London, is a more virtuosic one than 
Temirkanov's RPO. But the latter has the right spirit -- and the right 
conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 For an approach similar to Muti's, but not taken to its extremes, try the 
budget-priced set of the six from Lorin Maazel and the Vienna Philharmonic on 
only four CDs (London 430 787). 
</P>
<P>
 Of more esoteric interest is a re-release of Tchaikovsky's ur -"Romeo and 
Juliet" of 1869, less coherent and certainly less memorably schmaltzy than the 
popular final product of a decade later. But the coupling (on Chandos 9191) is 
a valuable rarity: Tchaikovsky's incidental music, as well as the reasonably 
familiar overture, to an 1876 French-language production of "Hamlet" that never 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces effectively evoke the moods of the various scenes for which they 
were intended, and there are some particularly sensitive pages for Ophelia 
(soprano Janis Kelly). 
</P>
<P>
 The lively, handsomely recorded performance is by the London Symphony 
conducted by Geoffrey Simon.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: CHAIRMAN OF THE CHARTS

 It's pretty safe to say now that Frank Sinatra's "Duets" -- No. 2 on The 
Times' Southern California pop album chart -- is no flash-in-the-pan. Lately we 
haven't heard a peep out of those detractors who initially insisted the album, 
a Top 10 staple for nearly two months, would plummet after a few weeks' 
success. D.R.S.'s "Gangsta Lean" continues its stranglehold on the top spot on 
the pop singles' chart. And whoomp! Here it is again -- Tag Team's single 
"Whoomp! (There It Is)" is climbing the pop chart once more, moving from No. 12 
to No. 8. Nationally it's No. 3. Will it ever stop selling? TOP 10 ALBUMS

 AND ONE MORE THING: Of all the holiday promotional items spotted by Pop Eye, 
from key rings to sweat pants, our favorite was a CD-sized booklet from Warner 
Bros. Records. The title: "Holiday Favorites: Recipes from the Family of Warner 
Bros.Records Recording Artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The delicacies range from Madonna's "Krispy Marshmallow Treats" (which 
suspiciously resembles a recipe usually published on a certain cereal box) and 
Biz Markie's tuna casserole -- in which you can use either butter or Cheese 
Whiz -- to a very involved "Enchiladas de Los Lobos" and "Vegetarian Moussaka" 
by k.d. lang (identified as a "Grammy-winning vocalist and vegetable 
enthusiast"). 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's "Lou Reed's X-Mas Recipe": 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to Carnegie Deli and order a hot pastrami sandwich with full sour 
pickles."

 RAW NERVE: Nirvana's public wars of words have generally involved high-profile 
opponents -- notably Axl Rose and Eddie Vedder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest involves just the kind of folks the band usually supports: 
fellow Seattle rockers Tad. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Nirvana invited Tad to open nine West Coast shows on its current 
tour, including last week's San Diego and Los Angeles dates.

 But then Tad, the ex-butcher who is lead singer in the band named after 
himself, said something unflattering about Courtney Love -- the wife of 
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain -- to the English pop press. 
</P>
<P>
 Bye-bye Tad. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the matter, a publicist for Tad's record company, Giant Records, 
said that Tad's girlfriend and Love "don't get along." 
</P>
<P>
 "Other things contributed, it wasn't solely that," says a Nirvana spokeswoman. 
"But that was the straw that broke the camel's back. You just can't say mean 
things about someone's wife." STEVE HOCHMAN

POP EYE: A FALLEN IDOL, BAD MEAT LOAF, LIVE COMPUTERS: BACK INTO 1993'S HELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More negative words may have been written about Billy Idol's "Cyberpunk" album 
than copies of it were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 So it should be no shock that the collection, which only made it to No. 48 
before rapidly falling off the charts last summer, was voted the worst release 
of '93 in Pop Eye's annual survey to nominate the year's most annoying or 
simply bad works. To obtain a cross-section of industry opinion, Pop Eye turned 
to nearly two dozen managers, record company employees and critics from Los 
Angeles to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that was written about the usually good-natured rocker during 1993, 
Idol himself said it best in an interview:  
</P>
<P>
 "(David) Bowie said he's always battling with his mediocrity. Christ, if he's 
battling with it, what do you think I'm doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Idol, though, was just a step ahead of Meat Loaf, whose "Bat Out of Hell II" 
shot him back from oblivion, but also earned him a special place in our own pop 
Hades. 
</P>
<P>
 Third place in the survey went to English doomsters Depeche Mode, who are 
currently selling a "live" album whose song list is the same as its last studio 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the band's music is mostly computer-driven, that means its devoted 
fans are essentially paying $15 to hear crowd noise -- the only real difference 
between the "live" and studio versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some voter comments on other, um, winners: 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Sinatra et al.'s "Duets": "That's a joke . 'Duets'? You have to be in 
the same room to duet." 
</P>
<P>
 * Billy Ray Cyrus' "This Won't Be the Last," which almost didn't make the list 
because many voters seemed to have forgotten completely about it: "Wow! People 
forgot about him already. That's almost a point in his favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, this marks the last appearance on this list of perennial 
favorites Michael Bolton and Mariah Carey, who will now be "retired" to the 
Easy Targets Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worst of '93: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Billy Idol, "Cyperpunk." 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Meat Loaf, "Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Depeche Mode, "Songs of Faith and Devotion -- Live." 
</P>
<P>
 (tie) Carnie & Wendy Wilson, "Hey, Santa!" 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Michael Bolton, "The One Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 (tie) Mariah Carey, "Music Box." 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Frank Sinatra, "Duets." 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Lenny Kravitz, "Are You Gonna Go My Way." 
</P>
<P>
 (tie) Paul McCartney, "Off the Ground." 
</P>
<P>
 (tie) Billy Ray Cyrus, "This Won't Be the Last." Steve Hochman

STREISAND AND THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In last Sunday's Film Clips roundup of the year's notable quotes, Chris 
Willman repeated a quote attributed to Barbra Streisand by Spy magazine, in 
reference to celebrities invited to the White House: "Why Sharon Stone? She 
doesn't know anything about policy." Our item prompted the following response:  
</P>
<P>
 The quote which Chris Willman attributed to me in his Sunday article was false 
and ridiculous. But what really offended me was that the Los Angeles Times 
would stoop to quoting Spy magazine as its source without seeking to verify 
such an offensive statement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that pales against your paper's tabloid-like presentation of the 
allegations against the President of the United States.

SENSE, DOLLARS AND ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "A Matter of Sense, Not Dollars," commentary by Times art critic 
Christopher Knight (Dec. 19): 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's extraordinary polemic affirming the importance of John McLaughlin as 
the "first, major, postwar Modern artist to have emerged in Southern 
California" is well-taken. 
</P>
<P>
 How many California artists of that era are represented by works in the 
collections of some 35 top museums, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, 
Art Institute of Chicago, Baltimore Museum of Art, Corcoran Art Gallery, 
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of 
Modern Art, National Museum of American Art and Whitney Museum of American Art? 
</P>
<P>
 I would dispute Knight's statement that "there is no place in the world . . . 
to see a full, representative display" of McLaughlin's art. The Kawamura 
Museum, near Tokyo, has a very fine, carefully assembled collection of nine 
paintings, including a rare diptych, and 13 lithographs. Of course, this fact 
serves only to emphasize a central point of Knight's article: that our region 
does not sufficiently attend to its own cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 A photo caption printed with the article (surely written by an editor, not by 
Knight) claims, "No major exhibition of (McLaughlin's) work has been compiled." 
Before his death in 1976, McLaughlin retrospectives were mounted by several 
museums around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Art Museum will present the first posthumous retrospective of 
McLaughlin's paintings, which I am organizing, from next Oct. 28 to Jan. 15, 
1995, after which a version of the show will travel to art museums in 
Baltimore, Newark, N.J., and Oakland. At the same time, we will publish the 
first major book on the work of this very important artist from Southern 
California.

<P>
 It's not about money. It's about politics, party-line politics. Since Knight 
arrived on the L.A. art scene, he has been actively engaged in devaluing most 
Abstract art. He has been the champion of a politically strident art that has 
been responsible for alienating what was a blossoming art audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight states that "the art scene is a complex ecology" and that "artists and 
their work stand at its center." It's my impression that some critics, and this 
critic in particular, have placed themselves in the center of that art scene 
and allow access only to those artists who share their political agendas. It is 
no wonder that L.A. collectors are a little jumpy about what is being 
represented as viable artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 That Knight would ask for a major exhibition of John McLaughlin's work is a 
non sequitur, on par with Bill Clinton talking about family values. It's true 
that McLaughlin deserves a major retrospective, but God help us if Knight 
writes that exhibition catalogue.

<P>
 I guess I'm one of those Knight likes to refer to as an anti-intellectual. In 
order for that to be the case, however, the art Knight coos and oohs about must 
therefore be "intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
 Pray, educate me as to the intellectual depths of a painting with a broad 
swath of one color, a narrow stroke of another and a third, broad swath of yet 
a different color. Sorry, pal, I just don't see it, and I refuse to pretend 
that I do in order to avoid being called names by various art critics so 
divorced from reality-realism that they couldn't see the forest for the trees 
in a Magritte. 
</P>
<P>
 I clearly lack the cranial might of your Mr. Knight. What he sees as profound, 
I can only see as empty interior decoration. Perhaps Blake should have 
continued his famous poem: "And see the most profound thought possible, in a 
big minimalistic blotch of blue." I don't think even that great visionary could 
have quite managed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berlin Wall has fallen, and soon the razor-wire walls of "Modern art" will 
likewise tumble, allowing the illumination to be cast upon works that convey 
pith and moment and, yes, even beauty, without the need for an intermediary to 
try to justify the validity of some simple-minded paint spattering or idiotic 
installation. So much of the world of Modern art is empty of true intellect 
that its very airiness will solidify its ultimate ephemerality. 
</P>
<P>
 So enough, already! Be gone, you dandified purveyors of intellectual fraud. 
You emperors of Modern hucksterism. Oh, and while you're leaving, put some 
clothes on!

<P>
 Bravo, Mr. Knight, for having the guts to stand up and say what needs to be 
said. But while you were flailing that shotgun about, perhaps you should have 
leveled a blast or two at the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists are also members of the art audience and public, and as such should 
not escape their fair share of the responsibility for the condition of this Los 
Angeles art world. For years artists have allowed the politics of fear to 
create a plantation-style mentality that dominates the consciousness of the art 
community. This scenario allows for a few house artists who must fearfully 
guard their places against the onslaught of field artists. If you want to eat 
at the Art table, you must be one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Van Cliburn piano competition, two of the judges wanted to 
establish that they did not view the competitors as entertainers. This point 
was extremely important to them. I see the pervading influence of Hollywood as 
the main progenitor of this entertainment idea. Artists now routinely accept 
that they are entertainers, just like all the other entertainers crowding an 
already far overcrowded entertainment world. This idea forces artists into a 
shuck-and-jive life that produces lurid, bombastic, political works or, in the 
opposite direction, works of repressed, quiet, brittle beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 This needs to be noticed, that this now self-induced need to be entertaining 
has lowered the standards we should be measuring ourselves against, creating a 
situation where blunt literalness is expected, poetic exploration lost. 
</P>
<P>
 We expect bureaucrats and the audience to move with the herd instinct. We wish 
artists wouldn't.

 I am grateful to The Times and critic Knight for his piece on the dearth of 
vision and leadership with respect to Southern California artists. At last a 
forthright, thorough and credible expose of both attitudes and institutions 
failing their responsibilities to the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, I would like to expand his critique of the Cultural Affairs 
Department. Under Director Al Nodal, the department has reflected Bolshevik 
tendencies, transforming itself at best into a social service agency and at 
worst into a pork barrel for City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 After being created through the largest-ever political effort by the L.A. arts 
community, the department reshaped itself into an agency that disrespects and 
mistrusts that community. The department now emphasizes art concerned with 
social issues or directly involving an "underserved" constituency, not art 
based on merit. 
</P>
<P>
 This policy in theory benefits the community as a whole by requiring artists 
to consider the needs of the audience. More accurately it reflects a 
devaluation of what artists now produce. Nodal's restrictions perpetuate the 
stereotype that art is elitist, indulgent and irrelevant. They also buy the 
discredited notion that government can engineer good art. 
</P>
<P>
 As Knight says, the L.A. arts community -- probably the nation's largest -- 
indeed produces thoughtful, exciting, diverse artwork, often toured and 
exhibited around the nation and abroad. It is time that the Cultural Affairs 
Department had the leadership to match this community achievement. We need a 
leader who will make the political case for arts dollars, who will fund artwork 
on the basis of merit and who understands that quality art will do what he now 
is trying to forcibly engineer.

<P>
 Knight's commentary put the stifling expectations placed on L.A. artists into 
the proper context by drawing a link to the lack of institutional, governmental 
and public self-confidence from which this city continues to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciated even more his analysis of American anti-intellectualism and of 
the muddled logic that surrounds specificity in art. Knight is a critic of 
perspective and depth, with the rare ability to spot the real issues and 
discuss them with creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always admired Knight's critiques of what is kitsch and delusive, but 
this time I was really dancing.

WITH AN EYE ON ... ; BILL BELLAMY TAKES HIS CHARM TO THE EDGE ON 'MTV JAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Bellamy has a way of looking into the camera and addressing just you . It 
doesn't matter if he's introducing the latest Salt N' Pepa video or 
interviewing Janet Jackson. There's something about the way he laughs, moves 
and makes eye contact that tells you you've been singled out of the Generation 
X audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTV veejay's flirtatious manner isn't reserved just for the camera, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy likes to turn the tables on a caller bantering by phone from New York 
about what he calls his "fun and quick" rise as the host of the rap-video show 
"MTV Jams." "Do you dance?" the bachelor asks, reminding a reporter that he's 
going to be in L.A. in a few weeks. Yet, the 26-year-old Bellamy seems to know 
just how much to turn up -- or down -- the charm. 
</P>
<P>
 He's even more attuned when he's on the air. Unlike many of his fellow 
comedians, the New Jersey native veers away from graphic sexual material, 
opting instead for what he calls "a lot of topical stuff, observational stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make people see the lighter side of things," says Bellamy, who 
started out as a stand-up comedian. "Most stuff in life is so serious. Life can 
be so boring, that just going to work, getting by, raising kids can be very 
dull. I just bring out the fun part of what people do that we don't realize." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy starting looking for the "fun part" of life when his economics and 
marketing classes at Rutgers University became a bit dull. Doing stand-up in 
local clubs added some spice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason I got into it was because my friends were always telling me 
I was funny," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His first stand-up stint was in a college sorority "male beauty pageant," 
which paved the way for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured when I graduated I was going to work on Wall Street," he recalls. 
"That was the picture I had. A sweet job at a good firm and work my way up." 
</P>
<P>
 But as he "got addicted" to comedy he entered every competition that came his 
way and performed at any club that would put him on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 An appearance on the first "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam" in 1992 was his 
biggest break, followed by a spot on the "15th Annual HBO Young Comedians 
Show." Then came a role in the rap-oriented movie "Who's the Man?," where he 
was spotted by an MTV exec. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy makes his MTV audition sound easy: "It was like, 'He can read the 
teleprompter! We love him!' " 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that his much-repeated MTV interview in June with Janet 
Jackson and her dancers, who writhed around him suggestively, got a lot of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened," he says of the interview. "The chemistry was just right." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy's hoping that the chemistry will be right with his new "MTV Jams 
Live," which bows this month. He's found that being front and center isn't too 
hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV Jams" airs daily from 10 a.m. to noon and Sundays from 2 to 3 p.m. on 
MTV.

RETRO; THE LAW AND BARRY; AMOS BURKE IS BACK -- THIS TIME ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You know something?," Gene Barry says. "It's just like riding a bike." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1963 to 1965, Barry starred in the popular ABC detective series "Burke's 
Law" as Amos Burke, the Los Angeles chief of detectives who just happened to be 
a millionaire. Suave, intelligent and handsome, Burke would report to the scene 
of the crime in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three decades after "Burke's Law" went to syndication heaven, it's back 
as a new limited CBS series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm the chief of homicide," says Barry, relaxing this sunny afternoon in 
the family room of his friendly Beverly Hills home. "I still have the old car 
-- we found one the same year (1963) and it looks great -- and a better house." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke also has a detective son, played by Peter Barton of "The Young and the 
Restless" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of having a sidekick or a young detective with me all the time, I 
have a son," Barry says. "Thirty years ago, Burke wasn't married, but he got 
married and lost his wife." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burke fils lives in a garage apartment at his father's mansion. "He's 
totally opposite," Barry says. "Where I dress in nice suits, he'll dress like 
from the Gap or something. I drive around in the Rolls Royce and he drives a 
Jeep." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry had been looking to revive "Burke's Law" for a number of years, but all 
the deals fell apart. "CBS was always interested," he says. It was producer 
Aaron Spelling, who was a producer on the original series, who finally made the 
new series a reality. "He always loved the show," Barry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Barry had no interest in doing a TV series 30 years ago. From 1958 
to 1961, he starred in the NBC Western "Bat Masterson" as the dandy lawman. 
After it was canceled, Barry was eager to do features. He had come out from the 
New York stage in the early '50s and appeared in such films as "War of the 
Worlds," "China Gate" and "Soldier of Fortune" before doing TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his agent asked him to read the "Burke's Law" pilot script. But Barry 
didn't want to be tempted. "I said: 'No. I don't want to play television. I 
want to go forward.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Barry had earlier turned down the role of Dr. Richard Kimble in "The 
Fugitive." "I said to (creator) Roy Huggins, 'If you want to do a one-shot, I 
would be happy to do it,' " Barry recalls. "But to play this character every I 
week, I would be afraid of that character, that it would stamp me in the wrong 
kind of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he read the "Burke's Law" pilot and loved it. "That's how I got 
involved," Barry says. Over the years, Spelling has called Barry to do weekly 
series, including "Dynasty." But Barry turned down the long-running prime-time 
soap to star on Broadway in the Tony Award-winning musical "La Cage Aux 
Folles." "I may not have gotten rich," Barry says, "but it was a wonderful 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry's discovered it's been easy to get back into Amos Burke's shoes. "The 
character stays with you," he says. "You find that as you get older, you add 
new elements, richer elements. When I look back at some of the things I did, I 
didn't like them. I did comedy and maybe I reached too far. I know what's more 
tasteful, and bringing the son into it makes it much richer." 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that Barry's eldest son, Michael, is involved in the new series. 
The two wrote a script about a murder which takes place at a Hollywood roast. 
"This is one of the five we are shooting," Barry says proudly. "We were 
flattered that they loved our idea. It's one heck of a script." 
</P>
<P>
 "Burke's Law" airs Fridays at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 Many "Another World" fans were upset when Anna Holbrook left the show in 1991 
after her character, Sharlene Frame Hudson, was presumed dead in a boat 
explosion. Well, Holbrook fans, the actress is returning to "Another World" in 
the new role of Kate Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new story line, Kate arrives in Bay City with two children: a teen-age 
boy, Jess, and a younger girl, Wendy. Everything about Kate will be mysterious. 
Since Kate obviously will look like Sharlene, her arrival will no doubt be 
quite a shock to Sharlene's former husband, John Hudson (David Forsyth), who is 
raising their son, Gregory. John, who has since married Kelsey Harrison 
(Kaitlin Hopkins), was always there for Sharlene, who suffered from 
multiple-personality disorder (her bad-seed side was Sharly). 
</P>
<P>
 Between her stints on "Another World," Holbrook was seen on "One Life to Live" 
as Lindsay Butler, and was a guest on the prime-time series "Law & Order." She 
worked with Nick Nolte in the film "I Love Trouble" and appeared in 
off-Broadway theatrical productions of "The Dolphin Position," "Blue Plains" 
and "Mr. Parnell."

 Victoria Rowell, Drucilla Winters on "The Young and the Restless," is one lady 
who was filled with the Christmas spirit. She spent the early weeks of December 
preparing for the holiday season by making pomander balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they're oranges covered with cloves," explains Rowell, who has 
been making this unique brand of ornament for the past few years. "It's become 
a tradition. Afterwords, I wrap them up in paper, put them in boxes, and send 
them out as gifts to all the special people in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tradition that runs in Rowell's family is collecting Christmas tree 
ornaments. "Every year, my daughter Maya and I go and pick out a beautiful, 
fresh tree," she says. "Then we stop at a store to find a new ornament. We've 
got tons of them!"

 ABC casting consultant Mari Lyn Henry will be conducting a national search 
seeking new talent for roles on "Loving," "All My Children," "One Life to Live" 
and "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry will travel around the country in search of African American, Asian, 
Hispanic and Native American actors as well as performers with disabilities. 
"What I hope to do is to establish a presence in the major regional-theater 
areas; discover talent pools, including minorities, put the most prepared and 
talented performers on tape, and bring them back to New York to be seen by the 
producers, casting directors and network executives for daytime programming at 
ABC," says Henry.

SAFETY EXPERT SEEKS ANSWERS TO 'HUMAN ERROR' IN PLANE CRASHES; AVIATION: 
PSYCHOLOGIST'S CAREER DEVOTED TO LEARNING WHY SMART PEOPLE -- PILOTS, 
MECHANICS, CONTROLLERS -- DO STUPID THINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 People are prone to mistakes -- we leave our headlights on when we park the 
car, we forget to turn off the oven -- and the consequences are mostly minor. 
But for an airline pilot, forgetting to lower the landing gear can be a deadly 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 If to err is human, can humans ever be completely safe in the air? 
</P>
<P>
 John Lauber thinks so. He sees human error as the last frontier in aviation 
safety, waiting to be conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauber, a psychologist, has devoted his career to learning why smart pilots -- 
and mechanics and air traffic controllers -- do stupid things. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the National Transportation Safety Board since 1985, he leads 
efforts to use that knowledge to compensate for human weakness, whether by 
designing better cockpits or adding backup safety systems. 
</P>
<P>
 From his office at the safety board, Lauber, 51, likes to watch planes float 
down toward the runway at Washington National Airport, just across the river. 
He expects them to land safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds of being killed on a U.S. commercial jet are about one in 11 million 
flights," Lauber said. But that's not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 His is a higher goal: eliminating all plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the jet engine has improved, computers do wonders, but there's 
still the human factor. Since worldwide record-keeping began in 1959, almost 
two-thirds of major airline accidents have been blamed on flight crew error. 
</P>
<P>
 "We virtually never have 'act of God' accidents, caused by forces somehow 
beyond reasonable control," Lauber said. "They are all controllable, manageable 
things we're learning how to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 29, 1972: An Eastern Air Lines jet plunges into the Florida Everglades, 
killing 99 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew was distracted by a burned-out light on the instrument panel. As they 
tried to change the light bulb, the altitude hold on the auto pilot was 
accidentally shut off. The plane began to drop, but the pilot and co-pilot 
didn't notice until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all concerned with this little 59-cent light bulb," Lauber said. 
"They forgot to fly the airplane, and they crashed into the swamp." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, "human factors" study was in its infancy. Lauber was working on 
pilot training for the U.S. Navy, about to move to NASA's Ames Research Center 
near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That crash was still seared in his mind when he arrived at the space 
administration. "That really triggered what we looked at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauber led a research team that put airline crews -- a pilot, co-pilot and 
flight engineer -- in flight simulators for a series of mock emergencies. The 
way they worked together -- or didn't -- was revealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them really worked as a cohesive team," Lauber said. "Others were 
just a shambles, a three-ring circus with nobody knowing what anybody else in 
the group was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers created a portrait of a successful flight team: a strong leader, 
good communication, clear priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 And they discovered problems that made some cockpit crews dangerous: lack of 
discipline, crew members overloaded with duties, co-pilots too intimidated to 
tell the captain when something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists, carrying NASA's clout, presented their findings to the airline 
industry at an international seminar in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until '79 there was no concrete scientific evidence that this was a major 
problem," said Clay Foushee, a former Ames researcher, now vice president of 
flight operations for Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scientific evidence corresponded with people's gut feeling," Foushee 
said. "It was a tremendous 'Aha!' in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Training methods that grew out of the Ames research -- called Crew Resource 
Management -- are now used by almost all airlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same training ideas have spread to ships and operating rooms and even 
into space, Lauber said, "beyond my wildest imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 But human error marches on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 16, 1987: A Northwest Airlines jet crashes on takeoff from Detroit. One 
child survives -- the other 154 people aboard die, plus two on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, Lauber arrives with a crew of investigators who will look for 
clues in the charred debris on the runway. It is a bitter duty he shares with 
four other board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first impression is always one of just overwhelming destruction," Lauber 
said. "The first reaction is horror." 
</P>
<P>
 From wreckage, the investigators piece together the story of each accident -- 
whether a plane crash, train wreck or pipeline explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board then rules on the cause and makes recommendations to federal 
regulators in hopes of preventing future disasters. The NTSB has no enforcement 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, the cockpit voice recorder helped tell a classic story of flight 
crew error: The captain and co-captain forgot to set the plane's wing flaps 
because they didn't follow a required safety checklist before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the safety board called for improved pilot training. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time, years ago, when the board saw the 'human factors' idea as 
excuses for incompetence and such," said John Enders, vice chairman of the 
Flight Safety Foundation. "Without it, you could never tackle the real root of 
many accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 July 19, 1989: Engine failure renders a United Airlines DC-10 virtually 
uncontrollable, forcing a crash landing at Sioux City, Iowa. Although 112 
people die, 185 miraculously survive -- and the crew members become heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot lost control when an explosion in the jet's tail engine severed the 
hydraulic system, but the crew worked together to wrestle the plummeting plane 
toward the nearest airport. 
</P>
<P>
 They talked, they disagreed, but working as a team they gained crude control 
of the jet. The safety board said it was a testament to the crew's 
NASA-inspired training. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lauber it was proof: "We are making a difference."

KODIAK ISLAND BEARS PITCH IN FOR ALASKA'S SALMON SEASON; FISHING: THE CITY OF 
KODIAK IS HOME TO THE NATION'S SECOND-LARGEST COMMERCIAL FISHING PORT, WITH 
3,000 VESSELS REGISTERED THERE. AND THE CARNIVORES DO THEIR PART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from National Geographic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like bull-riding cowboys waiting for the chute to bang open, 90 skippers 
jockey for positions and rein in the engines of their fishing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tick of 9 p.m., an official's red flare shoots across the Alaska sky, 
opening the sockeye salmon season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pandemonium roils the water. The salmon must be thunderstruck. Throttles roar 
and clouds of black diesel smoke belch as the big boats maneuver and their 
attendant skiffs race to circle seine nets around those precious fish, worth 
about $7 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "no-holds-barred fishing, Kodiak style," John L. Eliot wrote in 
National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
 Waves smash into one boat intentionally beached by its skipper, angling to net 
fish running close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, "in the wheelhouse of Jack Christiansen's Desiree C., I hung on as the 
stern of the Sea Star -- it was easy to read -- cut close across Jack's bow," 
Eliot wrote. "He never blinked." 
</P>
<P>
 The frenzied harvest continued for four days, until Alaska Fish and Game 
authorities called a halt to assess the strength of the salmon run. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodiak Island, sitting in the Kodiak archipelago 250 miles southwest of 
Anchorage, is one of nature's great treasure houses. On Kodiak, nearly everyone 
fishes, including the island's famous huge brown bears. 
</P>
<P>
 In a good year, Eliot wrote, more than a million Pacific salmon come plowing 
up Kodiak's Ayakulik River: chinook, coho, pink, chum and steelhead, as well as 
sockeye. 
</P>
<P>
 The river teems also with thousands of rainbow and Dolly Varden trout. And the 
Ayakulik is only one of about 400 rivers and streams on Kodiak. Offshore swim 
herring and halibut; farther out, pollock and cod. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a land of spellbinding contrasts -- from coastal wetlands to ice-sculpted 
4,000-foot mountains. Fingers of the sea reach in; nowhere on Kodiak are you 
more than 15 miles from salt water. Rain drenches the island; days are overcast 
more than half the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roaming these islands, and ruling them, are some of Earth's largest carnivores 
-- Kodiak brown bears, perhaps 3,000 of them. Many are protected in a federal 
wildlife refuge that takes up two-thirds of the island's 3,620 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Males tower 10 feet and approach 1,500 pounds. They grow so big simply because 
Kodiak offers them so much to eat. The refuge has one of the world's highest 
bear densities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing this wilderness with bears and salmon are 16,000 humans. More than 
half live in the city of Kodiak and on the U.S. Coast Guard base. Many of the 
island's 2,200 Alutiiq, also known as Aleuts, live in six villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Desiree C.'s skipper is an Alutiiq living in Old Harbor, population 298. 
The village itself was all but wiped out in 1964 by tsunamis spawned by an 
undersea earthquake. The disaster killed 22 people and caused $45 million in 
damage throughout the archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen has recently gained a reputation as a "highliner," a top-dog 
fisherman who always makes the big haul. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, he had chugged 32 hours from Old Harbor and weathered a big 
storm in search of herring. By law he was allowed time enough for only a single 
set of his seine. Instantly his net was bursting with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," Christiansen said. "It took hours -- days 
-- before we knew how much we had." With more than a million fish, he broke the 
state tonnage record for a single herring set. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in Old Harbor dips a hook or sets a net, including the Rev. Sergios 
Gerken. His is the oldest Russian Orthodox community in the Western Hemisphere, 
dating from 1784. Russians established the first European settlement in Alaska 
not far from Old Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian control, which ended in 1867 with the U.S. purchase of the territory, 
left its mark. Many Alutiiq today roll their names with Slavic suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But other people downplay their Russian names and emphasize their native 
names to get government benefits," the priest said. "Welfare programs are 
killing this place, because they make it more convenient not to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Kodiak is home to the nation's second-largest commercial fishing 
port, as measured by quantity of fish caught. Three thousand vessels are 
registered there. The salmon harvest brings fishermen more than $40 million a 
year, the deep-water trawlers' catch of pollock and cod nearly as much. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in a wilderness paradise like Kodiak Island, conflicts simmer, Eliot 
wrote. The Fish and Wildlife Service is nervous that native landholdings 
threaten the bears within its refuge. And on Kodiak's sister island, Afognak, 
chain saws are ripping down great Sitka spruce forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do the Alutiiq have a stake in a federal wildlife refuge? The 1971 Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act, which established native corporations, requires 
that they select lands in the immediate vicinity of their villages. Some got 
land rich with oil and gas rights. But for the three native corporations on 
Kodiak, the requirement meant 330,000 acres within the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 They soon discovered that such land remains subject to the laws and 
regulations governing use and development of wildlife refuges. 
</P>
<P>
 For years Kodiak natives have been willing to sell this land back to the 
government for perhaps $200 million, Eliot wrote. Now these natives are 
threatening to develop their lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides sense that everyone would profit if the government bought back the 
land, Eliot wrote. They have looked for money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring a huge new source appeared. Nearly $1 billion in penalties was 
levied against the Exxon Corp. after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March, 1989. 
A large chunk may go to preserving lands in the Kodiak archipelago to 
compensate for spill damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people call that infamous oil spill an environmental disaster. But, Eliot 
says, it could end up paying significant dividends, if those funds can make 
Kodiak's refuge whole again and preserve what's left of Afognak's woodlands.

BEASTIES WITH JAWS THAT BITE, CLAWS THAT CATCH MAY BE ANGELS AT HEART; 
TASMANIAN DEVILS: THEY ARE "ENDEARING COWARDS," DESPITE THEIR FEROCIOUS 
REPUTATION, WILDLIFE BIOLOGIST SAYS. "WHEN I'M HANDLING THEM, THEY ALMOST 
FREEZE WITH FEAR, AND THEY'RE NOT AGGRESSIVE. . . . " 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD J. FREDERICK, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a munch, crunch and chilling gulp, a voracious Tasmanian devil devours a 
hunk of fresh road kill, a small kangaroo-like wallaby. 
</P>
<P>
 The devil shrieks when another devil tries to share the feast. With a bump of 
the rump that a hockey player would admire, it fends off the intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not pleasant to see them eating," said John Hamilton, director of 
Tasmanian Devils Park on the southern Australian island of Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's left when they finish a meal. They devour everything, including 
bones and fur. Some experts say only the largest of all the sharks exert 
greater jaw pressure than the Tasmanian devil." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's park is a refuge for injured or orphaned animals, and there's no 
shortage of them. Wildlife experts estimate that more than 100,000 "Tassie 
devils" roam Tasmania's luxuriant forests and rugged wilderness. The island has 
become their last stronghold. Once prevalent on the Australian continent, they 
are now found nowhere else on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Their belligerent sounds and appearance undoubtedly gave these pouched 
creatures of the night the ominous "devil" name. Early European settlers 
associated them with the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 Colored mostly black, befitting nocturnal animals, these marsupials look a bit 
like misshapen bear cubs. But they have fierce-looking teeth, reddish-purple 
pointed ears and long hairy tails. 
</P>
<P>
 Old devils carry great battle scars. "They've got holes in their ears. They've 
got broken teeth and bad breath," said Michael Stoddart, a zoologist at the 
University of Tasmania. "I mean, they look like a football team after they've 
had a really bad night on the beer." 
</P>
<P>
 When they're squabbling over food among themselves, "they make a sound that's 
a cross between a baby screaming and a cat fight," said Meena Jones, a 
university wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 A really angry devil is an even more frightening soloist. "It starts out with 
a monotone growling sound, a single, flat tone that just increases in crescendo 
until it becomes almost a blood-curdling scream," said Jones. Supported by the 
National Geographic Society, she recently completed a two-year study of the 
animals in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult devils, she was surprised to learn, don't lose their youthful ability to 
climb. A 23-pound male devil, the largest in the area, climbed 6 feet straight 
up a slender gum tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the devils are using the trees as a lookout post," Jones said, 
"to get a bit of height and have a listen and smell of their surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly forest animals, the devils have flourished even though much of their 
habitat has been cleared for farming and grazing. Nearly 455,000 people live on 
Tasmania. More than 30% of the island is preserved in national parks and other 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The grazing areas have actually attracted the devils' favorite food, wallabies 
and kangaroos. Injured or dead ewes, lambs and cattle are also consumed. 
Skilled scavengers rather than predators, devils can travel as many as six to 
eight miles a night in search of a good meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasmanians tell tales of dead cows or horses that all but disappeared 
overnight. Devils will even eat cattle horns and feet, says Hamilton. "I doubt 
there's any other animal in the world that's such a complete scavenger." 
</P>
<P>
 Devils are "endearing cowards," despite their ferocious reputation, Jones 
said. "When I'm handling them, they almost freeze with fear, and they're not 
aggressive. If I let the animals go, it's almost as if they're playing a 
childhood game. If I have one on my lap and take my hands away and just sit 
there, it will remain frozen, maybe for minutes without moving a muscle. Then, 
cautiously, looking from side to side, it will gradually take a step and creep 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Even medical science has turned to the devils -- for a parasite found in the 
muscles of as much as 30% of the animal population. 
</P>
<P>
 The parasite produces a substance that may be useful in fighting some types of 
inflammations and skin allergies, according to three University of Texas 
immunologists, George Stewart, Nancy Street and Jerry Niederkorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our data indicate that if we can synthesize materials from this parasite," 
Stewart said, "they might have a broad range of medical applications."

EXOTIC BANGKOK GROANS UNDER TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK; THAILAND: MOST OF THE CITY'S 
CANALS HAVE BEEN PAVED OVER TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE THAN 3 MILLION CARS AND 
ALMOST AS MANY MOTORCYCLES -- QUADRUPLE THE NUMBER 10 YEARS AGO.

<P>
 This noisy Southeast Asian capital used to be known as the "Venice of the 
East." Its graceful canals were so colorful and exotic that foreign visitors 
called them an opium smoker's vision of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days people spend so much time in their cars caught in gridlock 
traffic that one of the hottest-selling items in Bangkok department stores and 
automobile service stations is a portable urinal for the car. Marketed as the 
"Ezee-Pee" and "Comfort 100," the devices come with female attachments and are 
becoming standard in taxis and many family cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society is going mad," said Thongchai Panswad, an engineering professor 
at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "Bangkok traffic reached a critical 
stage some five years ago, but no one took the problems seriously until 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Bangkok's the canals, or "klongs," have been paved over to make room 
for more than 3 millions cars and almost as many motorcycles -- quadruple the 
number of vehicles on city streets only 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A just-concluded United Nations conference confirms what most of the 8 million 
residents of this Southeast Asian capital have known for a long time: Two 
decades of skyrocketing economic growth have turned Bangkok into the gridlock 
capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Today 12-minute waits for red lights are common, and so is traffic that snakes 
along at an average pace of 5 m.p.h. So much lead is dumped in the air from 
vehicle exhaust fumes that babies are routinely born with blood levels that 
exceed 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter -- a threshold figure the United 
States and other Western governments label a "serious public health risk" 
because that much lead destroys nerve and brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
 And lead is only one of 18 toxic substances in Bangkok's foul-smelling air 
that exceed maximum levels considered safe by international standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owners say business is bad because traffic jams that continue past 
midnight keep Thais at home and foreign visitors in their hotels fearing for 
their health. 
</P>
<P>
 So severe are Bangkok's problems that the United Nations has dubbed it the 
"most polluted megacity on Earth."

<P>
 Thailand's economy is expected to grow 7.7% this year, a figure that would 
otherwise be the envy of most industrial countries, but traffic jams will shave 
1% off the country's surging economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to official estimates, in the last six months, 93,000 new cars have 
joined the vehicular fray. About 450 new motorcycles per day also appeared on 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say not much can be done about traffic congestion anytime soon, 
besides tallying up the human and environmental costs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the United Nations, Bangkok's growing pains are part of an 
unprecedented demographic upheaval shared by a dozen other Asian cities with 
populations approaching 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While only one-third of all Asians live in cities today, U.N. forecasters say 
55% of the region's people will be urban dwellers by the year 2025 -- a 
population shift of about 1.5 billion persons, or more than the entire 
population of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangkok authorities have tried changing school and office hours, set up 
one-way bus lanes on major streets, and built scores of overpasses atop major 
intersections -- all with no apparent effect on the gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to and from the office now eat up an average of 40 working days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-mile trip from the city center to Don Muang Airport can take as long as 
three or four hours, prompting at least one luxury hotel to start a helicopter 
service. Hundreds of less well-heeled tourists check out of their Bangkok 
hotels a day ahead of their departure time and into lodgings closer to the 
airport, thus ensuring they will not miss early morning flights. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners say laying more asphalt is not the answer to Bangkok's traffic 
jams -- or those of other Asian capitals. Only a system of satellite cities and 
mass-transit railways can save Bangkok from the congestion and pollution that 
officials say they are powerless to stop, according to one authoritative report 
issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But several mass-transit schemes have been left in doubt by bureaucratic 
snarls and skeptical investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently opened $1.1-billion "second-stage expressway" has turned into a 
fiasco, in part because contractors and Thai bureaucrats could not agree on how 
to divide revenues from a hefty $1.20 toll charge that has outraged motorists 
using the new 12.5-mile-long road. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed solutions to Bangkok's problems include providing more buses and 
reducing the number of cars through higher taxes or production quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-owned Bangkok Mass Transit Authority runs 10,000 regular buses, but 
the operation loses $80,000 a day due to low fares. A current plan calls for 
building two routes for extra-long buses in the downtown area that would 
include tracks, so other vehicles couldn't use the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians want to adopt a system similar to neighboring Singapore, 
where motorists buy special permits to enter heavily traveled downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems hard to separate Thais from their automobiles at any price. A new 
study says that car sales are accelerating, especially luxury models. 
</P>
<P>
 As if Bangkok didn't have enough problems, elephants are descending on the 
city in search of food, adding to the congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand banned commercial logging five years ago after a landslide buried two 
villages in the northwest, putting thousands of elephants out of their jobs 
hauling freshly cut timber from tropical hardwood forests. Their natural 
habitat now in shambles, some elephants have begun infiltrating large cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is more than just money," said Pisit Patalung, secretary general of the 
Wildlife Fund of Thailand. "We have got to protect our forgotten friends like 
the elephants, who end up going berserk in the Bangkok traffic because of the 
noise and fumes."

PUERTO RICO TROOPS FIGHT HOUSING PROJECT CRIME; LAW ENFORCEMENT: HUNDREDS OF 
NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND POLICE HAVE BEEN USED TO TAKE OVER AND PATROL 
FACILITIES OVERRUN BY DRUGS, GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Soldiers in camouflage, each carrying an M-16, check every passing car. They 
stand guard alongside schools pockmarked with bullet holes. They patrol nightly 
along lines where workers are putting up 12-foot-high walls topped with barbed 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminiscent of El Salvador and Vietnam, this military operation is taking 
place on U.S. territory, battling the enemy within: drugs, gangs and violent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of National Guard troops and police have taken over at least 23 
public housing projects in this U.S. commonwealth since June, often in swift 
nighttime operations complete with helicopters, armored personnel carriers and 
shouted orders to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pedro Rossello ordered the National Guard into action, seeking to lower a 
murder rate higher than any of the 50 states and to fulfill a campaign pledge 
of law and order. It is the first time U.S. military units have been pressed 
into routine crime-fighting service with police. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeovers have ended shootouts at the projects and brought back frightened 
repair crews, mail carriers and social workers. But it has also been criticized 
as undemocratic by civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 For Santo Almodovar, repairing his snack shop inside the rundown Vista Hermosa 
(Beautiful View) project, the takeover has returned something he thought was 
lost forever -- security. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke with a reporter, workers were busy walling off the project to stop 
foot traffic and building a guard post at the single remaining street entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that we have to live in forts like the cowboys against the 
Indians, but it works," said Almodovar, 44, as he surveyed empty streets that 
used to be crowded with outsiders, many buying or selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kill fewer people in some of these guerrilla wars in Latin America than 
they do here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 through Sept. 27, killings claimed 8,204 lives in Puerto Rico, with 
new murder records set in 1991 and 1992. The 706 people killed so far this year 
-- including five in one recent shootout at an housing project without patrols 
-- is well above the 617 at the same point last year. Police say 85% of the 
slayings are drug-related, in a land where unemployment is officially listed at 
17.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 From the windows of her office in a nearby elementary school, Principal 
Armenda Perez used to watch drug sales, some by children not much older than 
those she teaches and tries to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 One Christmas, gangs shot up her school for target practice. Another time, 
panicked mothers who got wind of a shootout pulled half of the 320 pupils out 
of school within 20 minutes. During another gunfight, Perez huddled in her 
office, metal shutters drawn, with about 30 children. A man was fatally shot 
outside the adjoining cafeteria -- half an hour before the children recessed 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press was afraid to come in here," said Perez, a veteran educator from 
the rural central mountain town of Utuado. "This phone -- it stayed broke for a 
month because repairmen didn't want to come in. The school doctor was afraid to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Hermosa was not even considered one of the worst of Puerto Rico's 332 
housing projects, which are home to 332,000 of its 3.8 million people. When it 
was built three decades ago, private guards rang a siren at 9 each night to 
tell children to head home. But order disappeared as many residents with jobs 
left, as its population doubled, as services crumbled, as drugs took hold in 
the 1970s and never let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Now each night, police and National Guard troops patrol the streets of the 
projects, or watch TVs from the street while earning money, a cause of 
resentment to some jobless residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lopez Sicardo, a housing project near the University of Puerto Rico, 
residents complain that authorities have closed the community center to public 
events and banned the weekend block parties they used to hold near the 
project's small, litter-strewn square. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dictatorship," said a 40-year-old man who would identify himself only 
as Pedro for fear of the authorities. "At 10 o'clock, you have to turn off your 
stereo in your house." 
</P>
<P>
 He said police continue to check the cars and papers of project residents they 
already know. He called it harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The island's police chief, Pedro Toledo, counters criticism by saying 
residents from 50 other projects have demanded that authorities move in. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has not said how much the operation has cost. About 500 
National Guard troops and police officers take part in the initial sweep of a 
project, then 30 or so are assigned to daily patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Those doing the patrolling find themselves face to face with a part of the 
island that Puerto Rico tries its best to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ishai Boria, waiting out an afternoon rain shower under the awning of a 
former drug-selling point, said the occupation of Vista Hermosa reminded him 
too much of Vietnam, where he fought in 1969 and 1970 as a soldier in the 
Army's 4th Infantry. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like Vietnam, it may have been easier to get in than get out. Although 
the government and the newly private management of the projects have made some 
repairs, several root problems remain: the size, the concentration of people 
and the lack of ways to keep criminals from living there. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have pulled troops out of three housing projects, leaving behind 
small police details to man guard posts, part of a police unit specially 
trained for projects duty. But at Vista Hermosa, even many residents who 
criticize the authorities do not want them to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place was like Salvador before," said Pedro Maisonet, 22. If the patrols 
end, he said, "it's going to be like the Old West."

REBELS, HIGH TAXES, FALLING PRICES BRING HARD TIMES TO PERU'S MINERS; ANDES: 
FOUR HUNDRED MINES, A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S MINING OPERATIONS, HAVE CLOSED IN 
RECENT YEARS, UNABLE TO COPE WITH GROWING BURDENS. 
</P>

<P>
 Andres Machacuoy and Alejandro Villavesa steady the powerful ore drill against 
the tunnel wall, scooping out a shower of rock particles that sparkle in the 
beams of their helmet-mounted flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deafening roar of the drill and the clouds of dust in the rarefied 
atmosphere of this vast copper mine 14,500 feet up in the Andes, they don't 
wear earplugs or face protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Machacuoy and Villavesa, thousands of miners eke out a harsh existence 
digging copper, zinc, silver and gold along Peru's mineral-rich Andean spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Once one of the world's largest mineral producers, Peru has endured a 
production plunge in recent decades due to inept administration, recession and 
guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred mines, a third of the country's mining operations, have closed in 
recent years, unable to cope with the additional burden of low international 
prices and high taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is we're all broke. We've only survived by going heavily into 
debt," says Carlos Diez Canseco of the National Mining Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A major burden has been security costs to ward off attacks by radical Shining 
Path guerrillas, who steal dynamite and blackmail mine owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have launched more than 300 attacks on mines since 1980, one study 
shows. An attack on Morococha in 1989 paralyzed the mine for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mining historically has been the pivot of Peru's economy. Mineral exports 
bring in $2 billion a year, nearly half total exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But hard times have made it impossible even for Peru's largest mining 
companies, such as Morococha's owner Centromin, to provide decent work or 
living conditions for its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Morococha, 75 miles east of Lima, Juan Torres rests on his bed while his 
wife boils cabbage for lunch on their tiny kerosene stove. Outside, a hailstorm 
rattles the tin roof of their single-room shack. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year-old Jesus, the youngest of Torres' eight children, plays on the 
dusty wooden floor. An outdated calendar is the only splash of color against 
the smoke-blackened brick walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's drinking water comes from a single tap next to reeking latrines 
in the muddy street outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been exploited. It's a slow death working down there," says Torres, 45. 
"But I'm working for a better future for my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After 23 years with the company, he earns the equivalent of $7 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Morococha is also the site of one of Latin America's biggest ecological 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow-green lakes are fed by streams of untreated mineral waste flowing past 
miners' homes. The mountains that rear over Morococha have turned a dirty 
orange color from the oxides that ooze from a honeycomb of tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Contamination is everywhere, from the high mercury levels in the drinking 
water to the copper particles pumped into the air by the refinery in La Oroya, 
a town 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 These conditions have bred a range of illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Miners and their families commonly suffer from lung, skin and eye diseases, 
stomach ailments and high blood pressure. Few miners live past 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Morococha's poorly stocked, understaffed hospital is overwhelmed by an average 
of 40 patients a day. Centromin recently sold its hospitals to Peru's chaotic 
social security system to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place has gone downhill. Before we had surgeons who could operate in 
case of an accident," says Dr. Wilber Alcantara, the hospital's director. "Now 
we have to send patients by road to the hospital in La Oroya and hope they 
survive the trip. Often they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The rough weather conditions in the Andes -- freezing temperatures, hail and 
snow -- further aggravate health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit by reporters to the mine, a heavy snowstorm blanketed the 
area within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, even the Devil uses a poncho," Centromin official Oscar Barreto says, 
shivering. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a plan to privatize Peru's largest mines hopes to turn the situation 
around, the future for miners looks bleak in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 Centromin, Peru's biggest mining outfit, has laid off 7,000 miners in the last 
year in a bid to stem losses and streamline the company to make it attractive 
for privatization. The move enabled the company to break even last year after 
losing $150 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But hardships have bred ingenuity among the miners. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve their needs, the workers' union has set up a communal soup kitchen, 
food market, hair salon and shoemaker's shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company gives us only one pair of boots a year," says shoemaker Fidel 
Castro, whose left-leaning father named him after the Cuban leader. "This way 
we can be self-sufficient."

HONG KONG AIRPORT SPREADS WINGS DESPITE CHINA'S OFFICIAL RESISTANCE; ASIA: 
PLANES MUST LAND AND TAKE OFF OVER A FOREST OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS, AN APPROACH 
SO HAZARDOUS THAT PILOTS MUST QUALIFY FOR A SPECIAL ENDORSEMENT ON THEIR 
LICENSES. BUT ALL THIS WILL SOON CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.

 Many of the 22 million passengers who land at Kai Tak International Airport 
every year feel as if they've just auditioned for the U.S. Air Force 
Thunderbirds aerobatic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming planes flying the colors of more than 50 international airlines take 
aim at Checkerboard Hill, a steep outcropping painted red and white to aid 
navigation into this British island colony. 
</P>
<P>
 With the low peak in sight, pilots make a gut-wrenching right turn seconds 
before touchdown on Kai Tak's short runway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 3 an incoming China Airlines jumbo jet carrying 296 passengers skidded 
off the rain-slick runway and landed in Hong Kong Harbor. Twenty-three people 
were reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst accident at the airport since a Chinese plane went off the 
runway in 1988, killing six. The worst accident in Kai Tak's history occurred 
in 1967, when a Thai airliner plunged into the harbor, killing 24 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensifying the airport's danger, planes must land and take off directly over 
a forest of high-rise apartment buildings, one of the most densely populated 
square miles on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the flight path live more than 340,000 people who can look out their 
apartment and automobile windows into the cabins of passing airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 So hazardous is the approach into Kai Tak that pilots must qualify for a 
special endorsement on their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this is about to change. Kai Tak, now the third-busiest cargo airport 
and fourth-busiest passenger airport in the world, will close in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a diplomatic standoff with Beijing, Hong Kong is moving ahead with 
plans to build a new airport, part of a $21-billion development program. The 
plan's ultimate purpose is to ensure that Hong Kong remains Asia's No. 1 
financial center and southern China's main port. 
</P>
<P>
 An army of construction workers already is filling in the South China Sea 
immediately off Lantau Island, building a 3,000-acre platform for the new Chek 
Lap Kok Airport, which is expected to open in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-speed railroad and expressway on the world's longest suspension bridge 
will link the new airport with Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is queuing up to lend us money," said Paul Brown, an official of 
the Hong Kong Airport Core Program. "Everyone wants a piece of the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, that is, but China, which will gain sovereignty over the colony in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, authorities in Beijing have balked at helping finance the new airport 
and nine other development projects in Hong Kong. The projects include 
freeways, rail and subway lines, a new town and reclaimed land the size of 700 
football fields, on which housing for 90,000 people would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse has left the development scheme in a twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But work is proceeding on projects that don't need China's approval. They 
include the airport platform and the 4,518-foot-long Tsing Ma suspension 
bridge, which will be 318 feet longer than San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, 
now the world's longest. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of all the dredges in the world, including half of the largest 
ones, have assembled in the waters off Hong Kong to start the massive landfill 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But China says the construction is too grandiose and will erode the wealthy 
colony's financial reserves. Chinese officials maintain that Hong Kong's riches 
should be left intact until after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong authorities reject these arguments, citing "greed and democracy 
factors" as the reasons Beijing has withheld support for such projects as a new 
tunnel under the city's harbor and a new downtown terminal for the airport rail 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese see private investment as loans, and they don't want the debt," 
Paul Brown said. "We suspect the Chinese have plans to get their hands deep in 
the cash register." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Hong Kong authorities say, the Chinese are furious about the 
continued efforts of the colony's popular and outspoken governor, Chris Patten, 
to increase the legislature's democratic base before 1997. Chinese-language 
newspapers issue almost daily denunciations of Patten, his plans and his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officially the Chinese deny linkage," said Mark Pinkstone, a spokesman for 
the Hong Kong government. "But every time we talk about giving Hong Kong more 
democracy, the Chinese find an excuse to muck up the airport negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong officials say that China's reluctance to help pay for the airport 
construction projects won't jeopardize their completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the $21 billion will be spent by 1997, when the first runway at Chek 
Lap Lok opens," Brown said. "But because of the Chinese impediments, the work, 
using private capital, is going to be much more costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulties with Chinese politicians, however, aren't Hong Kong's only 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The colony faces competition from a recently opened airport just across the 
Chinese border in Shenzhen and from new airports being built in the nearby 
Portuguese colony of Macau, in Osaka, Japan, and near Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka's $14-billion Kansai International Airport, plagued by construction 
delays because the man-made island on which it is built keeps sinking into 
Osaka Bay, is finally scheduled to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The $13-billion New Seoul Metropolitan Airport on Cheju Island already is 
being touted as the largest airport in Asia, years before it begins operation 
toward the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore, long championed as Asia's most efficient gateway, plans a third 
runway and two more passenger terminals at its ultramodern Changi International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these challenges surprises Brown or Henry Townsend, chief executive 
officer of Hong Kong's provisional Airport Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the Asia-Pacific region will account for 40% of international 
passenger traffic by 2000, Townsend said Hong Kong will remain a major gateway 
for China after 1997. He predicts that travelers using Chek Lap Kok Airport 
will increase 3.5% annually between 1997 and 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macau, Osaka, Seoul -- everyone -- is discovering that you can build airports 
on islands," Brown said. "It's a little like the Hula-Hoop. Once you understand 
how to do it, you can build an airport anywhere."

SETTLEMENT MONEY IN '89 SCHOOL BUS ACCIDENT TEARS TOWN APART; TEXAS: MANY IN 
THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF ALTON ARE UPSET THAT A NUMBER OF THE 21 VICTIMS' 
FAMILIES HAVE USED LAWSUIT MONEY TO MOVE INTO BIGGER HOUSES AND BUY EXPENSIVE 
CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tragedy almost beyond endurance: Twenty-one children drowning when 
their school bus was knocked into the murky waters of a flooded gravel pit. 
</P>
<P>
 The four years that have passed may have partially healed some of the wounds, 
but the money -- the millions of settlement dollars paid to the parents of 
these children -- has opened new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't sit well with some of the 3,000 residents of this mostly poor 
community that a number of the victims' families have used settlement money to 
move into bigger houses and buy expensive cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough, says the Rev. Joseph Lapauw, who is building a new church with help 
from some of the families. The Roman Catholic priest says it's long past time 
for residents and outsiders alike to stop talking about greed and stop judging 
the victims for how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is greedy? I think it is the lawyers who pushed them," Lapauw said. "The 
people want to live in peace and go on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The families feel hurt by local gossip -- and occasional news stories -- 
implying that they're living fast and loose with their new fortunes, the priest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For each child killed, the families received an estimated $4.5 million from 
Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co., which owned the truck that ran a stop sign and 
knocked the school bus into the pit on Sept. 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 They received nearly $1 million more for each death from the bus manufacturer 
to settle lawsuits alleging the bus had insufficient escape hatches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that some of the families built sprawling ranch houses unlike any 
ever seen in Alton, and that some of their children cruise the rural roads in 
fancy hot rods and pickups. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, two students who had escaped the bus wreck died in a Camaro that 
smashed into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lapauw said the positive things that happened get less attention, such as 
the poor families who moved into decent, but modest, homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some invested in small businesses and in their children's education, he said, 
and committed acts of generosity that have received little notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say all of the families have relatives in Mexico, so they built houses 
for them in Mexico," Lapauw said. "You can't say the people have not shared. A 
number of those families have been generous." 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Ortega, whose 15-year-old son, Jose, died in the bus, said that he hasn't 
changed but that others began looking at him differently after he received the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have anything, nobody wants you. Now, everybody is your 
friend. Now, everybody wants to take advantage of you. Everybody wants you to 
give them money," said Ortega, 62, an usher and one of the donors at the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want you to lend them some money," he said, "and if you don't lend them, 
they start talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, many of the families distanced themselves from the rest of Alton, living 
in seclusion in their new homes, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give to everybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former migrant farm worker said he had never heard of a lawsuit before 
lawyers approached him immediately after the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do anything to bring our boy back. We decided to buy a good place to 
live, and that's it," he said. "We still have him in our thoughts. This is 
something that you don't forget easily." 
</P>
<P>
 And the reminders won't end soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the biggest cases have been settled, it almost seems as if the lawsuits 
-- about 350 were filed -- will go on indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they will finish with them by the year 2000," Hidalgo County Dist. 
Atty. Rene Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. paid out a total of $133 million, and Blue Bird 
Body Co., the bus manufacturer accused of design flaws, settled for $23 
million. Fees for plaintiff attorneys in those cases, split among several 
firms, have been estimated at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of one rescuer shows how complicated the legal battles can become. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Border Patrol Agent John R. Swyers, called to help save children from the 
flooded bus, filed suit in 1991, alleging that he suffered leg injuries and 
permanent mental and emotional distress. He is seeking $3.4 million from Valley 
Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Coca-Cola attached to the case its own lawsuit contending that Blue 
Bird's bus design and the dangerous intersection in Alton contributed to the 
deaths. Coca-Cola argues that if the soft-drink company is found liable for 
damages, then Blue Bird and the City of Alton should pay a share. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Alton sued the Texas Department of Transportation, alleging that the 
state agency had failed to put up guard rails to prevent vehicles from falling 
into the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have sued in connection with the accident include nearly two dozen 
rescuers, the bus driver, the truck driver -- who was acquitted this year of 21 
counts of criminally negligent homicide -- long-lost relatives of the victims, 
the Coca-Cola truck passenger, and some Coca-Cola employees who weren't even at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, attorneys even sued attorneys over the right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all simple for Raul Ortega: No millions could ever replace his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It benefited us, but at a cost," he said of the money. "I would prefer that 
he be with us. We wouldn't have much, but we'd be more or less . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 With that, his voice trailed off.

MAINE'S 70,000 PROLIFIC BEAVERS KEEP STATE BIOLOGIST BUSY AS -- A BEAVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN ADAMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maine's prolific beavers are busier than ever this fall, stopping up streams, 
clogging culverts and flooding fields and woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
 For state biologist G. Keel Kemper, that means about a half dozen phone calls 
a day from residents complaining about those clever beaver dams. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Kemper's job to keep the waterways open, but with minimal disturbance to 
the beavers' intricate structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Beavers are especially active in the fall, when they build homes and gather 
food -- tree bark and wood -- for the winter. Kemper, however, rules out 
relocating beavers in the fall, since that would force them to restart their 
home-building process and could, in effect, sentence them to a slow death. 
</P>
<P>
 To Kemper, Castor canadensis is too valuable a species to dislodge and send 
packing just because the beavers follow their instincts to dam up waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question the beaver is the most important animal to all other 
animals, because he can alter habitats," said Kemper. "If I move him down the 
road, I'm just moving my problem down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Killing beavers is not an option. Maine's policy is to avoid killing nuisance 
animals unless it's a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Over-hunting in the 19th Century nearly wiped out the beaver in Maine. Later, 
trapping regulations helped the creature return slowly. Over the last few 
decades, a sharp drop in demand for beaver furs and forest-cutting practices 
that create good forage have sent the state's beaver population soaring toward 
pre-Colonial levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine now has an estimated 70,000 beavers, about the number it can adequately 
support. Signs of nature's most tireless builders are evident along many of the 
state's waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jean Pratte's spread in Sabattus in southern Maine, a 6-foot-high dam made 
of gnawed sticks and branches tightly packed with mud spans a 30-foot-wide 
stream, raising the water level of an extensive marsh by more than three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The edge of the marsh and a nearby woodland are marked by stumps efficiently 
gnawed by razor-toothed beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the marsh, a yellowish tinge on softwood trees provides evidence that 
the high water is taking a toll on the evergreens. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratte, afraid the rising marsh would destroy up to 40 acres of commercial 
timber, called Kemper for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper arrived with an assistant, a canoe, several lengths of perforated pipe 
and waders. The two went right to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing himself in a canoe with the grace of a tightrope walker, the wiry 
biologist swung a sledgehammer to drive several steel stakes into the stream 
bed about 10 feet from the head of the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 After attaching five 6-inch diameter pipes to the stakes, he rested the 
20-foot-long pipes on top of the dam. The perforated pipes prevent the beavers 
from undoing Kemper's work by blocking the intake end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper and his assistant, Steve Saucier, then went to work with pickaxes and 
their bare hands, digging troughs into the top of the dam. As they placed the 
pipes through the openings, water gushed into the stream below the dam. The 
level at the high-water side dropped a half-inch within an hour. The dam 
remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper said he was sure the beaver would be back to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "By their instincts, beavers don't like the sound of running water," said the 
biologist. "When he returns, he'll come back with sticks in his mouth." 
Biologists don't know exactly why the water sound prompts beavers into action. 
</P>
<P>
 To help get the beaver started on the reconstruction, Kemper and Saucier 
shoved a few sticks into the top of the dam and placed some more limbs across 
the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year alone, Kemper said, the state put pipes through 48 beaver 
dams and gave equipment to dozens of other landowners to do the job themselves. 
The federal government pays for the pipes because it endorses Maine's strategy 
to preserve freshwater wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaver dams preserve marshes, which are a critical habitat for a whole 
range of creatures from worms and grubs to ducks, birds, raccoons, skunks, deer 
and moose. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated cycles of ripping out dams only to have them replaced by eager 
beavers cause rapid fluctuations in the level of marshes, diminishing their 
value as animal habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 And tearing out dams sends silt downstream, which is bad for fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, beavers don't always choose the right places to build dams; one of 
their favorite places, for example, is in culverts under highways. That's when 
Kemper hears from town road officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper used to crawl into the culverts and prod the dams loose by hand, but 
the resulting gushes of water convinced him to take another approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been spit out of the end of more than one culvert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapping and relocating beavers are more practical in the spring, when the 
beavers can adapt more easily to new places and have more time to build new 
lodges.

NEW TOOLS HELP FDA GET TOUGHER IN TRACKING THREATS TO PRODUCT SAFETY; PUBLIC 
HEALTH: THE DECISION TO TURN A SMALL CINCINNATI FIELD LAB INTO A 
STATE-OF-THE-ART NATIONAL FORENSIC CHEMISTRY CENTER WAS MADE AFTER SEVERAL 
EMBARRASSING INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than four years ago, a scare over the possible cyanide poisoning of 
grapes imported from Chile stumped the Food and Drug Administration. Were the 
grapes really tainted? If so, by whom, and when? Would they be dangerous if 
consumed? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Though agency investigators found cyanide in two grapes plucked from among 
tens of thousands sitting on a Philadelphia dock, they could never say whether 
the contamination took place in Chile, on a boat en route to the United States, 
on the docks or perhaps at the FDA's own lab. There was controversy over how 
much cyanide was in the two grapes. There was confusion over the threat to 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocery shelves were cleared. Tons of fruit spoiled as the FDA imposed an 
embargo, then lifted it five days later. Chilean growers lost an estimated $240 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, there was little evidence that the threat was real, but 
substantial evidence that the agency charged with policing thousands of 
consumer goods and much of the nation's food supply was not equipped to do the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to June, 1993, when consumers began complaining of syringes found 
in Pepsi products. 
</P>
<P>
 Detecting a syringe was not a daunting task, but determining whether the soda 
itself had been tainted called for sophisticated analysis. Forensic scientists 
at an FDA lab here -- opened after the grape fiasco -- analyzed samples of the 
soda, syringes and cans with electron microscopes and other equipment. They 
concluded the soda was not contaminated. No product recall would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 As the FDA advised consumers that they could protect themselves by shaking the 
container or emptying the drink into a glass, members of a newly formed FDA 
criminal investigative team began "flying polygraphers across the country" 
interviewing those who had complained, said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to Winfield, Ill., where hospital employee Keith Willis said he had 
found a syringe in a Pepsi bought from the hospital vending machine. Under 
questioning by a polygraph operator, he admitted he had put the syringe in the 
can, according to an affidavit prepared by FDA agent Gregory Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to Milwaukee, where Katherine Wuerl, an employee of a local 
newspaper, also admitted to the syringe hoax after an FDA agent and an FBI 
polygraph expert quizzed her about discrepancies in her story, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven M. Biskupic. Why, they asked, had she shifted from 
Diet Pepsi to Pepsi? Why had she bought the soda at a suburban store, but 
waited until three hours later to open it when she was with a group of people 
in the newspaper's employee lounge? One day, Wuerl's first-person account of 
finding the syringe was front-page news in the Milwaukee Sentinel; now she 
faces up to a year in prison for allegedly violating the Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act by making false product-tampering claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 37 people have been charged. Guilty pleas or convictions have been 
obtained in 13 cases; charges are pending in the 24 other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the grape case, the investigative work on the Pepsi incident 
was swift and definitive. It allowed Kessler to reveal the hoax quickly, 
announce arrests and end an incident that otherwise might have continued to 
worry consumers and the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as significant, the response marked a turning point in the agency's 
evolution as the nation's chief commodity cop. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal unit "has already proven its value," said Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), who spearheaded several investigations into the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 And the manufacturer of Pepsi, understandably, is pleased. "Our product was on 
trial, and the fact that they moved so quickly helped," said Pepsi spokesman 
Andrew Giangola. "It would have been potentially catastrophic had the situation 
continued to play itself out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago there was more disdain than regard for the FDA. "Clueless" is 
how one congressional staff aide who researched the agency for an oversight 
committee described the FDA then. "The whole agency by the end of the 1980s was 
just in hideous shape. They were defenseless," the staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chile and the fruit industry pressed to recover damages from the cyanide 
scare, the FDA suffered further when outside criminal and congressional 
investigators found that some of the country's largest makers of generic drugs 
had submitted fraudulent test data to the agency and bribed FDA officials to 
allow products onto the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said the agency's weakness was clear: There were plenty of regulators 
on staff who understood how the food and drug industry should work, but few 
with the investigative ability to ferret out fraud, track down counterfeit pill 
makers or draw a confession from someone calling in a fake product complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after taking office in 1990, Kessler announced plans to establish the 
new 100-member Office of Criminal Investigations, for the first time putting a 
fully trained federal police force behind the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The force, which has been operating since January, was assembled by Terrell 
Vermillion, a 23-year veteran of the Secret Service. The agents have an average 
of 12 years of experience in other federal law enforcement agencies. The unit 
has helped develop an attempted murder case against a Florida woman who put lye 
in cough syrup she gave to her twins. It also is helping in the prosecution of 
a company charged with selling "look-alike" amphetamines in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people charged in the Pepsi case already is more than were cited 
under product tampering laws in the decade since those provisions were enacted 
in 1983, according to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to turn a small Cincinnati field lab into a state-of-the-art 
National Forensic Chemistry Center was made shortly after the grape incident. 
Besides working on cases sent by Vermillion's investigators, researchers also 
are creating an encyclopedia that outlines what happens when poisons or other 
contaminants are put in common consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 That vital information was missing in the grape crisis, said lab director Fred 
Fricke. No one was sure, for example, what cyanide would do to a grape, how 
much poison the fruit could absorb or what a poisoned grape would look like at 
different stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just did not know all of the reactions to cyanide in fruit at that time -- 
would it turn an apple purple, or whatever," said Fricke, a 30-year FDA 
veteran. "We had none of those answers." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get answers, Fricke's small lab of four researchers was 
expanded to 29, including 11 people with doctorates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the staff's time is spent on specific cases, but otherwise 
researchers are free to hypothesize about questions such as this: What would 
happen if a vengeful drug lord tried to taint bananas with cocaine? (The 
answer: Not much. Cocaine ingested orally would be harmful only in amounts so 
large that the contamination would be obvious.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the lab continues its work on Pepsi -- partly to bolster pending 
criminal prosecutions and partly to add to its general understanding of soft 
drinks.

SERIAL CHILD MOLESTER'S RAMPAGE ENDS WITH ARREST, INDIANA POLICE SAY; 
ABDUCTIONS: SUSPECT CONFESSED TO AT LEAST EIGHT CASES IN FIVE STATES. HE SOUGHT 
VICTIMS IN SMALL TOWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON LESKO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, in the course of his cunning rampage through small-town America, one of 
the young girls David Lee Thompson molested made him cry. 
</P>
<P>
 He assaulted the 5-year-old several times along the 100-mile drive from her 
Illinois home. At one point that night, before releasing her with enough cash 
to call her parents, Thompson told the girl to get some sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she did, she asked God to help Thompson, and she told him he could help 
himself by throwing away pornographic magazines that were in the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about how he even sat up front and cried," said Detective Barry 
Story of the Wells County sheriff's office. "But what happened after she fell 
asleep? He went back and did it again." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was not the only time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has confessed in explicit detail to at least eight child molestation 
cases in five states, though the full extent of his spree may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's job was delivering vans. He plotted his interstate routes, he told 
police, by picking out-of-the-way towns where he could seek victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And throughout 1991, he called a missing children's hot line in San Francisco 
from pay phones, telling savage stories of children he said he had molested and 
killed. He called himself "the Child Cannibal." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that the 40-year-old Thompson killed anyone; later, when 
he led police to a place in the Arizona desert where he claimed to have buried 
more than a dozen dismembered girls, there were no bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is plenty of evidence of Thompson's other crimes. He has given 
precise directions to houses where girls were molested, and his accounts of the 
crimes -- he is accused of forcing the girls to engage in oral sex -- has been 
nearly identical to those of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly has a world of problems," said Thompson's court-appointed 
attorney in Wells County, Linda Wagoner. She would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is accused of crimes in five Indiana counties. He pleaded guilty in 
one Indiana case on Dec. 17, and faces a maximum of 86 years prison when he is 
sentenced on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been charged in Mt. Vernon, Mo., and Palmer, Mass., and charges are 
expected in Marshall, Ill. Officials in Half Moon, N.Y., have declined to 
pursue allegations that involve a 2-year-old girl; the other girls were between 
the ages of 4 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest in Waco, Tex., on July 1, Thompson confessed to only one 
attack. He often told police he had "done so many bad things in his life" and 
wanted to talk about them, but he refused until late October. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting ready to go to court one day and he said, 'Barry, I've got to 
talk, I've got to get this off my chest,' " Story recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a corner of Bluffton Detective Scott Gilliam's tiny, cluttered office is a 
cardboard box that holds Thompson's files. Inside are more than a dozen 
cassette tapes of Thompson's confessions; he has hinted there is more to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just sat and talked to him about anything, you'd probably like him," 
Gilliam said. "Then you talk to him about the details of what he's done. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Georgetown, Ky., Thompson moved to Indiana when he was 11. He has told 
police he was molested as a child, which he claims pushed him toward a youthful 
fascination with pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 He read detective novels in which children were raped and killed. "He began 
fantasizing about that," Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was charged in 1973 with felony assault in a case involving a young 
Ohio girl, and in 1982, he was charged with phone harassment, a misdemeanor, in 
a case involving a young Indiana girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Thompson was accused of molesting his stepson and 
stepdaughter. He spent four years in prison after pleading guilty to the attack 
on the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, he was arrested on an attempted burglary charge in Hewitt, 
Tex., and spent eight months in the county jail. He since has told police he 
broke into the home to molest a 5-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, he had been at work delivering vans for a year and a half. He 
was roving the countryside, looking for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer than 9,000 residents, Bluffton is the largest town in which 
Thompson is accused. In each case, Thompson would walk through neighborhoods 
until he spotted two or three possible victims. He would find out where they 
lived, return late at night and sneak through an unlocked window or door. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he would molest the girls in the house, other times he would take 
them out. In Bluffton, last May, he returned the 5-year-old girl to her home 
after molesting her. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he struck, fear followed. Story's 6-year-old daughter is close 
friends with the victim in Bluffton. "She kept asking me, 'Are we going to be 
safe in our house?' " Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 He began locking his windows and doors for the first time. His three children 
still pray each night that God will protect them while they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken away some of that small-town, hometown effect," said Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
 In his repeated calls to the San Francisco hot line, Thompson claimed 
responsibility for the April, 1991, disappearance of a 4-year-old girl in 
Tyler, Tex.; police say he had no connection to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Thompson's first call to San Francisco led to his downfall -- he used 
his sister's phone in Indiana, and within seconds he realized his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a 10-second phone call, and then he realized we could trace that call 
to his sister's house and he hung up almost immediately," Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made that one fatal mistake. If it hadn't been for that, he may still be 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, he was not in jail for good -- on Nov. 16, he escaped 
briefly from a Ft. Wayne psychiatrist's office. He was arrested without 
incident in Valparaiso, 100 miles away, and faces kidnaping and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He told police he escaped just for the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he just wanted to run down the road one more time," Story said.

GALLERY: NOT YOUR AVERAGE LAP DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HYUNGWON KANG, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the lunar calendar observed throughout Asia, 1994 is the Year of the Dog -- 
and no dog is more respected in all Korea than the Jindo. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolated on the remote island of Jindo off southwestern Korea, the breed 
evolved into fierce hunters.Their job was to catch wild game and bring it home 
to their masters. Sometimes several dogs would work together to bring down a 
deer or other large animal, then one dog would go get their owner while the 
others stayed behind to guard the game. 
</P>

 "Natural selection favored the mightiest dogs to breed while the weaker ones 
died out," says In Sub Yang of the 400-member Korean Jindo Club in Los Angeles. 
"That explains their aggressive nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Jindo folklore is rich with tales of an ancestry that includes Mongolian war 
dogs and Asian wolves. During the 1930s, the breed nearly became extinct when 
the Japanese military rounded up more than 300,000 of the dogs to make fur 
coats for soldiers fighting in Manchuria. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are an estimated 14,000 dogs on the island and perhaps 2,000 in 
the United States, despite efforts by the South Korean government to control 
export of purebred Jindos. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs are prized for their intelligence and perseverance, says Junnie Yoon, 
a dog show judge from South Korea. Stories abound of Jindos overcoming great 
difficulties and distances to find their way home. 
</P>
<P>
 "However aggressive Jindo dogs are, that aggression is only directed at wild 
animals," Yoon says. "Jindo dogs should never show aggression toward people 
unless they perceive harm intended to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a fighting dog, but when it is confronted with an aggressive dog, 
it will fight until it drops."

THE BUZZ: FAUX AD HAS FIRM FUMING

 The Federal Wage and Labor Law Institute has been averaging between 100 and 
150 misdirected calls a day since December's Esquire magazine listed the firm's 
800 number in a joke ad for a faux charity called Feed the Waifs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mag's annual Dubious Achievement issue, beneath a picture of ultra-slim 
Kate Moss, the ad reads: "For just 39 cents a day, less than the cost of a cup 
of coffee, you can keep this girl and other super-models just like her alive." 
Mark Haag, director of the Texas-based labor law consulting firm, said regular 
customers have been unable to get through on the line, while ad readers call to 
ask if it's true they can sponsor a starving super-model on a diet of warm miso 
soup and tuna carpaccio. "The whole thing is incredibly frustrating," Haag 
said. "It doesn't take a mental giant to call the phone number before you print 
it. I just hope this appears as a dubious achievement in the '94 issue." Morgue 
Humor: The final tally in a marketing triumph worthy of the Addams Family is 
in. The L.A. County Coroner made worldwide news this year by opening Skeletons 
in the Closet, a primarily mail-order operation that sold gift items from the 
morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise included a key ring made from a coroner's toe tag, plus T-shirts, 
mugs and tote bags with a skeleton logo. The biggest seller for '93 turned out 
to be the $20 beach towel with a body figure done in a chalk-line design (the 
kind drawn around corpses on the street) that's available in five colors. It 
was described by marketing director Marilyn Lewis as "the hot item in a cold 
place." Trend Watch: This might never make it to the level of a permanent 
sightseeing tour or become worthy of a hawker-sold map on Sunset Boulevard, but 
at least one addicted Menendez trial watcher has mentioned hearing of fellow TV 
trial aficionados who have driven the route the brothers said they took the 
night of the shooting to see if it matches the time Lyle and Erik said it took.

LETTERS IN VIEW; PRINCIPLES COLLIDE OVER NATURAL PRODUCTS

<P>
 Re "Faking It" (Dec. 17): So the vegans get free press in View promoting their 
lifestyle sans animal products. Thankfully, in America we have the freedom to 
choose what to wear, eat and benefit from (medical advances, for example). 
</P>
<P>
 I choose to wear natural products -- fur, leather, wool and silk. This way my 
conscience is clear. I'm not polluting the planet with rubber and vinyl 
manufacturing plants. I'm not supporting those huge tankers that carry gasoline 
from which synthetics are made, and that in one accident at sea have wiped out 
entire ecosystems.

harmful to the biosphere, so who are they helping? Let them wear jute.

 Thank you very much for the balanced article on vegans. Usually we're regarded 
as being strange or weird. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of being a vegan is to express compassion and pity through an active 
nonviolent lifestyle. As a vegan, you strive to do the least amount of violence 
the society will allow, thereby moving society forward toward living in peace, 
not only with other humans, but also with the creatures of the air, land and 
sea.

LETTERS IN VIEW; COPING AND CAUTION IN AN ERA OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your article in View, "Fear Is Starting to Run Our Lives" (Dec. 21): 
I think Los Angeles Police Sgt. Christopher West's idea of providing free maps 
of Los Angeles County showing the locations of all police stations is a most 
creative and commendable idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible for the telephone companies to provide fold-out and 
detachable maps in all Los Angeles County telephone directories? This would at 
least provide maps for people with phones. 
</P>
<P>
 For those without phones, West's unit will need sponsors to have maps printed 
and distributed. He is absolutely right: "The police can't be everywhere, and 
some things we've got to do for ourselves."

 I was the victim of an armed robbery in the late '70s in which I had to lie on 
the floor and a shotgun was placed against the back of my head. Needless to 
say, I was struck with fear and remained fearful for days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 From this experience, I adopted defensive attitudes that those in your article 
are now discovering. It may not be healthy to some, but to me defensiveness is 
very psychologically healthy, as is survival. To even think one can live life 
today as life is portrayed on a TV show from the '50s is unhealthy and 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tragedy that crime dictates our lives, but until society changes for 
the better, to live without caution is foolish.

 Like many others who have lived here a long time, I can remember how good it

 When I was a child, my mother would take me to MacArthur Park in the evening. 
We would go for a boat ride and take a stroll around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 How enjoyable it was. We would stay until 10 p.m. and never have any concern 
about crime. Today, most people wouldn't feel safe there in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the long-range prognosis for Los Angeles? We are caught in a vicious 
circle. Politicians tell us they don't have any more money to fight crime, but 
it is crime that is driving people out of Los Angeles and they are taking their 
tax dollars with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Public safety must be the No. 1 budgetary priority if Los Angeles is to ever 
again become the city we all once loved so much.

PLAN WOULD GIVE MAYOR A VOTE AND CUT 1 COUNCIL SEAT; GOVERNMENT: ADVOCATES SAY 
THE PROPOSAL HAS COST-SAVINGS ADVANTAGE OVER SIMPLY GIVING THE CITY CHIEF A 
VOTE, AND WOULD ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEADLOCK. MEASURE COULD APPEAR 
ON THE APRIL BALLOT.

<P>
 Searching for a way to eliminate one of the oddities of Long Beach government, 
the City Council has decided to consider a ballot measure to give the mayor a 
vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 3 at a special session Wednesday to direct City Atty. 
John Calhoun to draft a charter amendment that would also reduce the number of 
council seats from nine to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The two items -- a voting mayor and a reduced council -- were linked because 
of the need to avoid deadlocks by creating a council with an even number of 
votes, said Councilman Thomas J. Clark, who proposed the charter amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor were given a vote under the current setup, some issues could be 
tied at 5 to 5. With eight voting council members and a voting mayor, that 
contingency would be eliminated, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has operated under the current system since 1988, when voters 
approved a charter amendment giving the city a mayor elected at-large. Long 
Beach is one of only a few California cities whose mayors cannot vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernie Kell has served two terms as a non-voting mayor -- a two-year term 
and a four-year term -- and he is up for reelection this year. A full-time 
elected official earning $84,221 a year, Kell chairs council meetings and 
sometimes seeks to influence council members. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, the mayor can exercise a veto, which can be overridden by a 
majority of the council. But without a vote, the mayor lacks mayoral authority, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the situation has been ludicrous all along," said Clark, a former 
mayor who has pressed for more than 10 years to have a voting mayor elected in 
a citywide vote. "It makes no sense to have someone sitting in the meeting like 
that and not having a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing the charter amendment were Councilmen Ray Grabinski, Alan S. 
Lowenthal and Warren Harwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski said he is concerned about the speed with which the council is 
moving on the measure. "I think there were six people in the audience (on 
Wednesday)," Grabinski said. "There ought to be heavy involvement from the 
community before they try to do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal called the measure "a rush to judgment," which could deprive 
neighborhood groups of influence in city government. "Reducing the number of 
council members from nine to eight is not the best way to empower 
neighborhoods," Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by Clark, the ninth seat would be eliminated by attrition, 
either by the retirement of a council member or by the two-term limit on 
council members enacted in 1992. Thus, the earliest that the system could be 
modified is 1996, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun will report back to the council Jan. 11. If the council approves the 
charter amendment on that day, it could go on the April 12 municipal ballot, 
City Clerk Shelba Powell said. Otherwise, it could go on the June 7 ballot, 
provided the council takes action by Feb. 15, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a related issue, council members considered whether to raise their salaries 
as part of the same charter amendment. Part-time council members are paid 
$21,055 a year, and some of them want to increase that amount to half of the 
mayor's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that, by decreasing the size of the council, we'd be increasing 
the size of the districts," Clark said. "We'd be increasing the workloads of 
each district by roughly 5,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating a council district, including staff and expenses, would represent 
an annual savings of more than $200,000, which could offset a salary increase 
for the remaining council members, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after members of the audience suggested that doubling council members' 
salaries was not in the public interest, the council majority proposed a salary 
review commission. Calhoun was directed to include such a commission in the 
charter amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach voters turned down proposed charter amendments in 1990 and 1992 
that would have given the mayor a stronger veto -- with six votes required to 
override. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a group called Citizens Task Force for Effective City Government 
proposed that the mayor be given a weighted vote so that, in case of a 5-5 
deadlock, the mayor's vote would break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current proposal has the virtue of including a budget savings, Clark 
said. "It reduces costs and it's easier to sell."

NEW PRODUCTION COMPANY WILL RUN CITY-OWNED THEATER; ARTS: FORMER GYMNAST CATHY 
RIGBY AND HUSBAND, TOM MCCOY, WILL STAGE FOUR SHOWS IN AN EFFORT TO BOOST 
TICKET SALES. THE FORMER OPERATOR, WHICH HAD TURNED A PROFIT DURING ALL BUT ONE 
YEAR SINCE 1976, IS SURPRISED.

<P>
 A new production company will take charge of professional shows in the 
city-owned theater this fall in hopes of reversing a seven-year decline in 
season ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton-based McCoy Rigby Entertainment will replace Rogers Productions of 
Beverly Hills, which has produced Broadway plays and musicals in the La Mirada 
Theatre for the Performing Arts since it opened in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy Rigby will stage four shows during the 1994-95 season at a cost of about 
$1.1 million. The company is owned by actress and former Olympic gymnast Cathy 
Rigby and her husband, Tom McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to switch production companies two weeks ago even 
though Rogers Productions turned a profit during all but one of its 17 seasons. 
The city splits any profits made by the shows with the producers and absorbs 
any losses. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were concerned that Rogers was turning a profit 
mainly by raising ticket prices and cutting production costs, while producing 
shows that were becoming less interesting and original. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting to be too much of the same old, same old," said theater 
director Jeff Brown. "You can only cut the budget so much. You can only raise 
ticket prices so much. At some point you have to get the bodies back in the 
seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Season ticket sales have fallen from a high of about 17,500 in 1985-86 to 
about 9,000 in 1992-93. Sales for this season are more than 1,000 tickets below 
last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company promises a greater variety of family-oriented productions and 
better promotion. It plans mailing campaigns and a local cable television show 
that will feature interviews with the theater's directors and stars as well as 
rehearsal footage, McCoy said.  
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to entice patronage from more La Mirada residents, who now represent 
only 11% of ticket buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy said he also plans to move away from the theater's usual adult-oriented, 
Neil Simon-type plays to reach a "family" audience. This year's schedule 
includes the West Coast premiere of a new stage adaptation of the novel "To 
Kill a Mockingbird," Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical revue "A Grand Night for 
Singing" and the classic "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy and Rigby, residents of nearby La Habra Heights, formed their company in 
1986 and have produced several touring shows, a live stadium concert and a film 
documentary. One production, "Peter Pan," has toured nationally and earned a 
Tony nomination for best revival. Rigby, who starred in the production, earned 
a best-actress nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the company's first series, McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rogers, co-owner of Rogers Productions, said his relationship with the 
city has been a good one. It will conclude with the season-ending musical "Five 
Guys Named Moe." 
</P>
<P>
 The McCoy Rigby bid was higher than the Rogers bid of $864,000, Brown said. He 
acknowledged that the city will assume more financial risk in hopes of reaping 
an even greater gain in ticket revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the McCoy Rigby shows will have bigger casts and bring in outside 
directors, choreographers and set designers. "Not so much more lavish, but a 
higher-quality and different look than the last series," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy Rigby hopes to take its more successful productions on national road 
tours as a way to generate profit for the theater, McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had split profits with Rogers Productions. In only one year, 
1991-1992, were profits less than $160,000. The series lost $100,000 that 
season, due to a variety of circumstances, including the opening of the largest 
and costliest show on the first night of the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said his proposal for next season would have arranged for the company 
to rent the theater and assume all profits and losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said he was surprised: "What we were proposing was much safer for the 
city. They would have been out of show business." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides any money the city loses on the theater series, it spends $500,000 a 
year to subsidize the theater, which is also rented out to community groups, 
local theater associations and orchestras.

CITY WILL SEEK INJUNCTION AGAINST GANG ATTIRE, ACTIVITIES; LAW: OFFICIALS HOPE 
CIVIL RESTRICTIONS WILL MAKE AREA SAFER, BUT SOME LEGAL GROUPS SAY ACTION COULD

 Gang members in Norwalk could be prosecuted if they wear gang clothes, carry a 
marking pen or hang out in an alley, under a program recently approved by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost the city $48,000 to seek an injunction against gang practices, 
such as tagging. Deputy Dist. Atty. Deanne Ancker will seek the civil remedy in 
an effort to ward off such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk, a city of 94,000, has about 2,500 gang members in five active gangs 
and two tagging crews in the city, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department said. About 500 of them are hard-core gang members, said 
Sgt. Dick Madden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although drive-by shootings are uncommon in Norwalk, authorities have received 
complaints for years from residents about intimidation by gang members. 
Widespread graffiti and theft are also attributed to gangs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancker, who prosecuted gang-related slayings for a year in East Los Angeles, 
is investigating several trouble spots in Norwalk, including a residential 
alley where gang members congregate, and the parking lot of a new hamburger 
restaurant. The lot has been the site of some turf wars, she said, and patrons 
have complained of slashed car tires and broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing police reports and interviewing residents about the activity 
in the area, Ancker plans to seek a public nuisance injunction in Norwalk 
Superior Court against the offending gang. If a judge grants the injunction, 
all members of the gang would be legally prohibited from congregating in the 
alley or parking lot during certain hours. The injunction would list known gang 
members by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a court order may forbid gang members from having otherwise legal objects 
that could be used as weapons, such as baseball bats, tire irons, screwdrivers, 
crowbars or bottles. Some may be prohibited from possessing tools commonly used 
to break into cars, such as pliers, wire cutters and lock picks. Gang members 
suspected of dealing illegal drugs could be under order not to carry pagers, 
cellular phones, binoculars, flashlights or walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancker said she may target some specific gang-related clothing, such as the 
type bearing letters or symbols that identify a particular gang.  
</P>
<P>
 Gang members who violate the injunction, such as taggers who carry a marking 
pen, could be jailed. Parents of taggers could be fined for damages caused by 
their children, Ancker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main aim of the program, said Ancker, is to discourage lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is not to put people in jail. We don't want to see teen-agers behind 
bars," Ancker said. "It's to prevent destructive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 One gang member said recently, however, that the use of such orders will not 
change his set's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do it anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to combat what we perceive to be a serious gang problem in our city," 
said Ernie Garcia, deputy city manager. "I'm not saying we have a tremendous 
problem, but it's one we've identified and taken steps to control. Now it's 
time to target those who won't go along with the program." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sheriff's Department figures, 1,542 crimes were committed by gang 
members in Norwalk during 1992. From January through October of 1993, the 
figure was 670. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil libertarians fear the plan would infringe on 1st Amendment rights, such 
as free speech and free assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Silverstein, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, 
successfully challenged a similar plan in Westminster. In that case, he said, 
the injunctions were found to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Westminster program restricted individual freedoms based only on 
the accusation of being involved with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action was an attempt to impose guilt by association," he said. "It was 
punishment for who you associated with, rather than what you actually did." 
</P>
<P>
 That injunction would have prevented any two of 60 suspected gang members, 
including members of the same family inside their home, from meeting in any 
quarter-mile area, Silverstein said. In denying the injunctions, an Orange 
County judge cited the constitutional right of free assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU plans to keep an eye on the Norwalk program, Silverstein said. "We 
have concerns about the constitutionality of these injunctions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ancker isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have upheld them when the injunction is narrowly tailored and 
carefully worded," she said. "We're talking about a one-block alleyway . . . 
where gangs have directly intimidated people." 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have allowed injunctions against gangs in Burbank and Van Nuys, Ancker 
said.

 "It does prevent the gang members from associating," she said. "It becomes too 
much hassle for them. They don't want to go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Ancker's contract ends in June, but it probably will be extended until 
December, when city officials plan to evaluate the effectiveness of any court 
orders obtained against the gangs, Garcia said.

RHYME AND REASON; PSYCHIATRIST USES POETRY TO HELP UNRAVEL PATIENTS' PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a helicopter crash in Vietnam that led Whittier psychiatrist Owen 
Heninger to discover the healing power of poetry therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 A young soldier killed in the crash was the son of one of Heninger's patients, 
a dentist who had helped his son overcome some physical obstacles so he could 
enlist in the Army. After the young man's death, the father was overwhelmed 
with remorse, blaming himself, feeling suicidal. Heninger had been treating the 
man for about a month, but wasn't making much progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Heninger remembered a poem he had learned in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger, 64, had never been much of a poetry enthusiast. There never seemed 
to be time for it. He'd been a soldier in the Korean War, then a pre-med 
student at Brigham Young University, then a medical school student, a doctor, a 
psychiatrist. He was a scientist, not a dreamy poetry lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was something about the poem that he remembered. The poem was 
Matthew Arnold's "Sohrab and Rustum," an adaptation of an ancient Persian work 
about a warrior who mistakenly kills his own son. It reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 For some are born to do great deeds, and live,  
</P>
<P>
 As some are born to be obscured, and die. Do thou the deeds I die too young to 
do, And reap a second glory in thine age: Thou art my father, and thy gain is 
mine.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't get to talk to his son before he died," Heninger says, "and I 
thought that the words the son says in the poem might give him solace." 
</P>
<P>
 After Heninger gave him the poem, the father came out of his depression and 
was able to go back to work, the psychiatrist says.  
</P>
<P>
 Heninger didn't make too much of it at the time, but about seven years later 
he was treating a woman also suffering from depression over a child's death. 
Recalling the earlier case, Heninger suggested that the woman read and write 
poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the poems she wrote, I saw that she was saying things she 
couldn't or wouldn't say in therapy," Heninger says.  
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Heninger says, a poem the woman wrote revealed her hatred for 
her brother-in-law, whom she blamed for her daughter's death.  
</P>
<P>
 Heninger used the feelings revealed in the poem to treat the woman. 
"Eventually she recovered," Heninger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Success with two patients made him realize that poetry could be helpful in his 
work. "I put two and two together. Here were two people who had recovered 
through this unusual treatment involving poetry. . . . I just stumbled onto it, 
like the guy who used mold to treat a wound and later found out it was 
penicillin." 
</P>
<P>
 What Heninger had stumbled onto was in fact a longstanding but relatively 
obscure form of therapy that a few psychologists and psychiatrists were already 
using. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending a UCLA course on poetry therapy taught by psychologist Arthur 
Lerner, a pioneer in the field who had been using it since the 1940s, Heninger 
jumped into poetry therapy with both feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he already had enough degrees to fill a good-sized wall, he went back 
to school, taking literature and poetry classes at Rio Hondo College and Cal 
State Fullerton while maintaining his practice. Last summer, he received a 
Registered Poetry Therapist Credential from the National Assn. for Poetry 
Therapy, one of only about a dozen mental health professionals who hold the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 And what exactly is poetry therapy? 
</P>
<P>
 There are two forms, Heninger said. One involves exposing patients to poetry 
written by others that will "strike a healthful resonance" within the patient, 
such as the effect the Arnold poem had on the father of the dead soldier. One 
poet Heninger uses often with his patients is Emily Dickinson, who he admits is 
his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has written poems that describe post-traumatic stress disorder better 
than the textbooks," Heninger says, citing a Dickinson poem that includes the 
lines, "After great pain, a formal feeling comes." 
</P>
<P>
 The other, more active form of poetry therapy involves poetry written by the 
patient, which Heninger says can serve as "a window to the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinary defenses may be bypassed by poetry. . . . Writing poetry has 
allowed unconscious material to become conscious, overcoming or bypassing 
repression, and has brought about genuine self-recognition," he wrote in a 
journal for mental health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger goes over patients' poetry with them, line by line, to uncover the 
meanings that they did not consciously know were there. Often, Heninger says, 
"poetry reveals, but it reveals by concealing. . . . Instead of saying 'you 
dirty S.O.B.,' you put it in poetic terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Again Heninger cites Dickinson:  
</P>
<P>
 "Tell all the Truth but tell it slant -- Success in Circuit lies Too bright 
for our infirm Delight The Truth's superb surprise As Lightning to the Children 
eased With explanation kind The Truth must dazzle gradually Or every man be 
blind  
</P>
<P>
 Although only a relative handful of Heninger's patients are undergoing poetry 
therapy -- he also uses more traditional forms of psychotherapy and medication 
-- he believes there could be a value in it for almost everyone except the 
drug-addicted or extremely psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's poetry in everybody," he says, "although they may not think of it as 
poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger and other advocates of poetry therapy admit that not everyone in the 
mental health field is sold on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone is accepting of it," says Lerner, editor of "Poetry in the 
Therapeutic Experience." "But I think as there is gradually a better 
understanding of what it's about, it is going to be used more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger hopes that his scheduled appearance with Lerner and other poetry 
therapy experts at the American Psychiatric Assn. Convention in Philadelphia 
this year will generate interest among psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If other psychiatrists find poetry therapy as useful as I have," Heninger 
says, "I think it's going to keep growing and growing and growing."

ED BEGLEY NOMINATED TO SEAT ON LAND PANEL; PARKS: RIORDAN CHOOSES ACTOR TO JOIN 
THE MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY BOARD. ANOTHER CANDIDATE, PETER IRELAND, WAS TARGET 
OF INTENSE OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Film actor Ed Begley Jr. will expand his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously named to the city's Environmental Affairs Commission, Begley has 
been nominated by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy after weeks of speculation over who would represent the 
city on the park agency's board. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed, as expected, by the City Council, Begley will join the 
eight-member panel that sets policy for the conservancy -- a state agency that 
buys parkland in the Santa Monicas and neighboring ranges, including the Santa 
Susana Mountains and Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Begley nomination follows vigorous lobbying against Peter Ireland, who was 
a leading candidate but was targeted by a wide spectrum of opponents, ranging 
from pro-development interests to conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. 
Edmiston and City Councilman Zev Yaroslavksy, a conservancy backer. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, 44, a Studio City resident who starred in the television series "St. 
Elsewhere" and whose film credits include "The Accidental Tourist," is 
"especially qualified" for the conservancy post, Riordan said in a letter to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment seems likely to enhance the conservancy's image as park agency 
to the stars. In recent years, actors Warren Beatty and Peter Strauss and 
singer-songwriter Don Henley have aided the agency's land acquisition efforts. 
Barbra Streisand last month presented her Malibu estate to the conservancy to 
use as an environmental research center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As government panels go, the conservancy board does not have the highest 
profile. But the lobbying surrounding the appointment illustrates the intense 
interest in the agency's land preservation efforts within environmental and 
development circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by Councilwoman Laura Chick, Ireland sought the board post and "was 
notified by the mayor's office that I had been given the appointment," he said. 
"Subsequently, I was informed . . . that everything was on hold and that things 
were being re-evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
 William McCarley, Riordan's chief of staff, said Ireland was among several 
candidates, but declined to give details. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other arguments may have been more persuasive, the campaign against 
Ireland included a false rumor that he was secretly being pushed by Soka 
University in an effort to stop the conservancy's efforts to acquire Soka's 
land by eminent domain. Soka is trying to expand its campus into a 
3,400-student university, a plan bitterly opposed by environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors he was in league with Soka were "completely false and I'm extremely 
disappointed someone would do this," Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good laugh over it," said Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan of the 
allegation. "As far as I know, Peter Ireland has never been a friend of Soka." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumor seemed calculated to smear Ireland, said one Soka supporter. "If you 
want to really ruin somebody's reputation in the environmental community, you 
accuse him of being soft on Soka," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said the rumor circulated among conservancy staff, but then was 
checked out and found to be false. "I certainly . . . don't think he's a dupe 
of Soka." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, 47, until last spring worked for Edmiston as a high-ranking staffer 
with the agency. But budget cuts reduced him to consultant status and last 
summer he became executive director of the Mountains Restoration Trust, a 
nonprofit land trust that sometimes receives conservancy funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Ireland and his former boss, Edmiston, were feuding over a 
conservancy-funded study on how the National Park Service could raise money for 
mountain parkland by selling the development credits that developers must buy 
to build in coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's new shop, the Restoration Trust, had raised money itself through 
sale of development credits, and he voiced philosophical as well as practical 
objections to Park Service involvement. In August, Ireland angered Edmiston by 
outlining his objections in a long letter to Park Service Director Roger 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland already had enemies on the other side of the fence -- among them 
property rights and development advocates with whom he once was allied. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's initial foray into mountain politics was as leader of a property 
rights group that fought park expansion. In 1981, he parlayed that role into a 
staff position with County Supervisor Deane Dana, considered an ally of 
mountain developers. Ireland also became Dana's representative on the 
conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 But he underwent a dramatic transformation from critic to ardent supporter of 
conservation efforts. In 1989, he supported a secret strategy by the 
conservancy to permanently block the county from putting landfills in three 
Santa Monicas canyons -- without telling Dana, his boss. A short time later, 
Ireland left Dana's office for the conservancy staff. 
</P>
<P>
 When word got around last summer that Ireland was a leading candidate for the 
conservancy board, both his erstwhile property rights allies and conservancy 
supporters stepped forward to oppose him. Among other things, they said Ireland 
would have a conflict of interest because his group, the Restoration Trust, 
sometimes seeks conservancy funds for its land acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Knabe, Dana's chief deputy, said his office voiced reservations, but "it 
wasn't anything hard-core -- that we started a campaign or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bates, a Malibu real state broker, said he was urged by fellow conservancy 
critics to weigh in against Ireland -- but then heard conservancy supporters 
already had torpedoed him. Bates said he also heard the rumor of Ireland's 
supposed alliance with Soka, but considered it misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he opposed Ireland because of the potential conflict of 
interest. He said he did not want such "side issues" to divert the 
conservancy's attention during the current real estate slump, which has given 
the agency "a golden opportunity to acquire some of the most valuable open 
space in the country."

WESTSIDE WATCH: THIS TRADITION NEEDS TO PUNT AND START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe next year: The folks who run Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade 
thought it might be nice to start a new Rose Bowl tradition by inviting 
university bands and football fans to a pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the first school invited? The USC Trojans -- you know, that local 
team that did not get invited to play in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a dysfunctional city or what?" said former Santa Monica Mayor 
Christine Reed, a graduate of the local school that did send a team to the Rose 
Bowl -- UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame the whole thing on a couple of USC alumni, City Councilman Robert T. 
Holbrook and Promenade executive Ron Cano. 
</P>
<P>
 After USC was out of contention, the university's band director asked 
Holbrook, a USC professor, if the band could still attend the Promenade pep 
rally. The answer was yes. 
</P>
<P>
 So why were the Trojans invited to what is ostensibly a Rose Bowl event? 
Holbrook and Cano pointed out that USC did, after all, rate the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did anyone invite UCLA?" asked an incredulous Councilwoman Asha Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not. But UCLA's opponents in the Rose Bowl, the Wisconsin Badgers, 
were tearing up the town last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's marching band practiced at Santa Monica High School. Scores of 
fans were ensconced at the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel next door. At the hotel 
bar, between drinks of the beer that made Milwaukee famous, they raved about 
the warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
 They, too, had a pep rally Thursday night, at the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 And what were the Bruins up to? The day USC was cheering for itself in Santa 
Monica, the UCLA football team went to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Name that tune: But which tune is it? "On Wisconsin"? "Mighty Bruins"? Both? 
Two-time Los Angeles City Council candidate Laura Lake, now running for Burt 
Margolin's likely-to-be-vacated Assembly seat, admits to split loyalties when 
it comes to this year's Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, she lives in Westwood, where her 
husband, fellow Wisconsin grad James Lake, is a professor at UCLA. How to deal 
with this dichotomy? In a press release last week, she said she would wear a 
Wisconsin T-shirt under a bright red down coat for the Badger band's Thursday 
evening concert on the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? Well, Lake said later, she meant to say she would wear a UCLA T-shirt 
under the Badger-red coat. "I typed it late at night," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin (D-Los Angeles) has said he will run for state insurance commissioner 
if that post is vacated by John Garamendi. Garamendi said last week that he 
would formally announce his candidacy for governor in January. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 D.C. shuffle: Once again, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) will be sifting 
through resumes to find a new chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After only four months in the post, Kyle Zimmer stepped down Friday to take a 
job with her old employer, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a Washington 
auto safety lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer's predecessor, Bill Black, left to work for Rep. Steny H. Hoyer 
(D-Md.), after just eight months with Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, in Hilton Head, S.C., for the New Year's weekend, said Zimmer left 
because she was offered a higher-level job by her former employer. Harman 
downplayed the twice-a-year turnover in the chief of staff post. Overall, 
Harman said, "We have had little turnover on the staff."

MERCHANTS RING IN AN INCREASE IN SALES; RETAIL: HOLIDAY SHOPPERS BOUGHT MORE 
AND SPENT MORE THAN IN 1992, REPORT MERRY SHOP OWNERS AND MALL MERCHANTS FROM 
PASADENA TO INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With sales at many stores still brisk last week, retailers from Pasadena to 
Pomona said they found purse strings looser this holiday season. Many reported 
substantial sales gains from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Old Pasadena, some small businesses recorded holiday sales increases in the 
double digits, as did several shops in San Gabriel Valley malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Store managers in Old Town said cashiers worked overtime the day before 
Christmas to keep up with mobs of last-minute shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear one manager at the California Basket Co. on Colorado Boulevard tell 
it, business hasn't been better in six years. The store reported a boost this 
holiday season in corporate orders for its $65 to $200 gift baskets helped spur 
a 60% increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "More customers were buying, and customers were buying more," said the store's 
executive vice president, Alexander Toland, who echoed many area retailers. 
"People last year didn't even want to pay the shipping fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, the Crate & Barrel kitchenware store reported sales were up 
roughly 8% from 1992's holiday shopping season, from the day after Thanksgiving 
through Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts expect retail sales nationwide to be up 4% to 5% for the 1993 
holiday season, compared with last year. Some analysts predict Southland 
holiday sales have lagged behind, showing an increase of 1% to 3% compared with 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sales were not robust everywhere in the San Gabriel Valley. Managers at the 
REI outdoor equipment store in San Dimas said sales were running about equal to 
last year's. And some mall officials said jewelers who have not changed their 
inventory to meet the demands of more price-conscious shoppers have not fared 
well this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, sales Valleywide -- from an Industry gun dealer to a Pasadena 
lingerie shop -- were up substantially and post-Christmas sales were strong, in 
some cases as strong as they were the week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't tell you how much sales are up this season because we're still 
very, very busy," said Michael Maloney, manager of the L.A. Tronics store on 
Foothill Boulevard in Pasadena. "The Christmas season is still on in our 
store." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Southland, the lure of even bigger savings after Christmas 
prompted a flood of shoppers that surpassed 1992's dramatic post-Christmas 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, last Sunday's onslaught was a sign that consumers are more willing 
than ever to wait for post-Christmas sales to get bargains, retail analysts 
say. A number of polls last year showed an increase in the number of consumers 
delaying their spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley malls were enjoying the post-Christmas buying spirit in the wake of 
what several local malls said were substantially higher holiday season sales in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Plaza at West Covina, which in October unveiled a $100-million 
expansion including 40 new shops and a Robinsons-May department store, sales at 
some stores far exceeded owners' expectations, according to Tracey Gotsis, the 
mall's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some food merchants saw sales increase about 30%, as did some 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanie Van Amon, marketing director at Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, 
reported that sales increased about 7% at many of the mall's shops. That mall 
will expand later this year with the opening of 20 new specialty shops. A 
Nordstrom department store is scheduled to open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had quite a bit of money spent in some of the local malls to update 
them -- they've positioned them to compete. For quite a while people were 
driving right by San Gabriel Valley malls to places like the Glendale Galleria 
and South Coast Plaza," said Richard Giss, a partner in the retail service 
group at the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the money poured into local malls and the growth in businesses in 
Old Town Pasadena, there are some real shopping alternatives in the San Gabriel 
Valley now," he said. "The retailers are going after more upscale customers 
than they have in the past. I think it's been pretty successful." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, he said, helped spur the upturn in Valley sales this holiday season, 
Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said, reports from Valley retailers he deals with indicate 
sales surged 3% to 4% above last year's holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at stores individually, some did much better than that but some 
of the chains might have done worse," he said. "Sears and J.C. Penney did 
better than they might have expected, while apparel shops didn't do so well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers who specialize in home furnishings, appliances and electronics have 
had strong sales this holiday season, analysts said. Most specialty apparel 
stores, such as The Limited, have had a difficult time, bringing in sales only 
by slashing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at the J.C. Penney department store in the Plaza at West Covina had 
to do more than just slash prices to fare well this holiday season. They feared 
the opening this fall of the mall's fourth anchor, the Robinsons-May, might 
siphon off sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gayle Izuno, assistant manager of the West Covina J.C. Penney, said two 
years of remodeling and the addition of more name-brand products enabled the 
store to attract the more upscale clientele that Robinsons-May has drawn to the 
mall.  
</P>

 "The new wing has brought new shoppers and sales have been phenomenal," Izuno 
said. She estimated a gain of 14% for December, compared with that month in 
1992.

ROUGH RIDE FOR RAGING WATERS EXPANSION; RECREATION: BONELLI PARK PRESERVATION 
GROUP VOWS TO FIGHT ANY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR MORE PARKING OR DEVELOP 
MORE OPEN SPACE AT AMUSEMENT PARK SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A citizens group that has repeatedly fought attempts to further develop Frank 
G. Bonelli Regional Park is making waves again, this time to prevent the 
popular Raging Waters amusement park from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Raging Waters, a 50-acre water-slide attraction in the 
northwest corner of the 2,000-acre Bonelli Park, has been drawing huge crowds 
on peak summertime weekends. Owners of the amusement park say existing parking 
facilities -- three dirt lots from which patrons must be bused to the 
attractions -- are overwhelmed. The owners want to increase parking by paving 
and possibly expanding those dusty lots, and they hope to boost attendance and 
profits by adding a 6- to 10-acre retail "village" and nine more acres of water 
attractions in an area now used for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 But they know their proposal is in for a rough ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 8-year-old Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park have vowed to 
fight any attempts to clear the way for more parking or develop more open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 San Dimas City Councilman Denis Bertone, co-chairman of the coalition, said 
its struggle to block further development in the park is hampered by the 
county's insistence that Raging Waters stays. Ranking among the biggest single 
revenue producers in the county park system, Raging Waters contributed more 
than $800,000 in rent to the county's general fund last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But coalition members say that money comes at too high a price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposed expansion of commercial development may enhance Raging Waters, 
but you're taking valuable parkland away from the public," Bertone said. "We're 
not going to get any more park space in the San Gabriel Valley -- it's too 
precious." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who are now considering the proposed expansion during a 
revision of the Bonelli Park master plan, say the coalition's interests must be 
balanced with the interests of residents throughout the county. Bonelli, after 
all, is a regional, rather than a community park, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
 The park accommodates, in addition to 10-year-old Raging Waters, a variety of 
concessionaires. There are 500 RV sites, a family tent area, a golf course, hot 
tubs and developed picnic areas. In addition, cash-strapped county park 
officials have opened Puddingstone Reservoir to Jet Ski rentals and national 
drag-boat races in addition to longtime recreational fishing. About a third of 
the park is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Waters, which has a lease with the county that runs to 2035, hopes to 
win approval within the next year from the County Board of Supervisors to 
expand. Rent is based on a percentage of gross sales, so theoretically, the 
county would get more money if the expansion brings in more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amusement park officials maintain that their attendance, which has increased 
over the past decade while Bonelli Park's attendance has declined in recent 
years, proves the park is popular countywide. They say coalition members 
represent a boisterous minority in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, said Kent Lemasters, general manager of Raging Waters, the 
amusement park is one of the East San Gabriel Valley's largest employers, with 
about 500 full- and part-time seasonal jobs. Most of the jobs at the park, 
which is open 135 days a year, are taken by teen-agers on summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the growing popularity of the amusement park, Raging Waters officials 
said, shareholders have not been paid dividends since the current owner, an 
investor group, took control in 1991. Company officials say that to maintain 
their current customer base and attract new patrons they must build more rides, 
pave the dirt parking areas, and add roughly 1,000 more spaces to the 3,300 or 
so available now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satisfaction level among visitors is high, but on weekends they don't 
like the dirty, dusty ride on a bus across the (Puddingstone Reservoir) dam or 
the line for tickets once they get to the park," said Andrew Haworth-Booth, 
president of Raging Waters. "You can't just close the gates after a certain 
number of people. What would you do with those who still want to get in? You 
could have a riot on your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Waters wants to exercise its option to lease an additional 110 
adjoining acres that would be partially developed as part of the expansion. A 
new entrance, featuring a village of retail shops and a variety of children's 
attractions, would link improved parking areas with the southwest edge of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the Board of Supervisors even considers that proposal, the project 
must be incorporated into a revised master plan for Bonelli Park, and an 
environmental impact report must be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Bonelli Park master plan is 23 years old and outdated, county 
parks officials say. A new plan outlining development in the park is being 
drawn up by county-paid consultants who are taking testimony from a citizens 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to deer, gray fox, jack rabbits and more than 100 species of birds, 
Bonelli Park lies mostly in San Dimas, but spreads into Pomona and La Verne. 
Covina and Glendora, though not contiguous with the park, are also members of 
the five-city joint powers authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group consists of two members from each city in the authority, as 
well as representatives of conservation groups, Bonelli Park concessionaires 
and other groups with an interest in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, several members of that master plan advisory committee -- most are 
also coalition members -- formed a fractious subcommittee that released a 
statement saying the workshops to revise the master plan are "a calculated 
effort to manipulate the citizen constituency" into going along with the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 James Park, chief planner for the county's Department of Parks and Recreation, 
denied that the county is considering the Raging Waters expansion only for the 
sake of raking in more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department is very interested in seeing Raging Waters survive," Park 
said. "I'm not convinced that, with the situation they are in, that they will 
survive. We need a balanced park that preserves the open space, serves the 
public and generates revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Park said he sympathizes with citizens who fiercely oppose the expansion and 
are suspicious of the motives of the county Parks Department. In the past, he 
said, the department endorsed development plans for Bonelli Park that were too 
intensive by the standards of current Parks Department administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the county proposed adding to the park a hotel, conference center and 
220-unit apartment complex, among other things. Then, in 1990, the county 
proposed expanding Raging Waters by using 119 acres to build new attractions 
and a parking lot for 4,000 cars, and adding to Bonelli Park a 150-room lodge, 
an 80-unit cabin complex and a 25,000-square-foot restaurant in a hillside area 
west of Puddingstone Reservoir. Public opposition sank both plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The new master plan revision includes proposals to build horse trails and to 
develop fee-based corporate picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, coalition members are trying to keep the spotlight and the bulk of 
the controversy centered on Raging Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear I have of this expansion is that it follows a pattern at the park," 
said Jane Riggs, who co-chairs the coalition with Bertone. "One-quarter of the 
park is already developed, and they are never satisfied with what they have. 
Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 SH Raging Waters Expansion: 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Waters plans to eliminate a nine-acre parking lot to make way for 
expansion of the amusement park and to eliminate traffic problems on 
Puddingstone Drive and San Dimas Avenue. To compensate for the loss of parking, 
Raging Waters wants to pave two dirt lots in Area B. In addition, a new 
entrance would be created, featuring a small village that includes a ticket 
booth, restaurant and retail shops. About six acres would be developed at the 
southwest corner of Area A for the village.

TREATING THE BODY, LIFTING THE SPIRIT; HEALTH CARE: T.H.E. CLINIC, THE COUNTY'S 
LARGEST FACILITY SPECIALIZING IN CARE FOR HIV-INFECTED WOMEN, LIVES UP TO ITS 
NAME -- TO HELP EVERYONE.

 When Ada Sellers went to her doctor in September for a pregnancy test, she 
figured that the most shocking news she could get was that she was expecting a 
child, at the age of 46. 
</P>
<P>
 She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' doctor sat her down and broke the news that not only was she 
pregnant, she was HIV-positive. Sellers said that because she was in a 
longtime, monogamous relationship, she was at a loss to explain how she 
contracted the virus, and she said her doctors have yet to determine the 
source. But after the initial disbelief came something worse: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried and walked the floor a long time that night," recalled Sellers, a 
mother of five. "I couldn't sleep. I didn't know who to talk to. I didn't know 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers finally picked up the phone and called an HIV hot line, and through it 
discovered the T.H.E. Clinic for Women, a community-based facility on West 
Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. in the Crenshaw district that specializes in 
treating women with AIDS and HIV infections. Today, Sellers says she is feeling 
much more hopeful, thanks to the clinic's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are there for you in so many ways," she said. "I can call whenever I 
have a problem. They take care of all my medical needs. If it wasn't for them, 
I don't know where I'd be." 
</P>
<P>
 The T.H.E. Clinic -- the acronym stands for To Help Everyone -- has been 
hailed as a pioneer in health care tailored for women. Since opening in 1974, 
it has offered comprehensive medical and psychological services for minority 
and low-income women, and today offers the largest program for HIV and 
AIDS-infected women in the county, said director Sylvia Drew Ivie.  
</P>
<P>
 Serving women is not the only reason the clinic is special. Similar medical 
facilities may offer services in Spanish, but T.H.E. Clinic has 62 physicians 
and other staffers who speak 10 languages, including Spanish, Japanese, Thai, 
Tongan and Vietnamese. It serves nearly 20,000 patients annually, including 115 
currently in the HIV program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women, particularly women of color, need different kinds of intervention than 
men," said Ivie, a former civil rights lawyer who has headed the clinic for 
five years. "Also, information needs to be discussed with a Japanese woman very 
differently than it's discussed with an African American or Latino. We operate 
from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic offers a wide array of services that have increased in scope as 
health problems have grown more complex. It not only provides gynecological and 
general primary health care, but prenatal care, pediatric services, 
psychosocial counseling, parenting classes and a teen health program that added 
a peer counseling component in November. The clinic is also in the process of 
adding separate facilities, including a lounge and counseling rooms, for 
teen-agers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating teens like a community with another language," said Ivie, who 
employs 18 students from local high schools as part-time workers. "We train 
them to give each other information, to cut through problems like peer pressure 
and self-esteem. An adult telling them, 'This is birth control' is much less 
effective than one of their peers saying, 'Can you deal with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its innovations and the rave reviews it regularly gets from the 
health care community and elected officials, Ivie says she wonders where her 
clinic, which is 80% government-funded, will fit in with the plans for national 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Though T.H.E. charges fees based on each patient's ability to pay, half of its 
patients are on Medi-Cal, and many more are immigrants who don't have 
insurance. "The need for our services will exist, but I don't know if we will 
be cost-efficient enough," Ivie said. "It's a little worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
 For HIV patient Beverly Mosley, 46, no price can be put on the support the 
clinic gives her, particularly during personally trying times. "They make you 
feel like you're family," she said. "At other places, you're a dollar. Here, I 
do volunteer work when I'm not a patient. That's how much I owe them."

AN EYE ON NEWTS; PROFESSOR STUDIES HOW AMPHIBIANS FARED IN THE FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Where the newts beckon, their follower must go, and if this exposes him to 
the harshness of the California springtime . . . well, this is the price he 
must pay with all the fortitude he can muster." -- Victor Twitty, "Of 
Scientists and Salamanders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Kats is wearing shorts and sandals, standing in the middle of an 
ankle-deep, 49-degree stream on a brisk December afternoon. He is chatting 
about the life of the California newt, a kind of salamander, and claims he 
isn't chilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get so into it I don't even think about the fact that my feet are cold," 
says Kats, 31, a Pepperdine University natural sciences professor who has been 
studying amphibians at Cold Creek Canyon Preserve near Malibu for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats is exploring the impact on amphibians of the Nov. 2 fire that roared 
through Cold Creek, destroying even the aquatic vegetation lining the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "What made Cold Creek unique before has really made it unique now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially attracted to Cold Creek because its amphibian life is largely 
intact, thanks to the purity of its water and the absence of non-native fish 
species. In many other streams, such fish are wreaking havoc on indigenous 
animals, particularly the amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perennial stream," Kats said, "and it's one of the most pristine 
streams in the Santa Monica Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Kats mainly focuses on California newts in his work at the preserve, which is 
owned and managed by the Mountains Restoration Trust and which has been closed 
to the public since the fire. He thinks the newts serve as "primary indicators 
of the health of the Santa Monica Mountains, where they spend significant 
amounts of time in both perennial water and away from the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be monitoring this population long-term. These animals are very 
fragile, because they can't easily move from one watershed to the next. You can 
see the extinction of local populations very easily." 
</P>
<P>
 When newt larvae hatch from eggs laid in water, they have gills. As they 
mature, they develop lungs and legs. Adult newts look like pudgy, amber-colored 
lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow-moving adults, whose orange skin contains a toxin that attacks the 
nervous systems of predators, live mostly on land. They return to the water for 
a few months each year to mate and lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults usually begin returning to the water in early January. Kats' 
research indicates they appear at the same pools each year, but those pools 
have filled up with debris washed down from the denuded hills. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Kats wonders, "When the animals come back, assuming they made it 
through the fire, where are they going to lay their eggs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last winter I stood here in the pouring rain and watched the newts pour out 
of the hills," he said. "But that was through rich leaf litter. Who knows what 
it's going to be like this year? They might be surfing on a mudslide." 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about newts. They have not been greatly studied since Victor 
Twitty, a Stanford biologist, focused on them in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats thinks newts live underground when they're away from water. He doesn't 
know if they can make it through a fire as hot as the one at Cold Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any number of hypotheses come to mind," Kats said. "The fire might have 
driven them even deeper underground." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kats also wonders if the still-strong char smell will reduce the animals' 
ability to migrate back to the stream. Newts depend greatly on their sense of 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small world of amphibian research, Kats' work is respected by his 
peers. Peter Morin, a Rutgers University biology professor who is studying the 
Pine Barrens tree frog, calls Kats' work on newt larvae behavior "cutting-edge" 
and "fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 Kats demonstrated that the larvae are apparently able to smell and avoid adult 
newts, which sometimes prey on their own young. The findings, Morin said, "made 
people rethink how sophisticated these animals are." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire may very well have an effect on the amount of cannibalism" this 
year, Kats said. If there are fewer newts and therefore fewer eggs and young, 
cannibalism might decrease. But "if there are fewer aquatic insects, it might 
mean we'll see more cannibalism," he added, because the newts need to find more 
food sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Two summers ago, Kats implanted tiny microchips in Cold Creek newts. Now he 
can identify individual animals with a hand-held scanner, collecting data year 
after year. (Newts typically live 10 to 15 years.) The chips don't allow him to 
track the newts, however. For that he would need radio telemetry implants, 
which are currently too big to use on such small animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats, who grew up in rural Indiana and earned his bachelor's degree in biology 
at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., and his Ph.D. at the University of 
Kentucky, has been studying amphibians since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people I studied amphibians before amphibians were cool. They only 
really started getting attention the last three or four years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives on the Pepperdine campus and is known for his ability to mimic tree 
frogs so well that tiny male tree frogs sometimes mistake him for a rival and 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, Kats was amazed to see coal-black tree frogs at Cold Creek. 
The frogs can change color to match their background, which is usually gray or 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just shocked," Kats said. "This indicates these things have an 
evolutionary history with fire. It hadn't burned here in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the newts that really fascinate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come January and February, I'm usually out here during the rains, and this 
year I plan to pack a sleeping bag," Kats said, explaining that mudslides might 
trap him there overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 In February and March, when the newts are laying eggs, he visits his research 
sites four or five times a week. In the summer, he added, he always has help 
from students. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding the creatures of the California landscape is important, Kats 
said, and he intends to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many university people have begun to focus on the tropics, and their back 
yards have been ignored," Kats said. "It's kind of amazing there's not more 
research going on in the area."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; STONES, PINK FLOYD AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council has approved a licensing agreement with Avalon 
Attractions to bring the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd to the Rose Bowl in 
1994. The Stones will play at least one date in October with the possibility of 
adding up to three others if the first show sells out, and Pink Floyd will play 
one show at the Bowl on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement specifies Avalon will pay a flat $800,000 rental fee to lease 
the 100,000-seat Rose Bowl for each show. Pasadena will keep the profits from 
parking and concession sales, which should total about $178,000 per concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The council found itself hoping the Stones do not sell out, since city 
expenses for security for extra shows will cut into the rental fee and 
concession profits. Pasadena will net roughly $722,700 for the Pink Floyd 
concert and one Stones show, but only $618,500 if the Stones decide to play 
additional shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved 5 to 1. Councilman Chris Holden opposed the measure 
because he said the agreement gave the city a diminishing return. Councilman 
William Thomas was not at the meeting.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: COVINA; HIGH SCHOOL TO GET POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Covina and Charter Oak School District will share costs of 
assigning a police officer to Charter Oak High School in an effort to reduce 
crime and gang-related activity, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the pilot program last week, and hopes to have it in 
place by the time students return from winter break, said Acting City Manager 
Fran Delach.The city's portion of the officer's $30,000 salary will come out of 
drug asset seizure funds, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charter Oak (School District) is meeting us halfway, and the council is 
hopeful that they will initiate some policies of their own that will 
dramatically curb some of the problems out there, like implementing a dress 
code, fencing, and considering a closed campus," Delach said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is successful, the city will consider implementing the program 
throughout its two school districts, although funding may depend on the 
districts' willingness to contribute, Delach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer's role will extend beyond patrols, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "That officer will be there as a resource for students and staff, not just as 
a big stick but as a positive presence," he said. "We're not there to be the 
strong arm, but to be a friend to students who might have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not assigned officers to its schools since the 1970s, before 
Proposition 13 reduced the city's revenue, Delach said.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA; ANTI-BIRD NOISE GUNS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea gulls flocking to the BKK Landfill may be greeted by sanitation workers 
armed with pistols that shoot firework-like projectiles designed to scare away 
the birds with a shrill sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the City Council approved BKK's request to use the guns, which are 
not designed to shoot bullets.The projectiles are to be shot close enough to 
startle the birds, not to hit them. The noise is expected to discourage the 
gulls from feasting on exposed trash during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past the landfill has used several methods -- including bird netting 
and regular blasts from devices that release compressed air -- to discourage 
the birds from landing on garbage. Sea gulls are known to spread disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Samaniego, the city's Waste Management Enforcement officer, said gulls 
have recently found ways to pick at the trash despite the nets and air blasts. 
He said the special anti-bird guns will be restricted to designated and 
qualified landfill employees, who will use them mostly during the next few 
months, as the sea gulls complete their migration through the area.

BEST BET: TAKE A PAGE OUT OF LIBRARY'S BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea of facing a new year can be hard when it seems so many of us are 
suffering a deficit of hope. New wars spring up around the globe. The economy 
seems to be in a permanent stall. Children carry guns to school and shoot other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 So this New Year's weekend, it seems best to highlight one of those average, 
everyday events that provide hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Cerritos Public Library for the past five years, "Teens and 
Kids" is a reading series for children that features teen-age volunteers as the 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has about 20 volunteers from local high schools. They give their 
time to be trained by the library's staff, then appear just about every 
Thursday to entertain 60 kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers don't get school credit and, although such a program might look 
good on college applications, many of the readers are still years away from 
worrying about that. These kids are giving up precious social time just to pass 
on a love of reading. Imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading series took a break for much of December because of busy holiday 
schedules, but it returns this Thursday with a full reading list. 
</P>
<P>
 The children who attend the series range in age from preschoolers to 
fourth-graders. They are split into three groups of about 20 children each, 
based on age. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, preschoolers -- known as the "Read Aloud" group -- will hear books 
such as "Goodnight Owl" by Pat Hutchins and "The Reason I'm Not Finished Tying 
My Shoes," by Martha Whitmore-Hickman. Teen-agers also lead their groups in 
songs and games. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Rookie Readers," ages 5 and 6, will hear stories such as "Abi Yoyo" by 
Pete Seeger. Children in the second- to fourth-grade range will hear tales such 
as Petra Mathers' "Maria Theresa," about a chicken by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, the program has retained a loyal following and, because 
class size is limited, the library staff takes reservations for the 20 slots in 
each age group. New series are created each month and the teen-agers rotate 
jobs, with some reading and some helping organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone gets to read. Children get introduced to books. Teen-agers learn the 
rewards of giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like a reason to hope for the future, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens and Kids" plays out every Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in the Cerritos Public 
Library, 18025 S. Bloomfield Ave., Cerritos. For information: (310) 924-5776,

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGION; WATER COMPANY WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports of people posing as water company workers have prompted the San 
Gabriel Valley Water Co. to alert its 45,000 customers to beware of anyone 
asking to enter a home to inspect the plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The alert followed complaints last year about thefts by people who represented 
themselves as water company employees to enter houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte-based water supplier is notifying its customers that normally a 
water company employee would not ask to enter a house. This would happen only 
if a customer had previously contacted the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Also company officials said any questions about whether someone is an employee 
can be directed to the customer service office at (818) 448-6183. 
</P>
<P>
 The water company serves El Monte, Rosemead, San Gabriel, Hacienda Heights, La 
Puente, Baldwin Park, Whittier and Montebello.

POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD RETURNS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach police officer who was shot in the head last summer has returned 
to the department for a few hours each week as a detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Dominguez, shot while writing a ticket in his patrol car Aug. 6, recently 
began working in the department's domestic violence detail. He is accompanied 
by a physical therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get some normalcy back in my life and work would be a part 
of that," Dominguez said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez was shot three times. As he wrote a speeding ticket, two men walked 
up to his patrol car, and one of them shot him through a closed window. Bullet 
fragments entered the right side of his head, another bullet went through his 
arm and a third was deflected by a protective vest. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of three was in a coma for five days. His doctors did not give him 
much chance of surviving, but Dominguez surprised them with his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dominguez is not only talking and exercising, but is learning to walk 
again. He trades his wheelchair for a cane whenever someone is next to him to 
help. "My therapist wants me out of the wheelchair soon, so I've been using a 
cane more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Dominguez, who will be 32 on Tuesday, said he hopes to return to 
work full time. While doctors are hopeful he will fully recover, they are 
concerned that he may not regain full peripheral vision in his left eye. If 
that happens, the six-year veteran of the department said he will likely work 
as a detective and not as a street officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's not in a black and white, it's still police work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez has attributed his rapid healing to his religious faith and his 
ability to release the hate he felt for his attackers. Police have arrested two 
men and charged them with attempted murder. Their trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shooting, the Dominguez household has been a hub of activity 
Neighbors, friends and strangers have pitched in to fix up the family's small 
North Long Beach home, adding a bedroom, a bathroom, remodeling the kitchen, 
replacing the roof and putting in temporary wheelchair ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been blessed," Dominguez said.

BEST BET: CLASS TAKES HIKERS OFF THE BEATEN PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Registration is under way for the Sierra Club's annual Wilderness Travel 
Course, which begins Jan. 25 in the San Gabriel Valley. The course is designed 
for outdoors enthusiasts, whether beginning hikers or experienced backpackers, 
who seek the knowledge and skills to safely explore off the beaten path. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-week course offers instruction in navigation with map and compass, 
wilderness ethics, backpacking equipment, outdoor nutrition, mountaineering 
medicine, physical conditioning, winter camping, and safety and rescue 
techniques. Classroom meetings will include training films, hands-on workshops 
and lectures illustrated with color slides. 
</P>
<P>
 Four trips are scheduled in small groups to practice techniques taught in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trip will be a 12- to 15-mile one-day conditioning hike up a peak in 
the San Gabriel Mountains. Two weeks later, students will spend a weekend in 
the desert at Joshua Tree National Monument for navigation practice and an 
introduction to basic rock climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow travel will be taught in another one-day hike, probably in the local 
mountains. The final trip will be a weekend snow camp in the High Sierra, 
utilizing all the techniques taught during the course. Chartered bus 
transportation is provided for the two weekend trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgette Schultz-Rieck, San Gabriel Valley chairwoman, said the course is for 
individuals who enjoy physical activity and want to learn more about the 
wilderness.. 
</P>
<P>
 The course can help develop a lifetime interest in wilderness adventure by 
putting students in contact with others who share an interest in the outdoors. 
It also introduces students to many other outings, activities and instructional 
programs sponsored by the Sierra Club, said Schultz-Rieck, an insurance broker 
and women's backpacking outfitter who has been involved in the course for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees are $135 for Sierra Club members and $150 for non-members, plus $18 for a 
textbook. Participants must be age 14 or older, and minors who take the course 
must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Class meetings will be at 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays starting Jan. 25 at Monterey 
Highlands Elementary School, 400 Casuda Canyon Drive, Monterey Park. Two other 
sections of the course will meet on Wednesdays starting Jan. 19 in Long Beach 
and on Tuesdays starting Jan. 11 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available at mountaineering stores, Sierra Club chapter 
headquarters and by mail from Pat Johantgen, the San Gabriel Valley registrar, 
Box 70438, Pasadena 91107-7438. Applicants should send a business size 
self-addressed stamped envelope. For information, call Johantgen at home (909) 
980-1210 or work (213) 726-7333. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is taught on a nonprofit basis by certified and experienced Sierra 
Club volunteers.

PEOPLE: VIENNESE AWARD A HIGH NOTE IN COMPOSER'S LONG CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some things 89-year-old Herbert Zipper doesn't do. He doesn't, for 
instance, use a high-tech computer. And he doesn't work out at a fancy health 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many things Herbert Zipper does do, however. He teaches and composes 
music, and conducts professional musicians in symphonic programs. He also 
teaches a twice-weekly counterpoint music class at Crossroads School for the 
Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica. And he visits China regularly to lecture and 
teach about Western music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no time to grow old," said the longtime Pacific Palisades resident and 
musician, who will celebrate his 90th birthday in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Zipper was awarded the Golden Decoration of Honor for 
humanitarian service to the city of Vienna. The award was presented by the 
Austrian consul-general, Christian Prosl, at a ceremony in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a great deal of time composing and writing for Austria," said Zipper, 
a native of Vienna. "I wrote for underground theaters, and that was my 
beginning in the politics of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Zipper is perhaps best-known for music he made in an unlikely place -- a Nazi 
concentration camp. In 1938, the young conductor/composer was arrested and 
imprisoned at Dachau. As an inmate, Zipper secretly formed an orchestra. He and 
14 other musicians risked their lives to perform music for other inmates in an 
unused latrine. 
</P>
<P>
 The music Zipper composed in his head while pushing carts full of stone day 
after day included "Dachau Song." He said the experience allowed him to 
appreciate the humanizing power of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until years later that Zipper discovered that the song had been 
passed from one prisoner to another and even to other camps. In 1988, he 
conducted its world premiere, sung by a chorus of young men at a festival in 
the Austrian city of Graz. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Austrians) took this as one of the most contemporary and living parts of 
the rebellion against what happened during the war," he said. "They appreciate 
my convictions. There is much more understanding of what present Austria is and 
past Austria is. . . . I think that I have helped (present the truth) in some 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Zipper's life story is the subject of a book published last year by Crossroads 
School President Paul Cummins. The book titled "Dachau Song" documents the 
Austrian-born musician's remarkable life. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dachau, Zipper survived a stay at Buchenwald before being released by 
the Nazis. He later moved to the United States, teaching music history and 
theory at the New School for Social Research in New York City. He also formed 
orchestras and is credited with bringing classical music to rural and 
inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, he helped reorganize the shattered Manila Symphony Orchestra. During 
the past four decades, he has also made numerous trips to Europe, China, Korea, 
Thailand and Hong Kong, working with students and professional musicians. 
Besides traveling, he enjoys volunteering as a teacher at Crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he could have retired years ago from the classroom and the concert 
hall, he says he would not want his life to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things I have not done and there are so many things I would 
still like to do, but time gets short," he said. "I do my best to remain 
active." 
</P>

transplant for leukemia three years ago, was honored at the Triumphs Through 
Technology award ceremony Nov. 12 at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA; PLAN FOR SMITH'S REVIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan has been revived to convert part of the city's old Sears store site at 
Fremont and Commonwealth avenues to a Smith's Food & Drug Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, sitting as the Alhambra Redevelopment Agency board, have 
approved an agreement with Smith's Food & Drug Center Inc. for the Salt Lake 
City firm to build a supermarket up to 66,600 square feet next to the 
unoccupied Sears. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Smith's called off plans to demolish the Sears store and build on 
its site. Sears closed April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to purchase the Sears building and some land next to 
it from Haagen Alhambra Retail. This land would be combined with a city-owned 
parking lot on one side of Sears as the site for Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Martin, deputy director of the agency, said the deal would cost the 
agency about $325,000 and leave it as owner of the empty Sears store. The city 
would pay an estimated $5.25 million for the Sears property and sell a portion 
to Smith's, a food and drug chain, for approximately $4.9 million, he said.

Covina and Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina -- are discussing the 
possibility of merging. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 20, both boards adopted a non-binding agreement to merge the two 
hospitals within 120 days.The resolutions pave the way for further 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both hospitals said they are considering a merger as a way to 
remain competitive in the changing health-care environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen of the Valley had been involved in affiliation discussions with Southern 
California Healthcare Systems, which is made up of Huntington Memorial Hospital 
and Methodist Hospital of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two hospitals have agreed to end discussions to allow Queen of the 
Valley and Inter-Community hospital to proceed with negotiations.

SENIORS; HER LIFE IS A REAL EXERCISE IN ENTHUSIASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Patey grew up in the no-nonsense America of Will Rogers. When she 
celebrated her 89th birthday last year, her church congregation stood up and 
applauded, and she pledged to be back this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She was. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Christmas card list has 300 names, even though she has no relatives living 
in the United States. No one in Patey's life doubts she will be back next year 
-- or that she will continue to teach her special brand of physical exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, when a heart ailment interrupted her schedule, Patey 
taught an exercise class at the Beverly Hills Women's Club. She led the class 
for nearly four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Her students miss her and often call to plead for her return. One gave her a 
deadline of mid-January. She wants to meet it. She already knows what she's 
going to say when she comes back: "Well, what do you know? Here I am, thanks to 
God and all your good wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Patey doesn't fit a mold. If ever there were a candidate for Renaissance 
woman, she'd be a contender. She paints, makes her own stationery, travels and 
is a perennial teacher. She's not guided by any grand philosophies, only the 
deep belief that she is not alone and the conviction that "you only have the 
things you give away."  
</P>
<P>
 Patey was born of British parents in Chihuahua, Mexico. The family moved to 
Arizona when she was 5 and left for British Columbia a few years later. They 
lived austere and adventurous life of pioneers. Until they moved to California, 
they were educated at home. Patey graduated in 1925 from a school that later 
became part of UCLA, with a major in physical education. She had wanted to be a 
doctor but instead took care of her ailing mother and worked as a physical 
education teacher at Beverly Hills High School. She never married because, she 
says, "I ran too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Patey's brand of exercise is not about speed or hard bodies. "You move in your 
mind before you move in your body. The challenge is how slow can you do that 
(physical) movement. (By moving slowly) a person is working inside their body 
before anything happens outside of it," she said from her home in West Los 
Angeles. The benefit, Patey said, is control, better balance, less exertion and 
the feeling of renewal rather than exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Brock, 81, of Santa Monica has been attending Patey's class since 
1956. "It changed my whole body alignment. I used to have backaches from 
curvature of the spine and I don't have them anymore," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken all kinds of exercise classes from aerobics to tai chi and Janet's 
class is the only one I ever felt rejuvenated from. Most people don't walk 
right and what Janet does for you is loosen the spine, make it more pliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like her class and there is no one like Janet Patey. She 
doesn't take compliments well, so we gossip behind her back and say how 
fabulous she is."

STRESS-REDUCING SPOTS; UNWINDING IN A ROMAN SPA ON BOARD THE NORWAY; TWO WAYS 
TO REJUVENATE, CARIBBEAN-STYLE-IN A CRUISE SHIP MEGA-SPA OR AT A TRANQUIL 
ISLAND RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Each stroke of the house-sized paint brush erased, if only temporarily, one 
more patch of winter pallor, along with a fair share of the stress that had 
gone into creating it. Finally, coated in a layer of warm mud and sealed in 
several layers of aluminum foil, I blissed out to the strains of Pachelbel and 
the distant hum of engines. 
</P>
<P>
 I was floating, figuratively and literally. It didn't really matter that I 
couldn't tell whether this gradually enveloping sense of relaxation had more to 
do with my cozy cocoon of oozing glop or the imperceptible motion of the ship 
-- the Norway -- upon which I'd just embarked, last June, on a weeklong spa at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,032-passenger Norwegian Cruise Line ship would be calling at St. John 
and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and St. Maarten in the Netherlands 
Antilles, but what I was really looking for was seven days of pampering. For 
passengers less than enchanted with the traditional frivolities of a week at 
sea -- you know, napkin folding classes, beer drinking contests, lambada 
lessons and the like -- the Norway offers what it claims to be: one of the 
largest spas afloat, a eucalyptus-scented refuge where aromatherapy massage, 
body wraps, facials and other typical spa pleasures offer a more sedate break 
from weekly pressures and routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 6,000-square-foot spa on one of the ship's lower decks was 
installed three years ago, defying the smaller-than-a-breadbox design 
philosophy generally associated with a ship and offering a range of services as 
varied as those you'd find at many major land-based spas. 
</P>
<P>
 I should say from the start that the whole idea of a spa cruise struck a 
number of people, not least among them several travel agents I consulted, as a 
major contradiction. "Spa?" asked one, as if she'd been asked to book a ski 
weekend on Maui. "People don't go on cruises for spas," she informed me, her 
mind clearly on the culinary excess travel at sea is better known for. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that most passengers on the Norway appeared more interested in the 
midnight buffet and the aft ice cream parlor than the "aroma-derm" facial or 
hydrotherapy massage. Still, I can report that with a heavy dose of willpower, 
it is possible to spend a week on a cruise ship and not have to head directly 
to Jenny Craig upon disembarking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norway offered light, low-fat choices on all dining room menus, and a 
poolside breakfast/lunch buffet with plenty of fresh fruit and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with policing your own calories, you have to do a little schedule 
juggling to get full spa benefits since the exercise programs are supervised by 
the gym staff while massages and other body services are managed in the spa 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's spa program has been planned so that passengers can book one or two 
treatments, $15 to $60 each, or sign up for the six-day "Emperor" package, $689 
for six massages, two facials, manicure or pedicure, three body wraps and full 
use of facilities like steam, sauna and whirlpool. Opt for the Emperor and you 
don't have to worry about ports of call -- you won't have time to see any of 
them. That's why the most popular package, according to one of the spa 
hostesses, is the three-day "Patrician," $359 (similar to the six-day package 
except you get three massages). 
</P>
<P>
 I'd booked a Patrician before the ship pulled away from the dock at the port 
of Miami, leaving the scheduling to the spa staff -- even though past 
experience at land spas had taught me that's not always wise. (Who wants a 
massage right before two hours of body sculpting; you want it after, right?) 
But the Norway's staff members not only seemed plugged in to that mentality, 
they were also more than willing to juggle both times and services. So, what 
can you do during a spa day at sea? 
</P>
<P>
 We started most mornings with a hike on the jogging track that circled one 
deck, 3.5 laps to the mile. (Serious runners were frustrated by not being 
allowed on it before 8 a.m. in deference to the sleeping habits of people in 
the nearby high-ticket cabins.) To encourage runners/walkers to use the track, 
anyone doing 35 laps got a 10-mile club certificate at week's end. To me, the 
exhilaration of running with a 360-degree ocean view was incentive enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when walking in circles was becoming monotonous, we docked off St. John, 
where the fitness staff gathered the die-hards for a 6:45 a.m. hike up a hill 
steep enough to make you wish you'd had room for hiking boots in your luggage. 
Our small but determined band of about 15 chugged the mile and a half in about 
20 minutes, arriving on a small, deserted beach that -- and this is major when 
you're on a ship with 2,000 other people -- no one else knew about. At that 
point we had a choice. Stay on the beach and enjoy a couple hours of relative 
isolation or follow the instructors back down the hill, double-time, and be 
rewarded with breakfast at a local dive they swore makes the best banana 
pancakes in the islands. See how easy it is to be led astray? 
</P>
<P>
 Back on ship, that transgression had to be redeemed with a couple hours in the 
fitness center. Like most modern cruise ships, the Norway's fitness facilities 
are vast and state-of-the-art. Along with the full line of exercise equipment, 
there's an extensive schedule of excellent aerobics and toning classes, all in 
a glass-walled gym that allows you to remember you're at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a small gym down in the spa, for those wanting a quick cycle or 
Stairmaster between treatments. Mostly, though, the spa was reserved for 
chilling out. At the center of it all, a freshwater pool surrounded by marble 
columns and comfortable lounge chairs served as both the arena for water 
aerobics and a place for relaxing between treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the packages, the spa menu lists several innovative offerings. For 
winter-weary travelers, the pre-tanning treatment makes a lot of sense. It 
starts with a body scrub and facial peel, then ends with a light massage using 
sunscreen instead of typical massage oil. At $45, it's money well spent.  
</P>
<P>
 Also popular is the couples' massage instruction, which seemed to attract not 
only the numerous newlyweds aboard but a fair sampling of the 25th to 40th 
anniversary crowd. And there was the Alphamassager, a futuristic looking 
contraption that you climb into, which bombards you with heat, ionized air, 
aromatherapy, a gentle rocking motion and the sounds of the ocean (recorded, 
not real life) all at once. They're said to be very popular in Japan, but I 
wasn't especially looking forward to being encapsulated for half an hour. 
Oddly, though, it's been the sensation I've looked back on most frequently 
since coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 As at any spa, I liked some treatments and some therapists better than others. 
But in general the Norway gets high marks for both, and especially the latter, 
an international mix of enthusiastic young people. The one major flaw I found 
was an extremely hard sell. The spa staff works for minimal wages, and though a 
12% gratuity is added to all spa charges, they make most money from commissions 
earned by pushing French beauty products used in treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, the full-court press seemed to get less relentless as the week 
wore on, perhaps because the staff started to learn who was buying and who 
wasn't. Still, it was hard to say no to kids like Elemir from Norway with the 
magical hands and Nikki from outside London with the Eliza Doolittle voice you 
had to hope no real-life Henry Higgins would ever trifle with. By the end of 
the cruise, I ended up knowing several spa staffers so well it was hard to say 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubtful I would have ever felt that way about a lambada teacher. GUIDEBOOK

STRESS-REDUCING SPOTS; TWO WAYS TO REJUVENATE, CARIBBEAN-STYLE-IN A CRUISE SHIP 
MEGA-SPA OR AT A TRANQUIL ISLAND RESORT; SAMPLING RETREATS ON ST. LUCIA, ST. 
MAARTEN AND JAMAICA

 When my parents first took me to the Caribbean when I was 10, some 25 years 
ago, we rented an A-frame house on a quiet beach in Antigua. The highlight of 
the trip for me was meeting a local girl my age while playing in the sand. She 
invited us to her home, down the beach. We joined her family for a lunch of 
fish her uncle had caught that morning, sweet cornmeal steamed in banana 
leaves, and tall glasses of clear coconut water. At the end of our vacation, 
one of their neighbors came all the way to the airport to see us off, bringing 
a gift of homemade hot pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, that was what Caribbean pampering was all about: strangers 
being graciously drawn into the friendly pulse of an island. I've returned to 
the West Indies countless times since then, on vacations and on assignments to 
write magazine and newspaper articles. Today busy hotels stand along the 
once-serene shore where my new friend and I fashioned sandy fortresses. 
Residents are still affable throughout most of the Caribbean, but invitations 
to home-cooked meals are almost as uncommon as fur coats. On more than a few 
islands, part of the change is that pampering now comes in the form of 
sophisticated health spas at plush resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not referring to the old style European spas where wealthy, elderly people 
went to soak in mineral baths and be cared for by doctors. And I don't mean 
simply massages and weight rooms. These full-scale health and fitness retreats 
offer a menu of exotic treatments; the exercise classes often include reggae 
dance or step classes, and there's usually state-of-the-art exercise equipment. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At Caribbean spas, meals may not qualify as strict "spa cuisine." When it's 
time for a culinary workout, diners usually have a choice of hearty fare and 
lighter selections, with an emphasis on tropical fruits, vegetables, seafood, 
and lean meats. Menus usually include a variety of high-style/high-health 
creations such as pumpkin bisque, red snapper with papaya relish, and passion 
fruit sorbet. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of warning: These hotels aren't for bargain hunters. During the more 
expensive winter season, rates begin at about $300 a night for two people 
sharing a double room. Some of the best are all-inclusive and can cost $400 or 
$500 a night. But this covers all meals, drinks, most sports and spa services 
-- and means that once guests arrive, they never have to open their wallets. 
Also, many spas offer day packages for travelers who prefer to save by staying 
elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 The first time I visited a Caribbean spa a few years ago, I was hooked, and 
I've been to many of the 20-odd in the region. With dry, sunny days and cool 
evenings, the winter months are a great time to go. The resorts usually offer 
expert guidance in choosing treatments and activities, but in contrast to the 
Marine-Corps-style regimens of some health retreats, most have no structured 
daily schedule. They usually allow vacationers to create their own balance 
between spa activities and diversions such as hiking, jogging, sailing, 
snorkeling, scuba diving, golf and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the best aspects of visiting a spa that's part of a tropical 
resort -- as opposed to the classic self-contained type -- is that traveling 
companions don't have to be perfectly in sync. My boyfriend, who sometimes 
travels with me, isn't into seaweed wraps or stretch classes, so he can head 
for the golf course, the tennis court or the beach while I do my thing. Perhaps 
because of the wide choice of non-spa activities, these Caribbean health 
retreats seem to attract almost equal numbers of women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 When people ask my favorites, I tell them about two places in St. Lucia: the 
Oasis at LeSPORT (with its extensive, guided spa program) and Jalousie 
Plantation (with wonderful views); one in St. Maarten: Port de Plaisance (with 
attractive architecture); and, in Jamaica, Ciboney Ocho Rios (with exceptional 
villas). 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since I first went to St. Lucia a few years ago to cover their 
water-sports festival, I'd heard great things about the Oasis spa at LeSPORT 
resort on the northwest coast of this island in the Eastern Caribbean. Last 
summer, I finally got the chance to stay there. Attracting many Europeans, 
LeSPORT sits at the edge of Cariblue Beach, about 20 minutes from Castries, the 
island's capital.  
</P>
<P>
 With dramatic Moorish archways, tall columns, decorative tiles and fountains, 
the Oasis spa complex mirrors the Alhambra palace in Grenada, Spain. It is 
perched on a hill overlooking the rest of the all-inclusive resort, and is one 
of the few spas in the Caribbean where a prescribed treatment program is 
designed for each guest. My warm-up began my first morning as I climbed the 72 
steps to the entrance. Each new guest was interviewed and examined by the 
resident nurse. Then we were given schedules of the three treatments we would 
have each day. Clad in white robes, we floated in and out of the private 
treatment rooms along open-air corridors surrounding the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Caribbean spas, the staff is overwhelmingly European, American or 
Canadian. When I've asked why this is so, I've received mumbled responses about 
the expense of training or the lack of interest among residents. But here, I 
was pleased to find that the highly skilled, extremely warm attendants were all 
St. Lucians. 
</P>
<P>
 LeSPORT claims to be the first resort to bring thalassotherapy to the West 
Indies. Dating to early Greek and Roman civilizations and prescribed by doctors 
in France today, this series of baths and underwater massages is said to allow 
the vitamins and minerals in seaweed and seawater to penetrate the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwater jets gently pummeled my body with salt water as I relaxed in an 
algae bath. During a seaweed wrap, I was slathered with a marine plant mixture 
whose smell made me think I was being served at a sushi bar. Then I was wrapped 
in plastic and covered with a heated blanket. After a sea-salt and oil loofa 
rub, my skin tingled and glowed. 
</P>
<P>
 A jet hose shower gave my circulation a boost. Standing 12 feet away and 
chatting with her daughter who was visiting from Florida, the attendant used a 
high-pressure stream of seawater to knead my muscles. The essential oils 
(extracted from flowers, spices, herbs and woods) were wonderfully fragrant 
during my aromatherapy massage.  
</P>
<P>
 While I waited on the balcony between treatments, I watched the step and dance 
classes through glass walls -- and caught my shoulders bouncing to the muffled 
calypso tunes. I took a few step classes myself and worked out on the cycles 
and Multi-Gym. But the stepping I enjoyed most was the daily 7 a.m. hike, 
during which our guide led us along winding roads, past sweeping views of 
undulating hillsides and sea-shimmering shades of turquoise, teal and navy.  
</P>
<P>
 All meals at LeSPORT were served in a breezy, alfresco dining room. The food 
was delicious. I couldn't resist second helpings of christophine (a 
zucchini-like vegetable) with onions and peppers or the soup made from callaloo 
(a cousin of spinach). But the cuisine legere (low-calorie) menu wasn't as 
light as it was touted to be. Cream sauces and fried potatoes (no matter how 
thinly sliced) aren't going to melt pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman I met while soaking in the thermal springs in southern St. Lucia raved 
about the setting of the island's other spa, nearby. So I decided to buy an 
eight-hour pass to this all-inclusive resort. With a small beach, Jalousie 
Plantation is in a startlingly scenic part of the island. It sits between the 
Pitons, the island's twin conical mountains. The Sugar Mill rooms (in the main 
hotel) and the one-bedroom cottages (with private plunge pools) face the water. 
</P>
<P>
 My $75 pass covered all meals, sports, and access to some spa facilities for 
one day. Guests staying at the resort are treated to two 25-minute massages a 
week. Both overnight and day visitors also have use of the whirlpool, men's and 
women's saunas, exercise equipment, aerobics and dance classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacuzzi and hot and cold plunge pools look out on the ocean and the 
Pitons. I spent some time lounging in the whirlpool as I sipped a glass of 
tangy soursop juice and drank in the view. Then I took a calypso dance class. 
Afterward, I tried some of the treatments for which both overnight guests and 
day-trippers pay an additional charge (ranging from about $15 to $60). The 
Vichy shower was wonderful: First my body was rubbed with a loofah and algae 
oil for about 20 minutes, then I had an invigorating 15-minute shower with 
water shooting from tiny nozzles all around me. As I sat in an oversized 
hydrotherapy tub, plankton-rich thermal waters forced through underwater jets 
soothed my limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountainous beauty and low-key charms of the half-French, half-Dutch 
island of St. Martin/St. Maarten in the Netherlands Antilles thoroughly 
impressed me when I first visited about a decade ago. But several years later, 
when I saw all the new hotels, gaudy casinos and T-shirt stalls, I vowed never 
to return. Then at a party a few months ago, I overheard someone talking -- to 
say "enthusiastically" would be an understatement -- about a recent vacation at 
Port de Plaisance Spa & Tennis Center on the Dutch side. He persuaded me to 
give the island another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Port de Plaisance overlooks boat-studded Simpson Bay Lagoon. Especially in the 
orange glow of the sinking sun, the marina is a gorgeous sight. Surrounding 
this cove, the resort's white gingerbread buildings are trimmed in sky blue and 
topped with red roofs. As I walked around the peaceful grounds, I almost forgot 
there was a busy casino on the premises. The artificial beach is only good for 
sunbathing, but guests are transported by boat to a natural sandy strand for 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 It was last fall when my boyfriend and I arrived for a long weekend. Our 
luxurious suite, typical of all the guest units, was so spacious we were 
tempted to gather some folks and throw a party.  
</P>
<P>
 I began each day with a guided fitness walk around the grounds or an 
aqua-aerobics class in the outdoor 23.5-meter lap pool. Then my boyfriend and I 
worked out on Lifecycle machines, treadmills, stationary bikes or the rowing 
machine. We each arranged to have a one-on-one fitness and weight training 
session in which the trainer gave us pointers on how we could improve our 
exercise routines at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day I had a wonderful "deluxe hydration" facial that seemed to last 
forever. Beauty treatments (such as facials, eye masks and pedicures) are 
surprisingly varied for a Caribbean resort. Rates run from about $10 for a 
firming neck mask to $70 for an aromatherapy full body massage lasting an hour 
and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its strong culture, thriving arts scene, rugged mountains and 
jungled greenery, Jamaica is probably my favorite Caribbean island. But there 
are parts of it I could do without. If I hadn't been on assignment, I never 
would have stayed in tourist-packed Ocho Rios on the north shore last spring. 
Being bombarded by hawkers selling ganja (marijuana) and mass-produced wood 
carvings is not my idea of fun. But Ciboney Ocho Rios resort was an oasis amid 
the frenzy.  
</P>
<P>
 Sand and sea may be just across the road, but the all-inclusive hotel boasts 
90 swimming pools. The main one is shared by guests in the 36 rooms in 
picturesque Great House, built to resemble an old plantation manor. Other pools 
are exclusively for vacationers staying in the hotel's hillside villas and 
cottages.  
</P>
<P>
 I booked one of the special villas, each of which has a private pool and 
Jacuzzi in an enclosed courtyard. All villas come with attendants who prepare 
breakfast (and other meals upon request) as well as afternoon cocktails by the 
private pool.  
</P>
<P>
 The day I arrived, a skilled masseuse worked the kinks out of my neck and 
shoulders in the solarium, by the spa in the Great House. In this cheerful 
room, sunlight streamed onto tropical plants growing from the rough stone 
walls. All Ciboney guests receive one back and neck massage, a manicure, one 
pedicure, a 25-minute full-body Swedish massage and foot reflexology. A gym, 
whirlpool and men's and women's steam rooms and saunas are available, as well 
as aerobics classes.

<P>
 Since most Caribbean spas don't offer rigid regimens or true spa cuisine, they 
may not shave off many pounds -- but hey, muscle weighs more than fat, right? 
And a few days at one of these resorts whenever I can afford it sure helps 
restore my peace of mind.

TRAVEL INSIDER: A SHORT BUT HEARTFELT LIST OF PET PEEVES FROM THE ROAD; 
COMPLAINTS: FROM MISSING WASHCLOTHS TO NOISY AIRPORTS, THINGS THAT COULD BE 
IMPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a frequent traveler, I have a gripe. Actually, I have lots of gripes. And 
what road warrior doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
 The folks who run the nation's airports, hotels and car rental firms say they 
want to make life easier for business travelers, but they seem to be missing 
some obvious opportunities to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the irritating placement of washcloths in hotel bathrooms. 
At home, my washcloth hangs within easy reach of my shower. Wouldn't you think 
hotels could arrange to do the same? But they don't -- well, not many of them 
anyway. Typically, the cloths are tucked in a basket along with the miniature 
bottles of shampoo, and the baskets invariably sit on the far side of the 
bathroom. I should know better, but I usually don't remember this until I've 
begun to soap up. I'm forced to splash out of the shower and drip across the 
floor to retrieve an item that should be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't hotel officials ever take showers? You wouldn't think so, based on the 
way they organize their guest bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you're going to say my problem here is a petty one, given the grievances 
that abound in this world, and I'll readily agree. My pet peeves -- I've 
compiled a list -- are essentially quite minor. I've never felt angry enough to 
complain to the management about any of them. But when you encounter these 
irritants week after week, as I and other business travelers do, they build 
into a wearisome hassle that I think could all be resolved quite easily with a 
little thoughtful effort on the part of the people who cater to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interrupting phone calls. After I've stood in line at a car rental counter, 
I want the clerk's full attention when it's finally my turn to check in. But 
surprisingly often, my rental is delayed while the single clerk on duty takes a 
complicated reservation from someone who has interrupted with a phone call. I 
wait while the intruder is given priority treatment, and it annoys me every 
time. In a just world, the rental clerk would place the caller on hold until my 
rental has been processed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Noisy air terminals. In the past year or two, a new and noisy distraction 
has been inflicted on passengers waiting to board a flight. At too many 
airports these days, overhead television sets have been installed, and they 
blare loudly and indiscriminately to the willing and the unwilling. My 
suggestion to airport officials is to turn down the volume -- so only those 
directly in front can hear -- and keep the number of TV sets to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 * Undecipherable receipts. As a business traveler, I'm expected to fill out an 
expense account after every trip. One of my big expenses is lodging, and I 
count on getting a readable bill listing my charges when I check out of a 
hotel. But it is amazing how many hotels make their bills complicated 
documents. I run into trouble especially if I have charged meals to my account 
over a period of days. "Is this item dinner or breakfast?" I wonder, "and on 
what day?" 
</P>
<P>
 * No space for a razor. Who designs hotel bathrooms? Stay-at-homes? When I 
travel, I tote a ditty bag with toothbrush, razor and other essentials, and I 
like to lay them out near the bathroom sink when I'm unpacking. But in many 
hotels, often the only space provided is the top of the toilet. Is it too much 
to ask for a decent shelf in the vicinity of the sink? 
</P>
<P>
 * Missing bed lights. As is now apparent, a number of my peeves stem from 
inadequate hotel rooms. Somehow many hotel managers seem incapable of providing 
a user-friendly room -- and the luxury properties are as guilty as the budget 
chains. Every room rented to two people should have two reading lights -- 
preferably installed overhead on the wall above each side of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insufficient airport seating. In many crowded airports, there simply aren't 
enough seats for everyone waiting for the next flight. Will all airport 
designers and managers please do something about this? 
</P>
<P>
 * Limited athletic facility hours. Hotels tempt business travelers with fancy 
athletic facilities to keep them fit on the road. I'm all for this, but 
curiously, time and again I've found that unthinking hotels have restricted the 
hours of the pool to the point that it is of no use to me. If it doesn't open 
until 9 a.m., it's too late for me to swim, have breakfast and get to work on 
time. If it closes at 6 p.m., I'm probably just getting back from work and 
don't have time for before-dinner laps. When hotels cater to business 
travelers, I suggest they keep their athletic facilities open early and late -- 
even if this means closing them at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Uninformed desk clerks. It is surprising how little some desk clerks know 
about the day-to-day operation of their hotels -- witness this little exchange 
I had over the phone in a big chain hotel in Lynchburg, Va. At about 8 a.m. I 
called the front desk. "What time does your pool open?" I asked. "Oh, it will 
open some time this morning," I was told. "But when?" I persisted. The clerk 
told me she would check, and finally, a voice told me, "Why, the pool is open 
right now." So I donned my bathing suit and descended four floors to the pool 
-- located not more than 30 yards from the front desk. There an attendant 
informed me he had just poured in a bunch of chemicals and I would have to wait 
for half an hour. No guest ought to be put through this, but it happens.

THE EMERGING FACE OF CRAZY HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Details are emerging in the face of Crazy Horse, the world's largest 
sculptural undertaking, in the Black Hills of South Dakota. In recent months, 
the eyes have been refined, eyebrows carved, lips roughed in and the bridge of 
the nose cut.So far, about 8.4 million tons of granite have been removed from 
the project, which was started in 1948 and has a target completion date of 
2000. The Crazy Horse Memorial, which honors Lakota leader Crazy Horse, and all 
Native Americans, was designed by the late Korczak Ziolkowski, who was asked to 
carve it after winning a sculpture prize at the 1939 New York World's Fair. He 
died in 1982 and his widow, Ruth, is overseeing the project. Long-range plans 
envision a museum and training center at the site. Crazy Horse, which receives 
no federal or state funding, is open to the public year-round. Last year, about 
1.3 million people visited the nine-story-high face.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; BEAT THE CROWDS -- GET YOUR PASSPORT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Get your passport now and beat the summer rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, which issued more than 4 million U.S. passports in 1993, 
expects demand to remain high in 1994 because of discounted international air 
fares and because several million 10-year passports are expiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Passport offices are deluged with travelers in the spring and summer, but 
demand is generally lower now through February. 
</P>
<P>
 The most convenient way to apply for a passport is at one of the 3,500 
designated post offices or clerks of the court, where the lines are generally 
shorter than at the 13 passport agencies around the United States. In Los 
Angeles, the passport agency is at the Federal Building in Westwood, 11000 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 13100. Hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has a detailed tape recording covering all aspects of passport 
applications and renewals. The line is heavily used and often busy. Keep 
calling. The number is (310) 575-7070. In many cases, you can renew your 
passport by mail. Instructions are covered in the tape recording. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department has issued a pamphlet with more information on applying 
for a passport and traveling abroad. To obtain a copy of "Passports: Applying 
for Them the Easy Way," send 50 cents to the Consumer Information Center, 
Pueblo, Colo. 81009.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: CABO SAN LUCAS; ECONO-DIVE; THIS SCUBA AFICIONADO TOOK 
ADVANTAGE OF A BAJA CALIFORNIA DIVE PACKAGE FOR A THREE-DAY VACATION THAT 
DIDN'T COST MUCH MORE THAN SOME LOCAL TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITE: Haldane writes for The Times' Orange 
County Edition Metro section. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that I was in for a decidedly different experience first struck me 90 
feet beneath the surface of the Sea of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 Sucking air from my regulator, I was hovering over the Sandfall, a place much 
favored by divers visiting this gem of a town on the southern tip of Baja 
California. Jacques Cousteau discovered this phenomenon in the early 1960s -- a 
natural trough in a sheer vertical wall plunging some 3,000 feet into the 
ocean's inky depths. And cascading down its face -- fed, Cousteau theorized, by 
a constant circular current -- flowed a steady stream of sand . 
</P>
<P>
 My mind did a somersault. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of others, I had been to Yosemite, where some of the world's 
most breathtaking waterfalls cascade in wild abandon over rock. Here, in an 
exact reversal of terrestrial reality, earth flowed through water. The scene's 
wackiness came to symbolize my feelings about Mexico: a parched desert of 
cactus and dust above ground, underwater a tropical forest teeming with 
colorful flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersea wonders have been a part of my life since I took up scuba diving as a 
teen-ager. For the past several years, the hobby has taken me on annual 
vacations to tropical dive destinations around the world -- the Florida Keys, 
Grand Cayman, Hawaii, Fiji, Honduras, Cozumel, Akumal and Eleuthera in the 
Bahamas -- spots where the water is warm, the visibility endless and the fruit 
drinks plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 This year I was planning a trip to Belize, a supposed diver's paradise in 
northern Central America. Like many Californians, however, I have experienced 
recent economic reversals -- in my case a divorce -- that made me balk at the 
notion of spending nearly $3,000 for a seven-day vacation. Reluctant to give up 
my annual dive trip altogether, I searched for a more economical alternative. I 
found it in Cabo San Lucas, where you can experience world-class diving at 
middle-class prices -- just $396 for the package I found, which included 
round-trip air fare, three nights at a quiet, modest hotel in the center of 
town, and two days of guided diving with boat, dive master and all equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the less thrift-minded, other packages range up to $771 for a suite at 
Hotel Palmilla, a luxury facility with a golf course and fishing fleet. Add 
$500 for first-class flying. 
</P>
<P>
 My own trip got off to a shaky start when, after arriving at LAX on a Friday 
for the 7 a.m. Aero California flight to Cabo, our departure was delayed 3 1/2 
hours due to a malfunctioning air-conditioning system. The delay lasted longer 
than the 2-hour-10-minute flight. I can't even describe the feeling of relief I 
felt when the plane finally took off. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early October, a full five weeks before a series of devastating 
thunderstorms was to close the Cabo airport. But friends tell me that 
conditions have since returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 My package didn't include hotel transfers, so after strolling into the airport 
lobby, I walked up to the first official-looking person I saw and asked for an 
$8 ticket for the 45-minute van trip into town. He turned out to be a 
time-share salesman, but he sold me the ticket anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel Mar de Cortez has a completely nondescript entryway on a side street 
near downtown. The lobby is actually on an outdoor patio, as is the hotel 
restaurant. Above all, the place is utilitarian. Because it had no alarm clock, 
telephone, television or radio, I had to rely on the early light to coax me 
awake the next morning, which it obligingly did. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8:45 a.m., after a quick hotel restaurant breakfast of coffee, 
Mexican-style scrambled eggs and tortillas with beans, I was ready for the 
four-block stroll through the humid heat of town to the marina where the dive 
boat was moored. The town wraps itself around the water like a glove, and its 
cobblestone streets slope gently down toward the ocean. Like most Mexican 
towns, this one first presents itself by its smells: the whiff of corn 
tortillas from the open-air restaurants mingled with the fumes of petroleum 
from passing cars.  
</P>
<P>
 After a briefing at Pacific Coast Adventures dive shop, one of six dive shops 
in town and the one through which I'd booked my package, we were ready to go. 
The shop is in a building next to the marina, just a few hundred yards from 
where the dive boat Pegasus is moored. Throwing our dive bags over our 
shoulders, the day's paying customers -- myself and a newly certified couple 
from Santa Monica -- walked out to the 26-foot fiberglass skiff with its 
outboard motor and cramped deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cabo everything is close," Juan Beltran, our 20-year-old Mexican dive 
master, told us on the first day out. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't have been more right; within half an hour we were staring bug-eyed 
at the Sandfall's trickling underwater wonders. Later we motored over to a 
nearby strand called Lover's Beach, a place to rest in the sun and drink Cokes 
while our bodies accumulated enough surface time to dissipate unwanted nitrogen 
and avoid getting the bends. Then it was back on board for the short trip to 
the Pinnacle, a magical place of contrasting temperatures, strange optical 
illusions and abundant sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 2 p.m. when we got back to shore. Not wanting to make a major 
production of lunch, I shelled out $4 for a couple of tacos from one of the 
numerous open stands near the water. Then, drinking in the view of ships in the 
harbor beneath an ink-blue sky, I began walking up the path toward town, taking 
in the shops along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a place selling marionettes that dangled on tangled strings. Another 
shop specialized in miniature guitars painted bright blue and red.  
</P>
<P>
 Dinner that night was a whole new adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 On the advice of a young Mexican tourist guide sitting at a table in the hotel 
lobby, I walked a few blocks to Mi Casa, a romantic restaurant next to the town 
square on Calle de Cabo San Lucas. There I paid $27 to sit in a cheerful 
courtyard eating enchiladas suissas and drinking margaritas while a gigantic 
brown moth fluttered daintily overhead. The most memorable thing about the meal 
was the cactus salad (my first), which tasted vaguely like a nutty version of 
shredded avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty much the only thing to do after dinner in Cabo, especially if you're 
alone, is check out the clubs. I started with Cabo Wabo, a live rock club owned 
by guitarist Van Halen a few doors down from my hotel on Vicente Guerrero 
Street. At 10 on a Saturday night, the place had only 15 patrons -- it was 
definitely dead. Later I hiked across town to El Squid Roe, where an overflow 
crowd of patrons in their 20s danced frantically to "Hang on Snoopy" while a 
waiter dressed as Pancho Villa poured shots of tequila down people's throats 
before ceremoniously wiping their chins with a towel.  
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, not quite my scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to its reputation, in fact, I found the Cabo night scene not 
particularly hospitable to singles traveling alone; most tourists seemed to 
move in groups or pairs. Still, I managed to make some friends. Hanging out at 
the Rio Grill, a neighborhood bar on the Boulevard Marina, I met 60-year-old 
Jud Millard, who said that he'd come down six months earlier from Northern 
California to work on a friend's house and decided to stay. One night on a 
sunset cruise, I befriended an interesting couple from Phoenix with whom I 
later shared dinner and ice cream cones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the center of the experience for me was the diving, always the diving. 
</P>
<P>
 The best day, I think, was that first one when the couple from Santa Monica 
and I went from the Sandfall to the Pinnacle, a rock formation a few hundred 
yards from the famous arched rocks of Cabo where the Pacific Ocean meets the 
Sea of Cortez.

 It was the kind of day divers pray for, with 90-foot visibility and gently 
rolling swells. At one point, having dropped off a sheer rock cliff into 70 
feet of water surrounded by a host of colorful trigger fish, king angels, 
trumpets and clarions, we were suddenly joined underwater by a group of curious 
and playful sea lions.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a myriad of exotic marine life inhabiting these waters: from the 
sluggish porcupine puffers that inflate to football size when squeezed gently 
in the middle, to the giant bat rays gliding through the water like huge flying 
saucers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, something strange happens here where the 75-degree waters of the 
Pacific mingle with the 85-degree waters of the Sea of Cortez, making 
underwater explorers feel, alternately, as if they are in a Jacuzzi and an 
unheated pool. The effect is not unlike the mixing of oil and vinegar, a sort 
of underwater fuzziness that envelopes divers in dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is not a dream, of course, any more than Cabo itself is a dream. It 
is the lush marine forest next to the scalding Mexican desert, where the sand 
granules of an underwater sandfall mark slowly the passage of time. My hope is 
that not too much more of it passes before I return. Budget for One

HIKING: VASQUEZ ROCKS: SOUTHLAND'S NO. 1 ROCK STAR, AT AGUA DULCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are, you've seen the rocks on TV and the big screen many times -- from 
old Westerns to modern sci-fi films. And you've probably seen Vasquez Rocks 
while motoring along the Antelope Valley Freeway; the famed formations are but 
a couple of miles from California 14. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best place to see the Southland's most famous geological silhouette is 
Vasquez Rocks County Park Natural Area in Agua Dulce. Hiking trails circle the 
rocks, which are not only enjoyable to view, but fun to climb upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a camera lens, and from a distance, the rocks look insurmountable; 
actually, they're rather easy to climb. The rocks are only 100 to 150 feet 
high, and you can find safe and mellow routes to the top of the sandstone 
outcrops. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocks themselves are tilted and worn sandstone, the result of millions of 
years of earthquake action and erosion by elements. The big beds of sedimentary 
rock known as the Mint Canyon Formation were laid down some eight to 15 million 
years ago. The Vasquez Rocks Formation is composed of coarser, redder layers 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Tataviam Indians occupied the area until the late 1700s, when their culture 
was overwhelmed and eventually extinguished by the soldiers, settlers and 
missionaries of the San Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1850s and 1860s, notorious highwayman Tiburcio Vasquez used the 
rocks and canyons as a hide-out from the Los Angeles lawmen who were pursuing 
him. Even before he was hung for his crimes in 1875, the area was known as 
Vasquez Rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail system at Vasquez Rocks is a bit informal. Because of the open 
nature of the terrain, hikers can -- and do -- tend to wander where their rock 
fancy takes them. If you remember that the park entrance/office is more or less 
to the north and the Antelope Valley Freeway to the south, you'll stay fairly 
well oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite route of mine, a clockwise tour of three miles or so, is described 
below; however, part of the fun of Vasquez Rocks is going your own way. 
Directions to trail head: From the Antelope Valley Freeway (14), a few miles 
northeast of the outskirts of Canyon Country, exit on Agua Dulce Canyon Road. 
Head north 1 1/2 miles. Agua Dulce Canyon Road swings west and you join 
Escondido Canyon Road, proceeding a quarter-mile to the signed Vasquez Rocks 
County Park entrance on your right. You can park just inside the entrance at 
the small parking area near the park office, or continue to the main lot near 
the largest of the rock formations. It costs $3 to park on Saturdays, Sundays 
and holidays. The hike: Begin at the signed trail head for "Geology Trail" just 
across the park road from the parking lot. (Pick up an interpretive brochure, 
as well as a trail map, from the office.) Soon after you begin your trail-side 
study of strata, Geology Trail intersects the famed Pacific Crest Trail and 
you'll head right. 
</P>
<P>
 The mile-long stretch of PCT through the park is part of a segment that 
connects the San Gabriel Mountains to the south with the Sierra Pelona area of 
Angeles National Forest to the north. The path parallels the park road. To your 
left are some scattered residences and the open desert beyond; to your right 
are some of the most famous of the Vasquez Rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Crest Trail joins a dirt road at the edge of a picnic area and 
continues west atop the north wall of Escondido Canyon. Very few park visitors, 
it seems, hike here, though the rock formations are stunning and a seasonal 
creek flows through the canyon. Only the annoying hum of the nearby Antelope 
Valley Freeway disturbs the natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 You can cross the creek with the PCT, double back along the other side of 
Escondido Canyon, and continue your exploration of the little-known southern 
part of the park. But to continue to the main rock formations, stay west with 
the dirt road and you'll soon reach a junction with the park's horse trail. You 
can take this trail if you wish, or continue a short distance farther and join 
the foot trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vasquez Rocks area is a transition zone between mountain and desert 
environments. Yucca, buckwheat, sage and California juniper are among the 
plants you'll pass en route. 
</P>
<P>
 The footpath drops northwestward, then heads east to visit the most dramatic 
of the Vasquez Rocks. Pacific Crest Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Vasquez Rocks County Park Natural Area. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 1-3 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Tilted sandstone outcrops, sagebrush- and juniper-covered hills. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Breathtaking geological formations, rock climbing.

 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy.

CRUISE VIEWS: CHAMPAGNE AND KEELHAULS FOR ANOTHER YEAR ON THE HIGH SEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, it's time to salute the highlights and low-lights of cruising and 
the cruise industry during 1993, a year marked by a glut of new ships, 
discounts and deals, mergers and acquisitions and, last April, the $500,000 
fine to Princess Cruises for a 1991 pollution incident in which 20 bags of 
garbage tossed over the side of the Regal Princess was recorded by a passenger 
with a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a year in which the states of California and Alaska banned cruise ship 
gambling between ports-of-call in state waters. Also one in which federal 
lawmakers introduced a flurry of bills (most still pending) aimed at taxing 
foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from U.S. ports in order to raise revenues 
to help revive the American shipbuilding industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * For starters, a champagne toast to the city of Key West, Fla., which has 
proven that an American port of call can offer an outstanding experience to 
cruise passengers. From the friendly volunteers who greet each disembarking 
passenger to the colorful open-air Conch Train that wends its way around the 
charming town, this easily accessible port of call is a real winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * A keelhaul to Epirotiki Caribazon Cruises for the most misleading cruise ad 
of the year, which appeared in travel-trade publications in October. The ad 
advised travel agents that their clients who book Amazon River sailings this 
winter between Belem and Manaus, Brazil, can see a jaguar "from the comfort of 
their deck chairs." It also promised sightings of pink dolphins and other 
exotic flora and fauna. As veterans of Amazon cruises know, passengers can't 
always see the banks of this extremely wide river from a cruise ship, let alone 
glimpse a nocturnal endangered species . . . lurking in the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 * A split of champagne to the U.S. Public Health Service's vessel sanitation 
program for making education, not punishment, the main focus of its shipboard 
sanitation inspections. When infractions are found, galley employees and other 
workers are told how to correct the situation and given a reinspection as soon 
as possible. Case in point: The new Spanish-language cruise ship FiestaMarina 
scored 75 (the passing grade is 86) on its first inspection Nov. 5, but 
corrected the problems cited and requested a reinspection. On Dec. 17, the ship 
was reinspected and received a score of 94. 
</P>
<P>
 * A keelhaul to Kloster Cruise Limited, whose executives spent the entire year 
denying that the corporation's Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Viking Line were 
up for sale, all the while shopping them around. Published rumors ranged from 
last January's hint of a Carnival buyout to an early December rumor of a 
takeover by the Carlson Companies, who also run the Radisson Diamond. Kloster 
finally announced in mid-December that the firm had signed a letter of intent 
to sell the two lines to a New York investment firm, AEA Investors, for $565 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * A champagne toast to S. Cody Engle for his long-range plans for the two 
U.S.-flag ships of American Hawaii Cruises, the Constitution and Independence. 
Engle, who acquired American Hawaii Cruises last summer, is also chairman and 
CEO of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. Plans for the Constitution and 
Independence call for more on-board emphasis on Hawaiian culture and heritage, 
as well as renovations to bring the pair of 1951 American-built vessels back to 
their original splendor. The Constitution was the ship Grace Kelly and her 
wedding party sailed aboard to Monaco in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 * A keelhaul to those Caribbean islands -- Jamaica, Barbados and St. Lucia are 
among them -- whose political leaders think that the way to fill their coffers 
is by raising the head tax to as much as double the present rate for 
cruise-ship passengers on day visits. The money would come directly from 
passenger pockets in the form of an increased port tax supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 * A champagne toast to the island of Curacao, one of the few Caribbean islands 
aggressively taking a positive tack with its cruise passengers. A 
recently-introduced program allows cruise stopover passengers to receive $500 
worth of discount coupons from their travel agents, good for meals, gifts, 
entertainment or tours while on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 * A keelhaul to California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, whose staunch crusade 
against shipboard gambling may end up costing California taxpayers money. A 
Lungren-backed state bill, which went into effect this year, bans gambling on 
ships operating between California ports, even beyond the state's three-mile 
jurisdiction. Lungren contended the law was necessary to discourage organized 
crime and prevent a proliferation of floating off-shore casinos on so-called 
"voyages to nowhere." But the port of San Diego says it has lost an estimated 
$6.5 million this year because Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Viking Serenade 
eliminated the weekly San Diego call on its four-day sailing between Los 
Angeles and Ensenada, Mexico, in order to allow passengers access to the ship's 
casino while at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, a farewell champagne toast to Royal Cruise Line's 450-passenger 
Golden Odyssey, the line's first ship and for 20 years the favorite of 
passengers who prefer smaller vessels. The Golden Odyssey retires May 5, to be 
replaced by the Star Odyssey, a renovation of the former Royal Viking Star.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; CHEAP SLEEPS ACROSS THE CONTINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's an inexpensive way to find out about more than 400 cheap places to 
sleep in the United States and Canada: 
</P>
<P>
 The Hostel Handbook is a 23-page booklet listing hostels that offer lodging 
for travelers, often in dormitory rooms, for $5-$22 per night. In areas where 
no suitable hostels exist, the booklet includes locations of inexpensive 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet was created by the staff of New York City's Sugar Hill 
International House Hostel to act as a companion to any guidebook. It doesn't 
include detailed information on the facilities -- just addresses, telephone 
numbers, nightly rates and affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 This book's advantage, editor Jim Williams points out, is that it can be much 
more up-to-date than major guidebooks, which are often researched a year before 
most travelers use them. The Hostel Handbook can include information that has 
been gathered only days before printing. The first edition was published in 
May. An updated pre-1994 edition is now available, and the revised 1994 edition 
will be released at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hostel Handbook does not include any type of rating scale. Williams, for 
one, believes that what's right for one traveler isn't necessarily right for 
another. "One traveler might complain because there is too much of a party 
atmosphere at a particular hostel, while another traveler might be happy with 
the arrangement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbook identifies a variety of organizations that offer budget 
accommodations -- some independent, some affiliated with national or 
international companies, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Youth Hostels (AYH). Some AYH facilities have curfews and 
restrictive check-in hours. Non-members of Hostelling International are usually 
charged $3 extra per night. There is no age limit for guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Assn. of Independent Hostels (AAIH). A network of independent 
hostels that sometimes requires guests to provide a passport or student 
identification of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
 * Backpackers Hostels Canada (BHC). A network of independent hostels in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canadian Hostelling Assn. (CHA). The first edition of this handbook listed 
all CHA hostels in Canada. Future editions will list only hostels in CHA 
regions that request inclusion in the handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hostel Handbook also includes hostels unaffiliated with Hostelling 
International and (for areas where no hostels exist) Motel 6s. Motel 6 prices 
vary by location; a typical charge is $24.95 for one person, $6 more for 
another adult. 
</P>
<P>
 With independent hostels, there are no guarantees. I've visited some excellent 
independent hostels, friendly and clean; but not all are operated like that, so 
it's wise to ask around. The major disadvantage of independent hostels is that 
they don't belong to an organization requiring them to maintain certain 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you settle in, have a good look. Make sure that there are adequate fire 
exits, and that they are not blocked. If you don't feel safe, move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the Hostel Handbook are available for $2 from the Sugar Hill 
International House Hostel, 722 St. Nicholas Ave., New York 10031.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: CLUBS FOR SENIORS WHO WANT TRAVEL COMPANIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of singles clubs for seniors have started in recent years. Most of 
these clubs attempt to find travel companions or roommates for solo senior 
travelers who may be widowed, divorced or have spouses who don't enjoy travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all of these clubs require payment of dues for membership, seniors are 
advised to send for complete information on costs, benefits and other details 
before remitting any fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest singles travel club is New York-based Travel Companion Exchange, 
now in its 13th year of operation. TCE's bimonthly newsletter is filled with 
information on available tours, hotels, resorts, cruises, best destinations, 
air-fare discounts and other bargains, and tips on how to avoid single 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 TCE also publishes a newsletter that lists persons looking for travel 
companions. For a free membership application, including details and prices, 
write to TCE, Box 833, Amityville, N.Y. 11701. For a copy of the current issue 
of the Travel Companions Newsletter, enclose a check payable to TCE for $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Other singles travel clubs with appeal to seniors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Partners-In-Travel, now in its 14th year, offers a free bulletin for new 
members: "More Travel for Less." It gives money-saving tips on accommodations 
and transportation, and other helpful hints. Miriam E. Tobolowsky, who operates 
the club, says that although the group is open to travelers of all ages, about 
90% of its members are 50 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners-In-Travel will run a personal listing in its travel directory for 
anyone who requests it. Membership is $25 per year; the club will send an 
outline of benefits as well as a questionnaire suggesting details to include in 
your listing. Send a long, self-addressed stamped envelope to 
Partners-In-Travel, 11660 Chenault St., No. 119, Los Angeles 90049. 
</P>
<P>
 * Partners For Travel calls itself "a travel resource for single, divorced and 
widowed men and women over age 50." New members fill out a profile detailing 
their interests, background, travel plans and what they are looking for in a 
traveling companion. The information is used to put members in touch with 
others who have similar interests. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on Partners For Travel, plus a free calendar of travel 
events for single seniors, write 801 N. Venetian Drive, Suite 1102, Miami, Fla. 
33139, or call (800) 866-5565. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Golden Companions, based in Pullman, Wash., has been in business 
only about seven years, it has become a popular medium for singles over the age 
of 45 to find travel companions of similar age and interests. The 
more-than-1,000 members range in age from 46 to 89. Golden Companions publishes 
a membership directory that contains an outline of members' interests 
(including travel, sports, hobbies and social activities). 
</P>
<P>
 Annual membership, which includes the companion listings, is $85; a six-month 
trial membership is $48. For complete membership information and an application 
form, write Golden Companions, P.O. Box 754, Pullman, Wash. 99163. Add $2 for a 
copy of the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Solo Flights founder Betty Sobel believes that single mature travelers 
should be able to enjoy what she calls "adventuresome travel." She offers tours 
ranging from one to two weeks, with Costa Rica, the Caribbean and Mexico as 
primary destinations. For descriptive material on Solo Flights, write 63 High 
Noon Road, Weston, Conn. 06883, or call (800) 266-1566.

GEAR & GADGETS; A ROUNDUP OF THE YEAR'S BEST 'MUST-HAVE' TRAVEL PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the new travel year gets into gear, here's a pick of top fundamentals for 
those on the go. We've tested a variety of versions of five "must-have" 
products, and come up with some winners. Herewith, our choice for the best 
luggage wheels, the most comfortable neck pillow, a perfect carry-on shoulder 
bag, a great travel kit and an ideal little padlock for securing zippered 
compartments (prices do not including shipping and handling): 
</P>
<P>
 Most travelers have a love-hate relationship with luggage wheels. They're a 
hassle to schlep around or to stuff into airplane storage areas, and can be 
difficult to open and dismantle -- invariably when you're in a hurry. On the 
other hand, they're a blessing on those long airport corridors and can save big 
bucks on accumulated bellhop tips. The perfect luggage cart -- sturdy, able to 
withstand heavy loads and pint-size when collapsed -- has yet to be invented. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kart-a-Bag, which the family-run Remin Co. has been fine-tuning for 27 
years, grades out as the very best of a burgeoning lot. These wheels are 
certainly not cheap, costing upward of $75, when the least-expensive wheels on 
the market can be had for under $20. But if you're a frequent traveler, you'll 
find the Kart-a-Bag well worth the higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost of its attributes is its assembly and disassembly. The wheels' 
telescoping handle opens up via a squeeze mechanism, about one-third of the way 
up from the base. To extend, you squeeze a double bar across the width, while 
pulling up on the top section of the handle. When fully extended, the 
curtain-rod-like aluminum parts lock in place. The same squeeze motion is used 
to collapse the handle. The base folds upward and is held in place by elastic 
cords. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kart-a-Bag comes in a dozen sizes and weights. Balancing sturdiness and 
compactness, my top choice is the Concorde III, a 7 1/2-pound model that 
accommodates a 175-pound load and collapses down to 18 3/4 inches high by 13 
inches wide by 4 3/4 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Remin Kart-a-Bag Concorde III is about $90 at luggage stores or from the 
manufacturer; (800) 423-9328. The Concorde II (about $80) has smaller wheels 
and lacks the Concorde III's steel stair-curb slides . During 34 hours of 
continuous flying recently, I sampled a slew of travel pillows designed to make 
snoozing on plane, train or car rides easier on the neck and shoulders. Some 
were fleece-covered, one had a snazzy tartan print, another plumped up with a 
hand pump. The simplest of the bunch -- one I had actually been using for years 
-- won, well, head down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Original Neckrest by Lewis N. Clark, a Chicago travel accessories 
supplier, is an ultra-lightweight inflatable pillow that fits easily around the 
neck, providing support on three sides. The plastic is covered with a 
suede-like material for a soft feel, and the neck rest comes with a storage 
pouch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Original Neckrest by Lewis N. Clark (item No. IF391) is $6.85, or two for 
$12, from Magellan's; (800) 962-4943. Or, for a store in your area, contact 
L.C. Industries; (800) 621-8083. Over the years, I've tried dozens of carry-on 
shoulder bags that provided varying amounts and allotments of space. Each had 
its pluses and minuses -- this one was too bulky, that one had flimsy zippers. 
But now I've found my perfect bag. Land's End has introduced its Under-Seat 
Shoulder Bag with an amazing amount of space, yet which fits under most 
airplane seats and in overhead storage bins.  
</P>
<P>
 Made of heavy-duty cotton canvas with extra strong zippers and leather 
supports at stress points, the bag has six zippered sections, ranging from a 
huge 15- by 10- by 11-inch main compartment that unzips on the top of the bag 
for easy access, to a slim outside pocket ideal for a book, airline tickets and 
other documents. Two cargo sections flanking the main compartment are each big 
enough for a pair of men's shoes and a change of socks, or about 50 rolls of 
boxed film. A large compartment at the front of the bag easily accommodates my 
full-size camera, three lenses and a flash. That leaves a zippered pocket on 
the back of the bag empty for last-minute stashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The zippers all have pulls at each end with large metal rings, so each 
compartment can be secured with a padlock (not included). One of the end 
pockets also has an inside key ring. The bag comes with double canvas handles 
with leather padding, a detachable shoulder strap and a leather luggage tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Under-Seat Shoulder Bag (item No. 2072-7236) is $94 from Land's End; (800) 
356-4444. Available in black, navy, burgundy, tan, hunter green or dark olive. 
Optional monogramming is an additional $5. There's something enticing about a 
well-stocked travel kit. It's ready to go anywhere and solve all manner of 
problems -- from dirty hair to a sore throat, an unraveled seam or a stubbed 
toe. This kit from Outdoor Research is so well-equipped, it's likely to gain 
fans even among the most fiercely independent packers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9 1/2- by 5-inch nylon bag unzips to 20 inches by 8 inches, revealing some 
20 items held in place within wide elastic bands, little pockets and a large 
zippered mesh compartment. Products include: shampoo, deodorant, shaving cream, 
razor, toothbrush and holder, comb, tweezers, nail clippers and file, dental 
floss, pre-moistened towelettes and basic first-aid and sewing kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty hard and soft plastic containers are provided for pills and additional 
liquid. A small mirror is attached to the inside of the bag, with Velcro for 
easy removal.  
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor Research standard Travel Kit (F336-175) is $30 from REI, a 
Washington-based distributor of outdoor gear and clothing; (800) 426-4840. 
Available in black, turquoise, fuchsia, royal blue, gray, red and purple. 
Finally, a happy solution to securing zippered compartments without having to 
worry about all those tiny keys that you can never find when you need them -- 
like when the customs person is demanding you open all your luggage for 
inspection, pronto. This small, 2 1/2- by 7/8-inch metal padlock has a 
three-digit combination lock that you program yourself following easy 
instructions. To prevent pilferage, I use the locks on all my luggage zippers, 
including outside compartments of garment bags, camera bags, even my fanny 
pack.  
</P>
<P>
 Combination lock (No. SL621) is $6.75 (two or more, $6.25 apiece) from 
Magellan's; (800) 962-4943.

TAKING THE KIDS: JUST THE TWO OF YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We smiled at each other across the candle-lit table at the terrific little 
restaurant we'd stumbled on in the town where we'd stopped overnight -- one of 
those conspiratorial, "I'm glad I'm here alone with you," kind of smiles. Then, 
in between bites of steamed clams and seafood fettuccine, my daughter Reggie 
filled me in on the latest doings in her second grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie, who is almost 8, was thrilled with the grown-up ambience and food. 
She'd picked the place after reading the menu outside (checking with me that it 
was within our budget) and peering in the window at the flower-bedecked tables. 
But most of all, she liked having me all to herself. As the middle child in a 
typically time-crunched '90s family with two working parents, she frequently 
complains about not getting enough "alone" time with me or her dad. 
</P>
<P>
 That was why I grabbed the chance to take her along when I had to do some 
research for a book on the Southwest. I wasn't doing this all for her. I wanted 
her input -- the book is for kids -- as well as her company. I was pleased her 
teachers were all for the idea, sending along a week's worth of homework that 
she dutifully completed along with a journal of what we'd seen. I didn't count 
on how much fun I'd have. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way -- which included long stretches in the car -- my daughter and I 
got to spend more time alone with each other than we'd ever managed since she 
was born a scant two years after her brother. I told her lots of stories about 
when I was her age. She listed every aggravating thing her brother and 
2-year-old sister had done in the previous month. She told me the latest 
"knock-knock" jokes. She gave me her take on every place we saw -- especially 
the duds -- and we helped each other choose just the right souvenirs to take 
home, laughing that the rest of the family would never have allowed us so much 
time to choose. She was helpful, cooperative and never whined. Where was this 
child at home, I wondered? 
</P>
<P>
 "The dynamics are all different. You're more like companions, than parent and 
child. You're focusing on each other, rather than work and getting homework 
done," explains Los Angeles child psychologist Jill Waterman, who teaches at 
UCLA. "The kid will be an angel so it's easier for you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like he's taking care of me too," adds Pat Murray, who owns a Chicago 
beauty salon and has traveled alone with her adolescent son since he was small. 
That's not to say you can totally relax. "You're always on duty," Murray sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie and I had spats along the way, of course, but there were so many 
adventures that we'd forget what they were about by the end of the day. Despite 
a grueling schedule, we were both sad when the trip was over. 
</P>
<P>
 As I dried her tears on the flight home, I resolved to sandwich in more 
one-on-one time with each child. In fact, I subsequently took my son Matt on a 
similar but shorter trip. His favorite parts: "swimming at 10 at night, missing 
school and room service." 
</P>
<P>
 The experts tell me such individual forays -- whether for an afternoon during 
a family vacation or a visit to the relatives, a weekend spent camping or even 
time squeezed into a business trip -- can have long-lasting positive benefits 
that include wonderful, lifelong memories. "It's great for a family's mental 
health," said New York psychologist Jane Greer, who is an expert on sibling 
relationships. (Her book "Adult Sibling Rivalry" has just been released in 
paperback by Fawcett, $5.99.) 
</P>
<P>
 Siblings may feel less compelled to compete so hard for your attention, she 
explains. And you won't feel so stressed on vacation trying to please everyone 
at once -- especially when the kids want to go in entirely different 
directions. "In order to share together as a family you don't have to be 
together all of the time," Greer added. 
</P>
<P>
 Only children also get a lot out of one-on-one time with each parent away from 
home. Just ask Hathi Hanna, a Washington administrator who took her 6-year-old 
son on a business trip she extended over a weekend. "It was totally different 
than when the three of us are together," she said. "We talked about school and 
his friends. It was like, sit back and look at the big picture. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get home, give your kids some "booster shots" of time alone with you. 
"It takes work to maintain that special bonding," UCLA's Waterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid that won't be enough for Reggie. She'd like the two of us to take 
off again -- permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

TRAVEL ADVISORY; TOUR BUS ATTACKS RENEW IN EGYPT 
</P>

 Africa 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt: Terrorists attacked a tour bus in Cairo on Monday, and 16 people were 
wounded, including eight Austrian tourists, by the gunfire and explosives. A 
radical Muslim group opposed to Egypt's secular government claimed 
responsibility. There have been eight such attacks in the past year, leaving 
seven foreign visitors dead. Algeria: In response to terrorist murders of 
foreigners, the U.S. government has stiffened its warning against travel to 
Algeria, now advising Americans not just to "defer" trips there but to "avoid" 
going. An organization known as the Armed Islamic Group warned all foreigners 
to leave Algeria by Dec. 1 or risk "sudden death." A Frenchman, a Briton, a 
Russian and 12 Croatian and Bosnian technicians have been killed in recent 
weeks, bringing to 23 the number of foreigners murdered since September. The 
State Department has suggested that Americans who are already there depart the 
country, and Times foreign correspondent Kim Murphy reports from Algeria that 
most foreign embassies and companies are reducing staff and sending family 
members home. Latin America 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico: In a new report on crime and safety in Mexico, the State Department 
singles out street crime as the main threat to American visitors in the 
country's larger cities. The report advises travelers to carry only essential 
identification and valuables while touring and shopping. Other than street 
crime, the department notes incidents of narcotics-related terrorist violence 
in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Nayarit and Jalisco. 
Robberies by bandits operating mostly after dark are not unusual in some 
isolated areas. Highway 15 in Sinaloa state and Highway 40 between the city of 
Durango and the Pacific Coast are considered particularly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicaragua: The State Department reports an increase in armed banditry in the 
Nicaraguan countryside, particularly in the north, and an increase in violent 
crime, especially in Managua, the capital. After dark, all the nation's roads, 
including the heavily traveled Pan American Highway, should be regarded as 
hazardous. Although anti-American sentiment is not considered widespread among 
Nicaraguans, at least two incidents involved Americans who were followed from 
the international airport and robbed en route to their residences in Managua. 
Caribbean 
</P>
<P>
 St. Kitts and Nevis: The governor-general of St. Kitts and Nevis imposed a 
state of emergency and curfew on the two-island country because of violent 
demonstrations in Basseterre, St. Kitts, the capital, after the Nov. 29 
election. At least 18 people were injured, but there were no reports of injury 
to Americans or other foreigners at tourist hotels on the other side of the 
main island. Asia 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand: Tourism to this Southeast Asian nation soared during the 1980s, but 
reported scams and ripoffs have harmed its image. The State Department warns of 
scams in which tourists are enticed into buying overpriced gems and the 
Associated Press has reported that many entertainment spots and gem dealers are 
known for cheating tourists but are allowed by police to continue operating. AP 
describes a government-sanctioned "two-price" system under which many tourist 
attractions charge higher admission fees to foreigners than to Thais. Briefly .

<P>
 Health info: International travelers seeking up-to-date health information on 
various countries may now call the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 
requesting faxed material on 16 regions of the world: current health risks, 
suggested immunizations, food and water precautions, etc. The service operates 
24 hours a day at (404) 332-4565. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot spots: The State Department periodically warns against travel to certain 
countries where Americans might be at risk. Travel warnings are currently in 
effect for Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, 
Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Peru, Somalia, Sudan 
and Tajikistan.

<P>
 The U.S. State Department offers recorded travel warnings and advisories at 
(202) 647-5225; the fax line is (202) 647-3000.

MY BEST SHOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Larry and Linda Gross of Encino were married in 1990, both had already 
traveled thousands of miles -- he primarily in Europe and South America, she in 
Europe and Asia."That left Africa" for a 5 1/2-week honeymoon, Larry says. The 
couple arrived at the Karnak Temples in Luxor on a July afternoon when 
temperatures hovered at about 120 degrees. "We didn't realize it would be that 
hot," Gross says, but they were not distracted. "This is our memory of Africa. 
It seemed like time had stood still."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES.: HUNKY HOLIDAYS FROM 
HOLLYWOOD: SEX SYMBOLS LIGHT UP THE SCREEN

<P>
 Hollywood used to crank out starlets by the bushel but, these days, it's the 
male counterpart that seems to be in abundance. Sex symbolism is in the eye of 
the beholder, but one doesn't have to look very far to see that, in the current 
crop of Christmas movies, the hunks out-number the starlets by a wide margin. 
Call them the boy toys of winter.  
</P>
<P>
 And while youth will be served, so will their older counterparts in the 
movie-going audience. So we make note of the plethora of male pulchritude 
adorning multiplex screens, even as we tip a hat to the robust senior division 
as well. YOUNG HUNKS

 CELINE DION

<P>
 "The Colour of My Love" 
</P>
<P>
 Epic  
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 What a waste of great pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 This 25-year-old Canadian singer, who can hold her own with Whitney Houston 
and Mariah Carey, continues to squander her voice on those romantic bombastic 
ballads -- bad bombastic ballads at that. 
</P>
<P>
 That award-winning "Beauty and the Beast" duet made her a star, so now she 
seems to be building her career around similarly swelling, romantic ballads and 
her second U.S. album is loaded with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombastic ballads aren't necessarily bad, particularly if the accent is on 
stark melodrama rather than syrupy emotionalism. But here Dion is knee-deep in 
syrup. On "The Power of Love," "Think Twice" and "Only One Road," you can 
almost feel her revving up for the kill -- that grandiose, note-stretching 
finish -- as if her purpose isn't to interpret these songs, but merely to 
dazzle you with her vocal power. 
</P>
<P>
 Up-tempo songs aren't the answer for her either. She's such a dyed-in-the-wool 
ballad singer that she can't loosen up when the tempo accelerates, and the few 
faster-paced songs on this album come across very stiffly. 
</P>
<P>
 With that great voice Dion has plenty of choices. But right now she's taking 
the easy, commercial route. Maybe on the next album she'll detour into 
something more challenging and artistically rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). DENNIS HUNT

 * * 1/2 Jane Child, "Here Not There," Warner Bros. On her sophomore effort, 
the soul-influenced pop singer veers sharply from the radio-friendly 
accessibility of her first hit single, "Don't Want to Fall in Love."Not all of 
her experiments pay off, but she nicely evokes the breathy, baby-beatnik style 
of Rickie Lee Jones on the title cut.

RECORD RACK: TOUCHING THE HEART OF 'PHILADELPHIA'

 Terrific new songs by Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young movingly evoke the 
complex emotions of AIDS-related love and fear on this soundtrack, with a 
recording of a Giordano aria by the late Maria Callas providing the perfect 
counterpoint to those subdued bookends. 
</P>
<P>
 Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" is in the tradition of his understated 
gems "The River" and "Wreck on the Highway" -- glimpses of people looking for 
something to hold onto as their life or dreams slip away."And my clothes don't 
fit me no more / Thousand miles just to slip my skin," he sings, as suspended 
keyboard notes bleed from one chord into the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The same qualities fill Young's beautiful title song, with the 
singer-songwriter at his most brittle, angelic and elegiac. Peter Gabriel also 
explores the movie's disheartening theme with the sketchy, lightly funky "Love 
Town." 
</P>
<P>
 If only the producers had commissioned more top-flight artists' musical 
impressions of the emotional topic. Instead, we get largely filler, with Sade's 
surprisingly earthy version of Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone to 
Love" generating some interest and the Spin Doctors' butchering of Creedence's 
"Have You Ever Seen the Rain" deserving almost none.

Whitney Houston is the duo's chief supporter.Siblings of the gospel-singing 
Winans clan, Angie and Debbie have a vocal timbre and polish that recall 
Houston herself. She even puts in an appearance on "Light of Love," which is 
like most of the tracks here -- pretty but far from passionate.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: HERE'S A REALLY NOVEL IDEA FOR A BISTRO

 There are no books at the Book Soup Bistro, but it does have one of the city's 
best-reading menus, a mix-and-match list of greatest hits inspired by the best 
urban rustic restaurants in California. Consider Tuscan bread soup with roasted 
peppers, tomatoes, garlic and basil; or a grilled Vermont white cheddar 
sandwich with fresh basil on cracked black pepper bread; or a smoky, herbed 
flatbread (think pizza) with caramelized red onions, thyme and goat cheese; or 
grilled pork tenderloin marinated in achiote and served with black mission figs 
and port. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, what looks so good on paper doesn't always translate on the 
plate. But with its neo-Mission lampshades and coolly architectured decor, it's 
a good-looking place to sit -- though not at all like the bookstore cafe you 
might expect from its name and proximity to its parent, the excellent Book Soup 
bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the sophisticated surroundings didn't bother one bohemia-damaged 
couple who took turns interviewing each other with a hand-held video camera. 
Call it exhibitionist intimacy. As the Henry Jaglom wanna-be nodded sagely, the 
Isabella Rossellini look- and talk-alike, her eyes deep with the experience of 
100 foreign films, pronounced, "I'm disengaging from him sexually." Later, he 
confessed, "I'd like to negotiate a physical understanding with you." With talk 
like this, who needs books? 
</P>
<P>
 * Book Soup Bistro, 8800 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 657-1072. Pastas, 
flatbreads and entrees, $6.50-$16. LAURIE OCHOA

RESTAURANT NEWS: ONLY 2 MENTIONS OF WOLFGANG PUCK IN THIS COLUMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Openings, closings, grease fires, chefs' tantrums, snotty maitre d's . . . and 
that's in an ordinary year. But last year was not ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Wolfgang Puck didn't close a restaurant, but the economy was crummier 
than ever. And as California Pizza Kitchen and Planet Hollywood continued to 
clone themselves, there was a flap over dinner with Julia (Madame Child, that 
is), Roger Verge lost one of his precious three stars, Paul Bocuse was thrown 
out of the opera, Bernard left Spago (maitre d' Erpicum, that is) and L.A. 
restaurants went non-smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in no particular order -- and without once more mentioning Wolfgang Puck 
-- is a look at restaurant ghosts, past and future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The La Toque Thing: After years of talking about it, Ken Frank finally sold 
his 13-year-old restaurant, La Toque. Last year customers wore themselves out 
attending a series of last meals: the last all-truffle dinner, the last Cinco 
de Mayo dinner, the final garlic dinner, the final mushroom menu. Meanwhile, 
the restaurant turned 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the news that Frank will be cooking at House of Blues, Isaac 
Tigrett's blues-themed restaurant when it opens in West Hollywood in March. The 
28,000-square-foot celebrity-supported restaurant and blues club will have a 
pivoting bar suspended from the ceiling and a very private room and kitchen 
upstairs called the Foundation Room, where Frank will cook special dinners for 
Tigrett's special customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yujean & Friends: First he had his eye on the former Trumps space in West 
Hollywood, but there were others ahead of him. Finally, after having the place 
checked out by a feng shui master to ensure the environment was in harmony with 
nature, Yujean Kang bought Ken Frank's La Toque property. Although he has no 
plans to close the Pasadena restaurant that bears his name, the new space, to 
also be named Yujean Kang's, will clearly become the flagship restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 With his new location due to open sometime this spring, Kang has hired a top 
designer from Taiwan to completely remodel the space. And because he hopes to 
attract rich Hong Kong businessmen, Kang's already shopping for Cristofle 
silver, luxurious Frette linens and 14K gold-tipped chopsticks that cost $160 a 
pair. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dinner With Julia: The world's finest French male chefs may have gained a 
whole new appreciation for their female counterparts after being publicly 
scolded by the legendary French-born Madeleine Kamman for not being invited to 
a dinner honoring Julia Child last February. Only two women were on the 
original "Merci Julia" guest list at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, and a 
few more were invited after this fact was revealed. At the very least, the 
country gained two organizations that plan to encourage young women to go into 
the restaurant business with scholarships, job training and a networking 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing Lasts Forever: Last year's list includes long-time favorites Vickman's 
Restaurant and Bakery, Stellini's, Gorky's Cafe & Brewery, Pioneer Boulangerie, 
Bullocks Wilshire Tea Room and Nickodell. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was brutal for "T" restaurants. Tulipe, Tryst, Tuttobene, Tuttopasta, 
Tse Yang and Trigo all called it quits. Other closures: Luma, Cafe 
Morpheum/Asylum, Bice, Duplex, Il Giardino, Picnic, Red Car Grill, Mary's Lamb, 
Dale's Bistro and Rondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, say sources, Chasen's and Broadway Deli are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that 50% of restaurants fail in their first year, look for more 
closings in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's No Plates Like Home: First there were the tamales served on the 
saintly Our Lady of Guadalupe plates. Then there were the shocking messages 
D.O.A. and drive by stenciled on dishes of Thai shrimp and veal chops. Now that 
he's got our attention, Bikini's John Sedlar is opening Abiquiu, a Southwestern 
restaurant named after a pueblo in northern New Mexico where Sedlar grew up. 
"Shirley MacLaine just bought my great-grandfather's ranch there," says Sedlar. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the Bikini patio, Abiquiu will be a more casual, spicier version of 
St. Estephe, Sedlar's former Manhattan Beach restaurant, and will operate out 
of a separate kitchen. Entree prices will range from $13 to $18. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You Can Too Have Too Many Friends: Bernard Erpicum proved that knowing the 
right people doesn't necessarily get you the best tables in town. In fact, the 
former Spago maitre d' table-hopped one time too many at Drai's, the 
celebrity-filled restaurant on La Cienega. Owner Victor Drai showed Erpicum the 
door for annoying his customers. Erpicum is expected to open his own place down 
the street from Drai's in March. Will Drai be invited to the opening? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While the Chef's Away: Judges for the Guide Michelin obviously noticed that 
Roger Verge had been spending too much time away from his restaurants. Besides 
Le Moulin de Mougins and L'Amandier near Cannes, Verge's empire includes a cafe 
in Monte Carlo, a restaurant in Disney World in Florida, another in Tokyo, a 
couple of cooking schools, a boutique, a line of china and glassware, a line of 
food products and a stove with his name on it. This year, Michelin withdrew one 
of Verge's coveted three stars from Le Moulin de Mougins and left the one-star 
L'Amandier starless. Prediction? If Verge gets himself back in the kitchen and 
stays there, the stars will be in his favor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Another Aria, Another Place: Tall Paul Bocuse gave his all to open a 60-seat 
restaurant on the top floor of the restored Lyon Opera. In the end, city 
officials said " Non ." So the three-star chef and three employees bought 
another Lyon landmark -- the Brasserie du Nord. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cuisine du Councilman: Forget about whether or not L.A.'s ban on smoking is 
hurting business. According to City Councilman Marvin Braude, unless a 
restaurant is very competitive and top-notch, you don't stay in business very 
long. Fine advice, responded L.A. restaurateurs, from the same man who says one 
of his all-time favorite restaurants is Souplantation.

 TOUGH SELL: The secret to reducing smog and traffic, the experts say, is to 
get more business people to work at home, tying into the office through 
computer hookups. Problem is, says a new Caltrans survey of more than 700 
Orange County companies, the idea isn't catching on. . . . Only 11% of the 
firms surveyed have formal telecommuting programs. Another 19% have a few 
informal arrangements. And those doing nothing? A whopping 87% of that group 
don't even have plans for such an option for its workers.

 BEYOND THE SHADOW: Some who know little about English writer C. S. Lewis may 
be more familiar with him after a special screening of "Shadowlands" at the 
Edwards Town Center Cinema in Costa Mesa Thursday night. The movie is about 
Lewis' marriage to American Joy Davidman Gresham. Her son, Douglas Gresham, 
will fly in from Ireland to talk about the marriage at a reception ($35-$50) 
following the Edwards screening. . . . Proceeds will go toward restoration of 
the late writer's Oxford home.

<P>
 SOCCER'S YEAR: With the U.S. soccer team training for the 1994 World Cup, some 
of its stars are a little surprised at the positive public reaction. They're 
even on trading cards, like baseball players. Says team member Joe-Max Moore, 
who went to Mission Viejo High School: "I collected trading cards when I was a 
kid, but I never expected to get the same treatment playing soccer." The team 
will play a preview match against Switzerland at Cal State Fullerton on Jan.

 WORKING WELL: Brenda Lynn, vice president of Santa Ana-based Plaza Home 
Mortgage Corp., may be getting more publicity than she wanted about her 
$1.4-million income last year. National business magazines showed she was the 
only woman in Orange County to top $1 million. Now Working Woman magazine has 
listed the top women's salaries, and it shows Lynn's to be 12th best in the 
U.S. First: Turi Josefsen, executive VP of U.S. Surgical Corp., at $26.7 
million.

NEW EUROPEAN TRADING BLOC IS USHERED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Year ushered in a giant new trading bloc -- the European Economic Area 
-- linking the European Union and European Free Trade Assn. and setting the 
stage for an enlarged EU in a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EEA . . . will create the biggest integrated economic zone in the world 
with their more than 370 million inhabitants," the European Union's external 
relations commissioner, Hans van den Broek, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EEA will give a most welcome impetus toward liberalization on a broader 
European scale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EEA upstages the North American Free Trade Agreement as the world's 
biggest free-trade zone by extending the Union's single market, celebrating its 
first birthday, to five out of seven of the EFTA countries -- Austria, Finland, 
Iceland, Norway and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 While NAFTA is five times bigger than the EEA in terms of land mass, the EEA 
has 372 million consumers compared with 360 million in NAFTA and is two or 
three times bigger in terms of trade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to bring economic benefits in an area stretching from the 
Arctic to the Mediterranean but is seen by four of the five EFTA states taking 
part as just a stepping stone to full EU membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The EEA will, in particular, provide more competition for public procurement 
contracts and in the banking and insurance sectors. Norway and Iceland also 
stand to gain from better access for their fish to the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 But aware of the market's limitations, the EEA does not give the EFTA 
countries a say in the rules they will have to apply and leaves customs borders 
intact. Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden all started negotiating Union 
membership in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to spend the next New Year's Eve crossing its threshold. If they do, 
that will leave only Iceland, and maybe Liechtenstein, which hopes to join 
shortly, in the EEA. 
</P>
<P>
 But European Commission President Jacques Delors has said he sees the EEA as a 
way of integrating Eastern European countries into the European trading scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining EFTA country, Switzerland, will not take part in the EEA after 
its people voted against membership in a referendum. It is seeking to cut its 
losses by negotiating bilateral accords with the Union.

CUBAN REFUGEES A RECORD

 A record number of Cuban refugees floated to Florida in 1993. Last year, 3,656 
Cubans reached Florida by boat, up 43% from 2,557 in 1992, Coast Guard Petty 
Officer Chris Whitlock said Saturday. It was the largest exodus since the 1980 
Mariel boat lift, which saw 125,000 Cubans flee to Florida.

 Several people were taken hostage in a clothing store after a botched robbery, 
and one customer was wounded before all hostages went free, police said. 
</P>

 Five people were arrested in the Friday evening incident, which unfolded only 
a few blocks from the Times Square New Year's Eve throngs. The police 
department's negotiating team persuaded the men to surrender about two hours 
after the incident began.

 Wisconsin and its fans can stop reminiscing about past Rose Bowl failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-ranked Badgers, behind junior tailback Brent Moss and capitalizing 
on six UCLA turnovers, defeated the 14th-ranked Bruins, 21-16, Saturday in the 
80th Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Badgers' first Rose Bowl victory in four attempts and their first 
appearance in the game since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, the nation's third-leading rusher, carried 36 times for 158 yards and 
two touchdowns. He scored on runs of three yards and one yard in the first half 
and was voted the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 31-year absence from the Rose Bowl, Wisconsin was hungry for a New 
Year's Day victory and came to party in Pasadena. A crowd of 101,237 fans, most 
dressed in Wisconsin colors of red and white, saw the Badgers improve to 10-1-1 
and set a school-record for most wins in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (8-4) suffered its first loss after three Rose Bowl victories under Coach 
Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss also spoiled an impressive performance by Bruin receiver J.J. Stokes, 
who had 14 catches for 176 yards, both Rose Bowl records. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, who missed three practices because of flu, 
completed 28 of 43 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook tried to rally the Bruins on a final drive, completing four of five 
passes for 39 yards and rushing twice for 13 yards. But with 15 seconds to 
play, the Bruins out of timeouts and the ball on Wisconsin's 15-yard line, he 
scrambled instead of throwing the ball away and time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins pulled to within five, 21-16, when Mike Nguyen caught a five-yard 
scoring pass from Cook with 3:38 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin took a 21-10 lead when sophomore quarterback Darrell Bevell 
scrambled away from two UCLA defenders and scored on a 21-yard run with 10:52 
left in the game. Bevell completed 10 of 20 passes for 96 yards with an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA cut its deficit to 14-10 on Ricky Davis' 12-yard scoring run with 14:08 
left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins led the nation in turnover margin, but they had five fumbles 
Saturday, a Rose Bowl record. Two Cook fumbles ended potential Bruin scoring 
drives in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins took the second-half kickoff and drove 72 yards to the Wisconsin 
eight. On first and eight, Cook fumbled while being tackled by Carlos Fowler 
and defensive tackle Mike Thompson recovered at Wisconsin's 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell Fletcher, Wisconsin's other talented running back, carried 33 yards on 
the first play after the fumble. He had three more carries for 24 yards as the 
Badgers moved inside the UCLA 20. But Moss was tackled for a one-yard loss on 
fourth and one at the UCLA nine and a fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players from each team were ejected. UCLA safeties Marvin Goodwin and 
Donovan Gallatin were thrown out, along with fullback Mark Montgomery and wide 
receiver Lee DeRamus from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA regained its composure and began a drive on its 10. The Bruins went 57 
yards in 12 plays to the Badger 33. But on first down from the Wisconsin 33, 
Cook fumbled again and linebacker Pete Diatelevi recovered the fumble at the 
Wisconsin 37. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA opened the scoring with a 27-yard field goal by All-American Bjorn Merten 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss scored his first of two first-half touchdown on a three-yard run to give 
Wisconsin a 7-3 lead with 11 seconds left in the first quarter. Moss carried 
five times for 28 yards during the 10-play, 78-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run to give the Badgers a 14-3 
halftime lead. Moss rushed 23 times for 93 yards and two touchdowns in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin won a combined six games in three years before Barry Alvarez became 
coach in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 1-10 mark his first year, Alvarez guided the team to consecutive 5-6 
seasons. In his fourth season, Alvarez led the Badgers to their first winning 
season since 1984 and a Big Ten championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Alvarez's arrival, the Badgers had lost five of their previous six bowl 
games. In their other three Rose Bowl appearances, they lost twice to USC (in 
1953 and 1963) and once to Washington (1960). 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1963 game, Wisconsin trailed, 42-14, but closed to within five points 
before time ran out in a 42-37 loss to the national champion Trojans. Wisconsin 
Athletic Director Pat Richter was a star end for the Badgers in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's only previous postseason victory came in the 1982 Independence 
Bowl, when the Badgers beat Kansas State, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Bruins' 12th bowl appearance and fourth in the Rose Bowl during 
Terry Donahue's 18 years as UCLA coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first meeting between the two schools in a bowl game. The teams 
have played eight times during the regular season with UCLA winning the last 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Although UCLA has used the Rose Bowl as its regular-season home field since 
1982, the Bruins wore their white uniforms and used the visitors' locker room.

1993; AN EMOTIONAL, MYSTIFYING YEAR TOUCHED BY TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HERRMANN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Real life isn't in the same ballpark with sports when it comes to playing 
fair. If something bad happens to you in sports, someone tries to make up for 
it. They give you a draft pick, free throws, five yards, a trip to first base, 
a power play. Real life doesn't play by those rules. 
</P>
<P>
 It can come in and just take over. Especially in a year like this one, it can 
leave you wondering, as Andrew Young did in quoting Arthur Ashe's lifelong 
query at Ashe's funeral, "Why, oh Lord, why?" 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find the answer on the scoreboard, which made 1993 so sad and 
mystifying for anyone with an emotional investment in sports. The world lost 
Ashe, who made the connection between life and sports better than most people. 
And there were far too many other occasions to mourn. 
</P>
<P>
 We were just getting used to the idea of real life intruding on sports in the 
form of big money, labor negotiations, corporate machinations. Then it all hit 
higher and harder in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The top sports story, in fact, was rooted in tragedy. Michael Jordan retired 
after leading the Chicago Bulls to their third consecutive National Basketball 
Assn. title, largely because he still was reeling from his father's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, triumph also had its day this year. Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue 
Jays was its chief spokesman, bounding home after ending the baseball season 
with a once-in-a-generation swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Revivals burst out all over. The Dallas Cowboys and Montreal Canadiens 
recaptured past glory. When history looks back on '93, it will recall a 
blistering pennant race in the National League West, a zestful debate over 
who's No. 1 in college football and a madcap heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, problems that would have seemed extraordinary most years looked tame. 
The New York Mets, for instance, could be said to have experienced the worst 
year a baseball team ever has had -- based on expectations, salaries and 
decorum. Except the Cleveland Indians' year was much worse. Pitchers Steve Olin 
and Tim Crews were killed in a spring training boating accident that seriously 
injured teammate Bobby Ojeda. When pitcher Cliff Young was killed in a car 
accident after the season, Cleveland was asking, why, why? 
</P>
<P>
 Ashe had started phrasing that question at age 6, when his mother died. 
Eulogists invoked it 43 years later, after pure blind chance gave him the AIDS 
virus through a blood transfusion. He was remembered for what he did in 
between, to make this kind of scene possible: 1,400 people an hour passed his 
coffin in the state house of Richmond, Va., a city that once denied him and 
every other black child access to its public tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life, to him, was more than a moment of triumph," Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., 
said at a memorial service in New York. "It was a gift of time. His was a life 
well-lived." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anyone, Jordan is larger than life. But he felt the world was 
forming too tight a circle around him, what with speculation about his gambling 
habits. He leaned on his dad, even asking James Jordan to speak on his behalf 
during the playoffs. "Makes me feel pretty good, you guys consider me a good 
substitute," the elder Jordan said at the time. Michael, stunned, left the 
stage in the fall, two months after his father was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball already was staggering from the loss of two players in their prime. 
The New Jersey Nets' Drazen Petrovic was on the verge of becoming the NBA's 
first European star when he was killed in an accident on a rain-slickened 
German road. Reggie Lewis already was a captain and fixture with the Boston 
Celtics before he collapsed on a practice court in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports generally are spared that grief. But it kept happening. Race drivers 
Davey Allison and Alan Kulwicki were killed in a helicopter and plane crash, 
respectively. Jim Valvano, still vibrant as a basketball analyst, died of 
cancer, as did golf pro Heather Farr. Houston Oilers lineman Jeff Alm was a 
suicide victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other former athletes who died in 1993, were baseball Hall of Famers Don 
Drysdale and Roy Campanella, whose storied careers were with the Brooklyn and 
Los Angeles Dodgers. Both had heart attacks, Campanella on June 26 and Drysdale 
on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Krone's milestone in the Belmont Stakes -- she became the first woman 
jockey to win a Triple Crown race -- was shaded by the loss of Preakness winner 
Prairie Bayou, who broke down and had to be destroyed. Krone herself, later in 
the season, suffered severe leg and ankle injuries while racing at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when life imitated art, the result was tragic. Syosset High football 
player Michael Macias was paralyzed when he was hit by a car while trying to 
copy a scene from the movie "The Program." 
</P>
<P>
 At least real life occasionally pulled its punch, with grim news that could 
have been much grimmer. Monica Seles is expected to recover from the stabbing 
she suffered during a match. Paul Azinger, who finally won a major title at the 
PGA Championship, is given a good chance to fight off lymphoma. Bobby Hurley, 
the Sacramento Kings' rookie point guard, is improving from critical injuries 
he suffered in a car accident. Krone is expected to ride again. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, 1993 did provide the more exciting ebb and flow, the 
unexpected that keeps us tuned in. You never know how things might fall -- 
possibly by parachute, which provided a burlesque interlude in Evander 
Holyfield's title decision over Riddick Bowe. You can't tell how the ball will 
bounce -- or if Leon Lett will take a poke at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets would just as soon throw away 1993. They tossed out most everything 
else: threats, fireworks, bleach, a manager and general manager. It was mostly 
chaotic and, in the Vince Coleman cherry-bomb incident, criminal. The most 
infamous throwing was done by team symbol Anthony Young, with his record 
27-game losing streak. When the streak ended, he said it wasn't a monkey off 
his back, "it was the whole zoo." Yet the circus kept spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner returned from a suspension in 
characteristically tasteful, understated manner. He dressed as Napoleon atop a 
white horse on the cover of Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 There was enough life in 1993 to keep a lot of people hoping. There's always a 
chance some kid will be as good as George Brett or Nolan Ryan, who said goodbye 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, 1993 was a victory lap. For these people, too: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky overcame back surgery and lifted the Los Angeles Kings to 
their first Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mario Lemieux eclipsed even that. He overcame Hodgkin's disease and won the 
league's MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A year after he won his first World Series and four years after it looked 
as if he were finished, Dave Winfield got his 3,000th hit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Time was on Chris Webber's side after all. His gaffe in calling a timeout 
that Michigan didn't have was costly in the NCAA final, but he was lauded only 
a couple of months later when he became the top choice in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barry Bonds matched pay with productivity, sending the seemingly 
overmatched San Francisco Giants to 103 wins, only one short of the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Norman, The Guy Who Always Chokes, won the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Molitor, a good and unheralded soldier all his career, was the star of 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dennis Byrd walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's a wonderful life.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JONES SAVED MONEY PAYING AIKMAN $50 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS MORTENSEN, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before anybody thinks Dallas Owner Jerry Jones is out of his mind for giving 
Troy Aikman an eight-year, $50-million contract, think again. The way my 
calculator figures it, Aikman could have cost Jones $57 million (and change) to 
remain as the Cowboys' quarterback through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 If Aikman's contract had not been extended last week, Aikman would have been 
tagged as the Cowboys' franchise player under the new labor agreement when he 
was scheduled to become a free agent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules of the labor deal, Aikman would have been paid a salary in '95 
that was an average of the top five quarterback salaries in the NFL. A 
conservative estimate of this figure is $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, Aikman would have received automatic 30% annual increases 
in salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Those raises (rounded off): $4.5 million to $5.8 million in '96, $7.6 million 
in '97, $9.9 million in '98, $12.85 million in '99 and $16.7 million in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, was able to articulate these 
calculations to Jones, who understood the dynamics of the situation. It made 
sense for both sides. Jones secured his quarterback for the decade and saves 
his franchise designation. Aikman gets a well-deserved raise and deposits a 
record $11-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 So, $50 million isn't so outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Jones can get his players to understand this as they prepare for their 
National Football Conference East title showdown with the Giants on Sunday in 
East Rutherford, N.J. There had to be concern that the Aikman deal would set 
off a chain reaction in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one must wonder if Emmitt Smith truly can set aside the 
bitterness of his contract negotiations, which ended in the third week when 
Smith signed a four-year, $14-million deal. Smith honored his previous 
contract. The chances of Smith remaining content for the duration of this deal 
seems slim. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a fair guess that Michael Irvin, who makes $1.25 million, has begun 
planning his training-camp holdout next summer. And Ken Norton and Daryl 
Johnston, probably the two most underrated players on the NFL's best team, are 
learning to say "free agent' without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton and Johnston both passed opportunities to extend their contracts by 
last Thursday's deadline to avoid the salary-cap crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys can ill afford to lose either player. Norton is the cornerstone of 
the defense and Johnston has become the league's best fullback. Johnston 
remains bitter about his negotiations last summer that ended in a one-year deal 
for $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones did succeed in extending the contract of right tackle Erik Williams, who 
has developed into one of the league's best offensive linemen. But there are 
several other potential free agents in the offensive line, including guards 
Nate Newton and John Gesek. Jimmy Johnson's job doesn't get easier. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CAROLINA PANTHERS will talk with Florida Coach Steve Spurrier after his 
Sugar Bowl date with West Virginia. Although Spurrier always has left the 
impression that he is too comfortable to leave Florida, there are some league 
executives who believe Carolina has an excellent shot to land him. It's going 
to be costly -- at least $1.5 million per year -- but the Panthers apparently 
are going to give him a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does that leave former Washington Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs? 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs returned from a ski vacation last week with determination that he should 
be free to coach. He prefers the Carolina job, but Redskins Owner Jack Kent 
Cooke has blocked access, claiming Gibbs owes him two years on his contract. 
Cooke wants Gibbs to come to the owner with a "pretty please" approach; Gibbs 
has told friends he won't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gibbs ever does get the opportunity to talk with Carolina, he will have to 
address the chief concerns of General Manager Mike McCormack, who wonders 
whether Gibbs was indeed "burned out" when he resigned after last season. 
McCormack is reluctant to fight for Gibbs because he is afraid Gibbs may burn 
out again in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is absurd. Gibbs has admitted he "overdid it" in his final year, but 
there were several factors involved in his resignation. One of them was his 
desire to watch his son, Coy, play his final two seasons at Stanford, and that 
factor shouldn't be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs, 53, may get shut out of the Carolina job if Spurrier takes the leap 
from college. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ROOKIE of the year? It's Rick Mirer of Seattle. Even with Rams running 
back Jerome Bettis still in the chase for a rushing title, Mirer gets the nod. 
Here are the reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 Mirer is a quarterback who has made every start. He has missed only a few 
snaps because of injuries, toughing it out when other quarterbacks would have 
sat. 
</P>
<P>
 He has set NFL rookie records for completions and passing yardage and has 
rushed for more than 300 yards, best among AFC quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, he has made the Seahawks a better team. The Seahawks won two 
games a year ago. Last Sunday, they won their sixth, an upset victory over 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 As good as Bettis is, the Rams (4-11) will finish worse than last season, when 
they were 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 BECAUSE THERE HAVE been occasional shots fired his way, it's only right to 
acknowledge that Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche has done a pretty good job of 
turning things around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucs have suffered their 11th consecutive season of double-digit defeats, 
but their 17-10 victory over the Broncos last Sunday at Denver's Mile High 
Stadium is one of several impressive second-half showings, not all of which 
ended in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, it's no coincidence that the offense has been considerably better 
since the late signing of left tackle Paul Gruber, who has been dominating. 
Gruber has provided protection for quarterback Craig Erickson, who is starting 
to develop under Wyche and quarterbacks coach Turk Schonert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucs ... getting respect?

NOTRE DAME DOES ITS PART, THEN AWAITS ITS FATE, 24-21; COTTON BOWL: FIELD GOAL 
WITH 2:17 PLAY LIFTS THE IRISH IN REMATCH WITH TEXAS A&M. OUTCOME OF LATER 
GAMES WILL DETERMINE WHETHER VICTORY IS ENOUGH TO REGAIN TOP SPOT IN POLL.

<P>
 Notre Dame kept its longshot national championship hopes alive. Barely. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a 45-yard punt return by Mike Miller and Kevin Pendergast's 31-yard 
field goal with 2:17 to play Saturday to rally the fourth-ranked Fighting Irish 
to a 24-21 victory over No. 7 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (11-1) had to come from behind twice to subdue the Aggies (10-2), 
who were looking for respect after last year's 25-point loss to the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish were hoping for a slim victory by Florida State over unbeaten 
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl and a victory by Florida in the Sugar Bowl over 
unbeaten West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's only loss was 41-39 to Boston College on a last-second field 
goal. The Irish beat Florida State 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is we beat one fine football team and let's see what happens 
because I remember we beat Florida State head to head," Notre Dame coach Lou 
Holtz said. "Playing A&M here is very tough. It's a home game. We couldn't 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-point underdog Aggies, who lost 28-3 to Notre Dame in last year's 
Cotton Bowl, survived an opening 91-yard scoring drive by the Irish to rally 
for a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After quarterback Kevin McDougal ran 19 yards for a Notre Dame touchdown on 
the option, the Aggies tied it with a 79-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pullig completed a key 21-yard screen pass to Rodney Thomas on 
third-and-16 to set up Greg Hill's eight-yard touchdown run, the first for the 
Aggies in three Cotton Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two daring gambles by the Aggies paid off in the go-ahead touchdown, a 
15-yard pass from Pullig to fullback Detron Smith on fourth-and-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The key play was on fourth-and-1 from the A&M 45. The Aggies called a timeout 
and Pullig sneaked two yards for the first down to keep the 77-yard drive 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Pullig hit Tony Harrison on a 21-yard pass. At the Notre Dame 15, Pullig 
faked into the line and found Smith running free in the befuddled Irish 
secondary for his first collegiate score. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame tied it 14-14 to start the second half on a 2-yard run by Ray 
Zellars but the Aggies went ahead 21-14 on a one-yard plunge by Rodney Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish tied it 21-21 when Marc Edwards bulled across on a 2-yard run just 
before the end of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's Lee Becton was the offensive MVP with 138 yards on 26 carries and 
A&M's Antonio Shorter, who had three sacks, was the defensive MVP.

SOOTHSAYERS TAKE A SHOT AT NORWAY OLYMPICS 
</P>

<P>
 Marcello Haugen, a Norwegian soothsayer who once lived at the base of what is 
now the Lillehammer Olympic Park, was renowned for his accurate predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 So when word spread that Haugen predicted a major ski competition would be 
canceled in Lillehammer in February 1994 due to extreme cold, some locals began 
to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fret not, the psychic's biographer, Oistein Parmann, told the Lillehammer 
Olympic Organizing Committee's internal magazine. Parmann said Haugen, who died 
in 1967, never made such a prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Stig Oyen, a Norwegian astrologer, told the magazine that the Feb. 12-27 Games 
would be a sporting success, but a mess in many other ways. He predicted wet 
weather, and that the Games would be troublesome for the news media, especially 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also predicted a shock for the home country in the 10,000-meter 
speedskating competition, in which Norwegian Johann Olav Koss is a favorite. He 
also said Norway will take gold in the men's Nordic skiing relay and that a 
Russian would edge out a Norwegian to win the women's 10-kilometer Nordic 
skiing pursuit. 
</P>

<P>
 SECOND WIND: With about six weeks to go before the opening ceremony, the staff 
of the Lillehammer Games is ready, willing and weary. 
</P>
<P>
 Tor Aune, spokesman for the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee, said the 
hectic pace of preparation was taking its toll, and that he -- like many of his 
co-workers -- was getting a second wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everything is under control," he said in an interview with the Norwegian 
news agency NTB. "We are unreservedly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Aune said that for much of the staff, the Games had already begun. They are 
moving into venues and preparing for the arrival of about 2,000 athletes, 
thousands of reporters and hordes of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge now is expecting the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there is a small margin between success and fiasco. We have 
contingency plans tucked away everywhere, and we assume the worst possible 
things will happen," Aune said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 TRAGIC TENT: Efforts to recover a tent used by Norwegian Roald Amundsen when 
he conquered the South Pole in 1911 were canceled this week when an expedition 
member fell into a crevasse and died. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member Norwegian expedition, funded partly by the Lillehammer Olympic 
Organizing Committee, had hoped to dig 50 feet into the ice to retrieve 
Amundsen's tent from the Pole in time for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 26, the team's second in command, 36-year-old Jostein Helgestad, fell 
into a 165-foot-deep crack in the ice. Despite a dramatic rescue effort by U.S. 
and Norwegian personnel, he was declared dead. His body was not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, the team abandoned plans to bring the tent to Lillehammer 
for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Amundsen and his team beat Briton Robert Scott in the race to become the first 
expedition to reach the South Pole. Scott died in the effort.

 REINDEER RUCKUS: Plans to haul a herd of reindeer from Norway's arctic region 
to Lillehammer for the Olympics have animal protection activists seeing as red 
as Rudolph's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160 reindeer, herded by Laplanders, are to be shipped 1,090 miles in rail 
cars or trucks for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the antlered animals -- commonly used as food in Norway -- will be 
paraded into the opening ceremony. Others will be available to give reindeer 
sleigh rides, or will simply mill around at a Lapp encampment being built for 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the animal protection group Dyrebeskyttelsen i Norge claims the reindeer 
are being made to suffer in the name of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "To ship reindeer on trucks or rail cars is pure cruelty to animals," said 
group spokeswoman Tatiana Kapsto. 
</P>
<P>
 The group asked the government to stop the plan, but the Ministry of 
Agriculture refused, saying that the domesticated reindeer are used to human 
activity and should withstand the trip with no trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am furious that the agriculture ministry has approved," Kapsto told the 
Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang. "We will mobilize heavily during the Olympics to 
show our disgust."

GOING HOLLYWOOD; MORE VALLEY CITIES ARE SEEKING STARRING ROLES AS LOCATIONS FOR 
MOVIES, TV SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose City Diner in Pasadena doubles as the Peach Pit on "Beverly Hills 
90210," Dave's White House was in Arcadia, and downtown Monrovia is having its 
15 seconds of fame in "Wayne's World 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley's all-American-looking cities have played a supporting 
role in Hollywood productions since D.W. Griffith filmed in Pasadena in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a handful of cities are going out of their way to lure movies, TV shows 
and commercials to the San Gabriel Valley. Pasadena, Sierra Madre and Monrovia 
have hired film liaisons to bring more film companies to town. In Altadena and 
other unincorporated areas, the Los Angeles County Film Office cuts through red 
tape to entice productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although filming has dropped by more than 12% in the movie industry's favorite 
location -- Los Angeles -- in the last two years, productions have increased in 
San Gabriel Valley areas. Since Pasadena hired a film liaison in 1985, the 
annual number of productions has more than doubled, with 470 film permits 
issued last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Likewise in the smaller communities of Altadena, Monrovia and Sierra Madre, 
with their picturesque, homey Midwest looks, the number of permits has risen 
steadily since they began to encourage filming. Last year, each issued 50 to 65 
permits. This year Monrovia became the latest San Gabriel Valley city to hire a 
liaison after the city began doubling as Rome, Wisc., on the CBS television 
show "Picket Fences."  
</P>
<P>
 "More cities are seeing the potential for economic development through 
filming," said Pamela A. Powell, deputy director of the California Film 
Commission, which promotes the industry in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money cities make from filming permits, hotels and local 
businesses get a boost, and so do residents who rent their homes to film 
companies. And then there's the intangible benefit of the free publicity 
garnered when a city makes a cameo appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said the San Gabriel Valley is popular with film companies in part 
because all cities except San Dimas, La Verne, Claremont and Pomona sit within 
a vital 30-mile zone, where 70% of movies are made. Beyond this zone, union 
crews are paid more, which increases production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant player in the movie location business in the San Gabriel Valley 
is Pasadena, where scenes from "Gone With The Wind," "The Sting" and "Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" were filmed. In 1993, filming was worth $5 
million to Pasadena's economy. Filming fees brought the city $700,000, far more 
than all other San Gabriel Valley cities combined, said Ariel Penn, the city's 
film liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 After Penn was hired in 1991, she helped the city draw up regulations and set 
permit fees to attract more filming. And in two years, filming in Pasadena has 
shot up 29%. She helps film crews arrange street closures, obtain police and 
fire backup, even find a better location -- all in the blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when Pasadena had a really bad rap, but that has all changed 
since Ariel," location manager Antoinette Levine said of the city's new 
eagerness to please. Penn helped Levine turn Old Pasadena's Dayton Street into 
Venice's Market Street for Columbia Pictures' soon-to-be released "I'll Do 
Anything," starring Nick Nolte. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million boost to Pasadena's local economy comes from fees to property 
owners ranging from $500 to $12,000 a day, and from film company spending on 
hotel rooms, food, equipment and other services, Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city charges $480.84 daily for permits on private property and $612.45 for 
filming on city property. Crews can spend up to six days every three months at 
one residence and longer if neighbors approve. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Michael Keaton in "My Life" lived in a 20,000-square-foot Arden 
Road home once used for "Dynasty" and the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup." "Addams 
Family Values" haunted a Manford Avenue home and "The Beverly Hillbillies" 
camped out in an Oaklawn Avenue estate. Crews from "Beverly Hills 90210" and 
"Murder, She Wrote" were regulars. And the Civic Center became the backdrop for 
"Love Affair" with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp-eyed television watchers can see the city in everything from Lexus ads 
to McDonald's commercials. The city in June played an East Coast town for Bell 
Atlantic and a month later, the Midwest for Michigan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn's daily challenge is to overcome a unique regional malady: location 
burnout. For example, residents of South San Rafael Road, where homes sell for 
$2 million and up, are regularly inundated by quarter-mile-long lines of movie 
trucks and trailers. Last month, the "Lois and Clark" TV show and the seventh 
"Nightmare on Elm Street" film joined the list of productions that have used 
the street, including the "Batman" TV series and the film "Dead Again." 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize complaints by neighbors, Penn promotes less well-known areas such 
as North Pasadena and has put together a book of 157 film locations whose 
owners want filming. Still, not all residents are pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film liaison is a movie industry representative," said Betty Keatinge, a 
San Rafael homeowner who led a neighborhood rebellion in 1991 against Paramount 
Pictures' plan to use helicopters to fly in sets for "Dead Again." She 
complained to the City Council, which refused to grant the studio an exemption 
from city filming rules without residents' approval, and the sets were trucked 
in instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn said complaints are rare, perhaps in part because 14,000 of the city's 
131,500 residents work in film production and related industries, according to 
the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Sierra Madre, Ruth and Jim Harmon were contracted eight years ago as 
liaisons after many residents began complaining of location burnout. The city, 
where the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" was shot, is now more 
appealing to the movie industry, city officials said, and complaints are dealt 
with quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get residents' authorization for filming and stay on the location to make 
sure the neighbors aren't bothered," Ruth Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon said many of the productions are filmed at an Italian villa in the 
Alverno High School, a private Catholic girls school which has played host to 
everything from the Guns N' Roses video "November Rain" to Tim Burton's "Ed 
Wood." 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings in money for scholarships," said Principal Elizabeth Broom, who 
declined to reveal how much money the school earns from filming. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city earned approximately $20,475 from the 49 permits issued 
for productions, including the movies "The Three Musketeers," "Man's Best 
Friend" and "Beethoven's 2nd." 
</P>
<P>
 In Monrovia, Old Town merchants and city officials are finding a financial 
windfall in the city's Middle America look. In 1993, the city hired a film 
liaison to oversee productions after "Picket Fences" became a regular part of 
town life. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the city and merchants closed Myrtle Avenue for two days and turned 
over Old Town to "Wayne's World 2" for a scene in which Mike Myers plows a car 
into a fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gayman, president of the city's Old Town Merchant's Assn., said he can 
give the OK to a production in the city center the same day a location manager 
calls, thanks to an agreement among shop owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we're selling tools or serving as a movie backdrop, it's all 
business," Gayman said. His Valley Hardware Store was featured as a 
Western-wear shop in the movie "Son-In-Law" in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Monrovia received more than $60,000 in permit fees and property 
owners received more than $300,000 for locations. Chamber of Commerce officials 
say productions have boosted the local economy and provided free advertising 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities private groups promote filming. Most of Arcadia's productions 
are at the invitation of the Foundation for Los Angeles State and County 
Arboretum. The foundation has increasingly turned to private fund raising after 
county budget cuts in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The arboretum, with its Queen Anne Cottage built by E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin in 
1906, has been the setting for more than 200 films. It was the centerpiece of 
television's "Fantasy Island," the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby hit "The Road to 
Singapore" and five Johnny Weismuller Tarzan movies. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the arboretum, which charges up to $3,900 a day to rent, co-starred 
in "Dave." The White House's Truman Balcony was built on the grounds. 
Moviegoers also saw Robert Redford charm Demi Moore in "Indecent Proposal." 
Arcadia issued 41 film permits in 1993. The city received $13,870 in return. 
</P>
<P>
 In an increasingly competitive market, some cities such as San Marino may have 
priced themselves out of consideration, location managers say. San Marino 
charges a minimum of $1,000 a day for permits to film on private property. With 
the recession and the move toward reality-based shows, San Marino has seen its 
film revenue drop from $45,000 to $25,000 in the last year, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others cities such as La Puente get few productions because they do not have 
an organized permitting process. La Puente officials say they simply cannot 
afford a film liaison to encourage filming. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of cities, location managers say, may be revitalizing their way out 
of the location business. "Wayne's World 2" was filmed in Monrovia partly 
because Covina's Citrus Avenue, where the original "Wayne's World" was shot, 
was remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Location manager Levine, who sought out Sierra Madre and Monrovia's pre-tract 
housing for the "China Beach" characters' return from Vietnam, gave this advice 
to other San Gabriel Valley cities interested in making it in show business: 
"Don't tear down your period buildings." Lights, Camera, Action! 03,22,31,20

CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Southeast area cities offer Christmas tree recycling. The trees are 
usually ground up and used instead of soil as cover at the Puente Hills 
Landfill. This saves space since the trees would otherwise be thrown into the 
landfill and extra soil added to cover them. Some of the shredded trees are 
also used as plant mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop-off site is available to all Los Angeles County residents from 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. todayand Jan. 8 and 9. It is in Whittier at Gunn Avenue Park, 10130 
Gunn Ave. Trees are not accepted with ornaments, stands or nails.

ART; LOVE, DEATH AND REBIRTH; TITIAN'S 'VENUS AND ADONIS,' THE GETTY MUSEUM'S 
LATEST ADDITION, IS A STORY OF AN OBJECT OF NEGLECT THAT BECAME AN OBJECT OF 
DESIRE, AND HOW ITS SUITORS BROUGHT THE AILING 400-YEAR-OLD CANVAS BACK TO 
PASSIONATE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Suzanne Muchnic is The Times' art writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two things about Titian are widely known: 
</P>
<P>
 He was the greatest painter in Venice in the 16th Century, when the city rose 
to its pinnacle of artistic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't buy a major work by him, even if you can afford it, because they are 
all owned by museums. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1991, when a soiled painting of "Venus and Adonis" was hauled down from 
its obscure position in an English country house and put up for auction at 
Christie's in London, conventional wisdom on the second count had to be 
revised. 
</P>
<P>
 Clumsily restored and darkened, the painting had been installed high above eye 
level in the home of the second Earl of Normanton, where scholars had long 
squinted at it and, for the most part, dismissed it as the work of Titian's 
assistants. When they finally got a close look, however, most agreed that 
"Venus and Adonis" was no mere workshop picture. It was essentially the work of 
the master himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement grew when George Goldner, then curator of paintings and drawings 
for the J. Paul Getty Museum, indicated an interest in the picture. When he 
summoned Getty conservator Andrea Rothe to inspect the painting's condition, 
the word was out: The Getty would go for the Titian. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Getty did not buy the painting at Christie's auction on 
Dec. 13, 1991. A partnership of dealers -- Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox of London and 
Herman Shickman of New York -- snagged it at $13.47 million, a record sum for a 
Titian and nearly twice the painting's estimated selling price of $7.2 million. 
The dealers claimed that they had purchased the picture as an investment, but 
the Getty soon arranged to buy it from them at an undisclosed price, contingent 
upon receiving an export license from British authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The license was granted about four months later, and in due time the Getty 
announced the purchase. Now -- after a year and a half of treatment and study 
in the museum's conservation laboratory -- "Venus and Adonis" is scheduled to 
go on view on Tuesday at the museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect to make an acquisition like this very often. It's too late in 
the game," Getty Museum Director John Walsh said of the spectacular new 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, landing a major work by one of the Western world's supreme painters is 
something of a miracle, said Goldner, who left the Getty in July to head the 
drawings and prints departments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
The best the Getty might have hoped for was a minor example, but the museum now 
claims one of a very few significant Titians in U.S. museums, second only to 
"Rape of Europa" at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Conisbee, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's former curator of 
European paintings and sculpture, also lauded the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is the boldest and best acquisition the Getty has made in European 
paintings. . . . I would certainly have bought it for the county if I had the 
means," said Conisbee, who left LACMA in the fall to become curator of French 
paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Getty, such miracles do happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect to get the Pontormo either," Walsh said of the Italian 
Mannerist's "Portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici," which had been on long-term loan 
to the Frick Collection for many years before the Getty bought it for $35.2 
million in a 1989 auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titian joins the Pontormo and Andrea Mantegna's "Adoration of the Magi" in 
a select group of the Getty's greatest purchases, Walsh said. "Venus and 
Adonis" will be the centerpiece of a "great little group of Venetian pictures," 
he said, referring to such paintings as Vittore Carpaccio's "Hunting on the 
Lagoon," Dosso Dossi's "Mythological Scene" and "An Allegory of Fortune," 
Sebastiano del Piombo's "Portrait of Pope Clement VII" and Paolo Veronese's 
"Portrait of a Man." The High Italian Renaissance is "practically a mined-out 
vein," Walsh said, but the museum has had surprising success in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venus and Adonis," which measures about 5 by 6 1/2 feet, was created circa 
1555-1560. Based on a mythological scene in Ovid's "Metamorphoses," the 
painting portrays a nude, voluptuous Venus attempting to restrain her lover 
from going off to hunt because she fears he will be killed. "Be brave against 
timorous creatures, but against bold creatures boldness is not safe," she warns 
in the literature. But Adonis declines her invitation to stay with her under a 
shady poplar tree and goes off to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting is likely to win the hearts of the public both for its subject 
matter and expressive style, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many works by Titian, this one really tells a story," he said. "In this 
case, the story is about love and death, and you can see that across the room. 
You can see Venus trying to hold back this impetuous kid and that he and the 
dogs are going off to hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew the story in Titian's time, and once you know that Adonis was 
going off to get gored to death by a wild boar, and that for days and days 
Venus had been sleeping with him, and trying to persuade him not to do this, 
you realize what the story is. It's brains against testosterone, I suppose, but 
also the pull of action and sensuality, adventure and common sense. It's a 
story that's part of everyone's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that's part of the appeal -- a story we understand," Walsh said. "The 
other half is . . . a cast of characters -- a beautiful Venus, an Adonis whose 
face shows a combination of pity and arrogance. It's all painted very solidly, 
so you believe in the characters . . . but softly and very expressively, and 
within a landscape that's full of movement, which tells you something very big 
is going on. . . . It's a universal story but quite particular in the warm, 
sympathetic way it is handled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story and its style of delivery are easier to appreciate now that the 
painting has been cleaned and restored by Rothe, the Getty's conservator in 
charge of paintings conservation. To the untrained eye, however, differences in 
the work's "before" and "after" appearance are not dramatic. There were no 
gaping holes to be patched, as has been the case in some of the laboratory's 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem was pinch marks due to the fact that the painting had been 
rolled up at a certain time in history," Rothe said, in an interview at the 
museum's conservation laboratory. Although the exact circumstances and date of 
the damage are unknown, ultraviolet photographs taken by the Getty have 
revealed parallel lines of stress running horizontally across the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Only minor spots of pigment had actually flaked off, but "outrageous masses of 
color were used to retouch the relatively small losses," he said. Awkward 
restorations done 20 or 30 years ago in London and much earlier in Italy masked 
sections of the original painting and disguised the underlying condition, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titian sometimes built up as many as 30 layers of thin glazes on his 
paintings, and these delicate glazes are frequently damaged or destroyed by 
overzealous cleaning, Rothe said. Failing to understand the extent to which 
unstable colors darken and glazes become more transparent, restorers sometimes 
think they can get back to brighter colors if they remove varnish. The danger 
is that they may actually remove Titian's glazes, he said, "and if cleaning is 
too harsh, there is nothing much you can do (to save a painting)." 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to Rothe's account of a typical Titian dilemma, Dawson Carr, the 
Getty's associate curator of paintings, said: "That's why Titians often look so 
raw and they lack a sense of modeled form and subtlety. So when Andrea started 
finding glazes on 'Venus and Adonis' we were elated." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of Titian's work had been painted over in "Venus and Adonis," it 
hadn't been destroyed. As Rothe worked -- proceeding through a four-step 
cleaning process of using progressively stronger solvents in increasingly 
selective areas -- he revealed many subtleties, including a dimple on Venus' 
back. Where losses of the original paint were disruptive to the eye, he filled 
them. In keeping with standard practice, all of the new conservation work is 
fully reversible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Titian's popularity has made the artist's work particularly vulnerable to 
damage, so some observers feared that "Venus and Adonis" might not be 
salvageable. But after examining it in London, Rothe disagreed. "I felt the 
condition hadn't compromised the painting so far that you couldn't retrieve it 
again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his excitement when Goldner called and confided, "I think we have a 
real one," Rothe said he was suffering from influenza at the time, but he 
dragged himself out of bed and onto a plane for London. "I felt absolutely 
revived after I saw it," he said. "I could recognize what the problems were." 
</P>
<P>
 The painting is not as good as new, however. As the work has aged, greens in 
the landscape have turned brown, for example, and that process cannot be 
reversed, but Rothe's faith in the picture appears to have been rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Andrea Rothe has done a wonderful job," said National Gallery curator 
Conisbee, who watched the painting emerge from layers of dirt and varnish 
during periodic visits to the Getty. "He revealed fresh color and rich passages 
of impasto and created a greater sense of space in the painting." 
</P>
<P>
 "Venus and Adonis" is the work of an immensely successful artist who was named 
Tiziano Vecellio and became known as Titian. He was born between 1480 and 1490 
and died of the plague in 1576. Titian was trained in Giovanni Bellini's 
workshop in Venice, worked as assistant to Giorgione and in the late 1520s 
became the leading painter in Venice. As his fame spread throughout Italy and 
beyond, his clients included Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III. 
</P>
<P>
 Titian created several versions of "Venus and Adonis," others of which can be 
found at the National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York, the National Gallery in Washington and the Prado Museum in Madrid. At 
some point in the future, Walsh hopes to assemble all these works at the Getty 
for public exhibition and scholarly study. 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype for the Getty's Titian is the Prado's more classical, restrained 
treatment of "Venus and Adonis," which was commissioned in the 1550s by Philip 
II of Spain. Nothing is known of circumstances surrounding the commission of 
the Getty's Titian, but the painting has been in distinguished collections, 
including that of Queen Christina of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given who had owned it, we should have known that it might very well be a 
better version than people supposed," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty's "Venus and Adonis" remains a topic of debate, however, with 
scholars disagreeing on exactly how much help Titian might have had with 
various parts of the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always discussion and speculation about who did what in paintings 
that were created in large workshops of successful artists," Walsh said. 
"Titian was in demand by everybody," he noted, and works created in his studio 
ranged from those done with minimal assistance to those he merely authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care very much that Titian's hand (is strongly in evidence in our 
painting), and we think it is there for the eye to see," Walsh said. "But we 
care more about the quality of the painting and its effectiveness, the 
importance of the subject and the state of conservation than the more arcane 
questions of whether an assistant painted this or that bit of drapery. The 
great thing is that now the painting is out where it can be seen."

FIRST PERSON: SCENES FROM ANOTHER LIFETIME; A ROLE IN OLIVER STONE'S MOVIE 
'HEAVEN AND EARTH' ALLOWS A JOURNALIST, WHOSE FAMILY FLED VIETNAM IN 1975, TO 
RELIVE THE TERROR OF WAR WHILE DISCOVERING ITS CONTRADICTORY LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was only 8 when my family left Saigon in 1975, and I was too young to 
comprehend the war around me. But in the last two years, I have begun to 
comprehend the Vietnam War and its aftermath in ways I had never expected. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened by accident when I heard about Oliver Stone's new film on Vietnam 
and ended up with a major role in it. "Heaven and Earth," which opened on 
Christmas Day, is based on the life of Le Ly Hayslip, born into a war-torn 
Vietnamese village, and the tortuous path that led her to America. Once here as 
a bewildered war bride, she adapts to new in-laws and a life in San Diego. It's 
a love story, an immigrant story and a survivor story. 
</P>
<P>
 But, most important, it is the first Hollywood movie about the Vietnam War 
from the Vietnamese perspective. Finally, moviegoers will see something other 
than a grunt's-eye view of that conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it was an unlikely triumph. Trained as a journalist and not as an 
actor, I was one of 8,000 Vietnamese Americans who auditioned for roles in the 
film as Stone's operation scoured the country. I was cast as Kim, a bar girl in 
Da Nang and one of Le Ly's older sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 On leave from The Times, I spent 2 1/2 months in Thailand, where not only did 
I and the other non-actors in the movie learn acting on the job, but I also saw 
close up the realities of a conflict I never knew personally. In character, we 
stood knee deep in the mud of rice paddies and cowered while American 
helicopters barking bullets interrupted our work; ran to a neighbor's house to 
witness his killing by the Viet Cong; and argued with each other about how to 
deal with the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet every evening, we left the rice fields and returned to the Phang Nga Bay 
Resort Hotel, where we enjoyed hot showers, ate sumptuous meals in 
air-conditioned dining rooms and slept on king-size beds. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this played havoc on my psyche. Day and night, I moved between the past 
and the present, war and peace, old enemies and new friends. No longer could I 
separate myself from the people and events I had known only intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than seeing how a movie was made, I learned the history of my birthplace 
from the Vietnamese extras who live in Thailand and who, to my surprise, have 
remained loyal to Ho Chi Minh. 
</P>
<P>
 And if ever in the past I have wavered in my opinions that communism is evil 
or that Washington should normalize relations with Hanoi as soon as possible, I 
found confirmation on this trip to Southeast Asia. Acting out scenes of 
destruction and pain helped me to fully grasp how people suffered once the Boy 
Scout-like Viet Minh troops turned into bullying Viet Cong cadres. 
</P>
<P>
 I first learned of the project two years ago in a Vietnamese-language daily 
newspaper published in Orange County, Nguoi Viet. The story announced open 
casting calls nationwide to look for a Vietnamese woman in her late teens or 
early 20s for the lead role and others to play her family. The article also 
said the script was not yet completed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was eager for a chance to help write the screenplay and ensure its 
authenticity, so I showed up for the audition in Westminster that Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the casting people told me the movie was based on Hayslip's two 
autobiographies, "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places" and "Child of War, 
Woman of Peace." The author was working closely with the director and there 
already were plenty of consultants, they said, but they asked me to stick 
around anyway to help audition the thousands of people who had been lining up 
outside since 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final casting call and I felt the magnitude and the importance of 
this potential movie as I watched people cry, laugh or scream their way through 
improvised scenes for screen tests. My people and I needed this movie for our 
spiritual therapy, I realized, just as some Americans worked to understand and 
heal their war wounds through films such as "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
 We emigres have been suppressing our sorrow and anger in the overwhelming 
effort to adapt in new homelands. A major motion picture telling the story of 
one of us would help the rest of us vent our emotions. I decided then that I 
had to be involved with this film, no matter how small my job. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing a screen test myself at the end of that day, I bought "When Heaven 
and Earth Changed Places" and read it for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before starting the novel, I was concerned that the story would stress again 
only the negatives of Vietnam in the American psyche. Hollywood movies about 
the war usually show peasants, prostitutes and bombed-out villages. Where are 
the courageous South Vietnamese soldiers, the handsome school buildings and the 
glorious flower markets of my youth in Saigon? 
</P>
<P>
 But the book went behind the scenes of those stereotypes. It told of a village 
in the middle ground of a battle having to buckle under two masters, a once 
tight-knit family being scattered by violence and a young, helpless woman with 
no skills resorting to the underworld to support an infant son and ailing 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayslip's story was the age-old tale of what one has to sacrifice not to drown 
under the waves of upheaval. And I wanted to help tell the story to anyone who 
wished to judge her decisions -- just as I had judged her before reading her 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 So I was excited when the casting people called me back in spring, 1992, for 
more tests. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted me to read for Kim, who becomes a bar girl after leaving her 
village. I didn't like that character, because she was cruel in the book. I 
changed my mind, however, after reading how Stone explained Kim in his script. 
He stressed that she was born with a harelip, was spurned by other villagers 
and other family members and was jealous of Hayslip when they were growing up. 
This buried resentment culminated in Kim's big scene, in which she behaves 
badly to her father and has to confront him and Hayslip. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's lines of anguish in these arguments really inspired my meager acting 
abilities during the later auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the first days on the set in Thailand, I was walking around the 
village built especially for the movie and wearing a prosthetic harelip glued 
on my mouth, when I saw two girls pointing at me and giggling. I looked closer 
at their faces, one 7 and the other 11, and had to laugh because their mouths 
also had fake scars. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not speak English, but a translator confirmed that they were to play 
Kim at different stages of her childhood. I was surprised to learn that their 
parents are Vietnamese and that the girls were born in a northeastern town of 
Thailand, near Vietnam's border. 
</P>
<P>
 I assumed that their families had emigrated there since 1975, after communists 
took over Saigon. But I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, the cast was in the Phung family home to practice such 
chores as shifting rice grains in baskets. As the Vietnamese Thais taught us, 
the older ones recounted their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Their families had slaved for the Japanese when they controlled Vietnam during 
World War II, one man said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese lost World War II in 1945, French colonists tried to regain 
the power they once had in Vietnam. In doing so, the French persecuted 
followers of Ho Chi Minh, who was trying to force out all foreign rulers and 
had the loyalty of many villages in the central region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uncle Ho," a woman said, persuaded the Thai government to let his people 
relocate to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of families then walked through forests and over mountains from 
central Vietnam in the early 1950s. On the way, many died of starvation or from 
eating sand out of desperation, another woman told us. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the Thai government had never allowed them citizenship or land 
ownership. And their children did not have the luxury of education beyond 
elementary school. But they still pray to Ho Chi Minh at their altars for 
having saved them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked the women to sing for us, so several stood up and sang of 
homesickness while they swung their arms rhythmically as if rowing a boat. 
Their songs added to my distress. 
</P>
<P>
 We see things so differently, I thought to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents emigrated from North Vietnam to South Vietnam to escape communism 
in 1955, only to flee from that regime again 20 years later to the United 
States. I remembered my father saying that he had hoped that Ho Chi Minh would 
save Vietnam for Vietnamese rule but that the man's communist ways also had 
oppressed our people and had shattered my father's illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are my relatives and other Vietnamese immigrants I have interviewed 
as a reporter. I've heard their testimonies of living under the communist 
government. Many had been imprisoned, starved into submission, deprived of 
religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, Ho Chi Minh remains a bogyman. To these people in front of me, he was a 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
 On the set, I was reminded of what nightmares Ho Chi Minh's forces could be. 
</P>
<P>
 One night was particularly unforgettable. The cast had walked onto the central 
courtyard to film a scene in which the Viet Minh soldiers changed from their 
idealist one-with-the-village behavior to the menacing attitudes of the Viet 
Cong. After killing a teacher, the soldiers in black uniforms were setting fire 
to buildings and fanatically dancing around the bonfires as a warning of more 
punishment if the whole village did not obey orders. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew the destroyers around me were only extras acting, but my face 
involuntarily twisted in pain and my eyes welled up with tears. I truly feared 
for my safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders, including city dwellers like my family, did not understand until 
too late what the Viet Cong were doing at the root of their extensive spy 
network: scaring many peasants into allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Phung family had two sons fighting for the Viet Cong, its 
officers still raped the youngest child, Le Ly, and later threatened to kill 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've been frustrated for years at books such as Frances FitzGerald's "Fire in 
the Lake," which seemed sympathetic to the Viet Cong as supposed rescuers of my 
birthplace from foreign invaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Viet Cong government is in Vietnam and I'm here in the United 
States, where Hayslip still is considered by many in the Vietnamese American 
community to be a communist. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons they cite are that she once served in a Viet Cong cadre and that 
her nonprofit group East Meets West builds hospitals in Vietnam because she 
works tightly with the current regime. This same group is also 
anti-normalization because it believes that helping the communist government 
will encourage it to continue to restrict human rights. That's not the picture 
I got when I returned to Saigon this time last year, after filming in Thailand 
was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we were already in the country next door, I went to the place renamed Ho 
Chi Minh City. Relatives there told how life has improved in the last five 
years as trade ties with other countries have improved. 
</P>
<P>
 They now can listen to Voice of America on the radio without being punished. 
They actually have money to fix up their homes instead of worrying about the 
next meal. And to attract tourists and businesses, the government has renovated 
buildings, allowed women and girls to wear again the traditional dress ao dai 
(which communists once banned because it was bourgeois) and invited 
international phone companies in to hook up communication lines with the rest 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was sweetest to me was that the word Saigon is printed on all 
postcards next to Ho Chi Minh City . 
</P>
<P>
 I felt I had lived two lifetimes. For the movie, there was the hell created by 
war. Then I visited what that hell has become. Although there still are 
problems and restrictions in Vietnam, what I saw was a promise of what could be 
if the nation were given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Others might not trust Hayslip, but I like how she ranks the welfare of the 
Vietnamese people over politics. It's only by working together with our former 
enemies that wars are won.

MOVIES; THE FIRE THIS TIME; DANIEL DAY-LEWIS DELIVERS A BLISTERING PERFORMANCE 
IN 'IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER' -- BUT THE CHARISMATIC STAR PLAYS HIS PERSONAL 
CARDS CLOSE TO THE VEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK MARIN, Rick Marin is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some actors play parts. Daniel Day-Lewis becomes them: "My Left Foot," "Last 
of the Mohicans," "The Age of Innocence." He's developed a reputation as an 
actor who out-Methods even big Method guys like De Niro, Pacino and Hoffman. He 
stays in character on movie sets whether the camera's rolling or not. He's been 
known to show up for interviews with the media affecting the costume and manner 
of his current project. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis' gift at becoming someone else on film only compounds the mystery of 
who this 36-year-old English actor is in real life. Sitting in a New York hotel 
suite to discuss his role in Jim Sheridan's "In the Name of the Father" -- in 
which he plays Gerry Conlon, an Irishman wrongly convicted of IRA bombing 
deaths in England -- Day-Lewis is not the enigmatic and brooding thespian that 
the press has often painted. 
</P>
<P>
 His wardrobe is casually stylish: black jeans, motorcycle boots, with a thick 
green turtleneck giving off just a hint of Irishness. His dark hair is short 
and unkempt, which detracts not at all from his charismatic good looks. He 
seems gregariously at ease, even upbeat. It might be an act, but who'd ever be 
able to tell? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never read any account of myself," Day-Lewis says, downplaying the 
mystique that has built up around him. "I mean, if people make my life seem 
mysterious, then I think that is probably a false impression. My life is fairly 
mysterious to me, but I don't see why it should be to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 He says this with an ironic half-smile. He hates talking about himself, and he 
hates talking about his acting. He did minimal publicity for Martin Scorsese's 
"The Age of Innocence" but has been much more compliant in promoting "In the 
Name of the Father" (which opened in Los Angeles and New York last week and 
opens wider this month), the success of which will largely depend on his 
considerable star power. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, critics have lavished praise on the film and Day-Lewis' performance; 
he was voted runner-up for best actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. for 
his work in both "Innocence" and "Father" and just won a Golden Globe 
nomination for best actor in a drama for "Father." 
</P>
<P>
 The case on which the movie is based, a cause celebre in England, is largely 
unfamiliar to most American audiences. Gerry Conlon was 19 and living in London 
when British authorities summarily arrested, charged and convicted him and 
three friends of the 1974 bombing of two pubs in Guildford, a London suburb. 
Dubbed the Guildford Four, they were branded as Irish Republican Army 
terrorists and served 15 years, despite the fact that they were innocent and 
had little if anything to do with the IRA -- a fact British authorities knew 
all along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, based on Conlon's book about his ordeal, "Proved Innocent," makes 
the Brits look very bad but does not endorse the brutal tactics of the IRA. The 
focus is on Conlon and his father, Giuseppe, who was imprisoned as an 
accomplice, and their complex and evolving relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis was persuaded to star in the film by Sheridan, who directed the 
actor's Oscar-winning performance in 1989's "My Left Foot." 
</P>
<P>
 "He started telling me the story, and by the time he was finished I was 
completely taken with it," Day-Lewis says. He also liked Conlon, whom he met 
while staying at Sheridan's house in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was most immediately struck by his sense of humor," Day-Lewis says. "He's 
very bright and very witty, and I was astonished to find myself howling with 
laughter at his descriptions of life in some of the toughest of Her Majesty's 
prisons. The story is so relentlessly grim that I think that humor was terribly 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides humor, Day-Lewis takes Conlon's character through violent extremes of 
pain, despair, sadness and, ultimately, joyous vindication. Sheridan, who also 
co-wrote the screenplay, says he "kind of wrote it with Daniel in mind, 
somebody with that kind of an intensity." Day-Lewis went to Belfast, met 
Conlon's family, and hung around their tough working-class neighborhood to 
absorb the accent and what Sheridan calls the "physicality" of the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Once filming started, Day-Lewis had transformed himself into Gerry Conlon, 
physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like Gerry playing Daniel sometimes," Sheridan says. "When we were 
doing the interrogation scenes, he kind of got himself into a state of absolute 
tiredness where he was on the verge of tears all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pete Postlethwaite, the English actor who plays Giuseppe Conlon: "There 
were times when I didn't know if he was reacting to me as me or as Giuseppe or 
if he was being Dan or Gerry. It's just the way Dan works. It's total." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Pfeiffer, Day-Lewis' co-star in "Age of Innocence," describes him as 
"very pleasant to be around." Did she get to know him? "No," she says. Because 
he was his character, Newland Archer, the whole time? "If he wasn't Newland, he 
was a very protected Daniel. He's not one to wear his heart on his sleeve. He's 
very private, and one learns to respect that. I mean, he's very warm and 
engaging, but he really does keep things to himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese, who first saw Day-Lewis in 1988's "The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being," praises the actor's "dedication to the work." What they concentrated 
on, Scorsese says, was "minimal movement and expression" by Day-Lewis' Archer. 
</P>
<P>
 The director describes a moment at the end of the movie between Archer and his 
son. It is a pivotal scene, revelatory for Archer, and Scorsese filmed 
Day-Lewis' reaction both as a medium-distance shot and a close-up: 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at both shots, and I realized the medium was better because Daniel 
does this little subtle movement with his body that says as much if not more 
than the close-up did. I didn't need the close-up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis insists that there's nothing unusual about his approach to acting: 
"Basically, it's just common sense. Any person who wants to understand a life 
and to borrow that life for a while, there are various means by which you do 
that. The reason I get involved with things in the first place is the life . 
It's not the idea of making a film that appeals to me; it's the idea of 
discovering a life which is fascinating to me. It's not like an exercise in 
self-flagellation or some kind of willful act of dedication that leads one to 
work in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to explore a life, the easiest way to explore it is from 
within, by holding onto it, and not sort of wandering in and out of it and 
wearing it one moment and slinging it off the next." 
</P>
<P>
 He cuts himself off, saying, "This is all junk, because I'm talking about 
something I don't really understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors and directors who have worked with him, even friends like Sheridan who 
have known him for years, seem hard-pressed to say what there is of Day-Lewis' 
life in the very different lives of the characters he's played. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very self-disciplined guy," says Michael Mann, who directed 
"Mohicans." Postlethwaite pronounces him "egoless." Scorsese cites his 
"elegance" and "respect for other people." The comments about him seem almost 
random. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike so many actors, even ones known for completely inhabiting their roles, 
Day-Lewis seems to bring no idiosyncratic traits or tics to the screen with 
him. A few qualities those who know him agree on: intelligence, humor, 
intensity. Mann adds one more to the list: anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a moment of killing rage in 'Mohicans,' " he says. "And there's a 
rage inside Daniel. You don't summon that from outside yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 As the title suggests, much of "In the Name of the Father" deals with the 
difficult relationship between the brash, rebellious Gerry Conlon and his 
father, Giuseppe, a God-fearing, peaceful man plagued by a weak heart. 
Day-Lewis' own father, English Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, died when Daniel 
was 15, after a long illness. Day-Lewis denies that he is haunted by his famous 
father, though he once collapsed onstage while playing Hamlet and said later 
that it was because he, like the melancholy Dane, had seen his father's ghost. 
He calls that story a "half-truth" but acknowledges that certain feelings about 
his father "filtered" into this film. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always want your father to be the big fella," he says. "So I did sort of 
understand the resentment of illness that Gerry has for Giuseppe. It is 
shocking to see someone who's very big shrinking while you're sort of going the 
other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis cuts himself off again, as he tends to do when the conversation gets 
too personal or cuts too close to the bone. "Do you want a cookie? They're 
rather good," he offers, grinning and biting into one himself, then washing it 
down with cola. Neither of these substances jibes with his legendarily ascetic 
dietary habits prohibiting meat, sugar, starch, caffeine and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," he says. "I've gone through periods of living like that. At 
the moment I'm half-on, half-off. Cookies are acceptable and I'm drinking 
again." His rules about drinking only on weekends while filming "In the Name of 
the Father" didn't last long, he says with amusement. "With Gerry's story, it 
seemed to be quite important that I drink." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Connecting with Conlon's -- and his own -- Irishness was another reason 
Day-Lewis was drawn to this film. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Frears, the director of one of the actor's first films, "My Beautiful 
Laundrette," once said, "I knew Daniel before he was Irish." The crack still 
bugs Day-Lewis, who was born and raised in England but recently acquired a 
passport issued by Ireland (his father's native country) and soon plans to move 
into a house in the south of Ireland. He resents the implication that his 
Irishness is some kind of pretentious pose or silly affectation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's got nothing better to do, he sits around and tries to think of 
something more unpleasant to say than the last thing he said," Day-Lewis says 
of Frears. "My sister and I were both educated in England, so we are both 
English in that sense, but my father took great pains to introduce us to his 
country and make us feel that it was as much a home as any place. Yes, I love 
Irish music. I love Irish people. I love the Irish country." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't say where in the south of Ireland he's moving. Nor will he discuss 
his reported involvement with French actress Isabelle Adjani, although he wears 
an Irish claddagh ring with the heart pointing inward, which indicates romantic 
attachment, rather than the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do ask me about it, I'll probably sling you out on your ear," he says 
with Gerry Conlon-like swagger. Pressed on the meaning of the ring, he simply 
smiles: "Wonder away." 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis' status as a sex symbol started with "Unbearable Lightness," which 
had him saying, "Take off your clothes" in a bored monotone to assorted 
Euro-babes. But it was his mostly shirtless performance in "Mohicans" that 
cemented his image as the thinking woman's Tom Cruise. But his appeal, though 
undeniable, is hard to put into words -- even from someone like Pfeiffer, who 
should be unflustered by such questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the fact that he's gorgeous?" Pfeiffer says. "He has a certain 
kind of darkness about him that's appealing. He's very intelligent. And he has 
an innate sensitivity that came through even in 'Last of the Mohicans,' which 
was a macho role." 
</P>
<P>
 With evident embarrassment, Day-Lewis avoids the topic by protesting that his 
"Mohicans" muscles fell off "in about a week and a half." When he was in Dublin 
making "In the Name of the Father," he says, the local women were disappointed 
in him: "They come up to me prodding me in the chest and saying, 'Where did it 
all go? Look at you, you miserable little bastard. Where did all those lovely 
muscles go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't know what his next film will be, and he plans to take at least 
several months off, he says, "to keep my head down, hide for a while." Told 
that a reviewer once suggested that somebody should remake "Wuthering Heights" 
because Day-Lewis would make such a good Heathcliff, he takes the notion as a 
high compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever read 'Wuthering Heights'?" he asks. "It's one of the most 
violent and depressing books I've ever read in my life. I reread it not that 
long ago with a view to maybe doing something about it. Heathcliff is one of 
the most unrelentingly morbid characters I've ever come across in literature." 
He pauses, savoring the memory. "But very appealing."

 No one could be happier to kiss '93 goodby than Kim Basinger. Last year at 
this time, the actress was facing a multimillion-dollar civil suit over a role 
that changed her life forever. Ironically, it was a role she never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new year rolls in, Basinger finds herself focusing on her new marriage 
to Alec Baldwin, thinking of starting a family and rebuilding her shattered 
career -- all in the midst of wiping out everything she owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as though I have been through a crash course in life," Basinger says. 
"It's been an incredible ride. I've had the highs of meeting my soul mate, but 
the lows of having my life ripped apart for something I didn't do. I wouldn't 
change the knowledge I've gained for anything. Just don't ever ask me to repeat 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's crash course in the school of hard knocks came to a head last 
spring. In May, 1991, she had decided to pass on playing the lead role in a 
small Jennifer Lynch film about a woman whose arms and legs are cut off by a 
doctor obsessed with her. Basinger had considered taking the role in "Boxing 
Helena," but reconsidered on the advice of her agent because of the dicey 
subject matter. The film's producers then sued her for breach of oral contract. 
On March 24, 1993, a jury in Los Angeles Superior Court told Basinger to pay 
the producers $8.9 million in damages. (The judge later reduced the award to 
$7.4 million, but with attorneys fees added, it currently stands at $8.1 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 The film, with Sherilyn Fenn in the lead role, was ultimately released in 
September and bombed badly at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned and, she says, with no way to make such a payment, Basinger filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 24, which her lawyers converted to a Chapter 7 
just last Monday. The change now means that her estate will be subject to 
immediate liquidation and distributed to creditors.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 40, she finds herself grappling with uncertain finances and a very 
bruised reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been done to this woman is so unfair, I can't even find the right 
words to describe it," says Baldwin, who has been Basinger's companion for 
several years and married her last summer. "After what I watched her go through 
in that courtroom day after day, I believe there is no justice for people like 
her in this country. These people are trying to destroy her." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin remains undaunted in his devotion to his wife, boosting her morale 
daily and helping her rebuild her career, even as his own career flourishes. "I 
will not stop until she gets her fair shake," he says. It was Baldwin who 
planned and prepared their beachfront wedding in East Hampton, right down to 
the surprise fireworks and the white baby roses in her tiara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alec and I want lots of kids everywhere -- a big family," Basinger says. "I 
never want to give up my work, don't get me wrong. But he is my life's focus. 
After all of this, sometimes I think there would be no Kim Basinger without 
Alec. Some days, during this insane ordeal, I would look at him and ask, 'Who 
is Kim Basinger?' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There is a crisp December breeze blowing as Basinger strolls through her 
Woodland Hills back yard to a place she calls sanctuary, Shih Tzu puppies 
nipping at her heels. The small structure holds two sun-filled rooms: 
downstairs a gym and upstairs an entertainment area with a white piano, a TV 
and stereo system atop a cinder block-and-board shelf (the kind most students 
have in college) and the chaise longue keepsake from the set of "The Marrying 
Man," the 1991 Disney film where Basinger met Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in a white T-shirt and baggy overalls and sitting cross-legged on the 
lavender carpet, Basinger settles down to her first lengthy interview since 
last year's monumental events, her voice rising as her tale unfolds. It's a 
tale of a verdict that shocked much of Hollywood and includes, she and her 
lawyers say, some questionable actions on the part of the judge and clerk in 
the case. It's a tale of facing bankruptcy after being one of Hollywood's most 
visible and successful actresses -- a bankruptcy that her creditors have tried 
to use to prevent her from becoming pregnant (a pregnancy, they say, would 
interfere with her ability to work for at least several months; that in turn 
would affect income that would ultimately go to them).  
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot: After a gap of several months since her last movie, 
Basinger's career is showing signs of life. Branded the co-stars from hell 
during the filming of "The Marrying Man" -- a set allegedly disrupted by 
tantrums, broken and hurled equipment, fights with the crew, producer and 
director, and cellular phones being ripped out of studio executives' hands by 
the stars in fits of pique -- she and Baldwin are back on screen in Roger 
Donaldson's action-packed remake of "The Getaway" for Largo Entertainment, due 
Feb. 11. It couldn't come at a better time.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "You know, after all of this, I've become sick of the sound of my own name," 
Basinger says, referring to the seemingly endless publicity surrounding last 
spring's "Boxing Helena" trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga actually began in January, 1991, when Jennifer Lynch, daughter of 
director David Lynch, walked into Basinger's production office off Coldwater 
Canyon Road with what Basinger thought might be an interesting, albeit twisted, 
script. It was the first of what would be three fateful meetings with Lynch.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I read it, I looked at the imagination," Basinger says. "I remember 
thinking, 'Was this story somebody's bad dream?' Like most actors, I always 
look for new writers with different material and I thought this was another 
woman trying to make it in this town. 'Give her a chance' (I thought). She 
seemed to know what she wanted. It was refreshing to see her enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everything went sour after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger insists she never committed verbally to playing Helena, the woman who 
is dismembered, and ultimately backed out on the advice of her ICM agent, Guy 
McElwaine. Lynch and Main Line Pictures producer Carl Mazzocone contend she did 
commit. Basinger says she never even met Mazzocone -- who pre-sold the movie to 
overseas distributors based on her anticipated involvement -- until her 
pretrial deposition. Mazzocone actually negotiated with Basinger's lawyer, 
Julie Philips of Bloom, Dekom, Hergott and Cook.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to make clear is that this was no handshake deal or some 
agreement scrawled on a cocktail napkin," Mazzocone says. "On Feb. 27, 1991, 
all deal points were reached and memorialized on a deal memo. After the deal 
memo, we started to exchange long-form acting service agreements. After seven 
drafts of long-form agreements, we reached the execution copies. Her agents and 
lawyers were authorized to act on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I stood up for is the 'deal memo.' That is what this town operates on." 
</P>
<P>
 But Basinger insists that her agents and lawyers were not authorized to sign 
off on any project, only to negotiate on her behalf. She never signed any deal 
memo, which is basically considered a working document in progress between a 
producer and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Helena" was Mazzocone's first feature to produce, it wasn't his first 
round with a star on deal memos or on deal memos with "Helena," for that 
matter. Madonna preceded Basinger, with discussions falling apart in December, 
1990, one month before Basinger was approached. In fact, Madonna had been 
further along in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna left these people in wardrobe fittings! When I met Jennifer for the 
first time, I didn't know who was walking into my office that afternoon," 
Basinger says. "I didn't know a woman (Jennifer) and a man (Mazzocone) had just 
been essentially fired by somebody else . . . that they were coming from such 
desperation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mazzocone didn't sue Madonna. The difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna solicited us ," Mazzocone says. "We relied on her because she wanted 
the part and then she bailed," four weeks before shooting. "We didn't sue her 
because we found Kim." Because Basinger was a bigger film star overseas, her 
casting meant more money upfront from foreign distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that I would wish this on Madonna or anyone," says Basinger, but she 
stills feels like a scapegoat. "The point is this whole thing is absurd, 
especially when you consider I never even met Mazzocone, never even talked to 
him until the deposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Philips, Basinger's attorney, says: "I knew there was no agreement (then), 
just as I sit here today. Main Line, like any small independent producer trying 
to raise money, wasn't in any position to commit $600,000 to Kim Basinger," her 
salary on the film. "The irony of this whole nightmare is that as the 
negotiations dragged on, I remember being concerned that Main Line would throw 
in the towel and Kim might be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzocone, 34, who says he's been in the business 12 years, meanwhile feels 
vindicated for taking on a big star and the Hollywood infrastructure -- and 
winning. "I beat those people," he says. "I think the catalyst in this whole 
thing was (ICM's Guy) McElwaine, the big shot, grandfatherly agent who thought 
I was just some moth he could flick off his shoulder." But Mazzocone proved too 
big a moth. "He underestimated his opponent. McElwaine sank this ship and he 
got off the hook, because under the law agents are bulletproof in these deals." 
ICM was eventually dismissed as a co-conspirator in the case. Basinger is now 
represented by another ICM agent, Andrea Eastman. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people were wanna-bes," Basinger says. "They needed someone to go after 
and it ended up being me. I just can't believe I'm caught up in the middle of 
this. It has made me a nervous wreck. I don't see myself as some victim or 
martyr -- I hate those words, they're so pathetic. People ask me, 'Why didn't 
you settle? Pay them $600,000 and get rid of them.' At no time did it ever 
cross my mind to settle. This town is all about settling. I didn't do anything 
wrong. Never, ever will I settle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How Kim Basinger ultimately fares in the legal system remains to be seen, as 
her case is far from over. Lawyer Irving H. Greines is already shaping her 
appeal, which will probably not be resolved until sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 38-page appellate motion for a new trial filed a month after the verdict, 
Basinger's lawyers attack the jury's damages as excessive; cite prejudicial 
error on the part of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin, who 
presided over the case, and her refusal to instruct the jury properly; allege 
failure by the judge to advise the jury of ICM's dismissal as a co-conspirator 
in the case, and point to what they say is insufficient evidence to determine 
that an oral agreement existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an appellate lawyer I see the disasters. But in the 26 years that I have 
been practicing appellate law, this case ranks at or near the top," Greines 
says. "This one is an appellate dream case because some of the errors are of 
the most elemental type." 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Basinger's team believes the jury's verdict demanding Basinger 
to pay Main Line a massive damage award based on gross revenues, not net 
profits, was excessive and against the law. They say the jury ignored the 
court's instruction to award net profits -- which would have fallen between 
$895,000 and $1.1 million -- and went for the higher gross amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, her lawyers say the jury had insufficient evidence to conclude that 
an oral agreement existed. Not directly considered was the Screen Actors Guild 
rule demanding that a written contract -- not oral -- exist for a producer (in 
this case, Mazzocone) to require a star (Basinger) to perform nude, as dictated 
in the script of "Helena." An oral agreement cannot supersede the SAG nudity 
rule. Basinger's lawyers say Chirlin never instructed the jury about the SAG 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 On this subject, at least, they seem to have a point. Juror Chawn Sanders 
says: "The SAG rule never came up when we were in (verdict) discussions. It's 
kind of funny because they were talking about the nudity issue during the 
majority of the trial. Now that I think about it, (consideration of the SAG 
rule) probably would have affected the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's lawyers also contend in the appellate motion Judge Chirlin erred in 
failing to inform the jury that ICM had been dropped from the case or to 
instruct them on Madonna's aborted involvement; refusing to allow Basinger's 
attorneys to provide evidence regarding the industry's customary practices to a 
jury unfamiliar with such, and, dropping the critical words "and agreed upon" 
in telling the jury that preliminary negotiations may result in a binding 
contract when material terms are understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This judge gave jury instructions that were absolutely wrong on the law," 
Greines says. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Judge Chirlin says her instructions were performed properly. 
And, she adds, "The fact of the matter is that throughout the trial, a 
significant portion of my rulings were in favor of Kim." 
</P>
<P>
 While Basinger's appeal will be fought on points of law and evidence in the 
case, allegations of Chirlin's other missteps can play no part in appellate 
strategy. But Basinger and her attorneys believe Chirlin's behavior had a 
subliminal, if not direct, effect on the minds of the jurors and their verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, they say other court clerks held a baby shower for the judge's 
clerk Syndy Scaife-Richard in the courtroom next door during a noon break in 
the trial. Both Basinger and Baldwin, inexplicably, had been invited to the 
shower by Scaife-Richard, and Basinger says she felt compelled to attend, under 
the peculiar circumstances. She spent part of the time at the party signing 
autographs and chatting it up with the judge, and some of the judge's employees 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all very nice, but I felt very uncomfortable being there," Basinger 
says now. "To be honest, I wasn't sure what to do. Nobody came from the 
(plaintiff's) side. We took pictures with the judge's mother. I felt like I had 
signed up for an episode of 'Night Court.' What it turned out to be was a 
kangaroo court." 
</P>
<P>
 Trial attorney Howard L. Weitzman put it another way. "Look, this was very 
improper. Kim shouldn't have been invited because it made her feel she had to 
show. This woman was a defendant in a case, on trial for her financial life. 
She shouldn't have been put in that position. Imagine the implication if Kim 
hadn't gone: 'Check out the pretty star snubbing us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin says that's not the case. "My staff is very friendly and they asked 
Kim to the shower. I had no idea she would be there. You have to understand the 
courtroom is the workplace for these employees and they held a shower there, 
just as any office would for a co-worker." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the verdict was announced, Weitzman says, Chirlin hugged Lynch and 
Mazzocone in the courtroom for all to see. "I've never, ever seen a judge come 
out and hug parties after a verdict," Weitzman says. "Most judges at least try 
to maintain an appearance of objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Counters Chirlin: "I don't remember being embraced, but it is not something I 
would initiate. I do remember them (Lynch and Mazzocone) being ecstatically 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin does recall Lynch and Mazzocone hugging members of the jury. "I would 
have hugged a tree, anything, anybody. I just made nearly $10 million," 
Mazzocone says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember after the trial, Jennifer and Mr. Mazzocone told us (the jurors) 
they were inviting us to the premiere," juror Sanders says. "I remember walking 
out of the courtroom thinking, 'That's strange. How can they have a premiere, 
when they kept saying during the whole trial they didn't have enough money to 
finish the movie?' We had been under the impression they couldn't get it sold 
and now they were having a premiere? Oh, well -- I didn't go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chirlin did attend the premiere. Her attendance also sticks in Weitzman's 
craw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did go to the premiere and in retrospect I probably shouldn't have gone, if 
they perceive it as a problem with my fairness," Chirlin says. "But by the time 
of the premiere, the trial was over." The appeal, she adds, was not weighing on 
her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 19, the day Basinger married Baldwin, a strange letter was being 
written to the star. A week or so later, it turned up at Basinger's office. She 
didn't know what to think; her attorney Julie Philips had the same reaction. "I 
think Julie fell on the floor when I read it to her. She couldn't believe her 
ears. I still can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Sent by clerk Scaife-Richard, the letter read, "Dear Kim: I have a really big 
favor to ask of Alec, but out of respect for you and your relationship with 
him, I thought it would be better to convey my request through you. Besides, 
soon you will be Mrs. Baldwin anyway. Right??? (smile) 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I thought of you first, but I would not want to place you in a 
compromising position and add to your legal problems in light of your 
bankruptcy filing. I don't know if you should be flattered that I thought of 
you first or relieved that I decided to ask Alec instead. (smile)" 
</P>
<P>
 Scaife-Richard goes on to talk about a family friend, an unnamed professional 
basketball player, and his wife who promised to loan her $125,000 to buy a 
house. But then the couple decided to divorce and rescinded their offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and Alec are the only other individuals I know who might have and be 
willing to loan this large amount of money," she wrote. "Having had the 
opportunity to meet you both in person, I know that you are 'down to earth' and 
hopefully have a sympathetic ear," Scaife-Richard continued. "Hopefully, I have 
not tarnished your opinion of me by making this request. It was very hard for 
me to set aside my pride and write this letter. I have great respect for you 
both and will respect your decision whatever it may be. All transactions shall 
be CONFIDENTIAL." Then she spelled out the terms: The clerk would issue Baldwin 
and Basinger a promissory note of $131,250 ($125,000 principle plus 5% 
interest) to be paid in full over 22 years at $497.15 a month. The postscript 
was a picture of the clerk and her three children, including the baby she had 
been carrying during Basinger's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by The Times why she didn't consider a bank loan, an embarrassed 
Scaife-Richard -- who is still clerking for Chirlin -- said the interest was 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin had no part in the letter. In fact, she was shocked when Philips wrote 
her about it on Oct. 19, following a second missive from the clerk (dated Oct. 
4) detailing her intended use of the loaned funds. That letter, Philips says, 
followed numerous calls to Basinger's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin's words in a letter to Philips were "stunned and appalled" and have 
been duly noted in the Basinger file. She said the clerk would be admonished. 
She was.

 "I hate the lawyers," Mazzocone rants. "I hate the system. Who knew I was 
dealing with a Kamikaze case?" Mazzocone is miffed that Basinger converted her 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, filed May 24, into a Chapter 7 
liquidation last week. She converted primarily because Mazzocone and his 
lawyers had insisted on a third party being brought in to determine what movie 
roles she would take. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, instead of stalling payment to Mazzocone and her other 
creditors -- under a Chapter 11 reorganization, there are more options in how 
assets can be distributed to creditors, over a more flexible time period -- she 
now faces one-time liquidation of the assets she has right now, which then 
would be distributed to creditors, ending the process. Her bankruptcy lawyer, 
Leslie Cohen, says Basinger had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became apparent there was no plan she could provide that would satisfy 
them," Cohen says. "They just had to keep hounding her. They wanted a third 
party to exercise control over her decisions over whether or not to accept 
work, which movies to make. That's involuntary servitude. They wanted her to 
reveal her plans about having a baby. That's against her constitutional rights 
-- it was ridiculous. It was the last straw." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger still bristles at the demands, pacing as she talks. "Just imagine 
them saying that to a man -- telling him he couldn't have a family. They wanted 
to know if I planned to take out a life insurance policy. What does that mean? 
What do these people want from me -- my arms, my heart, my soul? What? This 
goes beyond any civilized demands . . . any human decency." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though our (Chapter 11) plan provided much more than the law required 
and much more than Main Line would have gotten in a Chapter 7, nothing was good 
enough for them," Cohen says. "Kim would have escrowed three years of earnings 
and all of her assets until the appeal was resolved under an 11. She would have 
kept $10,000 a month to live on, plus the $9,000 a month she has to pay in 
alimony (to her first husband, Ron Britton).  
</P>
<P>
 "Now her assets will be liquidated by a court trustee and they'll have to take 
what they get in the pecking order of creditors. It shouldn't have come to 
this, but Kim had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy documents show Basinger, who can command a $3-million salary on 
some films, had net earnings of $7.9 million for 1988 through 1992. She 
projects her net income this year to be $846,429, which includes income from 
the upcoming "The Getaway," proceeds from a bit part as Garth's girlfriend in 
the current "Wayne's World 2" and a fee from an appearance in a Spanish 
commercial for the champagne Freixenet.  
</P>
<P>
 Basinger has asked the bankruptcy court to consider several factors beyond her 
control: That her films, except for "Batman," have not performed well at the 
box office; that actresses over 40 are offered fewer roles, and that the 
"relentless" trial coverage has damaged her reputation with potential 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzocone counters that Basinger could get plenty of work. He sees her Chapter 
7 conversion as completely self-destructive. "I just want my money, what she 
owes me. This is their grand way of stalling." After a court-appointed trustee 
liquidates Basinger's assets under the Chapter 7, any money due Mazzocone would 
be put into an escrow account until the appeal is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzocone and his lawyers have accused Basinger in court documents regarding 
her bankruptcy of hiding assets, saying their value was closer to $5 million 
and up than the $3 million she has claimed. They've challenged the 5% interest 
she says she has had in a partnership since 1989, which bought the town of 
Braselton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe she has squirreled away valuable antiques and probably holds more 
property interests than she's letting on. That includes her Coldwater Canyon 
production company, Porch Swing Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around. This is what I have," Basinger says. "This" is a modest tract 
home -- at least by movie-star standards -- that she paid $150,000 for 14 years 
ago that her appraiser now values at $600,000. It has three smallish bedrooms. 
A row of chipped-paint Georgia rockers in varying sizes are lined up in front 
of her living room fireplace. A white couch and matching chaise that look as if 
they came from Stylus are in the den.  
</P>
<P>
 Special touches include a stained-glass window at the entry way, a 
room-separating bar that has been turned into an aquarium, a carousel horse and 
a long pine table covered with vanilla candles. There's a fenced-in pool in the 
back yard where she and Alec take evening swims. And of course, there's her 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, I'm more famous for the things that I haven't done than for 
what I have done," muses Basinger. Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 As a shy girl in Athens, Ga., young Kim would while away the hours with a 
girlfriend, dreaming of becoming an actress and having her friend be her 
"dresser." As a teen-ager she became Athens' Junior Miss beauty queen. At age 
16 headed for New York to become a Breck girl and eventually a model. The 
camera loved her blond mane and sensuous features, a product of Swedish, German 
and Cherokee bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dream of acting started to unfold in 1979 with the TV movie "Katie: 
Portrait of a Centerfold," with Basinger playing the centerfold, and then the 
1980 NBC miniseries "From Here to Eternity." Her motion picture debut happened 
in late 1980, opposite Jan-Michael Vincent, in "Hard Country." The next year, 
Basinger co-starred with Charlton Heston in "Mother Lode."  
</P>
<P>
 Her breakthrough was playing Domino in the 1983 James Bond film "Never Say 
Never Again." That same year she starred for Blake Edwards in "The Man Who 
Loved Women" and played a femme fatale -- Robert Redford's mistress -- in Barry 
Levinson's "The Natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Then her career careened off into more controversial parts: Adrian Lyne's "9 
1/2 Weeks" -- what Basinger considers her toughest role to date -- and "Fool 
for Love," with Sam Shepard. A few other forgettable roles preceded what would 
be her biggest part to date: that of reporter Vicki Vale in Warner Bros.' 1989 
blockbuster "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite role, though, was the lead in Robert Benton's 1987 quirky 
romantic comedy "Nadine" -- "the most beautifully written role I've read," 
Basinger says. She has also played more than her share of truly ridiculous 
parts in such films as "My Stepmother Is an Alien" and the animated feature 
"Cool World."  
</P>
<P>
 The turning point in her career -- and life -- was 1991's "The Marrying Man." 
Basinger had just ended an unhappy eight-year marriage to Britton, her makeup 
artist. She describes her wild fling with pop star Prince that followed as a 
"pit stop, post divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she was in Minnesota with Prince when she first talked to Baldwin, 
who rang to ask her about co-starring in "The Marrying Man." Many phone 
conversations followed. Finally they met on the set. They went to dinner at 
Morton's the first night to discuss the film. They came in two cars. They left 
in one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He actually had car trouble. We came back to the house. We were talking, up 
here" in the sanctuary. "He kissed me and then asked me if I wanted kids. That 
was the beginning," says Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the beginning of what some cast and crew on the set called a 
journey into bedlam. Reports began to surface that Basinger and Baldwin pulled 
outrageous shenanigans, cursing at the producer and director, hurling chairs in 
the air, grabbing phones out of Disney executives' hands. Producer David 
Permutt, who had worked with Basinger on "Blind Date," had some of the biggest 
rows with the stars. While 1987's "Blind Date" had been a positive experience 
with Basinger, Permutt says he'd "never ever" work with Basinger or Baldwin 
again. Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg also grumbled at the time about the 
pair and his difficulties working with them.  
</P>
<P>
 The feelings are mutual, say Basinger and Baldwin. In fact, both say the 
accounts were blown out of proportion. They also say they were promised things 
by Disney that never happened. They write it off as an unpleasant experience 
that had a great ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "That film was a media mad-dog frenzy," says Basinger. "I can say that a lot 
of that stuff wasn't true, but what's the point? It's over. Do people treat me 
different after 'The Marrying Man'? Some do. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I learned from that experience was how to stand up for myself, 
which was hard for me in the past. I look back and have to thank Disney and 
Jeffrey Katzenberg," she adds. "If it had not been for Jeffrey I wouldn't have 
met Alec or had a chance to sing. I always wanted to sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Several films followed, including "Final Analysis" and last fall's "The Real 
McCoy." The latter was another box-office disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film was originally a love story that turned into a caper movie," she 
says. "I blame myself in part for this. I fought to get Val Kilmer in the 
movie, but he just wasn't into it. It just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's producer, Martin Bregman, also grouses about Kilmer. "He almost 
tried to destroy the picture. We had to rewrite it because of him," says 
Bregman. "But Kim was terrific, a real pro. Never late, always very prepared, 
always very helpful and never an ounce of trouble. She was a classy, nice 
woman, who always brought cookies to the crew.  
</P>
<P>
 "With 'The Marrying Man' they had a director who never made anything but an 
animated picture and didn't know how to handle stars. Stars need strong 
directors. I'm working with Alec now on 'The Shadow' and I would say the same 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have recommended Kim to other producers around town," says Bregman. "And I 
would say unequivocally she is the most misunderstood talent in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Frank Mancuso Jr., who worked with her on "Cool World," and Chuck 
Roven, who produced "Final Analysis," say the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Larry Gordon, who just wrapped "The Getaway," says he got calls from 
colleagues asking about his experience working with the couple. "Zero problems. 
I mean it -- zero. And this was a tough shoot, six days a week in the (Arizona) 
desert. Lots of action. But they were total pros and I love them both." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Testimonials aside, none of Basinger's films have been big moneymakers except 
"Batman," as duly noted in her bankruptcy filing, though she and Baldwin have 
high hopes for the steamy, action-packed "The Getaway." She passed on "T. Rex," 
about a cop who has a dinosaur as a partner, last year, which Whoopi Goldberg 
picked up and then tried (and failed) to forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what's funny: I've become the example. When Whoopi tried to bail, 
they threatened to sue her and pointed to me as What Could Happen," says 
Basinger. "Now think about this. They can make her act in the movie, but how 
good of a performance will they get? Will she promote the picture when they 
need her to? Who can say? But those things have to be weighed and the smart 
people in this town know that. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you expect when you force people against their will? In a way my 
trial was a movie, one that everybody watched." 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger, for one, is still waiting for the final cut.

TELEVISION; IT HASN'T ALL BEEN A SITCOM; KELSEY GRAMMER'S HIT SHOW 'FRASIER' IS 
A COMEDIC COUNTERPOINT TO THE EXTREME UPS AND DOWNS THAT HAVE MARKED THE 
ACTOR'S LIFE -- EVENTS HE DISCUSSES WITH AN OPENNESS DR. FRASIER CRANE COULDN'T 
HELP BUT ADMIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, Rick Du Brow is The Times' television writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelsey Grammer is sitting at a small conference table in a modest upstairs 
office of Stage 25 at Paramount Studios, where he blossomed for the last decade 
as the pompous, insecure psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on "Cheers." He 
insisted on using the old "Cheers" set for his new NBC comedy, "Frasier," in 
which the character has left Boston and a broken marriage to return to his 
hometown of Seattle as a radio psychiatrist. The vibes certainly are right. 
This brand-new spinoff of "Cheers" is a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think there's got to be some kind of ghost thing, a support system, 
here," he says, gesturing with his hand at the surroundings. "The energy around 
this stage is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Grammer is wearing red sneakers, jeans and an open-collared shirt with, as he 
points out, a surfing pattern -- more in tune with himself than the stuffy, 
vivid character that has led him to fame. There are other surprises. He looks 
and acts much younger in person than on screen -- he is 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 28 when I got the job," Grammer says of "Cheers," "and, of course, 
Frasier has been 35 for 10 years. People assumed I was a lot older than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is his voice, which resonates deep and rich in conversation 
and laughter, sounding like that of Orson Welles as he zips through his answers 
and opinions. Grammer is a classically trained actor who revels in the stage -- 
he has performed with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego and regional theater 
in Buffalo, N.Y., and Minneapolis, Minn., has appeared both on and off Broadway 
and starred in "Richard II" in 1992 at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage, he says, "is my first love -- it is, I think, what establishes you 
as an actor." And the Welles touches are important to Grammer: "The reason I 
started my production company, the original project I still wish to do, is an 
Orson Welles thing. We're thinking of starting it as a one-man show on the 
stage, a sort of retrospective of his younger years. He's always fascinated me. 
When I first got on ("Cheers"), Ted Danson said to me, after about two months, 
'You ought to do Orson Welles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this wide range of acting inclinations has enabled Grammer to survive 
in sitcom-land -- and in life. First "Cheers" and now "Frasier" have been a 
kind of comedy counterpoint to personal tragedies, other dramas and 
self-admitted "irresponsible" behavior that have marked his well-documented 
childhood and rise to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was murdered when he was 13. His 18-year-old sister was murdered 
when he was 20. His two half brothers were killed in a shark attack when he was 
25. He's had two marital breakups, plus arrests involving drugs and alcohol 
that brought him jail sentences. These experiences would seem to have prepared 
him for "King Lear" rather than another TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, with disarming and surprising openness, Grammer discusses all of this 
quite candidly and bluntly rather than ducking behind the common celebrity 
stance that it is his private business and no one else's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, well, at one point I thought there's nothing to really hide about 
anything because everybody's going to write about it anyway," he says. "My 
viewpoint is if it comes from my mouth, that will get people to stop talking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I've talked about things. I really have no apologies to make. I've 
certainly made some mistakes, but I'm not sorry for the things that have 
happened to me or the things that I have mistakenly done. The best thing about 
life, in my opinion, is you can grow, you can change, you can fix things, you 
can make amends, if you will, for things that people may think you may need to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff that happens to you, the traffic of life, as I call it, does shape 
us, but it doesn't have to define us. It doesn't have to be what we end up 
being or the lasting impression that is made by us. So I believe that your duty 
is to prevail, to overcome your inheritance and your environment and do 
something a bit beyond what you were given. And the real beauty of the job I've 
got is my work, which keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Grammer, who was born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and was brought up in New 
Jersey and Florida, lived primarily with his mother, her parents and his 
sister. He adored his grandfather, Gordon, who died when he was 12: "From that 
point on, all I dealt with was my mother and my sister and my grandmother -- 
three different generations of women who pretty much relied on me to play son, 
father, husband, child, all at the same time. So that was a little confusing 
growing up as an adolescent." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the appealing traits of Grammer in "Frasier" is the vulnerability that 
belies his pomposity. Cut to real life: "Yeah, I'm fairly vulnerable, but I do 
hide it a lot for my own survival. I was very vulnerable to the constant 
information I got from my mother, my sister and grandmother that I wasn't doing 
good enough. No matter what happened, really, I was always letting one of them 
down. My relationships with women have by definition been a little rocky and 
shaky." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the turmoil in his life, which he calls "landmark events," Grammer 
acknowledges: "There's been a lot of stuff. And also I got in some trouble for 
drugs. I was irresponsible about fulfilling my obligations to the courts. 
That's the way I've been about a lot of things. I tend to procrastinate, try to 
run away from things sometimes. Hence I became an actor -- acting gives you a 
great opportunity to express yourself honestly without being accountable for 
it. See what I mean? It's not really Kelse -- it's that character. You get off 
the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the turbulence that has marked Grammer's personal life, little, if 
any, of it has carried over to the production of "Frasier," according to 
several of his co-stars. John Mahoney, featured as Grammer's retired cop father 
-- who, with his now-famous dog Eddie, moves in with him -- says: "He's never 
late. I've never, ever seen him lose his temper. He's very open about the whole 
thing. There's not a shred of tension." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hyde Pierce, who portrays Grammer's equally pompous psychiatrist 
brother, says: "Whatever is going on in his personal life, it has never 
affected the quality of his work. He's unfailingly good-hearted and 
good-spirited on the show. His concern while we're working is with the script 
and what we're working on." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, like Grammer, is a major scene-stealer, and the two of them make an 
often-memorable pair in their exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Grammer: "Obviously, both of us have stolen liberally from Jack Benny. 
Jack Benny's my favorite comic." Of the challenge of Pierce's strong presence, 
Grammer says: "That's what's good. I never in my life want to back away from 
someone who's gifted and talented. You want to surround yourself with the best 
possible group of people in the world and just throw yourself into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Has there been any effect on Grammer's work because of his personal traumas? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says, "I think there must. Also, my life has been full of a lot of 
great richness and joy. I love life -- I think possibly because of the 
tragedies that have been marked along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 And after all the ups and downs, does "Frasier," with its immediate success, 
represent something special to him? 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of my career, this is the height," Grammer says. "This is something 
I was hoping to achieve. I got my own show, and it's a good show. I'm proud of 
it. All the stuff that happened to me before that was basically, I think, in 
preparation to get to a point of having this much responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he notes, the show is about "a man discovering a family that he 
hadn't had. And what's a nice parallel for me is that I'm discovering a family 
that I never had. Kelsey gets to come along for the ride. I have a relationship 
with a father and a brother. I never had any of those things. So it is 
fascinating to talk to 'my dad.' It's been interesting for a man to explore the 
relationships between the men in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grammer's input into "Frasier" has been buoyed by some heavyweight support. 
First there was Paramount, which talked him and the show's producers into 
continuing the Frasier character from "Cheers" rather than creating a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought originally that Frasier should die with 'Cheers,' " the actor says. 
"(But) I like him. He tries to stay true to his word. And he's a decent chap 
who's overwhelmed at times, but he's still staggering on with rejoicing." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the fact that "Frasier" has the potent lead-in of "Seinfeld," 
with the two series emerging as the top spear-carriers for NBC. But there is 
also the fact that "Frasier" retains more than 90% of the audience from 
"Seinfeld," which indicates, even this early in its premiere season, that the 
new series has the legs to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, "Frasier" is commanding a reported $204,000 for a 30-second 
commercial spot, sixth highest among the series in network prime time. And 
members of Viewers for Quality Television, a grass-roots organization, have 
voted it the best new comedy of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, "Frasier" drew on its "Cheers" heritage by lining up three 
former producers and writers of the classic series, which ended last spring -- 
David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee. The trio, which also created another 
NBC success, the sitcom "Wings," are the executive producers of "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 In another important move, Jim Burrows -- who co-created "Cheers" with Glen 
Charles and Les Charles -- has directed about half of the "Frasier" episodes 
thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 "My partners and I have a proprietary interest in ("Frasier")," Burrows says. 
Noting the generally acknowledged comfort and ease with which "Frasier" has 
gotten off the ground, he adds: "You have a lot of residual effect from 
'Cheers.' The producers are really secure and know what's funny. It's wonderful 
writing. And I love Kelsey." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was important to Burrows, who credits the producers for making it work, 
was that the Frasier character become to the new series what the Sam Malone 
character (Danson) was to "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
 "What had to be done was you had to make Kelsey 'Sam' and be smart enough to 
bring in David Hyde Pierce to be Kelsey," Burrows says. "You can carry on the 
intellectual nature of the character through David -- it's a lot of stuff 
Kelsey would have done on 'Cheers.' That was their (the producers') invention. 
And Kelsey had to show much more emotion and vulnerability than on 'Cheers' and 
say a lot of straight lines. When I was directing the pilot, I kept saying he's 
got to be more emotional, he's got to be more like Sam, and we were all in 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, says Casey, one idea for a series without the Frasier character was 
that Grammer would play a magnate modeled after the late Malcolm Forbes, 
running his empire from his bedroom after a motorcycle accident. Then the idea 
was that "Frasier" would center around the life of the former "Cheers" 
psychiatrist as a radio personality, but the show seemed too similar to "WKRP 
in Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, says Lee, the creators came up with the notion of Frasier 
reacquainting himself with his father in middle age, "something many of us are 
going through right now. Whenever you do a series, you're looking for an 
emotional hook. It gives depth and breadth to the characters." 
</P>
<P>
 As with most good comedies, there is more going on in "Frasier" than just the 
gags. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Angell: "We have to remind ourselves not to try to joke it up if a page 
or two goes by without a laugh. We've gotten some nice moments out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his all-star support, Grammer hardly seems putty in anybody's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges "resisting the concept a little bit" when he was asked to go 
in and read with actress Jane Leeves, who plays the off-center, semi-psychic 
home care worker: "I thought, oh, my God, it's 'Nanny and the Professor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reading, he says, he made it clear that "I don't want to do 'Nanny 
and the Professor' -- I'm not going to do it. I said, 'You've got to convince 
me it's not a stereotype and it's not going to be just a silly little device in 
the show.' And they did. And she did. It was instantly: 'Hire her. That's 
fabulous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grammer and Dr. Frasier Crane now have been part of each other's lives since 
1984. And, the actor says, "We've grown together. I'm a bit more haphazard and 
a bit more casual personally. But there's a side of me that would rather sit 
around listening to classical music at night and reading a good book than to be 
hanging out with a bunch of contemporaries and going crazy. But I do tend to do 
the other thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges a wild streak not far below the surface in both himself and 
Frasier: "That is there." He also offers that "now I'm in therapy. There's no 
question I need it. Oh, yeah, twice a week. And I'm really happy about it. It 
started about a year and a half ago. It's a great help." 
</P>
<P>
 He says all this with an affecting, and unaffected, gregariousness. As a 
younger man, he motorcycled cross-country to join the Old Globe Theatre. He 
still makes it to Hawaii occasionally to surf. Of growing up in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla., he says that surfing "was a big, huge part of my spiritual development, 
more than almost anything else. I surfed the whole East Coast. I sail now. I've 
got a 37-foot sloop. That intimacy with the ocean is a big thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Professionally, if not personally, he has been fortunate. Even a truncated 
stay at the Juilliard School, where he met legendary producer-director John 
Houseman, paid off in the long run: "I didn't really know him. He was running 
the drama department. He would have kind of a closure meeting with those of us 
who got kicked out. I got kicked out -- for a perfectly good reason: It wasn't 
working out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But John Houseman did call me in for this last meeting and said a great thing 
to me. He said, 'Read the great novels. It's a way of getting yourself 
experiential data about a universe that doesn't exist anymore, a world that 
does not exist anymore, of relationships, mores, styles of associating that 
don't exist anymore. As an actor, if you don't have that kind of information, 
you will never be able to portray with authority and style those periods.' The 
advice was dead-on. I had the insight to take advantage of the advice."

ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER, HIT MAN; THE CRITICS HOWL, THE TICKETS SELL AND THE 
MAESTRO JUST KEEPS GOING (AND GOING AND GOING).

<P>
 DID YOU NOT KNOW ABOUT THE horse?" Anthony Pye-Jeary is inquiring excitedly. 
"His name is . . . is . . . Frank Rich ." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Rich was, until recently, the New York Times' lead drama critic and the 
pundit who most bedeviled composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Frank Rich is also a 
racehorse owned and christened by Lloyd Webber, a four-legged repository of his 
private revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Pye-Jeary chuckles. He's an old friend of Lloyd Webber and so is in on the 
Frank Rich joke, one part of which is that Lloyd Webber's mount is a gelding , 
it has been -- you know, ha ha -- desexed . The other part is that Frank Rich 
-- the horse -- had been running poorly until, as Pye-Jeary recounts, "They put 
a tongue strap on him. They tied the tongue down. So Frank Rich runs for the 
first time with a tongue strap. And wins ! Really, really ! This is true! It 
sounds like a joke! But he had his tongue strapped down and the horse won!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pye-Jeary's rising glee attests to just how satisfying pay-back can be. To 
fathom his joyful hysteria, one must consider this: From the perspective of 
Lloyd Webber's crowd, Frank Rich -- the man -- is a pen-wielding bully who has 
been using wittily phrased insights to beat up on their long-suffering chum for 
years. In 1988, for example, Rich wrote that "The Phantom of the Opera" was "a 
victory of dynamic stagecraft over musical kitsch." And just this past July, 
when Lloyd Webber's latest concoction, "Sunset Boulevard," had its world 
premiere in London, Rich complimented the composer on his "surprisingly dark, 
jazz-accented" music but suggested that Lloyd Webber and company go back to the 
drawing board on everything else: "Its creators have the time . . . to search 
for means other than hydraulics to make their show lift off." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not as if Frank Rich has been alone in his scorn. Lloyd Webber is 
fair game for the Fourth Estate and, it seems, anyone else who cares to 
comment. Take "Cats," for example. This Lloyd Webber revenue mill has become an 
equal-opportunity gag-line. It's big, it's bourgeois and it won't go away. 
David Letterman can exploit it for yuks with the same ease that playwright Paul 
Rudnick did when he inserted a running goof on "Cats" in his off-Broadway hit 
"Jeffrey." "Have someone come out in a cat suit," Rudnick says, and the next 
thing you know, "there's this roar of laughter. This is very useful in a 
comedy." Of course, not all Lloyd Webber-bashing has such harmless intentions. 
Several years ago, Malcolm Williamson, the Master of the Queen's Music, 
explained to reporters how he assessed his countryman's mass appeal: Lloyd 
Webber's music is "everywhere," he said, "but then so is AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Lloyd Webber doesn't tell Frank Rich stories -- not about the 
man and not about the horse. Indeed, with his accumulation of successes, he 
shouldn't have to care what any critic thinks. Lloyd Webber's 11 productions 
include best-sellers like his first hit, "Jesus Christ Superstar," in 1971, 
"Evita," "Cats" and "The Phantom of the Opera" -- the last two alone have been 
worth $3.5 billion worldwide. Now comes "Sunset Boulevard," which set 
advance-sales records in London and has been selling out the Shubert Theatre in 
Century City since its American premiere there last month. Among his many 
believe-it-or-not career statistics is the fact that on this very night, 
tickets will be available for a sanctioned Lloyd Webber production at 37 
different locations on our planet. In London's West End, six Lloyd Webber shows 
are running concurrently; on Broadway, three. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, today, sitting in the cool shade of the stone veranda at his 
rented Beverly Hills estate, Lloyd Webber is talking (and talking and talking) 
about his critical notices. "As an artist, I'll always pick up something if I 
feel it is constructive." Lloyd Webber's distinctive delivery combines plummy 
English diction with sentences that conclude in a mumble. "I mean, what you 
should be reading is, ' This is a really interesting direction. I wish there 
was more of it.' That's what criticism should be about." He utters this last 
statement as if he truly believes it's the job of reviewers everywhere to 
assist in the refinement of an Andrew Lloyd Webber production. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's relaxed, Lloyd Webber can be a self-deprecating charmer. When he's 
uncomfortable, he's a bundle of nervous tics, given to bouts of head-bobbing, 
foot waggling, stomach rubbing or hiccuping. On this afternoon, this is how his 
anxiety is expressing itself: Into his mouth goes the tip of his thumb, which 
is milky white, very clean and well-manicured. Later, he briefly licks his 
middle finger, his index finger, then his pinky. Nothing on Lloyd Webber's face 
indicates that he's aware of performing these small ablutions. 
</P>
<P>
 And all the while, he is politely holding forth about his detractors, about 
their pretense and their pack mentality. He seems to take pride in always 
having run against the elitist grain. Even when he was a dweeby teen, he'd 
boldly defend Victorian paintings and Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals to his 
stuffy headmasters. "They were always considered sentimental rubbish," says 
Lloyd Webber, who happens to own one of the world's most valuable 
Pre-Raphaelite art collections. It's in this spirit that Lloyd Webber hears his 
work dismissed as hopeless schlock and reconfigures the assaults into a badge 
of honor: "I'm the least politically correct composer in the world," he 
declares. "I am ." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad rap he gets, he theorizes, comes from the spontaneity of his creative 
process. So much of his work "has been done in public," he says, that people 
think it just materializes "without, um, the pain of creation that really, um, 
has to go on." (His no-sweat reputation might also come from his own past 
admissions that "Evita" was re-orchestrated during previews and that he dashed 
off a 35-minute musical called "Cricket" in three days.) "It's been very easy 
to have a go at my music," he admits weakly. "I've been, uh, very lucky and 
very popular. And I think people don't always realize just how much you try and 
put into everything. I mean, to the best of your ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing at his watch, Lloyd Webber regretfully excuses himself. It's several 
weeks before "Sunset Boulevard" will open in Los Angeles and he must dash off, 
with his driver, on one of his myriad rounds. Just as he readies himself to 
leave, he furtively moistens a forefinger. And for some reason, one half 
expects Lloyd Webber to hoist his glistening digit into the warm California air 
to see in which direction the wind is blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE NEWS MEDIA ARE SQUISHED THREE DEEP against a dingy wall 
in a Hollywood rehearsal hall. Four feet away, and too close for comfort, what 
looks like the entire "Sunset" chorus line is vocalizing and briskly hitting 
its marks. The numbers are adroitly executed but one can't help noting that 
some of the ensemble members are tossing panicky smiles over their shoulders. 
Who wouldn't get the jitters, performing without the security of a proscenium, 
just blasting away like a giant singing telegram, in the faces of the gawking 
press? And where are the big stars in this musicalized remake of the Billy 
Wilder film classic? Where is Glenn Close, who will play Norma Desmond? Or 
George Hearn, who plays Desmond's gloss-topped driver Max? It is later 
explained that Close wasn't "ready" for this mini-preview; nobody ever 
mentioned where Hearn was hiding out. 
</P>
<P>
 The event bumps along awkwardly, perhaps because of its quaking but determined 
host. Lloyd Webber's quick brown eyes never really meet anyone's gaze. The best 
he can do is stand alongside a baby grand piano, rocking back and forth, his 
hands twitching nervously at his hips, while silently mouthing love ballad 
lyrics that two cast members are singing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is nothing if not 100% invested in his work. "I worry about the content of 
my shows," he confesses, "to the point that I think about them all the time ." 
He frets so much over his vast network of productions that it drives him to 
make spot-check visitations to any city on the map where a show of his is 
playing. Just to make sure everything is running in tip-top shape, he'll -- 
surprise! -- appear unexpectedly and frighten everyone right out of their 
Flexatards. As a case in point, he has visited the Las Vegas production of 
"Starlight Express" four times, even though, having licensed the rights away, 
he isn't even involved in it.  
</P>
<P>
 With "Sunset Boulevard," Lloyd Webber's perfectionist bent has been greatly 
tested. Every news clip on the making of the London production included 
documentation of all that went awry. First there was the malfunctioning main 
set, a high-tech 18-ton prop that would, without human provocation and rarely 
on cue, shift forward or rise toward the rafters like the Starship Enterprise, 
occasionally with startled stagehands on board. Then the reviews rolled in, and 
like Frank Rich, most of the critics gave with one hand and took with the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, Lloyd Webber began to institute endless alterations for 
the Los Angeles opening. He fiddled not just with the score (which he "very 
arrogantly" calls "my best"), but also with every detail imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 The London reviews found the stage characters lacking all chemistry, when the 
film was all about the creepiness of a sordid love triangle formed by a fading 
film star, her paid honey-boy and his girlfriend. So Lloyd Webber, with 
Christopher Hampton and Don Black, who worked together on the book and lyrics, 
came up with hundreds of minute script adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 The notices had also said the tunes were agreeably hummable, but where was a 
showstopper like "Memory" or "The Music of the Night" from "Cats" and 
"Phantom"? Lloyd Webber added a zotzy number "Every Movie's a Circus" -- "for 
the younger people." John Napier's gilt-splashed set was dazzling, according to 
the papers, but inappropriately glitzy. In Los Angeles, Norma Desmond's shut-in 
environment became more claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber indulged his own second-chance desires as well. He can barely 
contain himself when describing the incorporation of some of his trademark 
flash -- a reproduction of an antique touring car -- into the L.A. action. It 
was Billy Wilder's idea (Wilder has been serving as the Lloyd Webber team's 
unpaid oracle). "I mean, we physically couldn't (include the automobile) in 
London," says Lloyd Webber peppily, "but we've found a way (in Los Angeles) 
that we can . We're going to do it. It's going to happen ! The old car will be 
there !" 
</P>
<P>
 But most of Lloyd Webber's uncapped fix-it enthusiasm was devoted to the 
casting. In London, the press corps found the square-shouldered belter Patti 
LuPone too invincible to capture Norma Desmond's cracked fragility. So Lloyd 
Webber tapped five-time Academy Award-nominated actress Glenn Close as the 
pivotal female lead. She is a Serious Actress, so she fits into Lloyd Webber's 
time-honored formula of gilding fluff with substance. And she is also a movie 
star, which usually has sure-thing drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, when the revamped "Sunset" opens, Lloyd Webber's new casting pays 
off. For the most part the critics coo over Close. "Stunning," says The Times' 
Sylvie Drake, and -- miracle of miracles -- the New York Times, in the form of 
Vincent Canby, raves: "Ms. Close's performance is ravishing" on its way to 
delivering a glowing thumbs-up. Time, USA Today and radio and TV also hand out 
mostly positive notices. Even so, there is plenty of Lloyd Webber blood drawn. 
"Grandiose camp, flashy but surprisingly dull," says David Ansen in Newsweek. 
"More confident . . . but no better," complains Daily Variety. "Wildly 
overblown," admits Drake. 
</P>
<P>
 And the disparaging rumbling never quite dies down. The word, at one point, is 
that Close, singing at the edge of her range, won't hold up to eight 
larnyx-punishing shows a week: Broadway trouper Betty Buckley, they say, has 
already been placed on 24-hour red alert. ("This absolutely isn't true," 
insists Lloyd Webber's media consultant, Peter Brown.) Tongue-waggers point out 
that the double-CD cast album has so far loitered drowsily on the racks. (An 
L.A. cast album may be in the offing.) Some even predict that "Sunset" will 
never make it to the Great White Way: New York audiences are notoriously picky, 
thus the risk-factor of staging such a pricey show is greater there. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly all of this chit-chat might yet come true. On the other hand, it 
might just be more of the flop-lust that grows stronger with the birth of each 
new Andrew Lloyd Webber production. Back in 1974, he came out with an effort 
called "Jeeves," which even Lloyd Webber says was " a complete disaster" and 
"catastrophically received." But it didn't sidetrack his campaign toward world 
domination -- the source of so much of what irritates the legions of Sir Andrew 
bashers. What they all seem to wish most for him is a huge bomb, the kind of 
failure that could bring the Lloyd Webber machine to a grinding halt. 
</P>
<P>
 IN ENGLAND, LLOYD WEBBER'S HEADQUARTERS IS A 10-BEDROOM, SIX-STORY townhouse 
in London's exclusive Belgravia district (not to be confused with his English 
country mansion, his villa in the south of France or his Trump Tower apartment 
in New York). When he is there, he can find no peace. The switchboard blinks 
constantly. Even in the upholstered depths of his chauffeur-driven, midnight 
blue Mercedes 600 SEL with the VCR, satellite-informed traffic monitor and 
fully stocked fridge, there is a back-seat car phone to distract him. 
</P>
<P>
 Life must have been simpler for Lloyd Webber when he was a newly minted 
phenomenon. Back then, he had his first partner, Tim Rice, in his corner, 
towering protectively over him, sharing the burdens. When the two aspiring 
songwriters met, in 1965, the 17-year-old Lloyd Webber was so sure of their 
future together that he dropped his history studies at Oxford and moved Rice 
into his family's South Kensington flat.  
</P>
<P>
 By that point, Lloyd Webber had already composed eight musicals. It was a 
family thing -- his father, William Lloyd Webber, was a skilled pianist who 
eventually became the director of the London College of Music; his mother, 
Jean, was a piano teacher and his brother, Julian, is a cellist. Bill Lloyd 
Webber had gotten Andrew's first creation, "The Toy Theatre Suite," published 
when he was 9. Apparently this was a rare display of fatherly support: 
According to Michael Walsh's coffee-table Lloyd Webber biography, when young 
Andrew informed his dad of his professional intentions, he merely grumbled 
back, "If you ever write a song as good as 'Some Enchanted Evening,' I'll tell 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After a few false starts, Rice and Lloyd Webber turned "The Wonder Book of 
Bible Stories" into "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," first 
produced in 1968. Big-time success came with "Jesus Christ Superstar." 
"Superstar" rode the rock-opera trend and introduced Lloyd Webber's sack of 
tricks -- catchy pop songs, broad-stroke dramatic arcs, open-throated arias 
and, later, special effects. From the onset, what Lloyd Webber has delivered is 
entertainment designed to overwhelm. His musicals guarantee not just 
jaw-dropping staging, but crescendo after string-filled crescendo as the 
heart-swelling backdrop to an easily readable story line. And Lloyd Webber 
hammers the hooks home, making it impossible for theatergoers to walk out onto 
the street without at least one melody stuck in their heads. In other words, 
Lloyd Webber treats his customers as if their enjoyment meant more to him than 
anything. The package took American musical theater by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, everyone writing on Broadway was so aware of the back catalogue 
they couldn't crawl out from under it," explains Mark Steyn, musical theater 
correspondent for the Independent in London. "They knew too much. Andrew and 
Tim were so ignorant of it they could more or less get away with anything. They 
managed to do what Broadway failed to do, which was to keep faith with the pop 
quality that American musicals always had 50 or 60 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, Lloyd Webber liked to mention publicly that his and Rice's 
names would soon be inextricably linked, "like Rodgers and Hart." But, in fact, 
Lloyd Webber seemed to get an adrenaline charge from attempting to prove that 
Rice was dispensable. In 1974, the ill-fated "Jeeves" was his first Rice-less 
venture. They temporarily reconciled for "Evita," which was one of Rice's 
ideas, then Lloyd Webber tried out other lyricists to medium-cool results. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, along came "Cats," Lloyd Webber's first genuine post-Rice triumph. To 
launch the production, based on T.S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Practical 
Cats," he mortgaged one of his houses and withstood the belly laughs his 
concept got on both sides of the ocean. He says he was snubbed by every major 
American choreographer: "Twyla Tharp said it was not possible. Bob Fosse said 
no way." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Rice-Lloyd Webber team tried several short-lived reunions. 
There was "Cricket" in 1986, their gift to Queen Elizabeth on her 60th 
birthday. (Later, Lloyd Webber shanghaied several tunes from "Cricket" for 
"Aspects of Love," which rendered Rice's lyrics worthless and ensured that the 
piece would never be produced again.) Their relationship now seems to exist 
only contractually, through shared credit and royalties on "Joseph," 
"Superstar" and "Evita." Rice has moved on to Disney, writing pretty lyrics for 
animated features like "Aladdin." When asked to comment on his ex-partner, Rice 
merely sighs and offers up this freighted remark: "It's not my dream way of 
spending an hour, talking about Andrew." 
</P>
<P>
 So now Lloyd Webber goes it alone -- not counting, of course, his phalanx of 
gentle publicists, assistants and assorted suits. He commissions the lyricists 
he wants to work with and he retains the final say-so over what they write. He 
has a hand in casting every touring group. And Lloyd Webber is also the 
near-absolute ruler of his jumbo business-side fiefdom, the Really Useful 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Lloyd Webber took the Really Useful Group public; but by 1990, 
dismayed over having to please stockholders and market forces instead of just 
himself, he was determinedly buying back stock. It was a financially bruising 
proposition. A year later, he bartered off one-third of the newly privatized 
RUG to PolyGram, the British entertainment mega-corporation, for roughly $130 
million. The London press called it a "sweetheart deal" -- a top-of-the-market 
sale that took him out of debt, kept him in the majority position and put all 
those precious creative details squarely back into his own well-manicured 
hands. These days, his staff says, he's worth in the neighborhood of $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends brag about his entrepreneurial craftiness; his critics are not so 
sanguine. Lloyd Webber's far-flung productions, says the Independent's Steyn, 
are the theatrical equivalent of fast food. "McDonald's can maybe introduce one 
new item every two years because they're so busy ensuring that a Big Mac tastes 
exactly the same in Reykjavik as it does in Kuala Lumpur. But they can't be as 
inventive and fresh as they might be, and that's a similar thing with Andrew," 
Steyn says. "This is musical theater on a scale undreamt of by anyone before -- 
identical productions in every major town in the world. It sounds like a 
nightmare and it is a nightmare, because it's boring. You get off the plane and 
go, 'Well, here I am in Budapest -- what's there to see?' And there's 'Evita' 
and 'Cats.' But in sheer business terms, you've got to give him credit." 
</P>
<P>
 David Mason, his pal and appointed art acquirer, says Lloyd Webber is famous 
for calculating the angles on everything. "He's got an animal instinct," he 
says. "He's like Rasputin. Shrewd isn't the word for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Lloyd Webber's intimates for some other descriptors and they'll paint the 
affectionate portrait of a man who must make for a complicated buddy. At one 
moment, he is the instigator of no-sleep trips, city-hopping with his wife, 
Madeleine, and various cohorts in his chartered 12-seater jet. At the next 
moment, he is the lover of baroque practical jokes, the type that are 
hysterical to those in the know and not as funny to those on the receiving end. 
He is at his most beguiling, they say, when sharing his most recent score, 
hunched over a piano, swaying to the chordal progressions and narrating the 
scenario to a one-person audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are his bleaker traits: The downside of being a king-hell 
businessman is incorrigible competitiveness, everyday stinginess and a 
potentate's ability to desert longtime compatriots without so much as an 
explanation. In December press conferences, Lloyd Webber said he was baffled -- 
baffled! -- by rumors that he was displeased with Patti LuPone's Norma. (LuPone 
was his megastar in "Evita.") Out of the TV lights, however, he edges a little 
closer to poison. Glenn Close, he says, "is a joy and fun to work with. Which I 
must say is a change from, shall we say, another Norma we've had." Later, when 
reminded of this not-so-subtle dig, Lloyd Webber angrily recants: "I will be 
cross with you," he says, pale-faced and just this side of supremely 
ticked-off, "if you don't quote me properly on this . I'm a great admirer of 
Patti's; she's a superb performer. But what she must do is to understand not to 
be threatened. Patti just needs to just relax a bit. That's all. And not 
worry." That said, his frail shoulders relax, and just as swiftly as his barely 
bottled rage bloomed, it dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
 His temper tantrums are legendary, and his friends claim the best prescription 
for them is to start creeping toward the exits. It is Gillian Lynne, who 
choreographed "Cats," "Phantom" and "Aspects," who suggests that it's in the 
aftermath of his vitriolic explosions that the essential Lloyd Webber makes a 
rare cameo appearance. This she learned from a "Cats"-in-progress 
confrontation, where a scarlet-faced Lloyd Webber furiously informed Lynne that 
her work was so dreadful that he was withdrawing his score. It was their first 
collaboration, and Lynne didn't know that he "sort of does this once a show." 
Lynne sassed him back -- "If Jerry Robbins can do a ballet without music, so 
can I" -- and then retreated to her dressing room to await her pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 But when summoned back to the stage, Lynne discovered that it wasn't her head 
that Lloyd Webber wanted, but a conciliatory bearhug from his Gilly. In the 
deserted theater stalls, Lynne found him "sitting and looking miserable. He put 
his arms around me and said, 'It will be all right, won't it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "ARE YOU LISTENING?" PETER BROWN WANTS TO KNOW. Brown is Lloyd Webber's friend 
of 23 years, as well as his media consultant. He is standing in the 
green-carpeted study of Lloyd Webber's temporarily roofless 16th-Century 
country mansion, Sydmonton Court, in Berkshire, England. Lloyd Webber is off in 
Holland, attending the opening of yet another "Phantom," so Brown has arranged 
for some quality time with just the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the owner's absence, the place is filled with distractions. Right next 
to the front door is a freshly grouted indoor jacuzzi that looks big enough to 
accommodate the bewhiskered cast of "Cats." On the periphery of the missing 
roof, there are muddy-booted workmen replacing the Victorian blue tile. Deep 
within the dark corridors, where the walls are decorated busily with gothic 
stars and angels, there are rosy-cheeked maids vacuuming their way through an 
off-season spring cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Every window frames yet another grassy perspective of this 4,000-acre-plus 
estate, and as far as you can see, every element on the landscape -- the 
bare-limbed cedar and ash trees, the fat grazing sheep, the husk-beige 
cornfields -- is the property of Lloyd Webber. So is the nearby stone church 
where the annual Sydmonton Festival is staged: Every summer, in this damp 
little space, Lloyd Webber likes to consumer-test his work on a house packed 
with urban swells and locals. On the roster for this year's 20th anniversary 
festival is the return of "Jeeves," which Lloyd Webber, in his compulsive 
mender-of-botched-projects way, has expressed the urge to "have another go at." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour covers a maze of showcase chambers, such as the formal dining room 
with a mahogany table that seats 36. It also reveals many signs that a family 
actually lives here. From the look of things, the oversized kitchen and a 
tatty-looking television nook are the central hangouts; the claw-footed 
furniture has comfortably dented cushions. Propped up on every available 
surface are photographs of the clan, Andrew and Madeleine, his 31-year-old 
third wife, smiling their tentative smiles, and the distinctly 
Lloyd-Webberish-looking offspring -- Imogen, 16, and Nicholas, 14, from the 
first marriage, and Alistair, 18 months, and William, 4 months, from the third. 
But tabloid readers who've tracked Lloyd Webber's love life would instantly be 
captivated by the group shots, specifically the ones that include Sarah Tudor 
Hugill, Lloyd Webber's first wife, or his Eliza Doolittle second spouse, Sarah 
Brightman, the ingenue whose voice inspired "Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
 It's often been said that what horsewoman Madeleine Lloyd Webber brings to her 
power-marriage is the calming effect her presence has on her husband. ("He was 
far more thermonuclear pre-Madeleine," says a friend.) And while Lloyd Webber 
is still an insecure mixer, you'd never know it from reports that during 
weekends and holidays Sydmonton's guest rooms are routinely filled with happy 
visitors. A proliferation of celebrity snapshots, like the one of Madeleine 
with former President Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy, sit on Sydmonton's drawing 
room mantlepiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But what gets top billing among the objects on display here is Lloyd Webber's 
invaluable Pre-Raphaelite art collection. His interest in art began while 
gazing at the 19th-Century stained glass that surrounded him as a student at 
London's Westminster School. From there, he drifted to the Pre-Raphs, which he 
decided to start purchasing because, as he blushingly admits, "they were so 
cheap." When he made his first acquisition, the Victorians were so far out of 
favor that a Rossetti drawing cost him only 15 pounds. Since then, he's snapped 
up so many masterworks that they form a thick racing stripe of gold-framed 
paintings that runs through almost every room at Sydmonton. Everywhere, there 
are pieces by artists such as Burne-Jones, Brett, Hughes and Leighton. In the 
drawing room is his latest prize, Rossetti's "A Vision of Fiametta," a 
full-length portrait of a pale-skinned, red-haired beauty over whose head 
circles the Angel of Death. It cost a reported $4.5 million. His most expensive 
painting -- $17.7 million -- is not a Pre-Raphaelite, but an 18th-Century 
Canaletto, "The Horse Guard's Parade." He bought the painting because he found 
it "a thumpingly good picture." And these are just a fraction of what he 
adoringly refers to en masse as "the love of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The following afternoon, Lloyd Webber, back from Holland, is chatting amiably 
in a clangorous Picadilly restaurant about his future agenda. He is ready to 
dive back into movie-making, even though his lucky streak with film adaptations 
began and ended in 1973 with Norman Jewison's antic "Jesus Christ Superstar" 
(which Lloyd Webber had no real ties to and didn't much care for). 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Lloyd Webber plans "to be involved with everything artistically." 
But he also readily admits that he doesn't "know anything about films at all." 
(In just a few weeks, word comes down that he has chosen Gary Lucchesi, who 
most recently was head of production at Paramount Pictures, to serve as his 
show-biz teacher and Hollywood point man.) Still, he enthusiastically ticks off 
the projects in the works: PolyGram is developing a feature version of "Aspects 
of Love," possibly with John Schlesinger as director; Warner Bros. is ready to 
cash in on "Phantom" groupies; "Evita" is an on-again, off-again Oliver 
Stone/Disney project. (At press time, Disney announced that it is definitely 
back on.) And Lloyd Webber also has hired British playwright Tom Stoppard to 
write a screen version of "Cats." T.S. Eliot's creation, he says, will become a 
"dark" full-length animated feature. 
</P>
<P>
 He also shares the story of a recent meeting with Sarah Brightman, his second 
wife. (Their marriage was a scandal -- when their affair started, she was a 
wild-haired chorine in "Cats." He was still wed to Sarah Tudor Hugill, whom he 
had met at an Oxford party.) Though their messy divorce after six years of 
marriage filled the British gossip rags, the two remain so friendly that Lloyd 
Webber has decided to produce an album of her warbling rock versions of his 
songs. So, in Amsterdam, they met for lunch right under the noses, he says, of 
neglectful paparazzi. "In theory," he insists, "that would have been one of the 
great pictures of all time," and, because he is an inveterate businessman, you 
can almost see him toting up photographers' lost income. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds one more element to the Lloyd Webber agenda -- an expanding art 
collection. He heads the Andrew Lloyd Webber Art Foundation, a charitable 
organization that purchases artworks intended for public exhibition in Britain 
and, he hopes, at the museum he would like to construct at Sydmonton. It would 
be in a modern building, he says, that could also house the theater for the 
annual festival. "You can't open the family house to the public," he explains. 
"It's not that big. Also, people would probably be coming for the wrong reasons 
anyway." In the meantime, Lloyd Webber is making moves to expand his personal 
collection, looking away from the Victorians and at early Picassos and Medieval 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the injurious wisecracks he hears about everything else he attempts, 
few question the breadth and importance of his art collection. And perhaps with 
the foundation and the museum, Lloyd Webber envisions himself, finally, being 
swept toward unqualified respect from the aesthetes. When he is asked which he 
values more -- his art or his music -- he says, with obvious passion, that he 
loves his art, but his "music has got to be first." But not long ago, David 
Mason, Lloyd Webber's art dealer, posed to him the very same question. The 
collection, he answered, is "the most important thing in my life." "Nonsense," 
returned Mason, "your music must be the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Lloyd Webber assured him. "One day, you'll see. The music is the means 
to an end, and the end is my art collection." 
</P>
<P>
 AT THE THURSDAY NIGHT American premiere of "Sunset," the early returns are 
definitely favorable. To begin with, the gala actually is, well, fun. In 
London, the expected horde of above-the-title celebrities never materialized, 
but in Los Angeles, Lloyd Webber has pulled in old-time Hollywood royalty: 
Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Lana Turner, Angela Lansbury, Carol Channing. So what 
if Sarah Brightman, drifting languidly up the long red carpet to the Shubert's 
entrance, gets a much bigger hand than her tuxedoed ex-spouse? 
</P>
<P>
 By the closing notes of the first number, the audience is already applauding 
(which will be repeated after nearly every song) -- and the set gets the 
expected oohs and aahs . But during intermission, the lobby buzz starts to rub 
a bit of the shine off the evening: "Well," remarks one grim-looking fan, "it's 
not as bad as I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 As the reviews trickled in over the next few days, Lloyd Webber had this 
comfort: Frank Rich -- the man -- wasn't there to kick him around anymore. Not 
that there is much question what Rich might have said, if he'd had the chance. 
As Peter Brown has advised his client, "He doesn't like what you do. He doesn't 
like what you've done to the American theater. Therefore he is never going to 
like anything you do. Why don't you just let it go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-eight hours after the Los Angeles "Sunset" debut, Lloyd Webber seems to 
have taken his old friend's emotional advice and run with it. His butler, 
Isaac, moves quietly through the Beverly Hills rental, organizing his 
employer's imminent departure. Madeleine, dressed in blue leggings and a thick 
sweater, waves hello as she dashes upstairs. Outside, a cold, hard rain 
splashes down, and Lloyd Webber, sitting on an overstuffed floral couch, 
professes total contentment. No matter that most of the reviews are decidedly 
mixed -- Lloyd Webber wants to accentuate the positive. The score overall, he 
says, is "certainly an eight or a nine out of 10." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done," Lloyd Webber says with finality -- "Sunset" is complete. In a few 
hours, he and his family will board their private jet to return to England and, 
after a rest, his next move will be to decide what exactly will happen next 
with his rejiggered "Sunset." How can he incorporate the changes in London? 
Will the next version end up in New York? "We're looking at all of the theaters 
in the United States which could take it," he says. And if that location 
happens not to be Broadway, he hastens to add, it's "not because we don't want 
to go to New York, it's because we can't find the theater in which to put it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, on a long, low coffee table, an immense arrangement of white lilies is 
turning brown at the edges and starting to droop. Whenever he falls back into 
contemplation, Lloyd Webber looks a little worse for the wear as well. The 
post-curtain partying on Thursday night went on and on, with 20 of his closest 
friends (some of whom he had flown in from England), staying until 5 a.m. And 
occasionally, his face crumples completely -- his mother died just days before 
"Sunset" opened after a long illness, having given orders that no one upset 
their plans in the event. Mostly, however, Lloyd Webber remembers to smile. He 
indulges in just one minor nervous gesture, tugging repeatedly at the bottom of 
his nose. And he comes back again and again to the "reviewers" who almost never 
let him down -- his fans. The day after the opening, they were out in force. 
"We took (in) more than half a million dollars. That's unbelievable. And I've 
just been told that there's a queue around the corner at the Shubert -- with 
umbrellas and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 He perches himself right at the edge of the cushy sofa. "I would say it's a 
much better set of reviews than I've ever had," he says one more time. "We 
could put together, really, the best quote-ad of any musical I've ever done." 
And then his fingers move upward, grab his nostrils, and tug.

 I'm drunk. My cheeks are flushed. My heart is beating fast. I'm not sure what 
time it is. As I look around the room, I find myself transfixed by 
insignificancies -- a beam of light etching a tiny rainbow onto one side of an 
Evian bottle protruding from an ice bucket; a thin, translucent rim of molten 
wax ringing the flame of the milk-white taper on my table; a scribble of blue 
thread on the back of a waiter's short black jacket. I also find myself, 
improbably, enjoying the syrupy pianist in the corner as he oozes through his 
maudlin repertoire. I feel wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sitting alone in the dining room of the Hotel Beau Rivage Palace in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, and have just finished a simple but delicious dinner. I 
began my evening with a flute of champagne in the hotel bar. With my meal, I 
consumed a bottle of good Swiss pinot blanc. Now, with a demitasse of strong, 
creamy coffee, I'm starting on my second tiny glass of the aged dry white 
cherry brandy called vieux kirsch . 
</P>
<P>
 Do I disgust you? Do you disapprove? And if so, why? I'm not behaving oddly or 
inappropriately to my surroundings. I'm not singing loudly to myself or 
knocking things over. I may well lurch a little when I get up to leave; I'll 
probably snore like a foghorn tonight. But I'm not going to drive anywhere. I'm 
not going to abuse anyone on the way to my room. So what if I'm drunk? Maybe 
I'll die before you do. Maybe I won't. Maybe you're a better person than I am. 
I hope you are, in fact. Good night.

 I WROTE THOSE WORDS, OR AT LEAST SCRAWLED the notes on which they are closely 
based, not quite two years ago, on the third evening of a 17-day business trip 
to Europe -- a trip that was to include many more good meals and many more 
ascents, as I like to think of them, to a state of pleasant inebriation. I was 
scrawling in the first place, instead of just sitting there sipping cherry 
hooch and listening to "La Vie en Rose," because I had lately started thinking 
seriously about alcohol and (for a start) my own relation to it. Since that 
time, I've scrawled and thought a good deal more, drunk and sober both, not 
just about why I drink, but about why other people do or don't, and about why 
alcohol is increasingly condemned these days, by the earnest and the honest as 
well as by the fatuous and the self-deluding, as evil straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 I've come to several conclusions: I think, first of all, that a lot of people 
who drink, and genuinely enjoy drinking, sometimes drink too much ( because 
they genuinely enjoy drinking), but that when they do, it's usually no big 
thing. They usually don't cause anybody any problems, and they probably do no 
more than minor damage to themselves. (A hangover is not a pretty beast, but it 
is a short-lived one; and, up to a point at least, the liver has astonishing 
self-regenerative abilities.) 
</P>
<P>
 I think that if alcohol is indeed, as we are often told, "America's number-one 
drug problem," it is also probably America's number-one scapegoat for societal 
ills -- ills whose real causes don't come conveniently packaged in bottle form. 
</P>
<P>
 And I think that, insofar as it is possible to measure such things, alcohol 
probably brings as much pleasure to the world as it brings pain. Plenty of 
people speak out against the pain. I think somebody ought to speak up for the 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 I LIKE TO DRINK. THIS IS NO SECRET TO ANYONE who knows me. Let's define some 
terms here, though: I don't live in a constant state of intoxication. I don't 
-- I can't -- work drunk. I don't get drunk every night. I don't get drunk on 
purpose. I mean, I know that alcohol will inebriate me if I consume a certain 
quantity of it and, in fact, appreciate that quality in it -- but I don't sit 
down at the table, open a bottle of vodka and say, "Boy, am I gonna get blotto 
tonight!" 
</P>
<P>
 And when I talk about getting drunk, incidentally, I don't mean 
falling-down/throwing-up/screaming-and-flailing-or-sniffling-and-sobbing/out-of-control 
drunk. I mean drinking to the point that the chemical equilibrium of my body 
begins to be altered in various noticeable ways -- my capillaries dilated, my 
muscles relaxed, my neurons disordered -- with pleasurable effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking is not an obsession with me. It is far from the defining activity of 
my life. I don't wake up in the morning imagining what alcoholic beverages I 
will consume that day. Drinking is simply a thing I do, a part of the mix. I 
drink wine -- a bottle, more or less -- with dinner three or four times a week. 
(I should mention that I'm 6-foot-1 and weigh something over 250 pounds, so I 
might be said to have a somewhat larger capacity than usual.) The nights I 
don't drink wine, I might have a small scotch when I come home or a brandy 
before I go to bed, or I might have nothing at all. I almost never drink at 
lunchtime, unless I'm off somewhere where lunchtime drinking is the norm. 
Occasionally, day or night, if I'm in the mood and the circumstances permit, I 
exceed these limits. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't drive drunk, but I'd be a liar if I said that I've never driven drunk 
-- and so would many of you. Sometimes when we drink more than we've intended 
to, judgment and coordination take advantage of the situation and sneak off 
hand-in-hand in the middle of the party, so discreetly that we don't even 
notice that they're gone. One of the drinker's most important responsibilities 
is to keep an eye on them, even through the haze, and to shut the bash down 
(and give up the car keys) if they disappear. (And one of the drinker's most 
important assets is a friend to help mount the vigil.) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm well aware of the physical dangers of alcohol -- the way it can wrack the 
body, scramble the brain. I'm also aware of its beneficial effects (wine's 
apparent value to the cardiovascular system, for instance). But I neither drink 
nor moderate my drinking for medical reasons. I do moderate it -- I drink less 
now than I did 20 or even 10 years ago, and will probably drink less in 1995 
than I do in 1994 -- but only out of common sense. My body is less resilient 
than it used to be, and since I drink for pleasure, I try to avoid drinking to 
the point of displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I drink, then? I drink because I like the way alcohol smells and 
tastes, especially in the forms in which I most often encounter it, which are 
wine, scotch, various brandies, an occasional beer, an occasional silly 
cocktail. I drink because I like the trappings of imbibing, the company it 
keeps -- the restaurants and cafes and bars and (usually) the people who gather 
in them. And, I drink, frankly, because I like the way alcohol makes me feel. I 
like the glow, the softening of hard edges, the faint anesthesia. I like the 
way my mind races, one zigzag step ahead of logic. I like the flash flood of 
unexpected utter joy that sometimes courses quickly through me between this 
glass and that one. I like the feeling of being almost, but not quite, in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 ALCOHOL IS ANCIENT -- AS OLD AS FRUIT AND grain. Fermentation, the process by 
which alcohol is produced, occurs spontaneously in nature. It is ignited by 
airborne yeasts, settling by chance onto grapes or other sugar-laden fruits, 
vegetables, grains and such (the catalogue of willing agents is immense). The 
yeast secretes an enzyme called zymase, which acts upon certain of the sugars 
-- principally dextrose and levulose -- to form carbon dioxide and a 
carbohydrate called ethanol or ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), which is the kind of 
alcohol we drink. 
</P>
<P>
 If alcohol is ancient, it is also ubiquitous. I don't mean just that most 
cultures, in most parts of the world, have discovered and enjoyed alcohol for 
themselves, but also that it is present in every one of us, whether we drink or 
not. In 1973, the Nobel Prize-winning British biochemist Sir Hans A. Krebs 
discovered that dietary sugars are fermented daily in the human intestine, 
producing alcohol in an amount said to approximate that contained in a quart of 
3.2% beer. This alcohol doesn't have the effects of a quart of beer, at least 
in normally functioning human bodies, because it is broken down almost 
immediately, before it reaches the bloodstream. Still, this would seem to be 
further proof that alcohol is a natural substance, and that the body has the 
means for dealing with it, at least in modest quantity. This is accomplished 
initially through an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase, whose function is 
to catalyze the first step in ridding the body of alcohol -- and which, as Mark 
Keller of the Rutgers University Center of Alcohol Studies writes in his book 
"Alcohol and Alcohol Problems," "doesn't seem to have very much else to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Louis Pasteur who discovered the nature of fermentation, in 1857. Many 
thousands of years before that, though, human beings began to take note of both 
the process and its effects. According to one story, Noah drank fermented grape 
juice after watching goats grow tipsy from the grapes, and liked the stuff so 
much that he subsequently became the world's first drunkard (and planted the 
world's first vineyard). Another tale credits a concubine in the court of the 
(probably mythical) King Jamshid of Persia, who sought oblivion by quaffing a 
noxious, foaming liquid she found at the bottom of a bowl of rotting grapes in 
the palace cellar -- and became the life of the party instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Distillation, the process by which whiskey, vodka, rum and other such liquors 
are made, is another story. Unlike fermentation, it is not a naturally 
occurring process, but rather a technique apparently developed by Arab 
alchemists in the 10th Century, originally to make perfumes and medicines. It 
is based on the fact that alcohol evaporates faster than water; by boiling 
wine, then, its alcohol can be drawn off and collected. The spirit, as it were, 
is extracted from the vinum corpus . 
</P>
<P>
 However fermentation was discovered, there is archeological evidence to 
suggest that, as long ago as 6,000 BC, the process had come under some measure 
of human control. The anthropologists Solomon H. Katz and Mary M. Voigt push 
the date back even earlier, to about 8,000 BC. They also posit that the 
earliest fermented beverage, apparently a kind of beer, might have been 
considered so desirable by its consumers that they were willing to change their 
very mode of living to ensure its regular supply -- actually planting grains 
that had hitherto been gathered in the wild. Out of cyclical, non-migratory 
agriculture grew the first permanent human settlements -- and the next thing 
anybody knew, you had rush-hour gridlock at Wilshire and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to get drunk, in other words, might lie at the very roots of human 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 MY NAME IS COLMAN, AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC. IT says so right here, at the bottom 
of this questionnaire from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. The form poses 
20 yes-or-no questions. "If you have answered YES to three or more," it reads 
in conclusion, "you are definitely an alcoholic." They got me on four of them: 
(3.) Do you drink because you are shy with other people? Yes, sometimes, when 
I'm feeling out of my element. It works great; after a glass or two of 
something, I loosen up, start a conversation and join the party. (10.) Do you 
crave a drink at a definite time daily? Yep. Dinnertime. (16.) Do you drink 
alone? All the time, especially when I travel. I like drinking in company, but 
good wine tastes just as good at the solitary table. (17.) Have you ever had a 
complete loss of memory as a result of drinking? Yes, once. 
</P>
<P>
 I was young (in my early twenties), tired (I was near the end of an arduous 
second-class train journey from Bucharest to Paris) and unwise. Stopping 
between trains in Dijon, I stashed my luggage in a locker and went off to the 
Foire Gastronomique, an immense food and wine exhibition, at which I attempted 
to taste about two dozen varieties of calvados -- strictly for academic 
purposes, of course -- after already having had a bit too much wine to drink. I 
vaguely remember leaving the exhibition hall. The next thing I knew, my train 
was pulling into the Gare de Lyon some four or five hours later. Miraculously, 
I had all my luggage with me. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the place to question the validity of facile questionnaires, to 
discuss the philosophies and methods of Alcoholics Anonymous and other such 
groups (which frequently use such questionnaires as screening devices) or to 
lampoon the you're-either-in-denial-or-in-recovery school of pop psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think it might be worth noting, since it is not commonly understood by 
the general public, that there is no single, universally accepted medical or 
legal definition of "alcoholism" -- and that by no means every expert on the 
subject accepts the fact that alcoholism is a disease at all. In his 
controversial but extensively documented 1988 book "Heavy Drinking; The Myth of 
Alcoholism as a Disease," Herbert Fingarette, a former World Health 
Organization alcoholism and addiction consultant, goes so far as to say that " 
No leading research authorities accept the classic disease concept (of 
alcoholism)." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholism is perhaps like obscenity in this respect: Almost everybody admits 
that it exists and most folks claim to know it when they see it. But when you 
try to get specific and say, This Is, This Isn't, it becomes a powerful elusive 
thing. Is an alcoholic, for instance, simply someone who ingests a certain 
predetermined quantity of alcohol? (The Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus 
thought so 2,000 years ago. "He is a drunkard," he proposed, "who takes more 
than three glasses, though he be not drunk.") Or should we define alcoholism in 
terms of physical symptoms (blackouts or the DTs, say) or of tragic social 
consequences (auto accidents, domestic violence, whatever)? 
</P>
<P>
 My father was an alcoholic by nearly anybody's definition. For most of his 
life, he drank like a son-of-a-bitch. As a young dandy of a newspaper editor in 
Chicago, just before Prohibition, he was famous for going to bed at 4 a.m. 
"drunk as a skunk," then getting to the office in the morning before anybody 
else and knocking out stories while his colleagues were still squinting at the 
coffee. Later, as a Hollywood writer, he hung out at Lucey's and other 
movie-business watering holes, where water was rarely consumed, and downed 
martinis or (his trademark drink) Old Rarity and Perrier. My personal 
recollections of his drinking are somewhat less romantic. I recall, for 
example, that he used to hide bottles of whiskey in his suitcase when he went 
on business trips -- and that when we went out to dinner as a family, he would 
sometimes excuse himself for a trip to the men's room, then stop on the way 
back to bribe a waiter to surreptitiously bring him a water glass filled with 
vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 If he was an alcoholic, though, he was also a scrupulously moral man, a 
stranger to violence whether drunk or sober and an almost unbelievably hard 
worker -- a writer who sat at his typewriter for unbroken four- and five-hour 
stints, not even getting up to go to the bathroom or the coffee-maker, or to 
stretch his legs. At the age of about 60, on doctor's orders, he quit drinking. 
He did it cold turkey, subsequently refusing even a celebratory glass of 
champagne when I graduated from high school. After my mother died, I encouraged 
him to drink a bit again. This he did with great pleasure. "I'd forgotten how 
good that tasted," he said when he tried his first martini in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 When he died himself a year later -- from the effects not of his drinking but 
of his lifelong three-pack-a-day cigarette habit -- I found nothing to suggest 
that he had started drinking seriously again. There was not a single bottle 
stashed in his apartment, not even beer in the refrigerator. If my father was 
an alcoholic, then, I'm tempted to say that he was not a typical one. But does 
a "typical" one exist? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it sometimes a question of social norms, or of context? Is the Frenchman 
who consumes maybe a bottle or a bottle and a half of wine a day, every day of 
his life (except when he's taking his annual government-subsidized, two-week 
"water cure" at some sulfurous-smelling spa in the mountains) an alcoholic? 
What about the Greek or Italian who cannot imagine sitting down to lunch or 
dinner without at least a glass of wine or beer? On the other hand, what about 
the kid who guzzles too much Coors at a high school beer bust and pukes all the 
way home (and who will probably repeat the process for a while until he grows 
out of it)? What about your aunt, who hadn't had a drink since George Bush was 
elected but who sipped a bit too much spiked eggnog a couple of nights ago and 
knocked over a stop sign driving back to Mission Viejo? And if she's not an 
alcoholic, which I would argue she certainly isn't, then how dare our courts 
require, as they might well do, that she attend AA meetings as a portion of her 
sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 And, er, what about me? 
</P>
<P>
 Context, in fact, is the whole point. You know all about context if you've 
ever gone sober to a party where the drinking is heavy. Everyone seems so, 
well, glassy-eyed and red-faced, so loud and unfunny. It is not a pretty 
picture. But that's just you. You're out of place -- just as you'd be out of 
place if you walked, glassy-eyed and red-faced, into a room full of the 
stone-cold sober. Wine-tasting party, wedding reception, Friday night at the 
tavern, table at Patina, bearskin rug by a ski lodge fire -- those are drinking 
places, or can be if you want them to be. Freeway, office, library, schoolhouse 
-- those are not, not even if you want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notion that there is a proper context for drinking, and for getting 
drunk, is rapidly disappearing in America. Institutionalized carousing is a 
facet of many cultures: Just as certain days are often set aside for 
abstinence, so certain days are set aside for popping corks and tapping kegs. 
We've just had such a day ourselves, and have another one coming up, on March 
17. But, we are now told, it's not OK to get drunk on those days, or on any 
others. Drinking is bad, period. The consumption of alcohol is increasingly 
unacceptable anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-martini lunch is an artifact today, as rare as the eight-track tape. 
In certain industries once famous for being practically fueled by ethanol -- 
the movie business, journalism, advertising -- drinking has become so suspect 
that a beer after work practically ruins reputations. In trendy restaurants, 
pregnant women are refused drinks by self-righteous waiters (never mind that 
some obstetricians permit their expectant patients an occasional glass or two 
of wine -- or that waiters probably ought to wield no particular moral 
authority in this regard). Schoolchildren come home with their "Just Say No" 
brochures and beg their parents not to drink wine with dinner because alcohol 
is a drug. The line between use and abuse is blurred. If you look up 
"Intoxication" in the on-line catalogue at the Santa Monica Public Library, you 
will be asked to "See Alcoholism" -- as if they are one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time alcohol fell into disrepute, say anti-alcohol activists. 
According to some estimates, in this country it is involved in more than half 
of all fatal traffic accidents, more than half of all homicides, more than half 
of all arrests of any kind -- and has a "negative economic impact" of more than 
$100 billion a year. It leads to suicide, broken homes, addiction to other 
drugs, woes of almost every kind. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, to some extent, to defend alcohol from these charges. Who 
says, for instance, that the tragic character flaws blamed on drinking are 
always caused by drinking, rather than the other way around? How many people on 
Skid Row drank themselves there, and how many drink because they are there? And 
why, for that matter, do we lavish opprobrium on those people irresponsible 
enough to drive drunk and not on those who drive while under the influence of 
prescription tranquilizers or antihistamines (which can cause dangerous 
drowsiness), or the ones who nod off behind the wheel from sheer fatigue or 
sleep disorder, or the ones temporarily short-circuited by anger or deep 
sorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a more basic response to the litany of accusations leveled against 
alcohol today, though: Alcohol is innocent. It has no soul. It has no 
intentions. It is a morally neutral substance, a mere arrangement of molecules, 
no more inherently good or bad than water (which both nourishes and drowns) or 
sunlight (progenitor of both chlorophyll and melanoma). Alcohol does not 
"cause" automobile accidents or child neglect or rape or murder. We do, by 
misusing it. Alcohol doesn't even cause alcoholism. (If it did, observed the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 1977, "everyone who 
drinks would become an alcohol abuser.") 
</P>
<P>
 If drinking, and getting drunk, should be done in context, they should also be 
done with a sense of (and I hope this doesn't seem too weak a word) manners. 
There are, and have always been, codes of drinking. These vary according to 
geography and era, but they are always in place. "Make not thyself helpless in 
drinking in the beer shop," reads an Egyptian papyrus from about 1500 BC, "for 
. . . falling down thy limbs will be broken, and no one will give thee a hand." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the responsibility of the drinker to know how, as well as when, to 
drink. There are people who Can't Drink. Something -- personality, hereditary 
chemistry, whatever -- robs them of control and of good sense when they ingest 
alcohol. Their etiquette is simply phrased, if not easily observed: Don't 
drink. There are others who can drink, and who choose to do so. Their etiquette 
is, or ought to be: Know yourself, and know alcohol in yourself.  
</P>
<P>
 I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS, ONE 9 MONTHS AND the other almost 4 years old, and 
though I've never actually sat down and thought deeply about the consequences 
of the messages I'm sending them by drinking so frequently in front of them -- 
by incorporating alcohol into my life, into our family life -- I am certainly 
very much aware that I am sending them messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do," my wife asked me recently, "if Maddy comes to you 
one day when she's a teen-ager and says, 'Dad, I'd like a glass of wine before 
I do my homework?' " I replied that I'd say no, and that I'd explain to her 
that there are some good things in life that you have to wait awhile for -- 
like coffee in the morning, a driver's license and that glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize, though, that that's far from enough. I realize that I have to imbue 
in my daughters a sense of respect for alcohol's heady powers and a sense of 
responsibility in its use. I hope, too, that I can inspire in them a deep 
affection for the concept of conviviality, and for the almost sacramental 
implications of breaking bread and sharing wine with someone. 
</P>
<P>
 But I also hope -- and this is the really tricky part -- that I can teach them 
this about getting drunk: That drinking, like life, is a matter of balance; 
that balance isn't always the same as moderation, though it keeps moderation at 
its core -- and that you can't keep your balance if you can't see the edge.

MOVIES; DIRECTOR IS FINDING PEACE WITH 'FATHER'; JIM SHERIDAN'S FILM ISN'T 
ABOUT THE IRA; IT'S ABOUT A FATHER AND SON WHO COULDN'T CONNECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLEN BARRA, Allan Barra writes about the arts for Newsday and the Village 
Voice. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Sheridan isn't exactly sure what it is that he's done, but he's absolutely 
certain that what he hasn't done is make a film about the Irish Republican 
Army. Members of the British press, most of whom haven't yet seen "In the Name 
of the Father," seem convinced that he has. One London paper, the Evening 
Standard, suggested that Emma Thompson might be stigmatized for her decision to 
appear in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the prevailing mood in Britain," the writer said, "it is likely to turn 
her from darling to rebel overnight." One tabloid suggested that the film's 
star, Daniel Day-Lewis, has wasted the opportunity given to him by the success 
of "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Age of Innocence" and "thrown away his 
chance to be a matinee idol." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan gives off a bewildered shrug when confronted with the last quote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonderful," he says, in a working-class Dublin accent too perfect for even an 
actor of Day-Lewis' talents to fake. "Now, in addition to everything else I've 
got to think about" -- he says tink for think -- "I've got to worry about 
ruining Daniel's career." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't likely that Day-Lewis' performance as Gerry Conlon, the Belfast lad 
wrongly accused of a horrendous 1974 bombing of a pub in Guildford, a suburb of 
London, in which five were killed and 70 hurt, will hurt the actor's 
reputation. If anything, his performance, looser and funnier than his 
Oscar-winning role in "My Left Foot" or his recent hits, will have audiences 
gasping at his transformation into an Irish hippie-turned-convict who plays air 
guitar on the roofs of Belfast houses while British soldiers try to pick him 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film isn't about politics, right? Sheridan hesitates -- this is a 
point where words should be chosen carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a political film in the usual sense of the word. I mean, it's about 
politics, y'know? One thing it's definitely not is anti-British. It's not a 
finger-pointing film. I love the English and I think they're great people -- 
you can't touch them for loyalty or independence of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope one of the points of the film is obvious to English viewers -- namely 
that one of the great tragedies of the IRA bombings is that the English have 
allowed them to inflict such terrible damage to their legal system. And I don't 
think it's anti-English of me to point that out. The Irish, from Swift to Shaw 
to Oscar Wilde, have always served as the outsiders that have made the English 
look at themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses to collect his thoughts. "To the degree that 'In the Name of the 
Father' is about politics, it's about the effect extremist politics can have on 
our lives. The precise point of the film is that Gerry Conlon wasn't in the 
IRA, yet his father and friend and several members of his family spent years in 
prison -- his father died there -- for a bombing that there wasn't a shred of 
evidence to connect them with." 
</P>
<P>
 In the near-hysteria that followed the bombing, Conlon, his friend Paul Hill, 
a 17-year-old Londoner named Paddy Armstrong and an English girl named Carole 
Richardson were convicted of planting the Guildford pub bomb and served 15 
years before Gareth Peirce, an English civil rights lawyer played by Thompson, 
looked into their case and discovered that investigators had deliberately 
withheld evidence that could have acquitted the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the so-called Maguire Seven, members of Conlon's family, including 
his father, his aunt Annie Maguire and her husband, Paddy and their two sons 
(15-year-old Vincent and 13-year-old Patrick), were arrested as part of the 
"terrorist" ring. All served several years in prison. The real IRA bombers 
confessed to the crime, but the confession was ignored by a judicial 
Establishment that stood to be embarrassed if the truth came out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "On one level, the film is a Kafka-like story about how a person through 
absolutely no fault of his own can get caught in a nightmare of something he 
can't comprehend. I think it's a film everyone can relate to, because deep down 
inside, all of us -- no matter what authority figures have said -- we all know 
that it's the truly innocent who usually get in the most trouble. The guilty 
know how to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On another level, though -- and this is what drew me to the script in the 
first place -- it's the story of how a father and son who could never connect 
with each other in the normal world finally bond while in prison." (Sheridan 
shares the writing credit with journalist and playwright Terry George.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been too many good fathers in Irish literature -- I think maybe 
Leopold Bloom is the only good one," Sheridan says, referring to the character 
in James Joyce's "Ulysses," "so I'm attracted to stories that explore that 
relationship." Sheridan has now produced two outstanding Irish fathers: the 
late Ray McAnally in "My Left Foot," and Peter Postlethwaite, in a performance 
remarkably synced to Day-Lewis', in "In the Name of the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan, who was born in Dublin in 1949, had a father who exerted a powerful 
influence on his life and work, taking him to the theater at an early age and 
urging him to read. Though they "had a lot of rows when I was in my teens and 
early 20s," Sheridan says, they got along well enough to work together in a 
theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 He did some acting in the group -- one of his fellow actors was young writer 
and would-be director Neil Jordan, who went on to win his own Academy Award 
last year for writing "The Crying Game." ("Me 'n' him played mules together in 
one play," Sheridan recalls. "He was a better director than actor, Neil was.") 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sheridan founded the Project Arts Centre, the focal point for a 
generation that found Dublin's Abbey Theatre too stuffy. Stephen Rea, Liam 
Neeson, Brenda Fricker, Gabriel Byrne and just about every other Irish actor of 
consequence in the late '70s performed at the Centre.  
</P>
<P>
 There were other jobs, including manager of a club in Dublin that featured an 
aspiring rock band with a singer named Bono. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, they were awful," Sheridan recalls of the band that would become U2. "I 
mean, they were only 17 or 18 at the time, and even then you could see they had 
some great ideas . . . they had the potential to go places. But they sounded 
awful." (Bono contributed some original music to the soundtrack of "In the Name 
of the Father.") 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Sheridan moved his wife and children to Canada and then about a year 
later, to New York, where he drove a cab to support them while working as 
artistic director of the Irish Arts Centre, a group that helped introduce the 
great playwright Brian Friel to American audiences.  
</P>
<P>
 It was in New York that theater producer Noel Pearson approached Sheridan 
about writing a film biography of novelist Christy Brown. The result, 1989's 
"My Left Foot," won two Oscars and became the first of four Sheridan 
screenplays to be filmed (he also wrote and directed 1990's "The Field," 
starring Richard Harris, and wrote the screenplay for last year's critically 
acclaimed "Into the West" for director Mike Newell). 
</P>
<P>
 "My Left Foot" began his artistic partnership with Day-Lewis, an odd but 
potent pairing that has been compared to that of Martin Scorsese and Robert De 
Niro. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan shrugs at the suggestion: "Well, it's flattering, of course but it's 
strange to hear it. I mean, Scorsese and De Niro have similar backgrounds, but 
Daniel and me, we're so different. I mean, we're not a gang, me 'n' Daniel. 
He's English, of course, and we're from, let's say, different social areas. 
We're from similar, I don't know, what's the word. . . ." Day-Lewis, when asked 
later to fill in the blank, says: "We're from similar psychological areas. When 
Jim writes a script, I often have the eerie feeling he's writing about me. Not 
my background, of course, but my emotional makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan seconds that notion. "Daniel has a terrifying ability to perceive 
what it is that you're getting at with the written word. He performs things 
exactly the way I envision them. I have to concede to him a small degree of 
madness when I'm directing him" -- Sheridan's eyes twinkle a bit -- "because, 
after all, he's the inspiration for a bit of it in me."

JAZZ; BENNY GREEN STRETCHES HIS FINGERS; THE 30-YEAR-OLD PIANO PHENOM IS 
DISBANDING HIS TRIO AFTER ITS CURRENT TOUR, BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE'S 
DISSATISFIED WITH HIS BANDMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Benny Green, wearing one of his trademark dark green suits that complements 
his rust-colored hair and sets off his fair complexion, hunches over the piano 
in the dining room at Wheeler Hot Springs in Ojai. Performing with Ray Brown's 
trio, the 30-year-old keyboard whiz is in the midst of a solo, delivering a 
long series of speeding lines that are dazzling in their complexity, their 
drive and swing, their consummate musicality. He finishes the improvisation, 
and for several moments there is no sound from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the legendary bassist, notes the quiet, and in an aside to the trio's 
drummer, Jeff Hamilton, says, "I think he killed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the crowd bursts out in enthusiastic applause, followed by cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Green has been drawing these kinds of ovations for a decade as he's toured the 
United States, Europe and Japan with singer Betty Carter, drummer Art Blakey, 
trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, bassist Brown and his own trio. Critical acclaim, 
too, has heralded him as one of the finest young pianists in jazz. Owen McNally 
of the Hartford Courant called him "certainly one of the most accessible and 
festive of today's young pianists." And The Times' Leonard Feather said Green 
is a "technically brilliant and consistently creative soloist." 
</P>
<P>
 While the influence of such artists as Oscar Peterson, Tommy Flanagan, Bobby 
Timmons and Bud Powell run through the slim, slight New York native's playing 
style, Green is increasingly coming into his own. And in that process, he is 
living up to the potential as one of jazz's major movers, a position seen for 
him by both critics and fans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief characteristics of his approach to jazz are a singing 
improvisational quality, a sense of melodic grace and a rhythmic punch. He 
works with a light, dancing touch that can turn suddenly dark and his solos are 
permeated with an ardent bluesiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Green grew up in Berkeley. He began classical studies at age 7, and by 12 was 
playing jazz, urged on by his father, an amateur jazz saxophonist who taught 
Green tunes and exposed him to such jazz giants as Powell and Thelonious Monk. 
After studies with such Bay Area jazz pianists as Ed Kelly and Dick 
Whittington, Green moved to New York in 1983. There he worked with Carter for 
four years and with Blakey from 1987-89. 
</P>
<P>
 He met bass Wunderkind Christian McBride and drummer Carl Allen while working 
with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, and with McBride and Allen formed a trio -- a 
group that, he says now, has run its course. The trio will have its swan song 
during Green's current two-month U.S. tour, which includes a free noontime 
concert at Santa Monica College on Jan. 11 and a six-night stand beginning that 
evening at Catalina Bar & Grill. (For the local engagements, Kenny Washington 
will replace Allen, who is staying in New York with his wife, who is due to 
give birth to their first child shortly.) 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who last year received Toronto's prestigious Glenn Gould International 
Protoge Award, has made six albums as a leader: two for the Dutch Criss Cross 
label and four albums leading a trio for Blue Note Records -- 1990's "Lineage" 
being his first, 1993's "That's Right!" being the most current. A recent 
conversation with Green began with a discussion of his work for Blue Note: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Both "Lineage" and "That's Right!" seem to have a more personal 
stance than "Greens" and "Testifyin' " -- two albums that seem to find you 
strongly in a blues frame of mind, playing tunes like "Down by the Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I made "Lineage," which featured bassist Ray Drummond and drummer 
Victor Lewis, just after I left Art Blakey, and, yes, there was something 
personal there in my music. I wasn't so much thinking about projecting other 
pianists' styles as putting something together that was my own. It was a fairly 
innocent period. But I hadn't gotten the grasp of the components that go into 
leading a band. I didn't know Ray and Victor that well. We just went into the 
studio and didn't have that close rapport as human beings that is essential. It 
was more just a professional arrangement. The guys treated my music with 
respect, but I felt a little intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That "human" element was in "Greens," which featured Christian and Carl? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Freddie had us open up the shows as a trio, play a tune or two, and it 
felt really good. There was a lot of freshness and humor there that made me 
want to pursue that trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Testifyin' " (which was recorded live at New York's Village Vanguard) 
documented our working band, and by then, in 1992, we were functioning as one. 
At the same time, I was really taken by the way pianists like Gene Harris and 
Ramsey Lewis could grab hold of an audience. There was a sense with them of a 
sermon taking place between the musicians and the audience, the bandstand being 
the pulpit and the audience being the congregation. I wanted to tap into that 
kind of power. I think that in imposing that demand on myself, I may have 
momentarily inhibited the whole expanse of my musical potential. 
</P>
<P>
 But with "That's Right!" I changed the style a bit, moved in the direction of 
playing more original music, extending my voice as a pianist through 
compositions as well as playing. I also wanted to document the sense of freedom 
and spirit that Christian, Carl and I share. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are you breaking up the band? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's time to let Christian and Carl pursue other avenues. They're so busy. 
It will be best for everyone. Maybe a year ago, I was more frightened to make a 
change, but now I welcome it. I want to get some guys I can spend time 
rehearsing with, and really work on advancing my repertoire. It's one thing to 
snag guys like Christian and Carl for the occasional trio gig, but we used to 
spend a lot of quality time together, and we don't now (due to our busy 
schedules) and that's what I'm looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the main rewards from playing with Ray Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 A: How nurturing the musical relationship is for me. First of all, he's the 
only veteran musician that I have played with who is completely open, willing 
and caring enough to take all the time necessary to help me with any musical 
question. And he won't just answer the question. He'll take some time and think 
about it, ending up giving me useful and practical advice. It's the most 
precious thing in our friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you get from your experience with Art Blakey? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Art told me to go out and play with some attitude. The audience is not 
interested in self doubt. People have come to have a good time, they want you 
to have a good time. Jazz is an art form, but we're also here to entertain 
people, to make people happy, to make people feel, period. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of his jazz message was that you should become a bandleader 
yourself, that leading brings something from within. I really blossomed with 
him, and I might not have, had it not been for that association. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What goes through your head when you're soloing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I try to sing a song from within and try to translate that to the piano. 
It's still that way. Ideally, you're playing what you feel. You want to react 
to the moment, come more from your heart than a strictly intellectual place. 
The technical knowledge that we accumulate is a means, like the vocabulary of a 
musical sentence, but it still comes back to the feeling that's in your heart. 
It's a relationship between yourself and your instrument and you really want to 
form a closer bond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's a good way to form this bond? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are several components. It has to begin with yourself as a person . . 
. the kind of values you have, the amount of care and respect you have for 
others. Your whole compassion and feeling toward humanity inevitably comes 
through in music whether you're trying to or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no shortcut and substitute for being with your instrument. That 
doesn't include just spending time sitting at the piano. It also involves 
thinking about the instrument when you're physically away from it, going about 
your everyday life. Thinking about what it represents, the beautiful sounds 
it's capable of achieving, those you are aware of and those yet to be 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who are you listening to these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, Hank Jones, though, more and more, I go for long 
periods without listening to records. I have been recording myself on gigs and 
when I hear things happen in live performance that surprise me, that are unlike 
anything I've heard, I want to examine that. It's really time now to be getting 
in touch with my own language, putting together my own vocabulary. Still, as 
I've felt in past, I don't want to be far from music that is touching me. I 
just want to personalize what I have ingested -- want that to be a continuation 
of the same heritage that's inspired me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's a typical day like when you're at home in New York? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically, my time is spent practicing, eating, sleeping, performing, 
listening and resting. At home, I wake up when I want, play when I want, sleep 
when I want. That can really change dramatically from day to day. Today, I got 
up at 8:30 a.m., practiced an hour or so. Now I'm talking to you. Tonight, I 
might still be up at 4. Sometimes, instead of sleeping eight hours, I may take 
two or three hourlong naps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about being on the road? What's that like? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When we're traveling, sleep is sometimes hard to get. I might come back 
from a gig, and have only two or three hours before we have to leave for the 
next job. So instead of trying to sleep for those few hours, I may stay up, 
maybe not eat, drink juice, have fruit, and then go straight to the next gig. 
There's a certain kind of nice, alert energy that comes with that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The feeling you get from playing music must be extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I definitely wouldn't exchange what I do for any other alternative. 
Sometimes I'll play things that I haven't heard anyone else do, that I feel are 
totally spontaneous. A moment like that is a little glimpse into something that 
is supremely beautiful, and gives me a little reminder, or a sign, that what 
I'm doing is of some spiritual merit. That gives me gratitude and appreciation 
-- makes me so grateful that I don't have a job where my heart isn't in it. I 
have to remind myself that this spiritual direction is really a kind of 
blessing, to be afforded the opportunity of doing something which is enriching 
and rewarding to my soul, is kind of unique, unique to all musicians, but not 
something to be taken for granted.

POP MUSIC; A MATCH MADE IN GRAMMY HEAVEN; WHITNEY HOUSTON'S SMASH 'I WILL 
ALWAYS LOVE YOU' HAS EVERYTHING THAT SWAYS VOTING MEMBERS -- IT'S WELL-CRAFTED, 
ANTHEMIC AND WAS A HUGE RADIO HIT -- MAKING THE SUPERSTAR THE FRONT-RUNNER FOR 
THE 36TH ANNUAL AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN, Paul Grein, a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles, has been 
forecasting the Grammys for Calendar since 1981. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" heads into Grammy season with more 
of a can't-miss aura than any record since the 1985 superstar spectacular "We 
Are the World." 
</P>
<P>
 Her smash ballad from "The Bodyguard" is brimming with traits that Grammy 
voters prize in a record of the year: It's immaculately crafted, dramatic and 
anthemic and was a huge hit in a variety of radio formats. 
</P>
<P>
 The record even gets bonus points for being a comeback of sorts (before the 
success of the soundtrack album, Houston had been briefly eclipsed in the 
pop-diva sweepstakes by Mariah Carey) and for having a Nashville connection 
(Dolly Parton's original recording of the song was a country hit in the '70s). 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the best record competition, the 30-year-old superstar is expected to 
be a finalist for best album, best female pop vocal and best female R&B vocal 
in the 36th annual Grammy competition. Nominations will be announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's chief competition in the album and single races is likely to include 
Billy Joel, Sting, U2, Janet Jackson and Rod Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammys reflect the tastes of the 8,000 voting members of the National 
Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences -- artists, songwriters, producers and 
others involved in the creative and technical areas of recording. 
</P>
<P>
 Grammy voters have historically been conservative (the Rolling Stones have 
never won a Grammy in regular competition) but they are gradually getting 
hipper (U2 has won four awards in the last five years). 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the nominations should shape up this year: Best Album  
</P>
<P>
 "The Bodyguard" soundtrack's massive success practically ensures that it will 
be nominated, but the album will have trouble actually winning the award. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it was an uneven collection of six prime songs by Houston and 
six filler cuts by other performers. Plus, there will be competition from 
Grammy perennials Sting and Joel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sting has won 10 Grammys since 1981, a total topped only by Michael Jackson's 
11 during the same period. With "Ten Summoner's Tales," Sting returned to the 
2-million sales success of his first two solo releases -- both of which were 
nominated in this category. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel, a five-time winner, personifies the key word in the Grammy lexicon -- 
mainstream. And "River of Dreams," his first album in four years, was widely 
regarded as his best work in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 U2 is the most respected rock band of the '80s and '90s -- a band so big that 
even middle-aged Grammy voters are aware of its significance. As a result, 
"Zooropa" will probably land a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her popular appeal, Janet Jackson has won only one Grammy -- and it's 
in the lower-profile music video field. Grammy voters prefer big, dramatic 
voices (think Houston and Carey) and they haven't shown much fondness for 
youthful dance music (which explains why Madonna has never won). Still, 
Jackson's sales punch should be enough to bring her a nomination here for 
"janet." 
</P>
<P>
 Also possible: Carey's "Music Box," the "Aladdin" soundtrack, Kenny G's 
"Breathless," Rod Stewart's "Unplugged . . . and Seated," R.E.M.'s "Automatic 
for the People" and Donald Fagen's "Kamakiriad." 
</P>
<P>
 What about Frank Sinatra's "Duets" and the all-star "Common Thread: The Songs 
of the Eagles"? Both albums were released after the cutoff date for this year's 
Grammys, which cover the period from Oct. 1, 1992, to Sept. 30. Best Single  
</P>
<P>
 "I Will Always Love You" looks so unbeatable in this category that the four 
other nominees seem like sacrificial lambs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel can't really complain: He won this award in 1979 with "Just the Way You 
Are." The pop veteran is likely to be back in the running with "The River of 
Dreams," his biggest non-novelty hit in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle are also expected to be nominated with "A Whole 
New World," the love theme from "Aladdin." The lush, old-fashioned ballad will 
appeal to older voters who are turned off by rap, grunge and metal. The song 
was an even bigger hit than Bryson and Celine Dion's "Beauty and the Beast," a 
best single finalist last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Stewart has never been nominated for best album or best single, but his 
graceful version of Van Morrison's "Have I Told You Lately" should change his 
luck. It's in the tender, acoustic style of Eric Clapton's "Tears in Heaven," 
last year's big winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sting's hypnotic "Fields of Gold" wasn't a big pop hit, but it has been a 
fixture on adult-contemporary radio for more than six months. This classy, 
relatively uncommercial single could fill the "quality" spot taken last year by 
k.d. lang's sensual "Constant Craving." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Carey will probably cancel each other out in the balloting with 
their smooth summertime smashes, "That's the Way Love Goes" and "Dreamlover," 
respectively. Other long shots: UB40's "Can't Help Falling in Love," Soul 
Asylum's "Runaway Train," R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts," Tina Turner's "I Don't 
Wanna Fight" and Kenny G's "Forever in Love." Best New Artist  
</P>
<P>
 Toni Braxton has gone on to big things since she made her debut on the 1992 
"Boomerang" soundtrack, but her main advantage over the female trio SWV is that 
she's a solo artist. The winner in this category is almost always a solo 
performer or a group with a strong lead personality. The other likely nominees: 
R&B vocal group Shai, album-rock faves Stone Temple Pilots and recent Rolling 
Stone cover boys Blind Melon. 
</P>
<P>
 The laundry list of 222 eligible performers also includes balladeers Joshua 
Kadison and Brian McKnight and such hit groups as the Cranberries, Jade, Silk 
and Ace of Base. Other Categories  
</P>
<P>
 Grammy rules were changed this year so that albums no longer compete with 
singles. All entries listed in the following performance categories are singles 
or album tracks -- except in the traditional-pop and alternative contests, 
which are open to albums only. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female -- "I Will Always Love You" is a cinch to 
give Houston her third award in this category. The other likely nominees: 
Carey's "Dreamlover," k.d. lang's "Miss Chatelaine," Tina Turner's "I Don't 
Wanna Fight," Janet Jackson's "If." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Male -- With "Have I Told You Lately," Rod Stewart has a good chance to 
finally win his first Grammy. But he's hardly a shoo-in. The likely 
competition: Joel's "River of Dreams," Sting's "Fields of Gold," Michael 
Bolton's "To Love Somebody," Aaron Neville's "Don't Take Away My Heaven." Long 
shot: Donald Fagen's "On the Dunes." Really long shot: Michael Jackson's "Will 
You Be There." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Duo or Group -- Male-female duets have won here in four of the last six 
years, which is good news for Bryson and Belle's "A Whole New World," Celine 
Dion and Clive Griffin's "When I Fall in Love," and Vanessa Williams and Brian 
McKnight's "Love Is." Also: R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts," UB40's "Can't Help 
Falling in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Pop -- From the inauguration gala to her Las Vegas concerts, 
Barbra Streisand probably made more news last year than she had in the previous 
10 combined. All that attention can't hurt her chances of winning her ninth 
Grammy with "Back to Broadway." Also: Tony Bennett's "Steppin' Out," Diane 
Schuur's "Love Songs," Rosemary Clooney's "Do You Miss New York?," Anne 
Murray's "Croonin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Solo -- Grammy voters love to cap a dramatic comeback with an award or 
two. Think: Tina Turner and Bonnie Raitt. That bodes well for Meat Loaf, who 
made last year's most astonishing comeback with the No. 1 smash "I'd Do 
Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)." But his competition is going to be 
classy: Peter Gabriel's "Steam," Sting's "Demolition Man," Neil Young's "All 
Along the Watchtower," Tina Turner's "Proud Mary." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Duo or Group -- U2 all but owns this category. The band is likely to win 
here for the fourth time in seven years with the title track from the "Zooropa" 
album. The other likely nominees: Aerosmith's "Cryin'," Soul Asylum's "Runaway 
Train," Blind Melon's "No Rain," Bob Dylan/Roger McGuinn/Tom Petty/Neil Young/ 
Eric Clapton/George Harrison's "My Back Pages." Long shots in this extremely 
competitive category: Guns N' Roses' "Yesterdays," Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Soul 
to Squeeze," Spin Doctors' "Two Princes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard Rock -- Stone Temple Pilots' "Plush," last year's hottest album-rock 
track, has the edge over Alice in Chains' "Down in a Hole," AC/DC's "Highway to 
Hell," Smashing Pumpkins' "Cherub Rock" and Living Colour's "Leave It Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal -- Keep an eye on Slayer and Ice-T's "Disorder" from the "Judgment 
Night" soundtrack, which consists of unlikely pairings of metal and rap acts. 
Grammy voters love high-concept collaborations -- though they tend to think 
more along the lines of Streisand & Barry Gibb. Also: Megadeth's "Angry Again," 
Anthrax's "Hy Pro Glo," White Zombie's "Thunder Kiss '65," Suicidal Tendencies' 
"Institutionalized." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative -- U2 ("Zooropa") is probably headed for a second Grammy here, 
though they'll be squaring off against two other massive bands, R.E.M. 
("Automatic for the People") and Nirvana ("In Utero"). Also: Paul Westerberg's 
"14 Songs," Smashing Pumpkins' "Siamese Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Female -- Houston's remake of Chaka Khan's "I'm Every Woman" is almost 
sure to give the pop queen her first R&B Grammy. That means Janet Jackson will 
come up short again , despite a powerhouse entry ("That's the Way Love Goes"). 
Also: Toni Braxton's "Another Sad Love Song," Aretha Franklin's "Someday We'll 
All Be Free," Patti LaBelle's "All Right Now." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Male -- Luther Vandross personifies the mix of class and commerciality 
that Grammy voters love, so he could be headed for his third win here in four 
years with "Heaven Knows." Also: Babyface's "For the Cool in You," Ray Charles' 
"A Song for You," Tevin Campbell's "Can We Talk," Teddy Pendergrass' "Voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Duo or Group -- The front-runners are SWV's "Weak," which hit No. 1 on 
both the pop and R&B charts, and Sade's "No Ordinary Love," which was featured 
in the hit movie "Indecent Proposal." Also: Jodeci's "Lately," Shai's "Baby I'm 
Yours," Tony Toni Tone's "If I Had No Loot." 
</P>
<P>
 Rap Solo -- Grammy voters will feel obliged to acknowledge the triple-platinum 
success of Dr. Dre's solo debut, "The Chronic," represented by the track "Let 
Me Ride." Also: MC Lyte's "Ice Cream Dream," Paperboy's "Ditty," LL Cool J's 
"Stand By Your Man," Positive K's "I Got a Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Rap Duo or Group -- The big question is how severely Snoop Doggy Dogg's recent 
arrest on murder charges will hurt the chances of Dr. Dre and Snoop's "Nuthin' 
But a 'G' Thang," which would otherwise be the likely winner. It'll probably 
cost it the award -- especially given the strength of the competition: 
Salt-N-Pepa's "Shoop," Tag Team's "Whoomp! (There It Is)," Arrested 
Development's "Revolution," Naughty by Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Female -- Mary-Chapin Carpenter is looking to become the first woman 
to win here three years in a row. She'll probably do it with "Passionate 
Kisses," though Wynonna Judd will give her a run for the money with "Tell Me 
Why." Also: Reba McEntire's "It's Your Call," Tanya Tucker's "Soon," Trisha 
Yearwood's "Walkaway Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Male -- Alan Jackson's spirited "Chattahoochee," which was voted best 
single in October by the Country Music Assn., is the front-runner. Also: Garth 
Brooks' "Ain't Going Down (Til the Sun Comes Up)," Travis Tritt's "Can I Trust 
You With My Heart," Randy Travis' "Look Heart, No Hands," Dwight Yoakam's 
"Ain't That Lonely Yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Duo or Group -- Brooks & Dunn's "Hard Workin' Man" has the inside 
track. Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn have been voted best duo by the Country Music 
Assn. the last two years running. Also: Alabama's "Reckless," Diamond Rio's "In 
a Week or Two," Restless Heart's "Mending Fences," Sawyer Brown's "Thank God 
for You."

THAT OLD-TIME BAD RELIGION; HAVE THE INDEPENDENT-MINDED PUNKS JOINED THE 
CORPORATE ESTABLISHMENT? NO WAY, THEY SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, Steve Hochman writes about pop music for Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the initial days of the Los Angeles punk scene, Bad Religion stood 
alongside such celebrated early '80s groups as X and Black Flag. 
</P>
<P>
 True to the punk tradition, the group raged against the machine with songs 
that were as cerebral as they were convulsive. The band's shows, too, were 
gripping episodes, leaving both the musicians and the audience drained by the 
end of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 While virtually every other band on the scene either moved to major labels or 
dissolved, Bad Religion maintained its semi-underground pace, releasing its 
albums on its own Epitaph label and finding its own ways to build a following, 
without having to cater to the tastes of radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was this last bastion of independence doing backstage recently at its 
Hollywood Palladium show, glad-handing with Atlantic Records 
President-designate Danny Goldberg for photos that ended up in music industry 
trade magazines? 
</P>
<P>
 And what was Bad Religion doing onstage last month at the Universal 
Amphitheatre as part of the "Acoustic Xmas" concerts alongside such 
corporate-affiliated acts as Billy Idol and 4 Non Blondes -- a benefit 
sponsored by KROQ-FM, one of L.A.'s biggest commercial-rock powerhouses? 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the new era for Bad Religion, which plays Saturday at UC 
Irvine's Crawford Hall, next Sunday at Red Dog in Santa Barbara and Jan. 11 at 
Montezuma Hall at San Diego State University. The band now is part of the 
corporate-rock world, having signed a five-album deal with Atlantic Records. 
Atlantic is now distributing the band's latest album, "Recipe for Hate," which 
was recorded before the deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Gurewitz, Bad Religion guitarist and songwriter, takes on one of these 
heard-it-all-before looks as he considers the reactions he has gotten to these 
moves from some of the group's old fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stand for individuality, we stand for independent thought," says Gurewitz, 
31. "Lyrically that's the crux of most of our topics. And I don't think moving 
to a company with broader distribution necessarily contradicts any of those 
concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Graffin, the band's singer and other primary songwriter, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had always maintained that having the benefit of a major distribution 
network would be something that would benefit us," says Graffin, 28, in the 
band's tour bus before a recent show. "An indie band can only go so far with 
indie distribution. We felt that what we had built thus far worked perfectly 
well, but it wasn't getting to enough people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gurewitz and Graffin are as odd a pair as you're likely to find fronting a 
band. The former, a California native, is completely immersed in the rock 
world, finding and developing new acts for the group's label when not playing 
with Bad Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin-born Graffin is into another kind of rock -- the fossils he studies 
in pursuit of a doctorate in evolutionary biology at Cornell University to 
complement the master's degree in geology he already has from UCLA. He's even 
abandoned Los Angeles, moving his family to Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a typical rock 'n' roll band," Graffin says of the lineup that also 
includes lead guitarist Greg Hetson (formerly of the Circle Jerks), bassist Jay 
Bentley and drummer Bobby Schayer. "We're a bunch of weird guys onstage who 
have really good melodies and relevant lyrics, but we're not your average rock 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Bad Religion started in 1980, it didn't really fit in to the 
standard molds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just kids in the same high school -- El Camino Real (in Woodland 
Hills) -- who didn't fit in," Gurewitz says. "We were geeks or punks or 
whatever you called us. We used to get beat up and picked on and we decided to 
play music in the garage once in a while. And then someone said, 'Why don't you 
play our party?' " 
</P>
<P>
 However, sometimes that party spirit has turned nasty. Three years ago when 
officials in North Hollywood closed a show by the band before it started, 
because of overcrowding, some fans threw objects at the police and broke 
windows of neighborhood businesses. The incident gave the band its greatest 
media exposure to that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a number of riots," Graffin says. "That's just the one that got 
covered. Bad Religion fans are very fervid and rabid. They wait a long time to 
see us, even if it's really only six or eight months. To them, that's a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Graffin regrets the damage done by the fans, he says the attention 
brought by that fracas helped the band in two ways. On one hand it precipitated 
a move to larger venues that could accommodate the crowds, and on the other it 
exposed the devotion of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made us more mysterious," he says. "People started going, 'Wow, this is 
that riot band. Let's go to the show!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly and quietly that started to manifest in hard-to-ignore ways. Rising 
alternative stars started naming Bad Religion as a significant influence (among 
them Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, who guests on "American Jesus," a track on 
"Recipe for Hate"). 
</P>
<P>
 And concert attendance and record sales built to levels far above the norm for 
indie rockers -- and even better than many big-label acts. "Recipe," in fact, 
had already sold 160,000 copies through Epitaph before the Atlantic deal was 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic's Goldberg says it wasn't so much the numbers but the strength of the 
music and the band's convictions that won him over after he was given a tape of 
"Recipe" by Bad Religion's publicist. But he sees a potential audience far 
beyond the band's current reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they could go very far," the executive says. "Certainly they could go 
as far as a band like Midnight Oil, which has had platinum (million-selling) 
albums. They have a quality so high that they easily transcend the genre in 
which they started. They seem to me a very sophisticated rock band that happens 
to have a lot of integrity and commitment, but musically they're so good that I 
don't see any limit to what they can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be fine by Graffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a band we have always tried to make people think and to have relevant 
lyrics that pertain to the common man," he says. "If you can provoke people to 
think, you go a long way toward making society a better place to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music is populist in focus, and I think all music should have equal 
potential in reaching the music-listening audience, and I know our audience is 
a lot bigger than 160,000 people. Whenever you put your heart and soul into 
music, from a personal perspective it's a tragedy if it's not widely 
distributed, if it's not given the same fair shake as other things. To me, it's 
a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling at KROQ is simply that the time had come for Bad Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just looking to play great music," says KROQ program director Kevin 
Weatherly. "We could care less what company distributes them. The fact is they 
have a loyal following and the timing was right." 
</P>
<P>
 But what if Bad Religion doesn't reach a wider audience? 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing to remember is that Bad Religion has never been goal-oriented," 
Gurewitz says. "We didn't say, 'Let's form a band . . . write songs . . . demo 
them . . . shop them . . . get a deal . . . try to have a gold record.' We 
said, 'Let's write cool music, let's play it and stay out of the way of the 
results.' I've found that when things are like that in my life, that's when 
I've had success." 
</P>
<P>
 But will success undermine the band's strongest selling point -- its loyal 
following? 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of Bad Religion's corporate move was a big topic among the fans at 
the Palladium show. The consensus is that the band will stay true to its values 
and its fans. But there was an air of doubt in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money talks, so who knows how the band will change?" Jose Avilez wondered as 
he bought a Bad Religion T-shirt. The 25-year-old West Covina firefighter said 
he's seen the band in concert 25 or 30 times in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think they'll change their values," countered his friend Chris 
Lester, a 26-year-old construction worker, also from West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they sell out, they won't have crowds like this," Avilez said, pointing to 
the packed auditorium, " 'cause I won't be here."

MACK DAVID, 81; LYRICIST FOR FILM SCORES, POP SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lyricist Mack David, who wrote the words for more than 100 pop and film tunes, 
including songs for "Gone With the Wind" and Walt Disney's "Cinderella," has 
died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 David, whose younger brother, Hal, is also a noted lyricist, died Thursday at 
Eisenhower Memorial Hospital in Rancho Mirage, nursing supervisor Geri Chaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among David's more famous compositions are lyrics to songs from "Gone With The 
Wind" ("My Own True Love"), "Ryan's Daughter" ("It Was a Good Time"), and 
"Cinderella" ("A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"). 
He also wrote songs for "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" and "Cat Ballou." 
</P>
<P>
 David provided the words for "I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine," recorded 
by Elvis Presley, and "It Must Be Him," performed by Vicki Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 He also created the lyrics for several popular 1960s television detective 
shows, including "77 Sunset Strip," "Hawaiian Eye" and "Surfside 6." 
</P>
<P>
 David received eight Oscar nominations during a five-decade career as a member 
of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. He is a member of 
the Songwriters Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those he collaborated with were Jerry Livingston, Duke Ellington, Johnny 
Green, Count Basie and Jimmy Van Husen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any which way the music business went, he was able to move in that 
direction," said his brother Hal, best known for his collaborations with 
composer Burt Bacharach. "He was always young enough at heart to turn with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his brother, David is survived by his wife, Bea; a son, a daughter and 
two grandchildren. Funeral services are scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles.

 Post-Christmas Bird Count Field Trip -- The Sea & Sage chapter of the National 
Audubon Society will hold its post-Christmas Bird Count specialties field trip 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the annual event is to look for the highlights of the birds 
spotted during the chapter's two local Christmas Bird Counts. The northeastern 
count was held Dec. 19 and the coastal count is being held today. 
</P>
<P>
 A schedule for the day will be distributed at the start of the trip, which 
begins at 8 a.m. at Huntington Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip group will meet at the park's Slater Street parking lot. To reach it, 
take the San Diego Freeway to the Golden West Street exit, go south. Turn left 
at Slater and the park and parking lot will be on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who take the trip are asked to wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to 
get wet feet from walking on wet grass. It is also suggested that those 
participating bring a warm jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are also asked to bring an Orange County map to help find the 
other birding locations. The length of the trip will depend upon how many 
different locations in which the highlighted birds were spotted. The trip will 
probably last the entire day. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the Sea & Sage chapter office at (714) 261-7963.

 Marsh Bird Walk -- The Sea & Sage chapter of the National Audubon Society is

NATIVE AMERICANS FIGHT TO PRESERVE SANCTITY OF SACRED LANDS; THE WEST: U.S. 
LAND MANAGERS UNSURE HOW TO RECONCILE RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL RIGHTS WITH 
PRESSURE FOR PUBLIC RECREATION, MINING AND LOGGING. 
</P>

<P>
 The meeting in Medicine Bear Lodge began with the burning of a braided strip 
of dried sweet grass. A tribal elder offered a barely audible prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked for understanding among the conflicting interests, called together by 
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to express their views on the proposed 
expansion of a gold mine on the edge of the Ft. Belknap Indian Reservation in 
the Little Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The mine threatens the quality of reservation streams and ground water, argue 
members of the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, they say, the range is sacred ground that shouldn't be 
further defiled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Indian religious freedom is an environmental issue, no matter how you look at 
it," said James Main Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disputes pose a dilemma for federal land managers: how to reconcile 
native religious and cultural rights with pressure for public recreation, 
mining and logging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to continue to try to maintain that consistent objective 
position when it seems like nobody is ever pleased with what you do," said Gene 
Miller, associate director of the BLM's northern Montana area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Native Americans are now capable of focusing on what they hold sacred; 
they become very vocal, and rightfully so. If there is a dilemma, it's a 
dilemma for agencies such as BLM to be able to convey the reality of the rules 
and regulations that we must work under, and to make sure that everybody -- 
tribes, industry, whoever -- has the same information." 
</P>
<P>
 A foundation for the tribal challenges is the American Indian Religious 
Freedom Act, a congressional resolution passed in 1978 as a "policy to protect 
and preserve for American Indians their inherent freedom to believe, express 
and exercise the traditional religions." 
</P>
<P>
 But the act has been more of a policy statement than a binding law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, even though the action would 
"virtually destroy the Indians' ability to practice their religion," the 
Constitution could not stop the Forest Service from building a logging road 
through a mountaintop area in Northern California containing holy places of 
three tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that ruling, native groups have been crusading for congressional 
amendments to the act that would better define their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing on proposed amendments last year before the Senate Select 
Committee on Indian Affairs, Walter Echo Hawk of the Native American Rights 
Fund testified that the sentiments expressed in the act "are inadequate when 
basic human rights are at stake. It is time for Congress to put teeth into its 
policy, since the executive and judicial branches have failed or refused to 
implement it in the last 13 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The list given to Congress of other sites considered sacred and threatened 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * The San Francisco Peaks in Arizona, where the Forest Service has allowed 
expansion of a ski lift into a Navajo and Hopi religious area. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Havasupai tribe's Red Butte, near the Grand Canyon, threatened by 
uranium mining. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sioux sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where the Forest Service has 
allowed public access. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mt. Shasta, Calif., threatened by a Forest Service timber sale and ski lift 
in a religious area used by the Wintu, Pit River, Modoc and Karuk tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volcanoes National Park in Hawaii, where geothermal development has been 
permitted in the home of the goddess Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 Many quarrels between Native Americans and government or industry in the 
Western United States are decades old. The one at Ft. Belknap began in 1895, 
when the federal government took 40,000 acres of gold-bearing land from the 
original reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long-disputed Badger-Two Medicine area near Glacier National Park in 
Montana, traditionalists won a temporary victory April 30 when Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt put a one-year hold on proposed oil and gas drilling. 
Blackfeet consider the pristine mountain valley a historic religious area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the decision is irresponsible," said Janelle Fallan, executive 
director of the Montana Petroleum Assn. Babbitt's move was motivated by 
"political pressure from environmentalists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from Glacier park, in the Sweet Grass Hills region of northwestern 
Montana and southern Alberta, Canada, Blackfeet and Chippewa-Cree scored 
another victory in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The hills contain caves and other sites that are sacred to some Plains 
Indians. The soil produces grass that is used in religious ceremonies. Antique 
ceremonial masks carved from seashells were found in a cave in the hills last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Native Americans, the BLM wrote an environmental impact 
statement before issuing what would have been an otherwise routine permit for 
gold exploration in the Sweet Grass Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hills were given a reprieve from prospectors' bulldozers and drills 
when the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, an independent federal 
agency, ruled that the bureau had failed to meet federal statutory requirements 
by not consulting with the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council ordered the BLM to restart its process, and this time to get more 
input from the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ceremonial site revered by area tribes as a kind of Stonehenge of the 
Rockies is the Medicine Wheel, an ancient stone circle high on a ridge in 
Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by a surge of tourists and New Age visitors in the last few years, the 
Forest Service scheduled road improvements, a parking area and a visitor 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the preservation council overrode those plans too, noting that the site is 
used for tribal ceremonies and that the Forest Service failed to adequately 
address Native American concerns.

PANTHERS POUNCE ON DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks would still like to think they are the better of the NHL's 
two newest teams, but right now that title belongs to the Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers swept the two-game season series by beating the Ducks, 4-2, 
before 14,669 at Miami Arena on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (16-15-6) lead the Ducks (14-24-2) by eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not accepting that they're better than us, but I can't tell you we're 
better than them, because they beat us twice," said the Ducks' Terry Yake, who 
scored his team-leading 14th goal at 3:39 of the third period. "Come the end of 
the year, we'll see. . . . There's no doubt they've got a pretty good hockey 
club, because they've beat a lot of other clubs, too. But I'm not going to take 
a back seat to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' record against the other four recent expansion teams dropped to 0-8 
-- a mark that Coach Ron Wilson declines to dwell on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we would try harder in a game like this. I mean, we try hard 
every night," Wilson said. "It's not like you try hard and then you try 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert said it is a topic the players don't discuss much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's probably something the organization itself is not very happy 
about," Hebert said. "But we want to play every game like it's a big game 
whether it's Montreal or Pittsburgh or whoever, Florida or Tampa Bay. But I'm 
sure maybe in the back of our minds, maybe it's a little frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers took a 3-0 lead, scoring first at 3:41 of the first period when 
the Ducks' Jarrod Skalde knocked the puck into Anaheim's net as he tried to 
clear it while Hebert tried to cover it. Stu Barnes, the nearest Panther, was 
credited with the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fluke, is what it was," Wilson said. "In the end that's what beat 
us. That's one of the few times you'll see a team score a goal where the other 
team never touched the puck." 
</P>
<P>
 That one wasn't Hebert's fault, but he had one of his shakiest games of the 
season, later giving up the Panthers' third goal when the puck rolled in slowly 
behind him after he made the initial stop on Paul Laus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough because we didn't want to give up a quick goal against this team; 
that's what they want," Hebert said. "They try to get a one-goal lead and sit 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks did their share of sitting in the first two periods, but came alive 
in the third with 26 shots -- doubling their total. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake's goal ended a scoreless stretch of 118 minutes that started in the third 
period of the Ducks' victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday. They were 
shut out by Washington on Thursday, as the absence of former leading scorer 
Anatoli Semenov continues to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bob Corkum scored at 17:27 of the third, making the score 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson pulled Hebert for an extra attacker with 1:19 to play, but Tim Sweeney 
lost a chance at close range when a Florida player lifted his stick from behind 
and he fanned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice play," Sweeney said. "I never saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Jody Hull scored into an empty net with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we can't make that claim (to be better) if we don't win the games," 
Sweeney said. "We've been in both games and had a chance to win. I think it 
comes down to us not burying our chances. We'll see who's better at the end of 
the year. I think it's a little too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, the way the better team is determined is who reaches 
the playoffs," he said. "One on one, they're 2-0 against us. They have that 
feather in their cap." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Coach Ron Wilson accused Florida goalie John Vanbiesbrouck of playing 
with pads wider than the regulation 12 inches. "I'd be willing to bet John 
Vanbiesbrouck's pads are 14 inches wide," Wilson said. Rules don't provide for 
questioning pads during a game, as they do with sticks. "I think a lot of 
goalies are cheating, and no one's really investigated into why all these 
goalies in the league have goals-against averages under 3.00 and save 
percentages over .900," said Wilson, also accusing San Jose's Arturs Irbe. "You 
go from four guys with those types of numbers last year to over 20 this year. I 
guess it's like baseball, the home runs go up one year, you should start 
checking bats." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Clarke, Florida general manager, responded by telling the Palm Beach Post: 
"I think Ron Wilson should just coach his hockey team and not worry about us. 
He's not exactly Al Arbour. He's only been in this league (this season). For 
him to become an expert so quickly is remarkable. For him to talk about our 
players like that is very unprofessional. He's open to criticism himself." 
Vanbiesbrouck simply laughed, saying Wilson could come to practice and check 
his pads, which the Florida goalie said were legal.

FOR KINGS, IT'S A KO IN TORONTO; HOCKEY: THEY TAKE THE OFFENSIVE, NOT ONLY 
FIGHTING BUT ALSO SCORING OFTEN TO DEFEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 7-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 King left wing Warren Rychel knew it was going to be that kind of game when he 
looked at the Maple Leafs' starting lineup Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of who was going to go first," Rychel said after the 
Kings defeated the Maple Leafs, 7-4, before a crowd of 15,728 at Maple Leaf 
Gardens. "(Ken) Baumgartner, (Greg) Smyth and one other clown, some bozo." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a whole nine seconds for things to unravel. Rychel fought Smyth to a 
draw in a spirited brawl, setting the tone for the night. There were 228 
penalty minutes in all, 111 were assessed to the Kings and 117 to the Maple 
Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, the offense came alive as the Kings opened a 7-0 lead with Wayne 
Gretzky scoring once and adding two assists, regaining the lead in the NHL's 
scoring race. Left wing Mike Donnelly had one goal and two assists and John 
Druce and Tomas Sandstrom each had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto scored twice in the final 5:39 when the game was long out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had a switch of goaltenders. Toronto Coach Pat Burns pulled Felix 
Potvin after the struggling goaltender gave up four goals on 12 shots in the 
first period, replacing him with Damian Rhodes. Later, King goaltender Kelly 
Hrudey pulled himself at 11:39 of the third period, suffering from a strained 
hamstring in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey revealed later that he injured the leg in Montreal on Nov. 27 and 
re-injured it in the second period Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough for me to make that decision," Hrudey said. "I've never done 
that. The ironic part was in warm-ups and the first period once things loosened 
up, it was the best I felt in months. It wasn't a move. It was some skating 
thing and I bent down and felt a strange feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been injured. It's a unique experience. I've always prided myself 
on being available. I may not have always played well, but I've always been 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb Stauber came in for Hrudey and for a brief moment it looked like Stauber 
might be gone, too, when he left the crease and tussled with Maple Leaf left 
wing Bill Berg with four seconds to play and racked up 14 penalty minutes on 
two minors and a 10-minute misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for Rogie (Vachon)," said King Coach Barry Melrose, joking. 
"The lead wasn't secure and there was too much time left to put (assistant 
coach) Cap (Raeder) in." 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber seemed a little embarrassed when asked about going after Berg and 
landing a couple of shots. "Did I?" he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining his action, Stauber said that Berg was going after King defenseman 
Brent Thompson and he was trying to help out. "They were running our guys," 
Stauber said. "I came around the net and tried to slow him down. He looked like 
he was going to come at me, and well, I was going his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rychel was impressed by Stauber's move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good for him," Rychel said. "Because that guy (Berg) is a cheap shot. He's 
heartless and gutless. He's always running guys from behind. I was loose. I 
could have got to him since I was the rover." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rychel shrugged, to suggest that might have been a waste of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some help now," he said. "Phil (Crowe) and Doug Houda and Brent 
Thompson. It seems like there is four heavyweights on each team. But I'll go 
any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rychel showed off his battered hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stinks," he said. "I want to be able to carry my kids. It's a job and I've 
got to do it. Some of these guys don't even bother with the other part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 And the other part of the game is going well for the Kings these days. Since 
losing to the Maple Leafs on Dec. 18, the Kings have lost once to Dallas and 
are 4-1-1 in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys played the best game in front of me all year," Hrudey said. "We were 
tough physically and kept the third man high all the time. In my mind I don't 
think we gave up one out-numbered attack. It was a fun game to play in, which 
made it tough for me to come out."

SPOTLIGHT / SATURDAY'S BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; FAUST'S FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Elliott Almond 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen bowl games for those illustrious Division I-A schools . . . 38 teams 
earning bids. These are the times that fry men's, and women's, souls, if not 
brains. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it might be one of life's little necessities. Because without this 
football feast how could Corporate America survive? Excluding the Rose Bowl, 
the postseason has the smell of a mercenary. The Federal Express this, the 
Thirty Car Rental that. 
</P>
<P>
 The IBM OS/2 Fiesta Bowl, played Saturday, is our personal favorite, although 
we have yet to compute exactly what an OS/2 is. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, we're wondering how we missed the OS/1 game. COME ON 
</P>
<P>
 First, it was the West Virginia Mountaineers. Now we have to put up with Notre 
Dame Coach Lou Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountaineers are no longer mentioning national-ranking rip-offs after 
their 41-7 trouncing in the Sugar Bowl. That leaves Holtz alone on the soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Holtz, his 11-1 Irish deserve to win the national championship as 
a result of Florida State's victory over previously unbeaten Nebraska. He 
reasons that Notre Dame defeated Florida State during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind Notre Dame escaped the Cotton Bowl with a 24-21 victory over Texas 
A&M. Holtz had an answer for that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing A&M here is very tough," he said. "It's a home game. We couldn't 
hear. Nobody wants to play A&M in Dallas. It's never easy playing on road." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Florida State's only loss came at South Bend, Ind. HOLD ON 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, a member of the NCAA's prestigious 
Presidents Commission, have a seat in the Rose Bowl? What was he doing on the 
sideline in the third quarter during a heated moment as Bruins and Badgers were 
mixing it up? HOLD OUT 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue said the third-quarter ejections of four players were 
regrettable, but he understood the foundation of frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that a lot of the reasons for that happening were . . . 
there was a lot of holding, I mean a lot of holding, going on out there -- by 
both sides -- and I don't think it was controlled properly by the officials." 
PAR FOR THIS COURSE 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers among the 100,000-plus Rose Bowl crowd might have been aghast at 
seeing the lush turf of Brookside's two municipal courses trampled by cars, 
spectators and concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 16th hole of the No. 1 course, children were using one of the manicured 
bunkers as a temporary sand box. And sharp-legged lawn chairs were digging some 
ugly divots. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of American Golf, operators of the two courses, said play will be 
under way today, however. SOFTLY INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the last of the Texas A&M Aggies at the Cotton Bowl for a while? 
</P>
<P>
 Many Texas football fans think so. Texas A&M, which has appeared in three 
consecutive New Year's Day games in Dallas, might be forced out because of NCAA 
rules violations (See Auburn and Washington). 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA Committee on Infractions is expected to rule this week on a case 
alleging Texas A&M football players were paid for work they did not complete. 
Aggie fans are bracing for two years of probation. UNBURDENING BOBBY 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably happy for Coach Bobby Bowden, who was drenched with a victory 
shower before the game had officially ended, Florida State's players said they 
won this one for their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get caught up in that 'poor old Bobby' thing because he's a great 
person," free safety Richard Coes said. "This is something different for his 
trophy case, though. I think it's fitting that we did this for him." CONFERENCE 
COUNTDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame and Louisville gave independents, a dying breed, some recognition 
with their postseason victories. The Big West, that bastion of athletic 
prowess, followed with Utah State's victory over Ball State in the Las Vegas 
Bowl. But when it comes to conference bragging rights, the Big Eight and 
Pacific 10, each 3-1 in bowls, will boast the loudest. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 Independents 2-0 Big West 1-0 Big Eight 3-1 Pac 10 3-1 Big East 2-2 Big Ten 
4-3 SEC 2-2 ACC 2-3 Mid-American 0-1 Southwest 0-2 WAC 0-4 WISCONSIN WOES 
</P>
<P>
 A sea of red-and-white passengers heard this special greeting on American 
Flight 1293 en route from Chicago to L.A. on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to welcome all you Bruin fans!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there was this sign outside one Pasadena residence near the Rose Bowl 
before Saturday's game: 
</P>
<P>
 "Need Tickets? We don't have any. Ha ha." WISCONSIN WONDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Feldman, host of American Public Radio's "Whad'ya Know?" comedy show 
at the University of Wisconsin, sees a boon in the Badgers' victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about a mile from Camp Randall (Stadium), so we get five bucks a car to 
park 'em," he said from his Madison home. "This looks like a good franchise in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, watching the game on television, noted: "The announcers still call us 
Wes consin like there is an East consin." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only flaw in this beautiful Badger day was the cow representing the 
state in the Rose Bowl Parade, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to lessen that profile, the bovine thing," he said. "There's a 
lot here besides cows. There (are) bulls for one thing . . . and quite a few 
sheep." LEADERS

 One of the better escapes by Heath Shuler, Tennessee quarterback, didn't come 
on the football field. It happened right before Christmas at the Westown Mall 
in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Benjie and I were shopping for a birthday when he says, 'We've got 
to go,' " Shuler said. "I turn around and there were 20 or 30 fans walking real 
abruptly toward us. He and I just took off running out of the mall. We just 
didn't have time to stop and sign autographs. You sign one and it's like a 
chain reaction. It can be a good hour's wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler has even resorted to disguises, wearing hats and glasses. But it 
doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just come up to you and ask you if you've got bad eyes." MAKING THE 
BIG PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the Rose Bowl game ended, safety Scott Nelson of Wisconsin proposed 
to Becky Klieforth, and, voila , they were engaged. The couple are from that 
little piece of paradise known as Sun Prairie, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got down on my knees," Nelson said. "She seemed a little shaky at first, 
but she finally said yes." OH, NO, NOT THAT SONG AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding tradition at Tennessee is the playing of the song, "Rocky Top," 
just about any time the Volunteers do something. It's almost enough to make you 
want to hear "Conquest." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in this era of thought police and political correctness, this song 
could easily be interpreted as the story of lurid animal sex, rampant 
alcoholism and a hint of multiple murder. In addition, its reference to smog is 
a clear slap at Los Angeles. How can this song be played in the 
let's-not-offend-anyone 90s? Judge for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 (Editor's note: The Times takes no responsibility for any emotional harm that 
reading these lyrics might cause.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that I was on old Rocky Top "Down in the Tennessee hills "Ain't no 
smoggy smoke on Rocky Top "Ain't no telephone bills." "Once I had a girl on 
Rocky Top "Half bear, other half cat "Wild as mink but sweet as soda pop "I 
still dream about that." "Rocky Top, you'll always be home sweet home to me 
"Gold old Rocky Top "Rocky Top, Tennessee "Rocky Top, Tennessee." "Once two 
strangers climbed old Rocky Top "Looking for a moonshine still "Strangers ain't 
come down from Rocky Top "Reckon they never will." "Corn won't grow at all on 
Rocky Top "Dirt's too rocky by far "That's why all the folks on Rocky Top "Get 
their corn from a jar." NOTEWORTHY 
</P>

 Penn State has won the coin toss nine times this season, all victories. . . . 
Coach Joe Paterno of Penn State tied Bear Bryant for the most bowl victories 
for a coach with 15. The breakdown: Fiesta (5), Orange (3), Cotton (2), Aloha 
(1), Citrus (1), Holiday (1), Liberty (1), Sugar (1). 
</P>
<P>
 At Atlanta, Matthew Dorsett returned a fumble 12 yards for the game's only 
touchdown and Southern University beat South Carolina State, 11-0, in the 
Heritage Bowl. . . . California's football players paid tribute to kidnap 
victim Polly Klaas of Petaluma by wearing her initials on their helmets in 
Friday's Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State extended its bowl unbeaten streak to 12 and its winning streak 
in bowls to an NCAA record nine. . . . Miami, college football's best team in 
the last 10 years, has lost all three Fiesta Bowl appearances. The Hurricanes 
also lost twice in Sugar Bowl games that determined national championships. . . 
. Only 69,855 tickets were sold for the Cotton Bowl, the least since 67,381 
watched Boston College beat Houston, 45-28, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Wright's interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter of 
the Sugar Bowl was the first by a Florida player in a bowl game in school 
history. . . . Florida, 10-11 in bowl games, won consecutive postseason games 
for the first time. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Don Nehlen of West Virginia, after his team was routed by Florida 
in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans: "Bourbon Street didn't bother us. The guys in 
orange pants bothered us."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins, forgetting the team's games against 
Rutgers (31-7), Maryland (70-7) and Northwestern (43-21): "They're (Tennessee) 
not used to playing in big games. We're in the Big Ten, we're used to playing 
bowl-type games every week."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler, upon being asked about his future: 
"I'm going to get on the bus. Go back to the hotel. Then go some place next 
week where none of you (reporters) can find me."  
</P>
<P>
 And junior Tyrone Wheatley, Michigan tailback, when asked about his future: 
"I'm not talking about it."  
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Tom Hammond, at the Fiesta Bowl, noted: "The first big play of the day 
will be the coin toss."  
</P>

 Notre Dame quarterback Kevin McDougal, recalling the previews: "We knew what 
Texas A&M was about. We saw the film."  
</P>

 Defensive back Brandon Sanders of Arizona, on Miami's attitude about the 
Wildcats' vaunted defense: "I don't think they really believed in the ( Desert) 
Swarm." EXTRA POINT

SIMON HELPS MATER DEI TOP LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though top-ranked Mater Dei appeared weary during its fifth game in six days, 
it still had enough to beat No. 2 Los Alamitos on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Simon scored 27 points to lead the Monarchs to a 76-63 victory over Los 
Alamitos in front of about 2,800 at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Schea Cotton added 18 points and 17 rebounds, including 12 in the 
first half, for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Jeremy Vandervoet led Los Alamitos with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said his team might have been tired after 
winning four consecutive games and the championship of the Orange Holiday 
Classic at Chapman University on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "After having five games this week and no practice, we weren't fresh," he 
said. "And we're still not playing well. We need to get back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos (11-3) stayed close early, but a big third quarter by Mater Dei 
sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs led, 20-16, after one quarter before going on a 10-3 spurt in the 
second quarter for a 30-19 lead after a basket by Simon with 4:36 remaining. 
The Monarchs led, 37-26, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos pulled to within, 30-25, after a basket by Ryan Staniec with 2:23 
left in the quarter. But two free throws by Cotton, a basket by Simon and a 
three-pointer by reserve Josh Porter gave the Monarchs a 37-26 advantage at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Mater Dei pulled away, opening with a 9-2 run for a 
46-28 lead with 6:19 remaining. Los Alamitos pulled to within 10 on several 
occasions before the end of the quarter, but each time the Monarchs thwarted 
the rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos made a final run in the last two minutes, pulling to within 
eight, but again Mater Dei turned back the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Foul trouble hurt Los Alamitos. Center Brian Doyle, a 6-foot-8 senior, who had 
10 points in the first half, fouled out with 4:15 remaining in the third 
quarter. He and 6-7 junior Vandervoet combined for 20 of the team's 26 points 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did a good job, but the fouls hurt us," Los Alamitos Coach Steve 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staniec tried to take up some of the slack left by Doyle's absence, scoring 10 
of his 14 points in the second half. It wasn't enough though. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei guard Clay McKnight finished with 12 points.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; RESOLUTIONS WAITING TO BE BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Year's resolutions for some of our favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan -- It was great getting away from it all. Now I want to go to 
spring training with the White Sox, join the golf tour and fly my Lear jet up 
to Nova Scotia to see a total eclipse of the sun. After that, I've got to win 
my money back from that chump in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley -- If Mike retires, I'm gone, too. Oh, he's back? 
</P>
<P>
 David Stern -- How about a seniors circuit, guys? NBC will carry it and do a 
Saturday show too, like Inside Puff, er, Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn Buckner -- If I get another TV gig, I'm hanging onto it. That was 
something I could do. One week, USA Today's Rudy Martzke said I had the best 
line of everyone: "Chicago looks tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fratello -- I hear you, Mighty. Rudy praised me for: "The Bulls have to 
give the ball to Jordan here." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis Reed -- If I ever get another GM job, I will not trade for Benoit 
Benjamin even though he was a great player for me at Creighton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Daly -- Next time I interview for a job, my first question will be: Did 
Benoit Benjamin ever play for you in college? 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Benjamin -- $3.2 million a year, 15 minutes a game. Is this a great 
country or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Donald T. Sterling -- Pia's coming to this spring's lottery party, so don't 
miss it. Is Ron Grinker representing Glen Robinson? Oh, we don't have our pick? 
Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning -- It's been great fun, but it was just one of those things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper -- I'm outta here, I'm outta here, I'm outta here. You're offering 
$3 million a year? You just bought yourself a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Pfund -- I'd better learn to relate to my young players. What's "Off the 
pig" mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad Rashad -- I'm tired of people saying I'm Michael Jordan's bobo. I'm 
going to be my own man, at least in public. More cocoa, Mike? 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley -- My resolutions will be published by Putnam ($22.95, $28 in 
Canada) under the title, "Ruminations of a Winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal -- Peace on earth, good will toward all men. Is the interview 
over? Here's a copy of my CD, "ShaqDiesel." Check out the third track: "Zo Go 2 
Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning -- So he's three inches bigger, 50 pounds heavier, has 4% body 
fat, pulls down backboards, leads the league in scoring, appears in a 
commercial every five minutes and out-earned me by $12 million last year? What 
else does he have that I don't? 
</P>
<P>
 George Shinn -- I'll never give another player $84 million if they have to 
push him into my office in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson -- Next summer, charity game, breakaway, crowd going nuts? I'm 
going to lay it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman -- Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Krishna Krishna. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Don Nelson -- Not that I'm superstitious, but step on a crack, break your 
point guard's back. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown -- My traveling days are over. I'm happy to be in. . . . Where is 
this again? 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson -- I'm not going to say one controversial thing this year. No. 
Really. LATEST DISPATCHES FROM THE PIT 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are going back to UC Irvine for another camp this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Great. Maybe they can make that Danny Manning-Glen Rice deal they pulled out 
of their last time there. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Heat boss Lew Schaffel said the Clippers called up last week to see if 
Miami was still interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat was. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Ron Grinker wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffel said Manning's agent now refuses to negotiate, even with a team Danny 
wanted to go to 12 weeks ago, with which he had agreed to a $5.5-million-a-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 With no assurance of keeping Manning, the Heat passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grinker is only doing what he said he would when the Clippers killed the Miami 
deal. Unless he relents, they're not likely to find a buyer at any price and, 
if Manning leaves via free agency, would get nothing for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back on the front lines. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Years of organizational chaos have produced a roster-wide funk. The Clippers 
should go 41-41 by accident except they're barely bothering to show up for 
games. After losses, someone like Harper and Mark Aguirre protests they were 
flat, they didn't show up, this is intolerable, etc. Aguirre might get himself 
ejected and swat some fan's popcorn all over the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The next game, everyone comes out flat again. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Try Lourdes. JERRY REYNOLDS, DEC. 1990-DEC. 1993 
</P>
<P>
 We regret to report the resignation, probably forced, of the Sacramento 
general manager, a funny guy who deserved a break but succumbed to the twin 
menaces, bad luck and new ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with one of the premium lottery slots, you have to be lucky in the draw. 
For every Orlando or Charlotte, there's a Sacramento or Washington -- one great 
player away and lacking only the good fortune to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings drew a No. 1 overall pick once, but it was in the woeful 1989 draft. 
They chose Pervis Ellison over Danny Ferry, Stacey King and Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the time, they got lower choices and had to settle for Walt 
Williams instead of Shaquille O'Neal, Billy Owens instead of Larry Johnson, 
Bobby Hurley instead of Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 It's something to remember as the Lakers begin their lottery era and the 
Clippers finish squandering the last of their riches. Opportunities are 
precious. Success is precarious. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reynolds could tell you, that's show biz. 
</P>
<P>
 In his honor, a few of his greatest hits: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assuring King fans they would like new pickup Jim Les: "I'm willing to 
stake what's left of my credibility on it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- After seeing himself on TV: "I told my wife, 'I look like a fat, little 
hillbilly.' She said, 'That's because you are, dear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- On getting a contract last season after having worked without one for two 
years: "People were sniffing around this job like lions sniffing out the weak 
antelope. It's a typical contract -- five years or 50 losses, whichever comes 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On owner Jim Thomas' state of mind as the Kings struggled this season: "Oh, 
it's great. Jim's like (King Coach) Garry (St. Jean) and myself. He's having a 
good time with it. Of course, he has advantages we don't." FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Seasons greetings, Western-style: Sun Coach Paul Westphal, delighted after 
victories at Seattle and at home over Houston: "Nothing in December means 
anything, but we ruined two teams' Christmas." . . . Right you are, Santa: 
After the loss to Phoenix, SuperSonic Coach George Karl yelled at publicist 
Cheri White, closed the door to his office, yelled at the walls and never came 
out to face reporters. "I didn't want to ruin my Christmas or anyone else's," 
Karl said later. . . . No wonder Atlanta and Chicago are such surprises -- 
someone in the woeful East has to win some games. There isn't an Eastern team 
that can't be beaten on its home court. The Knicks have lost at home to the 
Jazz, Rockets and Nets. The Hawks have lost to the Pacers; the Bulls to the 
Heat. The Rockets, Suns and SuperSonics have lost a total of three games at 
home, two to each other. Going into Sunday's games, the East was 22 games under 
.500. 
</P>
<P>
 Add panic: They're recircling the wagons in Charlotte, where Larry Johnson 
played his best game of the season -- 29 points, 20 rebounds -- and came out of 
it with his back sore. First announcement by the Hornets: This was "totally 
unrelated" to his other back problems. (What, those were in a different back?) 
Second announcement: Team physician Glenn Perry says a connection "can't be 
discounted." Prognosis: Johnson will be gone "three to 30 days." Bottom line: 
Johnson went on the injured list, meaning he'll be out at least 10 days. . . . 
Isiah Thomas' contract is up this season, and he's upset that his longtime 
patron, Piston owner Bill Davidson, hasn't stepped up with a Jerry Buss-type 
$10-million balloon payment. Thomas, who usually plays through fractures, took 
last week off with a strained arch. He's lucky Davidson doesn't take out a 
contract on him. . . . Clyde Drexler's legs may not be as shot as his head. 
Portland insiders say his troubles started with his announcement he deserved a 
$17-million ballon payment, which Trail Blazer management treated with scorn, 
even if Clyde, at $1.4 million, was No. 6 on the payroll. Drexler apologized, 
sulked, slumped, then sprained an ankle and went on the injured list. Portland 
got hot without him; now teammates whisper the ball moves better without him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks continue to stumble, and they're getting jittery. "I'm not 
convinced with Charles Smith and Hubert Davis, both injured, we have what it 
takes to get it done," said team President Dave Checketts. "We've got to add a 
piece to this puzzle to win it all this year." . . . And Checketts on what 
happened: "Maybe the rules have taken something away. We're not nearly as 
physical as we were last year. We're unable to play that way. We're timid 
overall." . . . Comment: Wrong. The Knicks are still No. 1 in defense -- almost 
five full points below last season's average of 95 points. Their problem is 
their two-man, Patrick Ewing-John Starks offense, No. 18 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buck isn't stopping here: Buck Williams' sore heels feel better, and he's 
playing his best ball in years, averaging 10 points, 11 rebounds and shooting 
59%. However, his contract is up, and Trail Blazer management wants his 
$1.8-million slot for a young free agent. "I won't be spending Christmas next 
year in Portland, that's certain," Williams said. "I can't say I'm not a little 
disappointed." . . . There are young teams -- Charlotte, Orlando -- in dire 
need of a power forward with Williams' kind of tangibles and intangibles. 
Whoever finishes second in the Horace Grant derby will have a wonderful 
fall-back position. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning experience: Shaquille O'Neal, still railing he can't get a call, got 
bounced from his second game of the season, No. 4 of his 109-game career. For 
good measure, referee Bennett Salvatore tossed teammate Jeff Turner and two 
Magic fans. . . . Former Cavalier Coach Lenny Wilkens, defending his old team, 
more or less: "They're not soft. They're finesse players. What I'm saying, we 
never had a guy on the team who was a tough-minded, physical player. But you 
don't throw out what you have unless you get something better." . . . Celtic 
Coach Chris Ford, acknowledging the obvious: "It's an issue, but I can't allow 
these guys to fall back and say, 'We're just not as talented.' Then we'd just 
be rolling over. We've got 12 guys on the roster. Let's get the most out of 
them." . . . Sun guard Danny Ainge, after Boston's Dino Radja went 0 for 14: 
"People said he struggled. Struggled? He got up 14 shots in only 18 minutes. 
He's my idol."

NHL ROUNDUP; NICHOLLS HAS THREE GOALS IN DEVIL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernie Nicholls, working his way through a troubled season, scored three goals 
as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Ottawa Senarors, 7-1, Saturday night at 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls, still recovering from the Nov. 19 death of his infant son, Jake, to 
spinal meningitis, hadn't scored since Nov. 5 and has seven goals in 22 games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it's a tough time in my career; 1993 was definitely the worst," 
Nicholls said. "That's behind me now and I'm just looking forward. Hopefully, 
1994 will be a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Millen, Stephane Richer, Bill Guerin and Tom Chorske also scored as the 
Devils moved into a tie with Toronto for second place overall in the NHL with 
48 points, seven behind the New York Rangers. The Senators remain last with 19 
points, eight behind Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators had eight players scratched from their lineup because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey outshot Ottawa, 11-1, through the opening six minutes but 
goaltender Craig Billington held his former teammates to one goal during that 
initial onslaught -- Millen's open-netter on a rebound at 3:24. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls, a 70-goal scorer with the Kings in 1988-89, made it 2-0 Devils at 
16:26 when he emerged from the penalty box to take a breakaway pass and blast 
it between Billington's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 4, N.Y. Islanders 3 -- Geoff Sanderson scored two power-play goals 
and Andrew Cassels had a goal and two assists to help the Whalers win at 
Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders lost despite a season-high 54 shots on goal against the Whalers' 
Sean Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt busy, not exhausted," Burke said. "You like to be in the game and get 
the first couple of shots early." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, who started for the 10th time in 11 games, faced 22 shots in the first 
period and gave up two goals -- both on the power play -- to Benoit Hogue and 
Derek King. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanderson broke a 3-3 tie at 7:13 of the third period. His shot from the right 
circle went between the pads of Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford scored three times in four power-play chances against the third-worst 
power-play defense in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our penalty killing -- I don't know what to say, but it's got to get better," 
said Hextall, who faced 33 shots. "It's atrocious." 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 5, Washington 5 -- The Lightning got two goals from Petr Klima at 
Landover, Md., in matching its best offensive output of the season, and the 
Capitals got two from Mike Ridley in stretching its unbeaten streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay, a team that specializes in defense, led, 4-3, after one period, but 
wasn't at all pleased with the direction in which the game was headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to score four goals, but it's not great when you give up three. 
What good is that?" Lightning goalie Pat Jablonski said. "That's not our style. 
That's not our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lightning went ahead, 5-3, on Petr Klima's second goal of the game midway 
through the second period, but the Capitals rallied, getting goals from Dale 
Hunter and Mike Ridley to salvage a tie.

SANTA ANITA; CROSS, MCCARRON HAPPY TO BE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Both trainer Richard Cross and jockey Chris McCarron believed Earl Of Barking 
was beaten at the wire by Fanmore in the $110,300 San Gabriel Handicap at Santa 
Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross told owner Henry Pabst not to come down to the track. "It's a pain in 
the neck to get back up there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron's opinion was verified by Fanmore's rider, Kent Desormeaux. "Seventy 
yards past the wire, I said to (Desormeaux), 'You got me, didn't you?' He said, 
'Yep.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The photo finish camera proved Cross, McCarron and Desormeaux wrong. In his 
first appearance at Santa Anita, Earl Of Barking won by a nose in 1:48 3/5 for 
the 1 1/8 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start as a 4-year-old, the 7-2 third choice won for the sixth 
time in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I thought he was beaten, but when I watched the replay, I 
wasn't sure," Cross said. "I don't know where we'll run him next. I'm just 
going to enjoy this victory for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fanmore, who gained the lead in midstretch, finished five lengths ahead of 9-5 
favorite Navarone, who was making his second start after being away for over 13 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had won it," Desormeaux said. "Chris even looked over and said, 
'You came back, didn't you.' I told him I thought so. My horse ran a super 
race. He was keen to go on, very anxious. He ran well all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Second in his comeback race on Dec. 5 at Hollywood Park, Navarone trailed 
early, began to surge around the turn, but couldn't gain on the first two in 
the final furlong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't handle the dirt," jockey Gary Stevens said of the turf course, 
which has drawn criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Arros finished fourth, two lengths ahead of Eastern Memories, then came 
Bossanova, Ranger and Square Cut. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brian Mayberry, who has trained the winner of the Pasadena Stakes two of the 
last three years, will be favored to win the six-furlong race for 3-year-old 
fillies again today. 
</P>
<P>
 Successful with Set Them Free last year and Ifyoucouldseemenow in 1991, 
Mayberry has a three-horse entry headed by recent maiden winner Madder Than 
Mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten a neck by Lakeway in her debut, Madder Than Mad won impressively Dec. 5 
at Hollywood Park. Tulgey Wood, who finished a distant third in that race, came 
back to win on Wednesday. Alex Solis will ride the Carr De Naskra filly, who 
will race coupled with Sophisticatedcielo and Noassemblyrequired. All three are 
owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the entrants include Concorde's Message, Jacodra's Devil, Malibu 
Light, Becky's Appeal, Bayou Plans and Dezibelle's Star. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gilded Time, the beaten favorite in the Malibu Stakes a week ago today, has 
been retired and will leave for Kentucky on Monday to begin a stud career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eclipse Award winner in 1992 as the nation's top 2-year-old, Gilded Time 
has had problems with his left front leg, according to trainer Darrell Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on Oct. 31, 1992, the son of Timeless 
Moment was off until he finished third behind Cardmania and Meafara in the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by David Milch and Jack and Mark Silverman, Gilded Time will stand at 
The Vinery. He finished his career with four victories in six starts and 
earnings of $975,980. 
</P>

<P>
 Terry Lipham, the agent for jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, has been released from 
the Sherman Oaks Burn Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A former rider, Lipham was accidentally burned while being treated for a skin 
condition. "There are still parts of my body with second-degree burns," Lipham 
said, "and they still don't know when it will heal. Only time will tell."

 Miss Dominique, a 16-1 shot, won the first stakes race of the new year at 
Santa Anita, beating nine rivals by nearly two lengths in the $62,200 Run For 
The Roses Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 With Corey Black riding for the absent Pat Valenzuela, the 5-year-old Private 
Account mare rallied from off the pace to win in 1:34 2/5 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Supah Gem, a 10-1 shot, finished second, a head in front of 2-1 favorite 
Cargo. Senate Appointee, the 2-1 second choice, finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Allen Paulson and trained by Alex Hassinger, Miss Dominique has won 
five of 13 and has two victories and two seconds in four starts at Santa Anita. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of longshots led to a Pick Six carryover of more than $129,000 for 
today's program. . . . Flying In The Lane, a 3-year-old Flying Victor filly, 
was impressive breaking her maiden in her debut, winning in 1:08 under Alex 
Solis as a 12-1 shot. . . . All jockeys were required to wear flak jackets 
Saturday under a new California Horse Racing Board regulation. The jackets, 
which weigh about 1 1/2 pounds, must be CHRB-approved and don't count in the 
jockey's weight. . . . Pat Valenzuela was off of his mounts for a second 
consecutive day after his wife and baby daughter came home from the hospital. 
Valenzuela now has four daughters. . . . Chris Antley, Corey Black and Chris 
McCarron each won twice Saturday.

THE FUTURE LOOMS BRIGHT; HOPE AND PERSEVERANCE GIVE SANTA ANA WOMAN A NEW 
LUSTER, AND THINGS ARE LOOKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The lowest point, Sandra Morisette says, was three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Unmarried and six months' pregnant, she was fired from her job as a waitress 
in a Huntington Beach Mexican restaurant. And a month after her daughter, 
Courtney, was born, she split up with the boyfriend she was living with. He's 
not the father of her child, she says, "but that's another story."  
</P>
<P>
 At 30, Morisette was on her own and on welfare for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't the stereotypical tale of a welfare mom. This is the story of a 
young woman who was determined to get off public assistance, to go back to 
school and to make a future for herself and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending night school for three years, Morisette is only one class away 
from receiving her AA degree from Coastline Community College. And in early 
December, she was hired as a receptionist at a new wireless cable TV investment 
firm in Irvine, her first non-waitress job since graduating from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's sluggish economic recovery from what some consider the worst 
recession since the Great Depression continues to take a toll on the lives of 
many residents, and the latest economic forecast predicts more of the same for 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all doom and gloom.  
</P>
<P>
 From Orange County firms helping out-of-work executives find jobs to the 
approximately 20,000 residents who were placed in jobs by Orange County's five 
Employment Development Department offices last year, individual success stories 
abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for those such as Morisette, the new year looms bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nobody believes in prayer or God, do so," she says, "because I've prayed 
for him to help me since Day One -- to lead me into some direction, and he has. 
I can't go wrong. It's a brand-new year for me and my daughter. I'm not looking 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround in her life began in mid-1990, a few weeks after she and her 
infant daughter moved in with Morisette's widowed father, a 74-year-old retired 
painting contractor who lives in a mobile home park in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 After splitting up with her boyfriend six months earlier, she rented a room in 
Huntington Beach, paying $350 a month in rent plus utilities. That left only 
about $50 a month from her AFDC check, and sometimes she even had to borrow 
money to buy diapers and other necessities for her baby. Many nights she'd stay 
up worrying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," she recalls. "I just couldn't make it."  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after she and her daughter moved in with her father, Morisette had 
something of a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat here and thought, 'What am I doing?' I didn't want to be on welfare any 
more. I was basically looking for security for my daughter. I knew I had this 
little baby that was depending solely on me to make our lives better." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not, Morisette says, the same person she was before becoming a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a partyer," she says. "I really had no responsibilities. As long as I 
had money to go out, I was fine. The minute my daughter was born, that all 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Morisette says she frequently drove by Coastline Community College in Fountain 
Valley "and one day I decided to turn in." A girlfriend had put herself through 
X-ray technician school, and Morisette figured if her friend could do it, she 
could too. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. While attending night school over the past three years, 
Morisette used money she could have used to buy new clothes and other things to 
pay for her schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 When she started at Coastline, she didn't even know how to type. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, "I had all my teachers behind me. They were really rooting for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her typing teacher, she says, even helped her write her resume. 
</P>
<P>
 In November -- with a spate of computer and clerical classes behind her -- 
Morisette signed up for Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN), a state 
Employment Development Department self-help program geared to helping AFDC 
recipients become self-sufficient and reduce their dependence on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to workshops on job interviewing and job-finding techniques, the 
program provides a phone bank for clients to set up interviews with prospective 
employers. GAIN specialists, meanwhile, do job searches and job developments, 
contacting employers to interest them in their clients' abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 GAIN even paid to buy outfits for Morisette to wear on job interviews because, 
she says, "I didn't have any clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after she enrolled with the program, Morisette began going on as many 
as three job interviews a day.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in tears after the second week because I kept getting shut out," she 
says. "I didn't have the professional experience. I had the know-how, but I 
needed somebody to give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Says GAIN specialist Pat Wright, who encouraged Morisette after two promised 
jobs fell through at the last minute: "When she came to GAIN, she was fearful 
of remaining unemployed. But she showed a lot of motivation and initiative. I 
don't want to say more so than our other clients, but she was one of the ones 
that stood out as the more motivated one." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week in December -- after 18 job interviews -- Wright called 
Morisette and said, "I've got something for you." 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was for a receptionist job at Continental Wireless Cable 
Television Inc. in Irvine. Despite having "the worst cold," Morisette went on 
the interview in which the office manager asked her why she would come out with 
such a bad cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," she said in a congested voice, "I really need a job."  
</P>
<P>
 The office manager told Morisette she liked how she presented herself, telling 
her "it shows a lot for you to come out like that."  
</P>
<P>
 When told she had the job, Morisette says, "I started crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that moment causes her to choke up. "I feel like I've kind of 
grabbed onto the end of the ladder where you keep pulling up," she says. "I 
always thought of myself as such a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 Landing the job, she says, was the answer to her prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pray every night," she says. "My daughter would say, 'Please, God, help my 
mommy find a job.' And then when I did and told her, she just hugged me and 
said, 'I love you' and said how proud she is. For being a 3-year-old, she 
really has supported me. Every day she'd say, 'Did you find a job? Don't 
worry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Morisette's first day of work in December, the office manager 
told her she had had "an excellent first day." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked out of there I felt like somebody," Morisette says. "I felt 
like I belong somewhere. I can honestly see a little future ahead of me. For 
the longest time I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 She began to cry again. "I'm sorry," she says between sniffles. "I just get 
very upset, because it was a long road." 
</P>
<P>
 Morisette's new job pays $8 an hour, more than she made as a waitress. She 
plans to continue living with her father. She takes care of the mobile home, 
cooks for him and pays half the rent -- $350 a month -- and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father depends on her now, she says, and "I don't want to leave him, and 
he doesn't want me to leave him." Besides, she says, "it's good for my daughter 
to have her grandpa around." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney, now nearly 4, is in preschool. For the next year, Morisette will 
receive help in paying for child care through a government Transitional Child 
Care program. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Morisette makes breakfast for her father and daughter and makes 
their lunches before taking Courtney to preschool in Costa Mesa at 9 a.m. and 
reporting for work at 10:30 a.m. She spends her 2:30 lunch hour picking up her 
daughter at preschool and dropping her off at the nearby home of her sister, 
who does not drive. But "that's OK," she says, "I just eat my lunch on the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister watches Courtney until Morisette gets off work at 7:30 p.m. Back 
home, she cooks dinner for her father or has their dinner simmering in a crock 
pot. "I have a long, busy day now, but it's a good, fulfilling day," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God every day that there's things like GAIN and welfare that 
help people. . . . People don't realize that you just have to reach out. 
There's a hand that will grab you and pull you up and take you. I started late, 
but I can see myself moving ahead. I don't ever see me going back because I 
know now, well, I'm worth it, and I can go out there and get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking back any more. I think '94 is going to be the best year yet."

AH, THE PITTER-PATTER OF LITTLE FEATS OF ELECTRONIC PARENTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can almost see these parents -- sitting alone at their desks, the kids 
finally down for a nap or out of the house. You can almost hear them too -- 
frustrated, confused or eager for personal contact. But all that exists are 
their written words flying across the telephone lines: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready for advice from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please help me understand. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "HELP!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, they might have been chatting with relatives or with 
neighbors over the back-yard fence. Now, they're seeking on-line child-rearing 
advice from strangers nationwide through electronic bulletin boards for 
parents. The boards offer a fascinating glimpse into how parents of the '90s, 
often isolated and overworked, are using technology to connect with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 With a home computer and a modem, members of systems such as Prodigy, America 
Online and the Well can, for various fees, boot up, sign on and maneuver past 
hundreds of other choices to the parenting bulletin boards, where they send and 
receive both public and private messages.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month over the Prodigy System, 750 parents nationwide sent 3,500 public 
messages to one another, with about 3,000 other users just peeking in to scroll 
through such topics as "2-Year-Old Throws!" and "Teen Behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really very representative of the isolationism we've come to," said 
Polly Johnson, a Nyack, N.Y., mother who with her husband, G.A., serves as 
"board leader," a kind of electronic social director, initiating conversations 
and trouble-shooting on Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a social work student, speculated that one reason people turn to 
computers for child-rearing advice is that they feel unsafe outside their 
homes, stay inside more and have fewer community contacts. Besides, she added, 
"I don't think they want to read another self-help book." 
</P>
<P>
 Many express age-old concerns: what to do about colic, earaches or sleep 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Others bring up more current family topics: grandparents' rights, the going 
rate for baby-sitters or where to get the hard-to-find Power Rangers toys. 
</P>
<P>
 One father named Phil recently sent a public message complaining that 
television was controlling his family life. "Please," he wrote, "I'd like to 
hear from folks that are living without it so I can plead a stronger case to my 
wife and my kids. Then again, I'd like to hear from anyone that lives with it, 
but can keep it under control." 
</P>
<P>
 A mother named Jennifer wrote back: "We have had the same problem as you and I 
hate to sound so harsh but NOTHING improved long term until we junked it. We 
are much happier." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dallas Mom" wrote in seeking other mothers for a play group. "Would love to 
chat with anyone (well, almost anyone, it's a long story) in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Some used the messages to debate the pros and cons of high-profile news 
stories, such as the Jessica DeBoer adoption mess. Others sent in descriptions 
of Polly Klaas, before the body of the 12-year-old Petaluma girl was found. The 
Prodigy System also runs photographs of missing children. 
</P>
<P>
 But parenting is the most dynamic topic, Johnson said. Without face-to-face 
contact, some people are more open than they might be in person, she said. One 
remarried woman wrote a bitter, six-screen letter about the lot of stepmothers, 
which read in part: "We are innocent people who fell in love with a man -- not 
his baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 The responses vary widely. Although some are dogmatic, "there are enough 
points of view that people can choose for themselves," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest recurring topic is spanking, she said. Whenever it comes up, 
someone usually writes in saying, "I don't see anything wrong with hitting a 
kid and I challenge any of you to give me one good reason why." Many people 
offer their religious views.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone named Jeff posted a message offering $500 to "anyone who can show me a 
single Bible verse -- Old Testament or New -- that specifically tells any adult 
to hit any child's butt with their hand or paddle."  
</P>
<P>
 One teen replied: "Dude, I am 17 and still get paddled by my stepdad. He feels 
guys understand physical punishment. . . . Anyway, at least I don't get 
grounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes children sign on and ask for advice with their parents. "One kid 
said, 'My father always comes home in a bad mood and insults my mother. What 
can I do? If I jump in, he'll get mad,' " Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of us came together and said maybe what you want to do is say, 'Gee, 
I like the dinner Mom made. Thanks Mom.' He said no, he'd be too afraid.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Electronic correspondents do not always fit the expected profile of upwardly 
mobile young computer users. "We get people saying we are scrimping and saving 
so I can stay home with the kids while he goes out to work. So there's a 
range," Johnson said. "This is their communication." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one senior citizen who's on," Johnson said. "One of her children is 
divorced and there's an issue about her ability to see the kids."  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she's asked for advice herself -- particularly about her father, 
who is terminally ill. "A lot of people were giving me lovely suggestions about 
how to deal with my daughter, who is asking me about death, what does it mean. 
She's also revisiting the terrible twos." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she took the advice of several writers who suggested that the 
grandfather and granddaughter make a photo book together so that she would have 
memories of him. She said her father also has a computer. "He spies on me on 
the board," she said. "He'll come back and say he was touched by this or that 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 Parenting bulletin boards aren't as popular as computer games, but enough 
parents use them for Johnson to consider dividing the board into advice for 
older and younger children and adding some experts authors, such as 
pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, to answer queries. In any case, Johnson said 
what people get out of their computer chat is often more than mere advice. 
"There's real warmth and reaching out," she said. "These people become 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent message from a teen-age mother began: "Hi, everyone. It's me again. 
I just want to let everyone know that things are starting to look up again. I'm 
enrolled in computer training and a living skills program. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 One reply came back: "I was a teen mom myself, on welfare a while and am now 
assuming a mortgage on a condo. It can be done! Hang in there!"

THE ERA OF FRAGMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pop culture is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 At least pop culture as we had come to know and love/hate it in the recent 
past, when it dressed, entertained and molded America en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 When culture popped in the 1960s, the entire country would tune in to "The Ed 
Sullivan Show" every Sunday night, forging a vocabulary for the next day's 
national dialogue around the water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades later, such solidarity is unthinkable in the face of a 
500-channel future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most interesting part of the story could be the disappearance of pop 
culture," said New York trend analyst Edith Weiner. "It has to have a history 
communicated through some generational mechanism. What we have now are flashes 
coming and going everywhere. That is not culture. Those are fads. . . . We have 
become a potpourri of cultures, and we have lost much of what was our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 So if you're scouting out pop culture, don't look for, say, a uniform that 
could brand an entire generation, the way love beads once made a silent hippie 
declaration. Now culture pops with flashbulb swiftness. Now you see belly 
button rings and blue bar drinks, now you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the picture, it's here and it's gone, as opposed to a motion 
picture," Weiner said. "Then you can say there are a lot of photographs there, 
and if you put an album together, yours would look different from someone who 
lives three blocks from you." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you wanted to costume someone in youth drag, you could make her a preppy.  
</P>
<P>
 Or a biker.  
</P>
<P>
 Or a grunge girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at teen-age culture, there's a phenomenon of teen-agers with a 
Chinese-menu approach for their lifestyle," said Robert Avila, chief economist 
for the Futures Group of Glastonbury, Conn. "My niece said she used to be a 
punker, and now she's a new romantic and she dresses like something out of 
'Gone With the Wind.' Pick and choose your lifestyle to suit your current mood 
and fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 In trendspeak, this is the era of fragmentation when it comes to pop culture 
-- or pop cultures . Trend watchers call this a nation of subcultures. With 
technology getting higher and higher, commerce can cater to smaller and smaller 
audiences. Fragmentation is linking arms with another late-20th-Century 
phenomenon -- a sharply stepped-up rate of change -- to create an explosion of 
culture pops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine a kid today 10 years old never understanding you'd only have a choice 
of five networks to watch, which is something a child 3 to 5 years older can 
remember," Weiner said. "Instead of having a generation defined at the 20-year 
break, it's more being defined in two-year breaks in time. We're experiencing 
generations of pop culture in one life span." 
</P>
<P>
 And as we peer into the jaws of the millennium, technology is helping to 
resculpt the bedrock of culture -- the economy -- moving us out of the 
Industrial Age and into the Information Age. As we interact with the world via 
our newly interactive TVs and computers -- 27 million U.S. households have 
computers -- another cultural phenomenon is unfolding: the trend toward 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings more people back to their home," said Gerald Celente, director of 
the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. "A reverse process is taking 
place. The Industrial Age took people away from homes to work locations. At the 
end of the Industrial Age, people are moving away from a centralized location 
to decentralized locations." 
</P>
<P>
 At work, 7.6 million people telecommute and 40 million hold full- or part-time 
jobs based in the home, trend analysts say.  
</P>
<P>
 At school, more work-at-home parents will respond to a declining education 
system by teaching their children at home, Celente said. He projects that by 
2005, the number of home-schooling families will grow to more than half a 
million from the current 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At leisure, Americans can shop electronically and socialize in cyberspace 
without leaving home. The new importance of home base is drawing sharply 
different responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streets are so dangerous or perceived to be so dangerous that you would 
rather be at home where it's comfortable," said Neil Feineman, a Los Angeles 
journalist who develops magazines about youth culture. "I think that's a 
terrible thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live music at a concert is not the same thing as seeing it on pay per view in 
your house. You are one more step removed and, from a moralistic standpoint, I 
wonder about the distancing. What happens when you do things in cyberspace as 
opposed to face to face? If cybersex is so satisfying, why have real sex, which 
raises so many emotional and health questions these days?" 
</P>
<P>
 But some society watchers view the trend toward an empowered home base 
equipped with modem as a good thing. Celente calls it Techno Tribalism: "People 
will be drawn back to their communities, and they'll take more of an activist 
role to see that their neighborhood develops in accord with their belief 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
 In trend analyst Weiner's view, computerized discourse, far from being 
alienating, can sow meaning in human affairs. If love is blind, then computers 
are the ultimate blindfold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop culture in previous eras was interaction, one-on-one and in person," she 
said. "The emerging pop culture's interaction will be just as meaningful when 
it's one-on-one but not in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the sub-pop culture of being on the (computer) network, very often people 
don't know what a person they're having an intimate relationship with looks 
like. You don't know that it's a female or male or their race or height. It's 
just to talk. To the people engaged in it, it's extremely meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 Herewith, some upcoming culture pops in the pan. Changing Success Ethic 
</P>
<P>
 Yuppie materialism as it defined the '80s will be consigned further into 
history. More and more, success in life for people of all ages will be defined 
by their ability to find a deeper purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a yuppie was about having a killer job that provided a sense of 
accomplishment at work," said Watts Wacker, a futurist for Yankelovich Partners 
Inc. of Westport, Conn. "The need for achievement isn't manifesting itself at 
the workplace. It's manifesting itself at home. Status has gone from being 
external -- what impresses you? -- to internal -- what works for me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Celente said that search will involve examining the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the basis of the so-called paradigm shift," he said. "The 
paradigm we're living under now is the Industrial Age, where success is 
measured in professionalism, accumulation of wealth and status. The ancient 
philosophies were based on the axiom that human life had a reason for being, 
much beyond what our culture of professionalism says it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a new paradigm, we'll go back to believing that life has a reason for 
being and we're not accidental glitches in an unfeeling universe. People are 
going to look at success as living a better quality of life." Baby boomers who 
are also aging hippies will lead the charge, in Celente's view. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the '80s and '90s they blended into the mainstream," he said. "They 
got their jobs and made money. They don't want to do that anymore. They will 
try to work less and buy less. It's the essence of less is more." 
</P>
<P>
 Celente calls that stripped-down existence a move toward Voluntary Simplicity, 
a trend abetted by the proliferation of such penny-pinching newsletters as the 
Tightwad Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Boomers) are previewing their mortality in the death and illness of their 
parents," he said. "They're saying, 'I cannot afford to be in my parents' 
condition when I get to be their age. If I'm going to be stressed out, if I'm 
exhausting myself, I'm going to end up as an inmate in a nursing home. So I'm 
going to move back to the land.' " At Play 
</P>
<P>
 As if the world weren't Barbied-out, Mattel celebrates Barbie's 35th birthday 
with the new -- Glitter Barbie -- and the old -- a reintroduction of the 
original 1959 doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the main pleasure principle is, if it can be watched, then it can 
be turned into a toy, as toys continue to take their cues from cartoons and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps perpetuate the toy in the market and allows toy makers to minimize 
research and development on a new virgin idea," said Jill Krutick, a leisure 
analyst for Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 That means kids will still clamor for action figures inspired by the TV show 
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," which Bandai of America produced in limited 
supply for Christmas '93, ensuring vociferous demand this year. Other action 
figures that will receive a big push include spinoffs from TV's "Biker Mice 
From Mars" and the animated film "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro's Elvis collector's dolls will take a bow, and computer games will 
become more sophisticated. Cars and planes will appear more realistic, 
Hollywood actors will find a new outlet for their talents in sharper game 
images and sound, and there will be more games available in 3-D and on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the trend of (CD-ROM) sales increasing at such a rapid pace that I can 
see the handwriting on the wall for floppy disc units by 1995," said Johnny 
Wilson, editor in chief of Computer Gaming World magazine in Anaheim. "I may be 
too cautious, because it may be by Christmas time . . . that that's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Hot computer games will include Lucas Arts' "Tie Fighter" game, a sequel to 
last year's popular Star Wars-inspired "X-Wing Fighter" game; the sequel will 
enable gamers to fight on Darth Vader's side for the first time. Also eagerly 
anticipated is "Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers," a CD-ROM game by Sierra 
On-Line that will employ Tim Curry's voice. Neo-Punk 
</P>
<P>
 Disco is passe. 
</P>
<P>
 Again. 
</P>
<P>
 But as you pack away your bell-bottoms, fear not that the fashion world is 
running out of past to plunder. Yesterday's punk is today's neo-punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the '70s there was punk, and that's why punk is back," says Los Angeles 
clothing designer Maggie Barry, whose label is VanBuren. "Everyone is trying to 
figure out what to do. It's another scene to follow. It makes sense because 
these are confused times." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the angry rebels of the '70s, the new punks are only into wearing 
safety pins, not wielding them. Neo-punk is fashion and nostalgia, not class 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion is always a statement of the times, and what better statement to make 
than punk, when everyone is running out of funds," says Luis Baraja, fashion 
director of Detour magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that doesn't stop such pricey designers as Gianni Versace and 
Chanel from leaping into the neo-punk fray with slitted and slashed pink 
leather from Italy and a harness bra from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Late at night, neo-punks are turning up at a new club called the Sham Lounge, 
named after the late '70s English punk rock group Sham 69. The club happens 
Thursday nights at the C 'n' C Club on Sunset Boulevard, spins hard-core to pop 
punk and early '80s hip-hop -- "from Circle Jerks to Blondie" and beyond -- in 
the words of club promoter Ben Yang. He said the club attracts nostalgic 
neo-punkers under 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a marked transition period," said journalist Feineman, "and looking 
backward for pop culture is a more reassuring way of staying viable in the 
marketplace until newer trends become more understandable." Cybersocializing 
</P>
<P>
 More people will be hanging out with friends in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty million people around the world are hooked up to electronic bulletin 
boards, and their ranks are growing by an estimated 10% a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rate of growth won't continue for long," said Howard Rheingold, editor 
of the Whole Earth Review and author of "The Virtual Community: Homesteading on 
the Electronic Frontier." "We'll run out of people on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Rheingold sees computers as a healing tool in our increasingly fragmented 
society. Computers are bridges to a "virtual community" of computer users next 
door or across the country -- "ordinary people helping each other in concrete 
Middle American real community ways, when your kid is sick, getting advice or 
raising the money to have an operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Cybersocializing on a more intimate plane is also expected to grow. People 
with specialized tastes are finding each other in adult bulletin boards, such 
as Maryland's Throbnet, where the computer version of phone sex thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 And on-line dating is expected to leap from the fringe to a mainstream meeting 
ground. "A lot of people out there would never dare go into a bar," Rheingold 
said. "What a weird way to meet people, and (yet) nobody thinks that's weird. 
Here, at least you get to know people. It's a real opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 High-tech dating will also take a turn in the next few years with the 
introduction of interactive video-dating TV channels. The lovelorn will punch 
in their requirements, view clips of appropriate candidates and flag desirable 
parties, who would then run their videos. Eventually, phone numbers would be 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Steven Dworman, publisher of the Los Angeles-based Infomercial Marketing 
Report: "The love of your life could be on your TV tonight." Woodstock 
</P>
<P>
 Trend-tracker Celente, writing in the Trends Journal, predicts that the 25th 
anniversary hullabaloo this year around Woodstock will be "the top 
entertainment trend of the year . . . the biggest cross-promotional/marketing 
tie-in extravaganza of the year and possibly the decade." 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s incarnation of 1969's Woodstock Music and Arts Fair will be big 
business. Two of Woodstock's original backers have linked up with Time Warner 
to mount a massive reprise of the defining megaconcert of the '60s. Their plan 
is to produce an Aug. 13 and 14 concert at the original Woodstock site with 
some of Woodstock I's rock 'n' rollers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope could be massive. Promoters expect as many as 250,000 people to 
spend $100 each to attend -- and the rest of the world could tune in via global 
satellite links and virtual reality technology. Organizers hope for a total 
audience of 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow through all those zeros, Celente sees a spiritual spinoff from the 
Woodstock refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has the probability of setting a tone for the nation, if it recaptures 
even a part of what the original Woodstock was about," he said in an interview, 
"and that's the peace and love message, the symbol of the bird on the guitar." 
Home Shopping 
</P>
<P>
 It's only going to get easier to spend money without crossing a store's 
threshold as more media and retail companies leap into the lucrative home 
shopping fray. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner Entertainment has linked up with Spiegel Inc. to launch two 
shopping channels next year: The 24-hour Catalog Channel will hawk goods from 
Spiegel's catalogues, as well as its Eddie Bauer merchandise. The other channel 
will be interactive -- subscribers to Time Warner Cable's Full Service Network 
in Orlando, Fla., will be able to shop in catalogue "stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Office workers far from their living-room TVs will be able to let their 
fingers do the shopping at catalogue kiosks tested in Chicago office buildings 
last year. A mere touch of the MicroMall Inc. screen enables passers-by to 
peruse catalogues and order by credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the television networks are gearing up for an interactive shopping 
future. NBC plans to coordinate some of its programming with the Interactive 
Network system, a digital broadcast network based in Mountain View, Calif., 
that will be unveiled this year. Viewers will be able to shop at home and 
participate in game shows. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mainstays of home shopping -- the $3-billion cable and infomercial 
industries -- will get glitzier. "Can We Shop?" a talk-and-spend show hosted by 
Joan Rivers, will make its debut this month on QVC. The network is also 
launching Q2, an upscale channel that will hawk trendy labels -- "an attitude, 
not a demographic," as its new chief, ex-Fox executive Stephen Chao, told New 
York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that has been proven in the infomercial industry is it takes a 
specialized creative talent to create programming capable of selling, but also 
entertaining and worth watching," said Dworman of the Infomercial Marketing 
Report. "Very few people have accomplished that. That's why literally only one 
out of 15 infomercials are successful. As the channels proliferate, you'll run 
into the same problem." Snowboarding 
</P>
<P>
 The unruly adolescent of winter sports is experiencing sharp growth spurts -- 
and pains -- as it schusses its way toward the front of the line at ski 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling in-your-face pastime of Generation Xers and their younger 
siblings is growing by 30% a year. One in 10 of those on ski slopes are 
shredders, slang for fans of the snowboard, essentially a skateboard for snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new sport with lots of money and lifestyle identification," says L.A. 
journalist Feineman. 
</P>
<P>
 That lifestyle is a blend of skateboarding, hip-hop fashion and raucous youth, 
a combination that can be nerve-racking for typically older skiers, who often 
reluctantly share the slopes with snowboarders. Indeed, ski resort owner Alpine 
Meadows Inc. found that 87% of the Lake Tahoe-area and Utah skiers surveyed 
didn't want the daredevil shredders on their mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most important test of rebellion versus the status quo in the youth 
culture that I know of because it's set up so diametrically opposed to skiing," 
Feineman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some resorts, mindful of the coming snowboarding boom, are catering to the 
shredders. Big Air Green Valley in the San Bernardino Mountains turned its 
slopes entirely over to snowboards this season. And Squaw Valley near Lake 
Tahoe is luring them with a six-foot-high volcano for fancy footwork. The Wild 
West 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild West will continue to rope in a broad spectrum of American dogies.  
</P>
<P>
 Country music is Tush Pushing its way into our leisure time. In the '90s, it 
has more than doubled its share of the album market to 16.5%, said 
trend-tracker Celente. More than 500 full-time country music dance clubs 
operate nationwide, with a dozen opening every month. And a dozen Western films 
-- TV and feature -- are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Country is even cutting a swath in that previously un-country-like country -- 
the book industry. In a reprise of Barbara Mandrell's great success with her 
1990 "Get to the Heart: My Story," Naomi Judd's "Love Can Build a Bridge" is a 
literary hit, having quickly climbed the bestseller lists after its November 
debut. More autobiographies are due from a line-dance of country stars: Dolly 
Parton and Reba McEntire have signed seven-figure contracts, and this year's 
autobiographers will include Charley Pride, Roy Clark, Glen Campbell and Travis 
Tritt. 
</P>
<P>
 One of L.A.'s hottest restaurants, Jackson's on Beverly Boulevard, serves 
roasted chicken under wagon-wheel chandeliers. And Celente noted that America's 
romance with the Wild West is reflected in the popularity of such utility 
vehicles as Ford Broncos and Jeep Cherokees.

STEPPING OUT AGAINST AIDS; AN ANNUAL MUSICAL REVUE BY SOUTHLAND ARTISTS WILL 
BENEFIT APLA'S NECESSITIES OF LIFE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AIDS was "a disease attacking gay men" when David Galligan directed the first 
Southland Artists Goodwill Event a decade ago. "Nobody knew much about it. It 
didn't sound terrifying, it wasn't anything that clutched your heart. We had no 
idea what this devastating disease would become." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Galligan will be directing his 10th STAGE benefit, with proceeds 
going to AIDS Project Los Angeles' Necessities of Life Program. The musical 
revue pays tribute each year to American composers and lyricists such as 
Leonard Bernstein, the Gershwins, Stephen Sondheim, and Richard Rodgers and 
Oscar Hammerstein, and draws on local and nationally known theater talent. The 
benefit has raised $500,000 over the years. A gross of $250,000 is anticipated 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrospective of favorites from past shows is this year's theme. In the cast 
are Lucie Arnaz, Dorian Harewood, Holly Near, B.D. Wong, Linda Purl and Dale 
Kristien. 
</P>
<P>
 Galligan says there's a different feeling at rehearsals now than there was a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we dish, the new babies come parading through, and then we cry over 
somebody we lost last year. It's a remarkable place to be. And as hard as we 
work, it's a lot easier for me to do this than for the (volunteer) 'buddies' 
who go and change people's bedclothes. Those people out there are amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Galligan, whose other theater credits include co-creating the shows "Blame It 
on the Movies" Parts One and Two, says he was asked to direct the first STAGE 
benefit by actor Michael Kearns and playwright James Carroll Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits the generosity of the theater community with one reason for the 
show's longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to people at the Ahmanson and told them we needed a prop and they 
donated one. The Mark Taper donated a light board, and away we went." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ron Abel, the show's musical director who has independently worked with 
Arnaz, Engelbert Humperdinck and Peter Allen: "The people who are based in 
theater have much more of a familial bond than those in movies or TV. It's hard 
to describe. The people you're doing the show with are your family for that 
amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 After nine years as the show's musical director, Abel says, "Every year brings 
new things that you have to deal with. You get to know the personalities you're 
arranging for, what suits them best. And then there are always new people, and 
you have to figure out what their strong points are." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel adds: "In the theater community, we've lost so many people. That makes it 
so much more personal. To have lost those people, you feel it a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Caryl is in her seventh year as a co-chair of the event. (Her co-chairs 
this year are Robert Fryer, Betty Garrett and Joyce Van Patten.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what I've learned from doing this," Caryl says, "is the importance of 
these kinds of events, the importance of committing yourself to it. It may be 
helping someone you know really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristien is a 10-year veteran of the benefit. The actress/singer, who 
performed as Christine in Andrew LLoyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera" at the 
Ahmanson for more than four years, calls the benefit "the best place in the 
world to perform. The audience is so appreciative of the talent, and there is 
so much talent. Everybody who gets up can stop the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, "I had just moved here from New York," she says, "and this was 
the first thing I did here. We all had to look up what AIDS was. Now, 10 years 
later, some of the people who used to perform with us are no longer here. . . . 
We all love to sing, and we need to make money for this particular cause. We 
certainly didn't think we'd be doing it so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristien echoes a wish made by Abel: "I'd like to see the time we don't have 
to do this anymore."

IT WAS A BANNER YEAR

<P>
 The 1993 high school athletic season may best be remembered for Kristaan 
Johnson's last-second shot in the boys' basketball Division I Southern 
California Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson took a long pass from Rico Laurie and made a desperation finger roll 
as time expired to give Crenshaw a 63-61 victory over Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
Cal-Hi Sports Magazine called the meeting between the two perennial powers the 
best boys' basketball game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's shot heard 'round the Southland highlighted another banner year for 
high school sports programs in Central Los Angeles. Local teams accounted for 
10 City Section titles, and individual accomplishments continued to make 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crenshaw's boys' basketball team beat Dorsey, 92-71, to win its 12th City 
Section title. The Lady Cougars defeated North Hollywood, 72-50, to win their 
second City title. Crenshaw is the only school to win both the boys' and girls' 
championships in the same season, first accomplishing the feat in the 1984-85 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jefferson's girls' basketball team beat Narbonne, 60-53, to win its first 
City title in the 3-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fremont upset Monroe, 1-0, to win its first City title in 22 years of soccer 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell became the first team outside the San Fernando Valley to win a City 
wrestling championship since Franklin took the title in 1984. The Eagles have 
compiled a 50-8 record since the wrestling team was formed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * The South Gate baseball team beat Crenshaw, 9-5, to win its third City 
title, and its first since 1960. The Rams also won in 1955. The Rams softball 
team, however, was denied a chance to win its sixth City title, losing to 
Verdugo Hills, 4-3, in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dorsey's boys' track team won both relays and scored in 12 of 15 events to 
upset defending champion Birmingham. It was the Dons' fourth City title, and 
first since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Belmont continued its dominance in cross-country under first-year coach Alex 
Carmona. The Sentinels have won 10 boys' titles and an unprecedented five 
consecutive girls titles. 
</P>
<P>
 * South Gate went 15-0 and won its first City Section girls' tennis title, 
beating Carson, 4-3, in the 3-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every local team won a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball, Verbum Dei lost to Serra, 69-53, in the Southern Section 
Division IV-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, Coach Ken Maki guided the Roosevelt boys' and girls' teams to 
the City 4-A finals, only to lose to Palisades in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In football, Dorsey, behind the running of Che Johnson and Christopher 
Phillips, hit a Carson roadblock and were humbled, 26-0, in the City 4-A final. 
Fremont reached a championship game for the first time since 1958, but lost to 
San Pedro, 31-7, in the 3-A game. 
</P>
<P>
 Local athletes also won their share of individual honors. Sprinter Michael 
Granville of Bell Gardens was selected the state's freshman athlete of the year 
by Cal-Hi Sports. Granville ran 47.24 to become the state's first ninth-grader 
to run under 48 seconds in the 400 meters. He also holds the national freshman 
record in the 800 of 1:51.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimmer Helen Salcedo of Bell won the 100-yard butterfly, her first City 
title, and later reached two individual finals against national-level 
competition in the Janet Evans Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer Carlos Navarro won a gold medal in the 122-pound division at the U. S. 
Olympic Festival in San Antonio after also taking first place in the National 
Golden Gloves competition in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kang proved a smashing success in the Big Apple, becoming one of two U. 
S. team members to capture a medal in the 11th annual Tae Kwon Do World 
Championships at Madison Square Garden. Kang, a teacher at Do San Tae Kwon Do 
Gym in Silver Lake, won a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Kendra Segura of Dorsey proved she does not need to belong to a 
country club to win a tennis title. The freshman upstart surprised senior 
Brahna Pastorini of Woodland Hills Taft to win the City individual tennis 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 News was also made off the field in 1993 high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The year began with a majority of Los Angeles Unified School District teachers 
accepting a 10% pay cut, averting a strike that potentially could have crippled 
the nation's second largest school system. The school district, however, 
received a boost in early April when Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc., announced 
that it would donate about $10 million over three years to fund the athletic 
programs of the district's 49 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most controversial story appeared May 8 when the The Times 
published an investigation into the Crenshaw boys' basketball program, 
questioning the eligibility of four of the team's nine transfers. Crenshaw was 
found innocent of any wrongdoing, but the probe forced other schools to more 
thoroughly investigate the eligibility of its athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a change in leadership in the City and Southern Section offices 
in 1993. City Commissioner Hal Harkness resigned in October for personal 
reasons and was replaced by former Belmont athletic director and girls' 
basketball coach Barbara Fiege. Stan Thomas, CIF Southern Section commissioner 
since 1986, resigned after an investigation showed he abused his expense 
account. He was replaced by Dean Crowley.

 Roosevelt High girls' basketball coach Lorenzo Garcia withdrew his team from 
the Los Angeles Invitational tournament and forfeited a semifinal game against 
Lynwood on Wednesday, charging mismanagement and favoritism in pairings by 
tournament director Jerry Weiner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders, who defeated Dorsey 59-48 in a quarterfinal game on Tuesday 
at East Los Angeles College, had been scheduled to play Santa Monica Crossroads 
in the semifinals.Lynwood was scheduled to play Inglewood Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, however, was informed by Weiner late Tuesday night that the 
Roughriders would instead play Lynwood, the defending State Division I 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weiner would rather see Lynwood play Morningside in the final than Roosevelt 
because it would produce a bigger draw for him," Garcia said. "It seems to me 
(Weiner) is catering to groups of people and treating Roosevelt like a 
second-class citizen. He should stick to his guns instead of dictating changes 
to accommodate himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner blamed the misunderstanding on a scheduling mistake on his part and 
said he had "inadvertently transposed" the pairings on the bracket sheet posted 
at the East L.A. gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Games for the 32-team tournament are also played at Gardena High and Pierce 
College and Weiner said it would be "logical" for Morningside to play 
Crossroads at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner also changed on short notice Roosevelt's first-round opponent from 
Eagle Rock to the Lynwood junior varsity Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against Lynwood, but I feel mistreated and this time it was too 
much," Garcia said. "This was the straw that broke the camel's back. I made a 
big mistake entering this tournament. "

PAST YEAR'S ISSUES MAY STILL HAVE HOLD ON O.C.'S FUTURE; PREDICTIONS: 
UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS SUCH AS EL TORO AND THE RAMS JOIN CRIME AND THE ECONOMY AS 
TOP CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The firestorms are over, the homicide record is history, and the prospects are 
poor for the El Toro Marine base and thousands of defense jobs, all in a county 
grappling with strained race relations and the potential loss of its football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County limps out of 1993 and lurches into 1994, it faces 
unparalleled challenges to its livelihood and character that could shape life 
here for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In so many areas, from gang prevention to defense conversion, the county has 
much work ahead to try to create jobs, quell fears, heal wounds and guarantee 
its safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the decisions will come from elected officials, others from the 
community as a whole. But all will be important and have an impact on Orange 
County in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime tops the agenda and for the first time in 12 years, residents responding 
to an annual survey conducted by UC Irvine said their concerns over safety 
issues now overshadow worries about the economy, immigration, traffic, schools, 
growth or housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the crime concern is gang violence, and in 1993, Orange County 
leaders in government, law enforcement, education, the judicial system and 
business gathered at an unprecedented "anti-gang summit" to try to tackle a 
problem that many believe is already out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 75 gang-related slayings and more than 210 killings countywide, 
Orange County has set records in both categories. This year, extra efforts are 
being made to make sure those two records are not eclipsed again. Emphasis is 
being placed on school dress codes, curfews, after-school programs, job 
opportunities and yet another law enforcement task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Wright, director of Orange County's juvenile hall, said it is 
imperative that this year families receive the broad support they need to keep 
their children out of gangs, whether it be from community organizations, 
churches, schools or social services agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright, like others, is not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gang problem has been such a well-kept secret for such a long time that 
people will continue to say that it's not happening until it gets so bad that 
they can't ignore it," Wright said. "Until then, the community at large will 
continue to look at police officers as the solution. In the meantime, the 
number of gangs is going to increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with their concerns about gangs, Orange County frets frequently about 
race relations at a time when immigration issues rank high on a list of problem 
areas. The UC Irvine poll showed that almost the same percentage who worry 
about the economy and jobs -- about one in five -- now consider immigration the 
county's biggest dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of new races and cultures causes anxiety among some white Orange 
County residents who equate legal and immigration with an escalation in crime 
and job loss. In the 1987 poll, 87% of the respondents said they believed the 
trend in quality of life in Orange County was going "very well" or "somewhat 
well." By 1993, the number had dropped to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll this year by the Los Angeles Times shows that more Orange County 
residents believe that personal responsibility plays a part in the problems 
facing minority groups than those who put the blame on racism or economic 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, nearly six in 10 respondents said that whites had a positive 
impact on the county while less than three in 10 said black and Latinos had a 
positive impact. Three in 10 respondents said Latinos had a negative impact, 
while 14% said blacks had a negative impact and 5% said whites had a negative 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 While race relations in Orange County appear tense -- especially when the 
topic is immigration -- county residents continue to worry about the economy, 
which shows little sign of recovery and calls for creative news ways to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
 With a rapidly shrinking aerospace industry, for example, business leaders 
will be confronted continually with the dilemma of defense conversion, a 
metaphor for finding jobs where none exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has lost at least 20,000 defense industry jobs since the summer 
of 1990, and economic forecasters say that similar high-paying jobs will not 
emerge until at least the end of the decade. Even then, the new opportunities 
will be in the fields of biotechnology and the medical industry, not in 
aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 While the U.S. government is of some help, doling out millions of dollars in 
"reinvestment" grants, the assistance will be relatively minimal in an area of 
the country where the defense industry has provided so much for so many. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants ultimately affect a relatively tiny part of the aerospace and 
defense industry, which employs more than 300,000 Californians, many of them in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, companies are busily trying to readjust, shifting focus from 
building missiles to expanding into electronics and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a Lockheed Corp. subsidiary, normally more well-versed in 
creating Stealth planes, is developing new methods of collecting fares for 
Orange County toll roads. Hughes Aircraft Co. also is marketing transportation 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously the defense situation will get worse and firms have to be more 
aggressive in developing commercial products -- from robotics to communications 
and space research -- and marketing them," said Anil Puri, Cal State 
Fullerton's dean of economics and co-director of its economic studies unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a very slow process," he said. "Nothing is easy and defense firms 
know that. They can shrink but they can only shrink so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Public officials have their own decisions to make, chief among them what to do 
with the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. In June, an independent federal 
panel voted to close El Toro and move its 8,000-plus military and civilian jobs 
to Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing El Toro has been estimated to cost the Orange County economy some $500 
million. But those who want the land used for a new airport say it could create 
52,000 new jobs and contribute more than $4 billion to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of how the 4,700-acre base will be redeveloped, however, has been 
overshadowed by political maneuvering reminiscent of the argument over the 
shape of the conference table at the Paris peace talks of the 1970s: who gets 
the seats on the planning agency board that oversees the base planning. 
</P>
<P>
 With new membership configurations emerging almost weekly, county supervisors 
announced last month that they had agreed on a nine-member planning board -- 
all five supervisors, three members from Irvine and one from Lake Forest -- but 
the makeup has already been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-year, the new panel must be formed to begin studying options for the 
base, all of which are subject to federal environmental review. If Orange 
County officials cannot come to a compromise, the U.S. government may step in 
and decide what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a challenge here and that is to sit down and make people realize 
that we've got a whole county here and we have to make some decisions that are 
in the best interests of the whole county," said county Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley, whose district encompasses the base. "We have already lost time here and 
it's an emotional issue, but I want to get moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Another emotional issue involves the rebuilding of Laguna Beach during the 
coming year, following a fierce wildfire that consumed 366 homes in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, the city seemed to unravel on several fronts: Many 
blamed the City Council for not approving a 3-million-gallon reservoir that 
some said would have helped quell the blaze; others said a strong environmental 
push in the city had swung too far and actually helped fuel the fire by 
favoring nature over safety; a debate raged over plans to reseed the area; and 
many, crushed by the instantaneous loss of their homes in a city they loved, 
didn't know whom to hold accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tensions have eased, real issues remain and all aren't likely to be 
resolved in 1994. For instance, though the city has approved a rebuilding plan, 
many who lost their homes are discovering to their dismay that their insurance 
coverage isn't nearly enough to allow them to rebuild the same size home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Powers, a city planning commissioner and Canyon Acres resident who lost 
his home in the blaze, said he has discarded his personal timetable for 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I hit the ground running and since then, I've thrown it all out the 
window," Powers said. "I've got to figure out if I can even rebuild what I 
have. I think it would unrealistic for me to expect a lot within the next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 As the months pass, however, wounded feelings are slowly healing, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting to come to deal with each other," he said. "We are now 
becoming more solution-oriented rather than pointing fingers. Part of that 
solution is to accept the natural fate of our area. When we choose to live in 
an area like this, there will be times that man will not have control over 
nature and she is going to have her way." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous issues, such as what to do about the reservoir, are still unresolved. 
The city has approved the project, but only if it can be buried underground to 
keep a ridgeline intact. The Laguna Beach County Water District has rejected 
the compromise, insisting that the reservoir be kept above ground so it can 
provide the proper gravity to the water system. 
</P>
<P>
 While Laguna Beach contemplates its rebuilding, the city of Anaheim is 
confronting some of its own fears in 1994: namely, whether it will lose both 
its professional football team and the promised expansion of its biggest 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Rams completed their 14th season in Anaheim today but poor 
attendance and the lack of adequate revenue-producing features at Anaheim 
Stadium such as luxury boxes have prompted the team to look elsewhere, 
especially toward Baltimore, St. Louis and Memphis, three cities that were 
recently denied in bids for an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the team must give at least 15 months' notice before moving, the Rams 
will be in Anaheim for at least the 1994-95 season. But beyond that, the 
prospects look bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has attorneys looking at the legal implications of moving. The Rams' 
lease with Anaheim expires in 2015, but an escape clause allows it to leave 
provided it pays off $30 million in bonds issued to expand the stadium when the 
team moved here in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities are prepared to offer the Rams a much better financial deal than 
they now have in Anaheim. The difference in revenue between Anaheim and any of 
the other three cities from luxury boxes alone is estimated at between $15 
million and $20 million a year, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim city officials say they support the team but are satisfied with their 
financial agreements with the Rams already in place and really don't have much 
more money to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rams officials say economic conditions have changed over the past decade, 
forcing them to see what other cities have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be in Anaheim at least one more season," said John Shaw, the team's 
executive vice president. "Beyond that, a number of things can happen. We could 
stay or serve notice on the city that we intend to leave in 15 months. 
Obviously, economics and fan support are the two big issues. You can draw your 
own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim is also in a quandary of a more serious financial nature: 
the fate of Westcot, a $3-billion Disney resort plan unveiled nearly three 
years ago amid much hoopla and promises of economic rebirth for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The project cleared some impressive hurdles, including environmental and 
zoning approval by Anaheim's planning commission and City Council, and 
resolution of the most troublesome of the lawsuits filed against Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, Westcot has shown some signs of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Disney officials are requesting $800 million in public money 
for parking structures, freeway off-ramps, sewers and utility lines, which 
include a blend of federal, state and city funds. City officials have not 
determined how much they want to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, the director of the project resigned, raising new 
questions about where Westcot was headed and whether Disney was still willing 
to keep its commitment to the theme park. Top Disney officials didn't offer 
much in the way of encouragement, acknowledging that the project has gone 
slower than expected. Ken Wong, senior vice president for Disney Development 
Co. in Burbank, said, "We still don't have a project that pencils out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said that because of financial losses 
at Euro Disneyland in France, "I don't even know if there's going to be a 
Westcot. We're at a real crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler said the possible departure of the 
Rams and the potential loss or delay of Westcot are two of his top concerns, 
but securing the future of Disneyland in the city far outweighs any concerns he 
has about the football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams don't bring much dollars and cents to us," he said. "You have your 
ups and downs as a city and if we can split on these two issues -- win Westcot 
and lose the Rams -- I think we'd be coming out on top."

NEWS ANALYSIS; O.C. SHERIFF'S '93 COULD HURT AT POLLS IN '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could have been a scene from "Naked Gun," the police spoof starring Leslie 
Nielsen. Surrounded by caterwauling recruits, an exotic dancer minced and 
sashayed at the knee of a popular training officer at the Orange County 
Sheriff's Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a birthday present from the guys. No problem, except someone leaked a 
videotape of the episode to the tabloid news program "A Current Affair." It 
aired nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad press over the striptease was the least of Sheriff Brad Gates' worries 
last year while at the wheel of the county's largest law enforcement agency. 
For months, the number of controversies surrounding him seemed to grow in both 
seriousness and size. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, members of the Board of Supervisors scolded Gates for being 
inaccessible and inattentive while they grappled with proposed cuts in the 
sheriff's budget. Months later, Gates was accused of improperly lobbying to 
secure a lucrative county contract for a communications company that employed 
one of his friends and political allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, law enforcement officials and county supervisors, both publicly 
and privately, expressed dismay at Gates' decision not to join a widely 
supported gang task force in the wake of record gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, tragedy struck. Deputy Brian Scanlan shot and killed fellow officer 
Darryn Leroy Robins on Christmas Day during an impromptu training session 
behind a Lake Forest movie theater. Although other police departments require 
guns to be unloaded during drills, Scanlan had live ammunition in his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by the news media to explain what happened, the Sheriff's 
Department could not keep its story straight, creating a public relations 
headache and the impression that no one in the department knew what was going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 From frat house hi-jinks to the death of Deputy Robins, 1993 was a trying year 
for the Orange County Sheriff's Department -- one that has dented the agency's 
image and generated considerable baggage for Gates to haul into the upcoming 
election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of this will stick to the sheriff is unclear. He's politically 
resilient and no stranger to controversy, having weathered far worse attacks 
and travails during his lengthy tenure as head of the 3,000-member agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost two decades, Gates has been reelected by generous margins, except 
for 1990 when a retired Fullerton police captain garnered about 45% of the vote 
with a small campaign chest and little name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately some law enforcement officials say that in 1994 Gates might be 
particularly vulnerable at the polls should a well-known police chief from one 
of the county's bigger cities decide to challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been said before, and, so far, no strong contender has emerged. There 
had been talk of a possible candidacy by retired Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. 
Molloy. But that prospect perished with Molloy's sudden death from a heart 
attack last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad has done a very good job. I don't think there will be any opposition," 
said Eileen Padberg, a political consultant who has worked on Gates' election 
campaigns. "He takes a lot of heat and in the end he is respected in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, law enforcement officials have applauded the sheriff and his 
department for lasting contributions to the community that will forever 
outweigh the current round of negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 On the list of achievements are the sheriff's tireless campaign work last year 
to secure sales tax revenue for financially strapped public safety agencies; 
the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, a cooperative effort of local 
police agencies created in the mid-1980s to combat drugs; and the Drug Use Is 
Life Abuse program, a popular drug education effort once heralded by 
then-President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been these tough situations that have been controversial, but on 
balance I would have to say that the Sheriff's Department and Brad Gates in 
particular have had many successes this year," said Orange County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner. "To just look at Brad Gates in black and white does a 
disservice to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Some police chiefs also credit Gates for running the county jail system in the 
face of overcrowding, growing inmate violence, limited funds for new 
facilities, and federal court orders to improve living conditions for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has worked hard to try to meet on a middle ground with the competing 
factors involved in the jail," said Orange Police Chief John R. Robertson. 
"There is tremendous pressure and it takes a tremendous toll. In all this, he 
has never turned and tried to point the finger at other people. He has simply 
met the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gates' achievements might not be able to dispel the current 
perception by some public officials and citizens that something has gone awry 
within his department. How the problems are dealt with, particularly the Robins 
shooting, could be pivotal in preserving public confidence, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' difficulties began in June when his relationship with the Board of 
Supervisors grew increasingly strained amid budget talks. County officials said 
they found the sheriff so inaccessible that it stalled important deliberations 
about reductions in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baloney," Gates said at the time. "My general is the people of Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gates sparred with the board, murky allegations surfaced involving staff 
at the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. Sheriff's officials began 
investigating a complaint about the theft of firewood by department employees, 
and sexual liaisons between deputies and inmates. Two senior officers were 
transferred, but sheriff's officials at the time defended the reputations of 
the deputies and said no evidence of wrongdoing could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was triggered by a letter sent to the jail which charged 
that female prisoners were offered early releases in exchange for sex. 
Investigators say the letter was a fake and bore the forged signature of a 
local newspaper reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, "A Current Affair" confronted Gates and embarrassed his 
department with a videotape of an exotic dancer who performed in April, 1991, 
at a sheriff's training facility. An internal affairs investigation ensued, and 
the lieutenant in charge of the facility said he expected to be disciplined for 
allowing the stripper to perform. Sheriff's officials could not be reached to 
discuss the outcome last week. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a month after the videotape aired nationally, a senior county 
official said Gates had lobbied for an $80-million county contract on behalf of 
a communications company which had hired Gates' friend and political ally, Gary 
L. Hausdorfer, as a consultant. Hausdorfer is a councilman in San Juan 
Capistrano, Gates' home town. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff denied making any improper overtures during the competition to 
build a state-of-the-art radio system for all law enforcement agencies in the 
county. Also, Hausdorfer has said he never talked to Gates about his work for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most serious problems for Gates have surfaced in the last few 
weeks. First, he decided not to commit his department to the county's new 
anti-gang task force, then Deputy Robins died at the hands of Scanlan, his 
friend and fellow officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an incredibly bizarre incident. I mean, how could this have 
happened?" civil rights attorney Christopher B. Mears said of Robins' death. 
"What is Gates doing to assure and satisfy the community that this was an 
isolated, random incident? Or is it a sign of more pervasive problems? The tone 
must be set by Gates and not be lost or take a back seat to the district 
attorney's investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan, a field training deputy, apparently shot Robins in the face while 
re-enacting a traffic stop to capture a felony suspect. Sources close to the 
investigation said the shooting appears to be an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the shooting, the Sheriff's Department released little 
information about the incident, which eventually prompted some Lake Forest city 
officials to question the safety of field training. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Robins died, a sheriff's spokesman told the news media that he had 
been killed with his own gun and that no one else was involved. That version of 
the events was withdrawn the next day. Since then, Gates has declined to 
comment on the case, citing a district attorney investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-ranking county official who requested anonymity said the handling of 
the shooting by the Sheriff's Department underscores Gates' independent streak. 
The official noted that the county Board of Supervisors has not been briefed 
about the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like department policy has been totally violated. It's been 
very awkward in terms of not giving information out to the press or anyone 
else," the official said. "Gates has a reputation for always running his own 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 That independence and desire for control, some county officials say, 
contributed to the sheriff recent decision's not to join the new $2-million 
gang task force proposed by Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and widely supported 
by local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A former deputy district attorney and other public officials, who requested 
that their names not be used, say they believe Gates refused to commit any 
resources because he could not run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As others have said, I believe the sheriff has always put himself first and 
everything else second," said county Treasurer Robert L. Citron, who has 
criticized Gates in the past. "He furthers his own ego at the expense of 
everything else. He alone cost this county $3 million in legal fees and court 
settlements three to four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who worked on the gang proposal, was referring to several civil rights 
lawsuits that accused the sheriff of improperly issuing concealed weapons 
permits and bringing spurious criminal charges against a critic of his 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated phone calls to his office in the past week, Gates could not 
be reached for comment. But he has said in the past that the new gang program 
would duplicate what his department is already trying to do in some of the 
cities it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Robins shooting and other perceived problems with the Sheriff's 
Department, some say that Gates might not be at fault. What is important, they 
say, is how the sheriff addresses the situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the public understands how difficult it is to run the type of 
operation he runs," Chief Robertson said. "Some of the things that have 
occurred occur in society at large. We hire human beings and human beings make 
mistakes. As the head of a large law enforcement agency, there are many things 
you cannot foresee, and many things are beyond your control." 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg, Gates' longtime supporter, blamed human error and bureaucratic 
problems for the release of incorrect information about the Robins shooting. 
Law enforcement officials also say that confidentiality is required when the 
district attorney investigates an officer-involved shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what he can do to have an effect on some of these things except 
to properly investigate the matters," Padberg said. "I think he has done that. 
I think he has handled things appropriately."

BADGERS CAME AS FANS, LEAVE AS LITIGANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You had all kinds of ticketless Wisconsin stalwarts outside the Rose Bowl on 
Saturday: those who got lucky, those who paid up and those who slinked off to a 
big-screen sports bar somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There were even a few who vowed to wait until the game ended so they could 
sneak in to watch the Badger band give its traditional "5th quarter" 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 They had one thing in common, however, besides their jaunty red and white 
outfits: Just about everybody was as mad as a rabid badger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Heitzinger was one of the angriest. He was the one walking around the 
parking lot with the sign proclaiming: "The Granddaddy of Them All -- Greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of Wisconsin fans left without tickets by the overselling of 
the 80th Rose Bowl game, Heitzinger arrived in Southern California a football 
fan but is leaving a litigant. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitzinger, who owns an electronics store in Racine, has organized 27 couples 
to sue Last Chance Travel of Mt. Joy, Pa., which he said failed to deliver 
tickets that had been the central component of a $900 three-day tour package 
that brought them here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lied to us all week at our hotel in Anaheim," Heitzinger said. "At 5 
a.m. today when we got on the bus to come up to the Rose Parade, they told us 
they had no tickets for us. When we arrived in Pasadena, a scalper got on the 
bus and told us he wanted $250 each for tickets. He knew just where we would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could be reached for comment Saturday at Last Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, Heitzinger and his wife, Linda, grudgingly paid $100 each for two 
70th row, end-zone seats, with a face value of $46 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Badger faithful bit the bullet and paid more. Many coughed up $200 a 
seat and some shelled out up to $400. In California, it is a misdemeanor to 
scalp tickets on the grounds of a stadium without permission. Still, hundreds 
of such sales were openly consummated. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the anger and near-desperation of many Badger fans, scalpers were 
not always able to command outrageous prices. 
</P>
<P>
 When a budding entrepreneur offered Ann and Carl Peters of Green Bay tickets 
at $250 a pop, she snapped at him and offered a lecture worthy of the ones her 
minister husband delivers from his pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be stubborn, but it's matter of right and wrong," she declared. "I'm 
not paying scalper's prices." 
</P>
<P>
 By kickoff time, however, there were a few happy endings. Consider Ken 
Siedenburg of Milwaukee, who arrived at the Rose Bowl with seven friends, 
displaying a homemade sign headlined "The Hose Bowl," which excoriated three 
travel agencies that allegedly stiffed him and his pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "People dropped out of heaven on us," bestowing one free ticket and six others 
at or near face value, Siedenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, well after kickoff, there were still hundreds of Wisconsin fans 
plaintively pacing outside the stadium, holding up one, two, three or four 
fingers, indicating the number of tickets they needed. "I'll give you two for 
$300," whispered one scalper. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more than $100 each," said Mike Finley, an assistant district attorney 
from Madison. He pointed to his small portable television and said: "I'm going 
to see the game whether I go in or not." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wendy Segal really needed to get into that stadium. She had bought three 
tickets from a New Jersey ticket broker for $225 apiece two weeks ago. On 
Friday afternoon, she was told it would be $650 apiece or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wisconsin was about to score its first touchdown, she was still searching 
for that rare commodity, a scalper with a conscience, while lamenting: "My son 
Scott is in there playing the trumpet for Wisconsin and I'm out here."

FLOATS, FIREFIGHTERS TOP 'FANTASTIC ADVENTURE'; ROSE PARADE: FLORAL CREATIONS 
DELIGHT CROWDS. CREWS THAT SAVED HOMES FROM FALL WILDFIRES GET BIGGEST 
REACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 There were hoots for the horses, jeers for the Wisconsin cheerleaders and 
cries of "Beam Me Up Scotty!" to the man who has boldly gone where no one has 
gone before. It was the firefighters, though, who brought the crowd along 
Colorado Boulevard to its feet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 105th time that the rollicking Rose Parade has turned Pasadena into 
a flurry of flowery floats. Covered with 19 million carnations, 11 million 
roses, 56,000 orchids, nine tons of onion seeds and 500 pounds of glue, the 56 
floats included a space station hovering above, a dinosaur hauled by humans and 
a sky diver plummeting from a plane with a broken chute. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of fantasy, cows, a goat and a rooster swooped through the air above 
a farmer in an imaginary barn. A genie rose magically from a sculptured lamp 
with a bird in one hand and a jeweled scepter in the other. A grove of towering 
bonsai trees rolled by, with purple butterflies flapping their wings on the 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking in the spectacle were hundreds of thousands of onlookers, treated to a 
picture-perfect first day of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament of Roses Grand Marshal William Shatner, who played Capt. James T. 
Kirk on the "Star Trek" series, left his Starship parked in another galaxy. 
This day, he wore a Stetson hat and buckskin coat and sat atop a prize-winning 
saddle horse whose tail was so long it dragged along the 5.5-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade's "Fantastic Adventure" theme spilled over onto the sidelines as 
well, where a stretch of grandstand buckled but did not fall, and nearly 200 
people were arrested -- more than twice last year's total -- in a police 
crackdown on marshmallow-throwing, Silly String-spraying and other revelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The glitches, however, were few. No floats toppled. Batons landed safely in 
their throwers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the quietest, smoothest parade I've seen," said parade spokesman Ken 
Veronda, who has seen more than 40 of them. "Everything went almost as 
planned." 
</P>
<P>
 A bagpiper from the Canadian Massed Pipes and Drums Band got lost at the 
chaotic finishing area and missed her bus. She was later reunited with the 
bagpipers at an Orange County hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse carrying a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy slipped on horse 
droppings along the parade route and threw the unidentified deputy to the 
ground. The horse was unhurt and the deputy -- who was patrolling the area, not 
participating in the parade -- was treated for "a superficial scalp wound," 
said a department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle's "Thrills, Chills and Spills" float overheated but was quickly 
repaired. It featured a pilot plummeting 40 feet from the wing of an airplane 
into a cloud of chrysanthemums. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles, which has been entering floats in the parade longer 
than anyone else, saw its "Planting for the Future" harvest scene run out of 
steam in the final stretch and become the only float that had to be towed to 
the end. Luckily for the city's image, the engine trouble happened away from 
the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had more glorious moments earlier in the parade. City firefighters 
who marched alongside the float became crowd favorites as they revived memories 
of the heroic battle by emergency personnel during the recent Southern 
California fires. As they filed by the judge's grandstand in uniform, the 
firefighters received a roaring tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for saving my house!" one woman yelled from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before dawn, the all-nighters chugged champagne from the bottle and 
bundled up next to bonfires to endure temperatures in the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the Willowridge High School Mighty Eagle Band of Houston 
opened the parade at precisely 8:05 a.m., the weather had warmed up and would 
eventually reach parade standards -- sunny skies, light winds, highs in the 
70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were freezing but the parade makes it all worth it," said Jeanette 
McDonald, 15, of Mission Viejo, who spent New Year's Eve sleeping next to a 
freeway off-ramp to get a prime viewing spot. "This is for the memories, and 
they will last my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 There were bitter memories for the 194 people cited by police for public 
drunkenness, assault and, mostly, violating a new city regulation that 
prohibits throwing items such as marshmallows or using aerosol string spray. 
Another 48 people had their cars towed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we took a lower tolerance to the drunkenness in public," Pasadena 
police spokeswoman Janet Pope-Hinton said. "We really cracked down. It may 
sound silly but some people don't like marshmallows thrown at them. It can 
start something more serious -- like a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The usual crush of protesters must have watched this parade at home, along 
with the estimated 300 million around the world connected by satellite. There 
was a lone preacher with a megaphone telling onlookers that the devil lurked in 
their souls. An airplane flew overhead with a message criticizing some Pasadena 
officials. The most common sign: "I Need Tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers avoided an embarrassing "counter-parade" that threatened to steal 
some of their thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition Against Racism called off its action just a month before the big 
day when the Tournament of Roses agreed to diversify its executive committee, 
whose membership has been all white and male for its entire 99-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators had blocked traffic and staged a candlelight vigil in front 
of Tournament House in recent months and leaders had threatened to "bring the 
Tournament to its knees" if it did not integrate the policy-making body. 
</P>
<P>
 As one pressure tactic, the Los Angeles City Council had voted to withdraw the 
city's float from the 1995 parade if the tournament failed to include 
minorities and women in its top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eleventh-hour agreement -- which named two African Americans, a Latino 
and an Asian American to the committee -- avoided a New Year's Day controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have stopped the parade, interrupted it and embarrassed them in the 
eyes of the world," said one of the protest leaders, Danny Bakewell, who 
watched the parade on television Saturday. "Thankfully for all, we worked it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 At this parade, the attention was focused on the floats. China Airlines' 
"Spectacular Taiwan" featured a dragon that towered above the buildings along 
the way and spouted steam from its nostrils. It won the Judges Special Trophy 
and raves from the crowd. The Sweepstakes Trophy for outstanding floral design 
went to (who else?) FTD Florists. Unocal's 55-foot-long genie float, titled 
"Make a Wish," took the Directors Trophy for outstanding craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed in with the floral displays were roller-skating clowns, miniature 
horses, hula dancers and 21 marching bands. Jan Fair had her eyes out for one 
band in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a trombone player she was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Maria math textbook writer has been cheering her son's trombone 
performances since he was in the elementary school band playing at the Elks 
Rodeo before a few hundred people. On Saturday, Eric was playing before the 
largest audience of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 As the UCLA marching band approached the corner of Fair Oaks and Colorado just 
after 9 a.m., his mom shouted "Here he comes. Here he comes," and the 
spectators all around her joined in with "Eric! Eric! Eric!" 
</P>
<P>
 Looking very spry despite having been camped out all night on a lawn chair, 
Fair jogged several blocks down Colorado, photographing every member of the 
band with her camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a movie Eric will be able to give all his friends," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Long before the football game even started, the Bruins and Badgers were 
battling it out on the streets, exchanging insults, gibes and dire 
end-of-the-game predictions. The Badger cheerleaders were particular targets, 
prompting a chorus of boos from UCLA fans. The partisanship even extended to 
the vendors: "Programs, $1! . . . $2 for Badgers!" one yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Their wrists twisting just so, Rose Queen Erica Beth Brynes and her royal 
court floated along atop a chariot of roses, gladiolus and Cattleya orchids. 
Their dresses and float came from Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 At ground zero, so close they could smell the parade, were Tim Gary and Linda 
Conti, a brother-and-sister volunteer team charged with cleaning up the horse 
manure at the parade's first crucial turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfitted in white jumpsuits, Gary had a shovel and Conti had a broom. Both 
wore running shoes. After all, they had a lot of work to do with 30 equestrian 
units, made up of several hundred horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing," Conti said, pointing to the odorous plastic bag at her 
side. "Last year, they had elephants." 
</P>

 Rose Parade floats will be on display today near Pasadena's Victory Park from 
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. For the handicapped and senior citizens, a special viewing 
period is offered from 7 to 9 a.m. The viewing area is near Sierra Madre 
Boulevard and Paloma Street.

UCLA FUMBLES AWAY ROSES; IS FLORIDA ST. NO. 1?

 UCLA played the role of generous Rose Bowl host to a fault Saturday as 
Wisconsin, making its first Pasadena appearance in 31 years, held off a final 
Bruin charge for a 21-16 victory before 101,237 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State staked its claim to the national championship as the Seminoles 
got a 22-yard field goal from Scott Bentley with 21 seconds to play and 
survived a wild finish for an 18-16 victory over previously unbeaten Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had six turnovers -- five fumbles and one interception -- and two of 
those errors led to Wisconsin touchdowns. But the Bruins still had a chance to 
overcome their mistakes in the final minute, driving inside the Wisconsin 20 
yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 15 seconds left and the Bruins out of timeouts, UCLA quarterback 
Wayne Cook scrambled up the middle instead of throwing the ball away. Time 
expired before the Bruins (8-4) could run another play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers (10-1-1) were led by running back Brent Moss, who rushed for 158 
yards and a pair of first-half touchdowns. J. J. Stokes, UCLA's All-American 
receiver, set Rose Bowl records with 14 receptions for 176 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games, West Virginia saw its 11-0 record go down the drain in a 41-7 
Sugar Bowl loss to Florida. Notre Dame edged Texas A & M in the Cotton Bowl, 
24-21.

COLUMN ONE; UNEXPECTED FRIEND ON DEATH ROW; MEXICO IS GIVING MONEY, LEGAL AID 
TO HELP DEFEND ITS CITIZENS FACING EXECUTION IN U.S. OFFICIALS CITE MORAL 
CONCERNS, PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT HAS MADE SOME CONDEMNED MEN INTO FOLK HEROES 
SOUTH OF BORDER.

<P>
 Attorney Scott Fouser had wondered how he would ever get the resources needed 
to file appeals on behalf of Aurelio Barajas, 33, a Mexican national sentenced 
to die in Idaho for the vicious murder of a convenience store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the blue in November, Mexican government officials called to offer 
whatever he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've already hired an investigator," Fouser said. "And they're flying me 
to Mexico, where I'll have a room, meals, car, interpreter and driver and meet 
with people who know Aurelio's background." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barajas case is just one example of a new, aggressive effort that Mexico 
is making on behalf of its 22 citizens on Death Row in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, which outlawed capital punishment in 1929, wants to help the inmates 
win new trials or have their death sentences commuted, said Laura Espinosa, 
deputy consulate in Salt Lake City. This could help the inmates take advantage 
of existing extradition treaties and serve out life sentences, which in Mexico 
typically last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine an American in a small town in Mexico accused of killing someone," 
Espinosa said. "We are going to use the same force the United States would in 
such a case to help one of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a nation that has long been accused of flouting the human rights of 
Americans incarcerated there is turning the tables -- and getting results. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid intervention of Mexican officials was partially responsible for 
persuading a Kentucky judge in May not to apply the death penalty in the case 
of two brothers convicted of a 1992 murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government also played an active role in postponing the execution 
of Ricardo Aldape, 31, who was sentenced to die in September, 1992, in Texas 
for killing a Houston police officer 10 years earlier. Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari even sent a letter to Texas Gov. Ann Richards requesting 
clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is also helping the California Appellate Project find lawyers 
to represent Ramon Salcido, 32, who is on Death Row in San Quentin for the 1989 
murders in Sonoma of his wife, four children, mother-in-law and employer. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, officials of Mexico's Commission on Human Rights and Foreign 
Relations Department interviewed these and other Death Row inmates in 
California, Arizona, Texas and Idaho with the aim of helping defense lawyers 
and Mexican consuls conduct investigations on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts are causing deep resentment among American officials who see this 
as ideological meddling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Supreme Court has said this is a constitutional type of punishment 
for a certain classification of crime," said Dane Gillette, state coordinator 
for capital litigation in California, which has 10 Mexican citizens on Death 
Row -- the most of any state. "We're not punishing people for race or 
nationality, or sentencing people to death for spitting on the sidewalk. These 
are heinous crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho Solicitor Gen. Lynn Thomas complains that "we have enough trouble being 
outmanned by anti-death penalty organizations mounting campaigns against us. 
Now, we have to put up with foreign governments bankrolling the opposition with 
unlimited resources." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger, Thomas said, "is one of mounting a public relations campaign that 
distorts the facts -- that's what happens when powerful special interests get 
involved in a case." 
</P>
<P>
 Fouser disagreed: "I told the Mexican officials to do everything they feel is 
appropriate in the Barajas case. Public relations campaigns? Go for it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials would not reveal how much they have spent on such cases, in 
part, they say, because costs are virtually impossible to calculate. For 
example, background investigations inside Mexico are conducted by local and 
national law enforcement authorities as part of their regular duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say they are making a full-scale effort to "prevent a Mexican citizen 
from receiving the death penalty," said Espinosa, who has become an 
administrator of Death Row appeals for Mexican nationals in the Rocky Mountain 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials say they are resuming a long tradition; in the 1920s, the 
Mexican consulate successfully pressured California to commute the death 
sentence of a Mexican minor and lobbied for state legislation prohibiting the 
execution of children. 
</P>
<P>
 This most recent surge is simply a reflection of timing, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-year gap, the death penalty was reinstituted in the United States 
in 1976. Most such cases take at least 15 years to wind through the courts. So, 
only recently have Mexican citizens in death penalty cases begun to face 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 And working with such prisoners, Mexican officials say, has convinced them to 
get involved earlier in the sentencing and appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Hernandez of the consulate office in El Paso said his country is 
compelled by a moral imperative to aid countrymen convicted of capital crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's involvement in such cases, he said, can help ensure that the inmates' 
human and civil rights are not violated, and that all available legal resources 
are exhausted before an execution takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the consulate offices in the United States have received instructions to 
follow these premises," Hernandez said, "not only with death sentence cases, 
but with all our nationals incarcerated in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, only military personnel are subject to the death penalty; not even 
military courts have carried out executions for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials also cite studies showing that in the United States, the 
poor and minorities are more likely to be executed. Indeed, many Mexicans 
believe some of their countrymen on Death Row are victims of racism and that it 
is hard for Mexican nationals in capital cases to receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The March execution of Ramon Montoya in Huntsville, Tex., was the top story in 
the Mexican press for weeks before and days afterward. Montoya, 38, was 
convicted in the January, 1983, shooting death of a Dallas police officer. His 
last words -- "Well, God help you" -- were faithfully reported along with the 
detailed saga of his death by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of Montoya's execution, riot police surrounded the U.S. Embassy in 
Mexico City to protect it from citizens and human rights groups demonstrating 
against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he was given a hero's burial in Mexico, complete with mariachi escort 
to the cemetery and telegrams of condolence from top government and church 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have several reasons to be wary of Mexico's involvement in 
American death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Luis Aviles, who had been convicted of killing a Houston taxi driver 
four years earlier, was returned to Mexico in a prisoner-exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1988, he was paroled and re-entered the United States illegally. In 
December of that year, he was arrested in Riverside in connection with another 
murder. Aviles, 34, is now on Death Row in San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, MariClair Acosta, director of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and 
Promotion of Human Rights, sees an irony in Mexico's campaign against the U.S. 
death penalty while abuses of civil liberties exist within its own legal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not opposed to (the Mexican effort to save its citizens on U.S. Death 
Rows); I just do not understand it," Acosta said. "We are more worried about 
what is happening inside the country. There are serious cases of human rights 
abuses here that deserve the government's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa, the consular official in Salt Lake City, said: "In Mexico, I know 
there is corruption and torture. It's true. I'm not denying it. But over the 
last five years we have tried to eliminate these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Some human rights activists say the Mexican government's efforts really don't 
amount to much. Francis Boyle, a professor at the University of Illinois' 
College of Law at Champagne-Urbana, said President Salinas should seek 
international hearings to decide whether either country should put citizens to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, a member of Amnesty International, the London-based human rights 
organization, says that right now, Salinas is "just posturing, throwing money 
at a problem to avoid taking a serious political step to save the lives of 
Mexicans on Death Row." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, such cases have become rallying points for anti-death penalty 
groups in the United States and for government officials in Mexico, who have 
come under increasing public pressure in that country because of stories such 
as Ricardo Aldape's. 
</P>
<P>
 In that highly publicized case, Aldape was convicted of killing Houston Police 
Officer James Harris in 1982. His defense attorney, Scott Atlas, said the 
Mexican government "flew me to Mexico, took care of accommodations and lined up 
character witnesses. They also flew one of the witnesses up here for a hearing 
and arranged for my client's parents to come here and visit him." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas maintains that another man, Roberto Carrasco, shot and killed Harris. 
Carrasco died in the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldape's name is now sung in sad Mexican ballads on both sides of the border 
and his picture is emblazoned on T-shirts that say: "Soy Innocente" ("I Am 
Innocent"). 
</P>
<P>
 The Idaho case of Aurelio Barajas is less well known in Mexico, but Fouser, 
with the support of Mexican officials, hopes to change all that. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 7, a Payette County jury found Barajas guilty of first-degree murder 
in the June, 1992, slaying of Fruitland, Ida., store clerk Sherill Jean 
McDonald. Her throat was slashed with such force that a pathologist could see 
her vertebrae. The jury based its verdict on evidence that included a butcher 
knife discovered in Barajas' car with traces of McDonald's blood on it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fouser questions the adequacy of Barajas' trial defense, as well as citing 
language difficulties and possible mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pre-sentencing hearing, Barajas' original defense attorney, John Gatchel, 
argued that his client did not disclose an alibi until the second day of trial. 
As a result, the lawyer said, he did not have enough time to investigate the 
alibi or locate and interview witnesses who could support it. 
</P>
<P>
 In that alibi, Barajas said the knife did not belong to him and that he had 
loaned his car to an acquaintance on the night of the murder, according to 
court documents filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatchel also argued that Barajas had displayed signs of paranoia and 
persecution and might be mentally incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 District Court Judge Gerald L. Weston dismissed the alibi argument and added 
that Barajas was found to be free of "depression, anxiety and loss of contact 
with reality" during a three-hour examination by a court-appointed 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, Fouser said, the psychologist did not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas shrugged off Fouser's assertions, saying: "There is no such thing as a 
perfect proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Did any of these things undermine our confidence in the 
validity of the finding of guilt? The answer is no. The evidence was 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Barajas was transferred from the Idaho Maximum Security 
Institute's Death Row to a medical facility where he was being treated for 
possible psychotic behavior, Fouser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas was returned to Death Row last Monday. He refused to eat, claiming 
that his prison meals were laced with poison by "people out to get him," Fouser 
said. Barajas was also seen drinking water out of the toilet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to determine whether these symptoms are a new onset or if there is a 
history of them," Fouser said. "Since I don't know of any Hispanic 
psychologists in the state of Idaho, I may ask the Mexican consulate about 
finding one who's bilingual." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa calls the case a "frame-up of an innocent man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get him a new trial," Espinosa said. "If he is taken off Death 
Row and given a life sentence, he may be able to complete it in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McMurdie, chief counsel of the appeals section of the Arizona attorney 
general's office, defended Mexico's interest in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of Mexico helping these Mexican nationals -- in some respects 
it will save the state of Arizona some money" in defense attorney's costs, 
McMurdie said. But he also suggested that the Mexican government may be 
grasping at straws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe the Mexican nationals we have on Death Row deserve to be 
there," he said. Mexicans on Death Row in U.S.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON CABINET: MORE STUMBLES THAN SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a briefing in the wood-paneled solemnity of her conference room, Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno read a quotation from Abraham Lincoln: "If I were to read 
everything bad everyone said about me, I might as well close up shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months ago, such displays of candor and probity were lifting Reno to 
unexpected stardom in President Clinton's Cabinet. Now, although still popular, 
she is also fighting a rear-guard action against critics in Washington who 
question her leadership and loyalty to the President's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has company in adversity. Blessed with talent and equipped with 
gold-plated resumes, many of the members of the Clinton Cabinet nonetheless 
have failed to meet the expectations that had been set for the first team of 
Democrats to move into Washington's top jobs in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In their debut year, some members of the Cabinet have proved successful, 
rising in stature and influence. Many others, however, have tripped and 
stumbled in the performance of what is admittedly a difficult assignment: 
helping to shape new national agendas at a time of skimpy resources, shielding 
their President from embarrassment or unwanted controversy and helping sell 
Administration policies to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying all this is a political reality that Cabinet members of all 
administrations, and particularly this one, must eventually face: the real star 
of the show is the President himself. In Clinton's case, it was probably 
inevitable that the White House would reserve for itself key decisions on such 
major issues as health care, economic policy, trade and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet members form a supporting cast whose role is to stay just out of the 
limelight, not to share it. And, to switch metaphors, they must serve as the 
President's downfield blockers, shielding him from political attack and, at all 
cost, never ever getting in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the failure to master this difficult ground that last month opened the 
trapdoor beneath Defense Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aspin was the first to exit, plenty of his colleagues are in difficulty: 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, unable to formulate a crisp and coherent 
post-Cold War policy for a President who is preoccupied with domestic problems; 
Reno, too independent of the White House and, worse, too popular in her own 
right; Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, out of step with the younger 
generation in the White House; Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, under 
scrutiny for his dealings with a Vietnamese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that the Cabinet stars who have the best chance of distinguishing 
themselves are those whose orbits are furthest from Clinton's sun -- those 
whose goals are not so dear to his heart that they invite his constant 
attention. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is one; Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros may be another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some White House aides, asked to pick the Cabinet's stand-out performers, 
name second-tier deputies before those at the traditional core agencies of 
Treasury, State, Defense and Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Cabinet secretaries have labored under the additional handicap of 
functioning with many senior appointed positions unfilled. The Defense, Justice 
and Commerce departments are the hardest hit -- only 10 of Commerce's top 28 
jobs are filled, for example -- and nearly half of appointed positions are 
still vacant overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretaries have also run into competition from some who are not legally 
Cabinet members, though deemed by Clinton to be of Cabinet rank. Leon E. 
Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget who was in the 
doghouse last spring for a burst of candor on the Administration's setbacks, 
has consolidated power as genial chief wielder of the budget cleaver. Another 
Californian, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, has distinguished himself 
fighting for the twin international trade treaties that have unexpectedly 
ranked high among Clinton's first-year accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look shows the progress and frustrations of the Cabinet's first year. 
Treasury: Bentsen Works to Increase Visibility 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. "I've been part of the action," the former 
senator asserts these days, but the words may only underscore his failure to 
become the foremost voice on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 This traditional role of the Treasury secretary has quietly migrated to Robert 
E. Rubin, head of the National Economic Council, the coordinating apparatus 
that operates under the White House eaves. OMB's Panetta is more influential in 
some areas of economic policy and Bentsen's second in command, Roger Altman, is 
personally closer to the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's difficulty is partly style: the 72-year-old Texan has not taken to 
the graduate-dorm style of policy-making that now dominates in the White House. 
Notable by his absence from public events for several months, he dissented on 
some key decisions, including Vice President Al Gore's broad-based energy tax. 
More recently he has been markedly unenthusiastic about financing plans for the 
health care reform scheme. (He couldn't bring himself to handle the lead-off 
congressional testimony for the plan, sending Altman instead.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bentsen's influence was crucial in persuading Clinton to stick with the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. And now the talk is of his efforts to 
increase his visibility, rather than retire with his memories to South Texas. 
State: Christopher Dogged by String of Bad Reviews 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Corporate lawyer and Clinton confidant, 
Christopher is so meticulous that he has been known to take pages of 
handwritten notes to cocktail parties to ensure he would not lack for 
well-informed small talk. But that preparation was not enough to enable 
Christopher to make silk purses of the President's intentions in Bosnia, 
Somalia and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's reviews hit bottom in May, when he swung through Europe asking 
the allies to back a plan to support the Bosnian Muslims. The Europeans snubbed 
the plan, and the sorry episode marked one of the few times since World War II 
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have not gone along with the 
United States on a matter of policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has also seen a leaching of some of his powers. Amid grumbling 
about Christopher's communications skills, Gore has stepped into a more visible 
role as foreign policy spokesman, while other officials are gaining influence 
on Russia, China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's apologists say, with some justice, that Daniel Webster himself 
would have stammered with the brief this secretary of state was handed. They 
say that much credit is owed him for holding together the Middle East peace 
negotiations. Justice: Reno Charms Public, Pains White House 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. The former Dade County, Fla., prosecutor relieved 
Clinton's headache from the withdrawal of nominee Zoe Baird, but lately she has 
been causing the White House shooting pains nearly as often as relieving them. 
</P>
<P>
 After her public relations masterstroke of accepting responsibility for the 
muffed April assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., she drew 
criticism for weak efforts on behalf of the Administration's anti-crime bill, a 
top priority. Each month she demonstrated with ever more painful clarity her 
differences with the President's views on crime fighting, including his top 
campaign pledge of adding 100,000 more street cops and his support for 
mandatory minimum sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her administration of the department has brought criticism; Webster 
Hubbell, the agency's No. 3 official, "talks to the White House a lot more than 
she does," said one Clinton aide. An outside adviser calls the attorney general 
"a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is still missing 14 top appointees, including senior officials for 
civil rights and environmental enforcement. Reno has taken steps to increase 
sharply the flow of public information and begun overhauling the Justice 
Department's internal investigation mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 With many Americans charmed by her classroom field trips and earnest talk of 
fighting crime's root causes, her mail is still running three times as heavy as 
her predecessor's. Health: Shalala Getting Hang of It After Some Miscues 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Service Secretary Donna Shalala. A leader of the 
Administration's liberal wing, Shalala advertises her independence from 
neo-Democratic dogma with the confidence born of her friendship with First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. "I don't much like the term 'new Democrat,' " she said 
in a recent speech. But those ties have not always guaranteed her a seat at the 
banquet of power, nor has it fully cushioned her bumps after some embarrassing 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 What might have been her biggest role, as the voice of health care reform, has 
been taken over by the Clintons and their war-room general staff. On welfare 
reform, the policy-drafting power seems to be flowing through her top aides but 
mostly around her. One top congressional aide compared her role to that of 
Secretary of State William P. Rogers while Henry A. Kissinger strode the 
diplomatic stage as President Richard Nixon's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Former university president Shalala was given flunking grades by many for two 
congressional appearances where she appeared ill-prepared. She had the poor 
timing to float a value-added tax proposal on April 15; later, she let slip 
that 40% of Americans would pay more under the Clinton health care reform, 
setting off a convulsion of White House clarifying and backpedaling. "She was 
responsible for a few (running) news stories we could have done without," said 
one White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shalala has also succeeded in selling a cost-reducing vaccination program, 
persuaded the White House to spend more on a variety of health programs and 
apparently fought off White House efforts to fill her staff with appointees she 
called "amateurs." Some say she is getting the hang of it. Labor: Most of 
Reich's Ideas on Hold in First Year 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. Some of his 1972 Yale law classmates thought 
the well-spoken Reich was more likely to be President than drawling Bill 
Clinton, and Reich's abilities have served him well in changing the profile and 
agenda of his backwater agency. Still, the former Harvard University 
professor's ideas have been largely delayed until the second year of the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has caused consternation among Clinton's economic aides by espousing 
ideas that conflicted with other plans in the pipeline. Some aides blanched at 
his talk of a fat payroll tax to finance worker training; his call for a 
higher, inflation-indexed minimum wage stepped on Administration claims that 
employer-paid health insurance could substitute for such a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 One outside Clinton adviser said that Reich's White House ratings and access 
"plummeted" after his espousal of the failed economic stimulus program and 
plans that could be termed tax-and-spend orthodoxy. But some insiders insist 
that his light burns bright. Commerce: Allegation Has Cast Cloud Over Brown 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. Promoted early as a star-to-be, 
lawyer-lobbyist Brown has already broadened the Commerce Department's export 
promotion efforts and launched a domestic industrial policy program to foster 
technology industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's progress was stopped dead last fall by an allegation that he was 
paid by a Vietnamese businessman to lift the U.S. trade embargo against 
Vietnam. Brown denies the charge, and little has been heard from a federal 
grand jury in Miami in months. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown continues to flash his unfailing smile, the White House 
confessed its worries -- an unusual signal during a grand jury investigation. 
The cloud forced Brown to take a lower profile on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, lest he become a target for its foes. More recently he has engaged 
in a whirlwind of appearances, perhaps aimed at demonstrating that he lives. 
</P>
<P>
 People who follow the Commerce Department say its more severe problem is that 
only 10 of 28 top-level appointees have been confirmed. This, trade lawyers 
say, has confused outsiders and, by leaving policy-making in civil servants' 
hands, tilted policy in some areas in a protectionist direction. "Call it 
'uninventing government,' " said one trade expert. Interior: Babbitt Is a 
Winner Even Without Triumph 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. The White House considers the former Arizona 
governor a major public relations resource. Yet he has no clear-cut policy 
triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Northwest logging dispute, Babbitt and the Administration reached a 
split-the-difference decision, but some environmentalists and the timber 
industry are already plotting new court challenges. On the feud over mining and 
grazing fees on public lands, Clinton shot down one Babbitt plan and Western 
lawmakers fought the second to a standstill in Congress. Babbitt is preparing a 
third and says, with understatement, that the battle "has been a bit more 
complicated than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if his solutions are messy, Babbitt can leave a permanent mark if he can 
demonstrate that environmental regulation does not have to be a dead-end of 
conflict and interminable litigation. Housing: White House Is Sweet on Cisneros 
</P>
<P>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. When a homeless 
woman died across the street from his office last month, the former San Antonio 
mayor spun it into a publicity blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros, long a media master, has also slept in a New York homeless shelter 
and denounced racism in Vidor, Tex., a city notorious for its segregationist 
attitudes. All this helped shame the White House into giving him $823 million 
more to fight homelessness. But budgeters will cut other HUD programs and 
Cisneros has struggled with Congress. His agency, a swamp of corruption in 
recent years, still needs an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recognition is winning Cisneros important points with Democratic 
constituencies Clinton needs to keep happy as he presses a more centrist 
agenda. The housing secretary, who has had a cologne named after him, smells 
very sweet to the White House just now. Veterans: So Far, So Good for Jesse 
Brown 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown. If the Administration fails to ease 
strains with veterans, it won't be because Brown hasn't tried. A former 
employee of the Disabled American Veterans organization, he has hewed to the 
veterans groups' party line on just about every substantial issue, and they are 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen how prominent he will be in health care reform, and 
where his loyalties will lie if the Administration wants to cut the agency's 
spending. EPA: Browner Masters the Technical Points 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner. On her 38th 
birthday recently, Browner received a photo from Clinton of the two of them and 
other luminaries with a handwritten inscription. Here she was again, it said, 
explaining technical points to senior officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining, unfortunately, is about all this former Gore aide has done to 
date. She has been largely occupied with reorganization and housekeeping chores 
at a time of budget cuts and growing workloads. But then, it's tough to stand 
out when you're part of a swarm of environmental officials that also includes 
Babbitt and "Big Green" Gore himself. Transportation: Pena Allays Fears, but 
Record Is Thin 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. Clinton made some aides very uneasy by 
choosing Pena, the largely untested former Denver mayor, in the final hours of 
his Cabinet selection process. Those fears have been allayed: "He's not a 
disaster," said one outside adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his record to date is thin: His plan to help the merchant marine was 
torpedoed; his attempt to unscramble the international airline landing-rights 
question is stalled; and it was a White House aide, not Pena, who ended the 
American Airlines flight attendant strike just before the Thanksgiving rush. 
Education: Riley Leads Agency Into the Background 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. Sincere and sophisticated, Riley has led 
a second-tier agency to near-invisibility. He reformed the college loan program 
and, with his Carolina-inflected Democratic rhetoric, brought smiles to the 
education Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency has been largely ignored by Riley's friend Clinton and by the 
outside world as well. Riley has surprised some observers by acquiescing in 
House Democrats' efforts to water down school performance standards. 
Agriculture: Espy Sets About Plowing a New Path 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. An early Clinton supporter, Espy has been 
praised for his efforts in Washington state's food contamination crisis and 
Midwest flood relief. He has shifted the agenda a bit, stressing rural 
development and nutrition programs over traditional farm programs. By contrast,

On the Agency Itself 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. The former utility executive got pummeled in 
early reviews for her weak grasp of the agency's work. But she lately has found 
a useful adversary: the 20,000-employee agency itself. O'Leary has won wide 
notice for denouncing the department's Cold War-era secretiveness, including 
its concealment of plutonium experiments on humans. When Cable News Network's 
Larry King said in an interview that O'Leary had been "discovered," she 
replied: "It's about time."

CLINTON CALLS FOR ACTION ON SOCIAL ISSUES; LEGISLATION: IN RADIO ADDRESS, 
PRESIDENT PUTS HEALTH CARE, CRIME, WELFARE AND JOB TRAINING AT TOP OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION FOR '94. DOLE SAYS GOP WILL WORK WITH HIM WHERE POSSIBLE.

<P>
 President Clinton sketched out his agenda for the new year on Saturday, 
calling for action on his health care, crime, welfare and job training 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In a radio address taped Friday at this seaside resort and broadcast to the 
nation on Saturday, the President also spoke of the nation's sense of community 
and the obligations of its citizens to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "For too long, we've been coming apart rather than coming together," he said. 
But "in 1993 we've begun to reverse that, and I'm grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to preview his goals for the coming year, predicting that his 
health care reform plan would pass in 1994 and calling it "a good deal for our 
families and our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that he planned to begin creating a system of lifetime education and 
training, he declared that a first step would be an education program that 
begins by "setting high standards for our public schools and challenging every 
state to meet them." 
</P>
<P>
 The House and Senate have each passed separate bills to create voluntary 
academic standards for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to his developing welfare reform proposal, Clinton stressed its 
emphasis on work and responsibility, saying: "Those who can work should do so. 
And both parents must take responsibility for their children because 
governments don't raise children, parents do." 
</P>
<P>
 He also called on Congress to pass an anti-crime bill that would put more 
police officers on the street, ban assault weapons and stiffen sentences for 
violent repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the President said: "Let us resolve to improve the health security, 
the personal security and the job security of the American people who work hard 
and play by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving the Republican response, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
promised the GOP would work with Clinton where possible but said no health care 
plan has enough support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need a different plan taking the best ideas, if any, from all the 
proposals, but without price controls, employer mandates, mandatory health care 
alliances and massive overdoses of government control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Saturday, in comments to reporters, Clinton indicated he has been 
closely involved in the Administration's effort to uncover more details about 
the federal government's radiation experiments on humans in the 1940s and 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he has already had conversations with his staff about the 
disclosure program, which has been led by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to meet now and assess where we are with the information and where 
to go next," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has summoned staff members from the Energy Department, the 
Defense Department, the Veterans Affairs Department and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration to a meeting Monday to coordinate the 
release of information on the tests. Although not scheduled to attend those 
sessions, the President left open the possibility that he might participate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last week, O'Leary has said that as many as 600 people were involved in 
800 experiments to determine the effects of radiation on human beings. She has 
also claimed that federal agencies were involved over the decades in efforts to 
cover up the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown announced an investigation 
to determine whether any patients in VA hospitals were involved. Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin previously called for a search of military files for more 
information on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his family have been spending the New Year's holiday at this 
island resort to attend the annual Renaissance Weekend, a gathering of some of 
the nation's leading figures that features off-the-record panel discussions 
about personal and public policy matters. The First Family is scheduled to 
return to Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's own new year apparently got off to a painful start. At a golf outing 
early Saturday, he complained of soreness and asked for aspirin to ease 
discomfort brought on by a 90-minute touch-football game on the beach Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was tackled hard during the game, slapped in the face by a 
bouncing football, and twice relegated to the bottom of a pile of bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The football was "too much," he told reporters Saturday. 'I'm pretty stiff 
today, guys, but plugging away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons spent New Year's Eve listening to a Renaissance Weekend panel 
talk about its foremost gripes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the stroke of midnight, the participants cried "Happy New Year!" But then 
they turned not to merry-making but back to the seminar topic at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the approximately 1,000 weekend participants held hands and sang songs 
that included "God Bless America," "Auld Lang Syne," "Oklahoma" and a tune from 
the Broadway musical "Annie." The Clintons left for their borrowed beachfront 
home by 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After golfing Saturday morning, the President spent the afternoon at seminars, 
socializing and watching football. On Saturday night, he was to address the 
full group with a talk entitled "What I Have Learned." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a group of panelists gave Clinton unsolicited advice on missions 
they hope he will accomplish during his presidency. One member of the 
Renaissance Weekend group, which includes more than a sprinkling of the very 
wealthy, told Clinton he should go easier on the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including some teen-agers, told the President that he needed to do 
more about guns and violence in schools. Clinton listened politely, 
participants said, but had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its intellectual endeavors, the President's visit has given him an 
opportunity to pursue sports with a selection of the rich and celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 In his football game Friday afternoon in front of the Hyatt Regency hotel, 
Clinton was joined by former Miss America and TV personality Phyllis George. On 
his team was Rep. Marjorie Margolis-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.), who cast a key vote for 
Clinton's economic plan last summer. Their team was a winner this time as well; 
they came out ahead two touchdowns to one. 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday's golf outing, Clinton was joined by Harvard University 
management expert Michael Porter, sports broadcaster Dick Schaap and sports 
doctor Rod Mortenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton dined with retired tennis pro Stan Smith on Thursday night at Smith's 
glass-sheathed home in the walled Hilton Head subdivision of Spanish Wells.

AFGHANISTAN RINGS IN THE NEW YEAR WITH HEAVIEST FIGHTING IN 6 MONTHS; VIOLENCE: 
HOSPITALS REPORT EIGHT DEAD AND 250 INJURED. WEEK-OLD CEASE-FIRE IS ANOTHER 
CASUALTY OF CIVIL WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Afghanistan's armed rivals rang in 1994 with the heaviest fighting in Kabul in 
more than six months, showering hundreds of rocket and artillery shells onto 
the divided, battered capital Saturday despite a cease-fire signed a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The two main hospitals in the city reported that eight dead and 250 injured 
had been brought in since the bombardment began at dawn, the British news 
agency Reuters reported. But heavy fighting prevented many injured from seeking 
assistance, and the total casualty toll was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 After first light, the rattle of firearms echoed through streets deserted save 
for tanks and armed men. Plumes of smoke marked the landing spots of shells and 
rockets, which rained down especially heavily on northern and eastern 
neighborhoods of the city ringed by the rugged Hindu Kush. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year and a half since Muslim rebels took power from the Communists, 
internecine fighting in Afghanistan has left at least 10,000 people dead, many 
of them civilians. In Kabul, buildings and much of the infrastructure left 
unscathed by 14 years of civil war have been devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 The major combatants have been troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani 
and forces aligned with Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In a statement 
released in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar, Rabbani claimed that 
Hekmatyar has now joined forces with Abdul Rashid Dostum, a powerful 
ex-Communist general, to try to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists want to undo the fruits of the jihad (holy war)" fought by 
U.S.-backed Muslim insurgents against the Soviet-supported Najibullah regime, 
presidential spokesman Bahauddin Ziayi told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 That development could have serious implications indeed for Rabbani, for whom 
Dostum's support has been crucial. The general, with relatively few men and the 
handicaps of being an ethnic Uzbek and a former Communist to boot, has few 
chances to emerge as supreme leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dostum holds much of northern Afghanistan and is believed to be strong 
enough to bar anyone he opposes from winning control of the country. It was his 
eleventh-hour defection to the guerrillas that helped topple President 
Najibullah in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Dostum, based in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, had ordered his troops to stay 
out of the bloodletting as rival factions in the guerrillas' coalition 
government warred for control of Kabul. But he was said to have given orders 
for an offensive after jets belonging to a Rabbani ally bombed his positions in 
northern Afghanistan on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from Kabul said Dostum's fighters fired salvos of rockets and 
artillery shells from an ancient fort south of Kabul's center. Pro-presidential 
forces, meanwhile, shot back from a hilltop in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three buildings were hit in the Soviet-built Microrayon housing 
complex in the northeast of the city where many pro-Dostum families live. Since 
the fighting broke out, Kabul has been divided into a crazy quilt of 
neighborhoods held by rival factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziayi, the presidential spokesman, asserted that government soldiers captured 
300 rebels, five tanks and Kabul's airport, formerly controlled by Dostum's 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Hekmatyar, Haji Farid, said the onslaught was part of an 
Islamic rebellion against Rabbani's government. He claimed anti-presidential 
fighters had taken Kabul radio, the Finance Ministry, a strategic bridge on the 
outskirts of the capital and the central committee hall, next door to the 
presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side's claim could be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire announced by the Afghan Cabinet a week ago was the latest in a 
string of dozens of truce agreements that failed to hold.

IRA FIREBOMBS HIT 11 BELFAST-AREA STORES; ULSTER: DAMAGE IS IN THE MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS. ATTACKS, LOYALIST WARNING ARE NEW BLOWS TO LATEST ANGLO-IRISH PEACE 
BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eleven stores in the Greater Belfast area were hit Saturday in a firebomb 
blitz that caused millions of dollars in damage. The Irish Republican Army 
telephoned news media to claim responsibility for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of fires in and around Belfast broke out minutes into the New Year. 
At the height of the blazes, firefighters from five nearby towns were called on 
to help. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Incendiary devices ignited fires in food, clothing and appliance stores, as 
well as warehouse outlets and Belfast's Linenhall Library, authorities said. Up 
to 200 workers could lose their jobs because of the damage, they estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks were preceded by a warning from the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a 
Protestant paramilitary group. It asserted its right to "respond militarily" in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of bombings and the announcement by the Protestant group represented 
new blows to the peace hopes for the troubled province that were raised by the 
Downing Street Declaration signed Dec. 15 by British Prime Minister John Major 
and his Irish counterpart, Albert Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 That declaration invited all the parties in the conflict over Northern 
Ireland's union with the United Kingdom to lay down their arms and negotiate a 
cease-fire, to be followed by a vote in which residents of the province could 
express their preferences about its political status. It specifically raised 
the possibility of reuniting the province with the rest of Ireland if voters 
wished it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Protestant paramilitary group, which opposes any talk of linking the 
province to the Republic of Ireland, criticized the declaration in its 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is widely agreed that the declaration, despite its grand claims regarding 
consent freely given, is part of a wider agenda and once again ignores the 
reality that the status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom was 
substantially changed with the imposition of the Anglo-Irish diktat ." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement accused the British government of abdicating its 
responsibilities to protect Northern Ireland and its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, declared, "It 
was inevitable that the IRA would continue the violence. In the loyalist 
community, people have come to the same conclusion as the loyalist paramilitary 
organization, namely that the Downing Street Declaration was an attempt to con 
people in Northern Ireland, particularly in the unionist community, that there 
was a way to end the cycle of violence by paying a price to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are now seeing that terrorists will always ask for more and that all 
the concessions made to the IRA have been made to no avail." 
</P>
<P>
 Belfast's mayor, Reg Empey, described the incendiary blitz as a "cynical 
exercise on behalf of the IRA because they know that people, when it comes to 
the New Year, are always looking forward to something better than they have 
just experienced."

INDIAN PEASANTS IN SOUTHERN MEXICO STATE STORM 4 CITIES, TOWNS; CASUALTIES 
REPORTED; LATIN AMERICA: 'ZAPATISTA LIBERATION ARMY' SAYS IT IS PROTESTING 
ABUSES BY AUTHORITIES. REBEL PULLBACKS REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of armed Indian peasants attacked four cities and towns in the 
southeastern state of Chiapas on Saturday. At least three police officers were 
killed and 18 were wounded, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned Televisa network said the rebels, who called themselves 
members of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, unleashed the attacks a 
few hours after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Televisa's correspondent in the area said San Cristobal de Las Casas, the 
state's second-biggest community with 80,000 residents, and the towns of 
Ocosingo, Altamirano and Las Margaritas were stormed. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports said Saturday afternoon that rebels were still holding at least 
parts of three of the communities. They reportedly withdrew from Ocosingo, and 
police were said to be guarding it. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, the rebels in San Cristobal de Las Casas had pulled back and 
concentrated in the city's downtown area, where they occupied the mayor's 
office, a resident there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica Suarez, a 25-year-old teacher, said the city's two radio stations 
were off the air. But all was quiet otherwise, and people were out and about as 
usual, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement by the Chiapas government at the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez 
said about 200 people, most of them of Indian origin, "carried out acts of 
provocation and violence" in the four communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement mentioned no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement faxed to the news media, the Zapatista Army of National 
Liberation said thousands of armed men and women seized San Cristobal de las 
Casas at around 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista Army said it was protesting alleged abuses by Mexican 
authorities against Lacandon Indians in the region. It said the group had 
"declared war" on the federal army and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The communique did not detail grievances. But it declared, "For (the 
government) it doesn't matter that we possess nothing, absolutely nothing, not 
a home, not land, not work, not education." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is named after Emiliano Zapata, a leader of the 1910-20 Mexican 
Revolution who defended the right of poor peasants to free land seized from 
wealthy landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lacandon and other Indian peoples in Chiapas have long been feuding with 
the state government and federal authorities, usually over land. 
</P>
<P>
 The indigenous people have complained their land is being swindled away from 
them and their traditional way of life is slowly being destroyed by Western 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas is one of the least developed and most violence-prone states in 
Mexico. Peasant uprisings and land disputes have occurred there for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's attack was the first violence bearing any sign of organization. 
</P>
<P>
 All three police officers were killed in a gun battle with the rebels in Las 
Margaritas, the government news agency Notimex said. The agency quoted 
witnesses as saying the rebels roared into Las Margaritas in eight trucks and 
stormed a hall where most of the townsfolk were celebrating the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth person was found dead of a bullet wound in San Cristobal early 
Saturday, but the Red Cross said it wasn't sure if the man's death was related 
to the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 There were unconfirmed reports of two other civilian deaths.

ISRAELI TROOPS IN GAZA WOUND 5 PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli troops shot and wounded five Palestinians in disturbances Saturday in 
the occupied Gaza Strip, and they beat reporters and photographers covering the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops arrested two youths in Palestine Square in central Gaza City after 
an army patrol had been stoned and hit with a firebomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of one of the youths grabbed a chair from a cafe and attacked a 
soldier, beating him on the head with the chair and screaming, "My son, my 
son!" 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier opened fire, but the youth's mother wasn't injured. Hospital 
officials said five people were treated for bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 An army officer identifying himself only as Camille told eight journalists who 
were sitting in the cafe observing the incident to get out, saying the area was 
a closed military zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers under Camille's command beat the journalists with rifle butts. They 
briefly detained a cameraman and confiscated the identity cards of all the 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalists later recovered their cards from Gaza police. Palestinians 
traveling in the occupied lands without identity cards are subject to arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The army spokesman's office confirmed the events. The spokesman, who cannot be 
identified under military regulations, said the disturbances justified closing 
the area to journalists. He said the journalists resisted leaving, which is why 
their identity cards were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalists did not resist but rather were beaten as they were told to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nablus in the occupied West Bank, celebrants shooting in the air slightly 
injured three Palestinians during festivities commemorating the founding of 
Fatah, Yasser Arafat's mainstream wing of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, on Jan. 1, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said 6,000 celebrants followed a marching band from central Nablus 
to An-Najah University campus, where masked men shot in the air, wounding three 
observers who were standing near upper-floor windows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in 
December, 1987, that Fatah marked the day with celebrations and not a strike, 
reflecting the new atmosphere following the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But that atmosphere has been marred by Israel's missing a Dec. 13 deadline to 
pull out of Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho as part of the accord.GAZA

ZHIRINOVSKY THREATENING TO DESTROY GERMANY, PAPER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
 Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, angry that he was denied a 
German visa, threatened the destruction of Germany through World War III should 
he come to power, a German newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Foreign Ministry spokesman would not confirm details of the Welt am Sonntag 
report, but he said that Zhirinovsky, through his reaction at the airport in 
Sofia, Bulgaria, on Wednesday, had further disqualified himself "as a 
discussion partner." 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry said Zhirinovsky criticized Germany at Sofia's airport after Bonn 
barred him from entering the country on the grounds that his presence could 
harm German state interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Welt am Sonntag, quoting a confidential report by Bonn's embassy in Sofia, 
said Zhirinovsky also threatened to return 300,000 Russian troops to eastern 
Germany and demand stifling war reparations from Bonn should he get the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry spokesman, reading a statement, said, "At this occasion, he 
expressed himself negatively about Germany, made threats and insulted an 
official of the German Embassy personally." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Germany emphatically rejects these attacks. In addition to his 
earlier statements, Zhirinovsky through these remarks further disqualifies 
himself as a discussion partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky originally planned to fly from Sofia to Berlin but had to change 
his plans after Bonn blocked his entry. He was left fuming in the Sofia 
airport's VIP lounge after the Moscow flight was canceled because of an 
unofficial pilots' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic Party polled strongly in last month's 
first post-Soviet elections, has dismayed Russian reformists and Western 
governments alike with wild calls for restoration of the Russian empire and 
aggressive comments about neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago he threatened to drop nuclear bombs on Germany if it interfered 
in Russian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Welt am Sonntag, without providing full quotes, said the diplomatic report and 
a tape recording showed that Zhirinovsky threatened Germany with "World War 
III" and its "complete destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 The article, released ahead of publication today, said the ultranationalist 
would not complete the Russian pullout from former Communist East Germany 
should he come to power. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60,000 Russian military personnel and family members are still stationed 
in eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow, which once had 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany as the 
spearhead of the Warsaw Pact, will withdraw all its soldiers by August as part 
of international agreements accompanying German unification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky said he would return 300,000 troops to eastern Germany to back up 
additional reparation claims from World War II that would make Germany "a poor 
country," the article said.

UKRAINE TO OFFER MOSCOW A DEAL ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS; DISARMAMENT: KIEV IS SET TO 
SEND WARHEADS TO RUSSIA AS SOON AS IT CAN BE 'PAID' WITH REACTOR FUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Ukrainian government is prepared to start transferring nuclear warheads to 
Russia as quickly as Moscow can compensate it with fuel for its atomic energy 
reactors, this country's chief arms negotiator says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Premier Valery Shmarov outlined Ukraine's position in an interview Friday 
as he prepared for disarmament talks in Washington this week with Russian and 
U.S. officials. The three-way talks are focused on Ukraine's conditions for 
giving up nearly 1,800 warheads inherited from the Soviet Union, a top priority 
of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of Russian claims on parts of its territory, Ukraine has balked at 
complying with international treaties to surrender the arsenal, saying that it 
first needs guarantees of security and material compensation. Mistrust between 
the two former Soviet republics has derailed several agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last month did the United States become involved in the talks, and that 
produced an immediate concession when Ukraine announced that it was 
deactivating 20 of its SS-24 missiles, the most sophisticated weapon in the 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, however, Shmarov indicated that those missiles, which carry 
a total of 200 warheads, were due to be dismantled anyway for periodic 
maintenance and might be reassembled unless Ukraine gets "an adequate response" 
from Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that at the talks this week Ukraine will press a formula that would 
help solve Ukraine's most pressing problem, a severe energy crisis that has 
reduced heating in homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will give Russia weapons-grade uranium (in the warheads) in return for 
nuclear reactor fuel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Ukraine agreed on such an exchange in September, without setting a 
timetable, but the deal quickly fell apart. On one side, Russia insisted on 
getting all the warheads by 1997 and spreading out fuel deliveries over 20 
years. On the other, Ukraine balked at pledging to turn over all its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 To build mutual confidence, Shmarov said he will propose what amounts to a 
trial swap of a token number of warheads for the equivalent in nuclear fuel. If 
the swap is agreed to and is completed simultaneously, that would "give us 
certainty" that Russia will compensate Ukraine for the entire lot of warheads, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will initial, maybe even sign, an agreement on this subject in 
Washington," the negotiator said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned that any agreement must be ratified by Ukraine's Parliament, 
which declared in November that the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty known 
as START-1 applies to just 36% of Ukraine's warheads. At the same time, he said 
President Leonid Kravchuk is committed to "full disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine would like the United States to disarm some of its nuclear missiles in 
return. But Shmarov did not pose that as a condition, saying only, "If we take 
off 10 weapons, be so kind as to reduce 10 weapons that are now aimed at us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been unenthusiastic about that proposal. Even 
so, Shmarov gave Washington credit for an apparent breakthrough in the talks 
since then-special U.S. presidential envoy Strobe Talbott, now deputy secretary 
of state, met here Dec. 16 with him and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy 
Mamedov. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine announced four days later it was deactivating the 20 missiles, and a 
flurry of diplomatic activity followed. Kravchuk flew to Budapest for talks 
with Vice President Al Gore and met later with Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin to lay the groundwork for the talks starting Monday in Washington.

'BOOZE BANDITS' THREATEN NATIONAL INDUSTRY, BRITISH PUB OWNERS SAY; COMMERCE: 
CROSS-CHANNEL TRIPS TO BUY LIQUOR, BEER, WINE ARE SAID TO ROB TREASURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pub keepers call them "booze bandits" and warn that their cross-Channel 
activities threaten the national brewing industry. Liquor store owners say 
these passengers on "booze cruises" are eroding their profits. The government 
claims these shoppers are costing the treasury as much as $750 million a year 
in vanished taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just who are these scofflaws? They're ordinary British citizens with a taste 
for the grape and a willingness to take advantage of the first year of the 
European Union's single market. They're doing so by buying liquor, wine and 
beer by the case -- and often by the 175-case pallet -- at dirt-cheap prices in 
French ferry ports like Calais and Dunkirk. They then haul the bottles and cans 
in vans and cars back by ferry to England. 
</P>
<P>
 Under European Union rules, citizens may buy unlimited quantities of liquor 
for "personal use." But just what constitutes "personal" use remains something 
of a mystery -- to be decided by customs agents in Dover, Folkestone and other 
Channel ports. 
</P>
<P>
 As a customs official puts it: "Our guidelines suggest that someone may bring 
in more than a normal amount, if they can prove they are holding a family party 
by showing us the invitations or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 What has caused the shopping boom along the French coast -- the spree peaked 
over the holiday season with an estimated 1 million Britons making the Channel 
crossing -- is cheaper French-bought wine, liquor and beer; the price 
differences are mainly attributable to much lower national taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-can case of Stella Artois beer that costs $31.50 in Britain goes for $8 
on French shelves; a liter of gin that sells for $22.50 in England costs $16.50 
in France; wine is available in Calais at half the price in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 One big-spending British customer in Calais claimed to have saved almost 
$4,000 on his bill after loading up a van at a huge liquor store outside town 
called Eastenders (named after the English television soap opera). The Calais 
Chamber of Commerce says 13 million gallons of beer flowed back to Britain in 
1993, representing a quarter of the total beer market in all of Northern 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has proved a bonanza to British boozers has riled British brewers, 
publicans and liquor store proprietors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimate that 10,000 pubs could go out of business because of French 
competition," said Catherine Chenery, spokeswoman for the Brewers' Society. 
"That's one out of six by the end of the century. We have lost about $375 
million in sales this year alone." The British Wine & Spirit Assn. estimates 
that wine sales in Britain are down by 10% this year with sales off by some 
$740 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Meale, a Labor member of Parliament, warned after a recent inspection 
trip to Calais: "If this isn't stopped, every pub in Britain and every brewery 
in Britain will close down, and we'll all be sipping beer from little glasses 
in wine bars at 2 pounds ($3.50) a go." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem as British brewers and merchants see it is Britain's high taxes. 
While British brewing production costs are the second lowest in the European 
Union (next to Portugal), its taxes are the second highest (after Ireland). "We 
tax beer at 31 pence per pint," Chenery of the Brewers' Society said. "The 
French tax at 4 pence per pint." 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials take a calmer view of the tax rates, though the treasury is 
dropping -- by some estimates up to $750 million yearly in lost taxes. But they 
predict that liquor and beer taxes will be lowered, as occurred in Denmark when 
Danes flocked to Germany to buy cheaper beer and schnapps. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials suggest that British brewing profit margins are much higher 
than those on the Continent and that the beer industry could cut back on 
profits to become more competitive. Competition is why, they say, Continentals 
come to Britain to buy clothing and other items that are bargains by European 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs agents are trying to crack down on canny British Channel crossers who 
load up with booze, which they then sell in Britain on the black market to pub 
keepers, stores and friends; this is supposed to be an illegal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brewers' Society consultant estimates that a "booze-cruiser" with a 
medium-sized van could clear $1,500 a day, buying beer for $4.50 per 24-bottle 
case and selling it in Britain for $10.50. 
</P>
<P>
 While many in Britain and France welcome the opening of the Channel tunnel 
this year, Peter Lewis, director of the Wine & Spirit Assn., complains of the 
opportunities for dedicated booze shoppers: "It will only exacerbate things 
further."

36 MISSING AS SHIP SINKS OFF CANADA; ACCIDENT: GREEK AND PHILIPPINE CREW 
MEMBERS ARE LOST IN STORMY SEAS NEARLY 1,000 MILES EAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND. 
LIGHTS, BUT NO SURVIVORS, ARE SEEN.

<P>
 None of the 36 Greek and Philippine crew members of a freighter that 
apparently sank in a North Atlantic winter storm had been found shortly after a 
ship came on the scene Saturday to search for survivors, the Canadian Coast 
Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bahamian tanker Freja Sveia, which arrived on the scene where the 
Liberian-registered Marika had sent out a distress signal, reported finding 
lights in the water but no crew members, Coast Guard spokesman Don Bedell told 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 900-foot iron-ore carrier left Sept Iles, Quebec, on Monday bound 
for the Netherlands and hit 30-foot seas 935 miles east of Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bedell added that the ship had carried several lifeboats and there was a 
chance that survivors could be found, although the rough conditions would make 
rescue difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian Coast Guard Hercules aircraft was also on the way to the area to 
search for survivors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier flight by a Coast Guard Hercules had seen lights bobbing in the 
water where the ship had sent out distress signals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Lloyd's Casualty Reporting Service quoted "St. John's radio" as 
saying that the ship had sunk in bad weather and that life rafts and survivors 
were in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's reported that the 900-foot-long freighter was built in 1973. It was 
operated by Atlantic Maritime Enterprises SA in Piraeus, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 All vessels in the area were requested to proceed to the area to render 
assistance, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedell cautioned that any rescue operation would be very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those kinds of stormy seas a rescue of any sort will be pretty rough," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the tanker comes to lower its rescue boats, they could be easily smashed 
against the hull of the boat because of the waves and winds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, a cargo ship sank in heavy seas off Nova Scotia, drowning 32 crew 
members.

REVELRY AND TRAGEDY ABOUND AS THE WORLD WELCOMES 1994

 Hundreds of thousands of French greeted 1994 by spraying champagne along the 
Champs Elysees, and U.S. and Vietnamese jazz musicians celebrated with a jam 
session in Hanoi. But the New Year's jubilation also left plenty of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, a man was blown apart when fireworks stuffed in his pockets 
exploded. Two other Italians were shot to death during street celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people were killed in shootings and stabbings in the Philippines. A gunman 
in Belgium, complaining about loud music, opened fire in a dance hall, killing 
a young woman and wounding two men. A 91-year-old man in Berlin died in a fire 
in the final minutes of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, at least 114 people died and more than 200 were wounded from New 
Year's Eve through the first hours of 1994 in violent incidents, suicides and 
accidents in the nation's three biggest cities. Police attributed the violence 
to excessive drinking by revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 New Year celebrations were more peaceful elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan started the festivities with peals of bells at temples and shrines. And 
Japanese toasted the gods with sweet rice wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Even North Korea's hard-line Marxist leaders unbent a little, staging what was 
called a "grand celebration" at a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Vietnamese jazz musicians greeted the new year with an 
old-fashioned jam session in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, hundreds of thousands of revelers -- half a million, according to 
radio and newspaper estimates -- flocked to a champagne-drenched celebration on 
the Champs Elysees. Revelers sang, toasted and swung from lamp posts. 
</P>
<P>
 The corks also popped in Spain, where thousands of Spaniards converged on 
Madrid carrying bottles of champagne and bunches of grapes, which were 
hurriedly consumed as bells tolled for midnight. Hours of drinking followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, police said 90,000 party-goers disregarded warnings to stay away 
from Trafalgar Square, where last year 100,000 gathered and 42 people were 
injured. Only three minor injuries were reported by police, who barred alcohol 
and fireworks from the square. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rio de Janeiro, at least 3 million people watched a display of 20 tons of 
fireworks over Copacabana Beach in what tourism officials billed as the world's 
largest outdoor gathering in history. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manila, appeals from officials failed to stop Filipinos from greeting the 
New Year with fireworks and gunshots. Radio stations said six people died from 
stabbings and gunshot wounds and 31 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 723 people have been treated for fireworks-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Liege, Belgium, a man armed with a rifle opened fire in a dance hall at 4 
a.m. during a New Year's party. A 19-year-old woman hit in the chest later 
died. Two other revelers were injured. Police arrested the man as he tried to 
flee.

 Times readers recently were asked to gaze into their crystal balls and offer 
their predictions for the biggest challenges, personal and civic, of 1994. Not 
surprisingly, crime, jobs and education figured prominently. Some readers also 
proposed detailed solutions. Below are excerpts from the taped TimesLink 
messages and faxes received over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that the major issues in Orange County are getting guns off the 
street, reducing the violence and supporting education in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Hoy, Laguna Beach, 56, Irvine Valley College professor 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of the 'us'-versus- 'them' mentality in Orange County -- 
Residents versus immigrants, developers versus environmentalists, rich versus 
poor -- and I'd like to see greater unity and a more complete sense of 
community for 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Litton, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County will have a lot more crime than we had this year, so I would 
like to see a lot of emphasis on crime. All cities (should) join forces and 
increase police presence. More search-and-seizures. A crackdown on gang 
members. Unless we do that, it will not be a safe county." 
</P>
<P>
 Fares Batarseh, Anaheim, 35, sales manager for a bakery 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1994 year (will give us) the opportunity to reach out to all segments of 
the population and also to make sure that the 40% of the population that is 
minority is fully integrated and becomes a player in everyday life in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Amezcua, Santa Ana, 43, attorney 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that crime and jobs will remain the watchwords for the year ahead, 
both for government and in our personal lives. Gangs and the mayhem and the 
loss of life they cause will unfortunately worsen our social fabric. As time 
goes on, gang violence becomes more of an accepted fact of life than a disease 
befitting eradication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs and their creation and retention will continue to be the other main 
source of concern. So many changes have occurred in 1993 with the passage of 
NAFTA and the loss of so many defense-related jobs that new and innovative 
ideas will need to come to the fore." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Baker, Anaheim, 42, operations analyst 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest 1994 challenge is education. Past programs have failed. Reason? 
Sex-education classes of the 1960s and '70s have failed to reduce the teen-age 
pregnancies. Pregnancies have actually increased. Discipline, ethnic problems, 
manner of dress, drugs, gangs and individual student safety . . . need 
improvement. Families with these concerns should be free to place their student 
in another school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The backbone of this program would be that no felon would be released to the 
streets until they get provided with proficiency in reading and writing," he 
said. The land could also be used to build a reform school for at-risk youth in 
addition to housing for the homeless, he said.

NEW MAYORS VOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER IN 3 MAJOR CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the nation's biggest and most troubled cities began 1994 with new 
people in the mayor's office, all of them vowing to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani began work on a program to make the nation's 
largest city safer.Detroit's Dennis Archer set about remaking a city ravaged by 
crime, budget problems and a poor national image. In Pittsburgh, Pa., Tom 
Murphy said his city needs a top-to-bottom turnaround to attract new business 
and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani, a Republican who defeated Democrat David N. Dinkins, New York City's 
first black mayor, said he would add police foot patrols to ensure the safety 
of students walking to and from William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx. 
It was one of the most violent schools in the city, with 72 criminal incidents 
reported last school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, Archer succeeds Coleman A. Young, who is suffering from emphysema 
and did not seek reelection after five consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit faces a potential budget deficit of $88.5 million, an eroding 
population and business base, too much vacant housing and a crime rate that 
remains high despite recent drops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a lot of energy to give us the world-class city we want. 
I'm excited about the challenges I face," said Archer, a former state Supreme 
Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's new mayor is a steelworker's son whose plans call for a break 
with the industrial past and bold steps into a new generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy has said he plans to develop vacant riverfront properties and expand 
high-tech industry. He wants riverboat casinos to lure gamblers and an expanded 
artistic and cultural community to bring tourists to town.

 Human polar bears greeted the New Year with heart-revving dips in icy surf 
Saturday, but millions of less adventurous people parked it on sofas and curbs 
to watch strutting Mummers and a stream of football games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island was a virtual hotbed of people braving frostbite by going 
swimming in freezing temperatures: Rhode Island Sound was the arena for the 
Polar Bear Plunge; the 6th Annual New Year's Day Pier Plunge sent people 
running across Narragansett Beach and into the ocean; Salty Brine Beach at 
Galilee had a third annual winter swim, and Jamestown called its limb-numbing 
swim the Penguin Plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Think that's a passing fad? This is the 75th anniversary year of the Icebergs 
Athletics Club, which does its New Year's Day paddling in the Atlantic Ocean 
surf off New York City's Coney Island. More than 100 members of that and two 
other clubs took the plunge Saturday in water that read only in the 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea didn't appeal to everyone. "I'll take the Caribbean any day," Lisa 
Tumminia said as she watched her boyfriend walk into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 members of Philadelphia social clubs took their golden slippers 
to the streets and celebrated the new year in the 94th Mummers Parade of 
sequins, feathers and marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thrill is to see the smiles on the kids' faces," said Carl 
Searle, a security guard and member of the Oregon Mummers. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade started with the "comic clubs" poking fun at President Clinton and 
other public figures and progressed to the fancy division featuring elaborate 
mini-floats each powered by a single parader.

U.S. FLIERS BELIEVED HELD BY LAOS AT VIETNAM WAR'S END; EVIDENCE: NEW DATA 
INDICATES AS MANY AS 41 U.S. PRISONERS WERE NOT RELEASED. OFFICIALLY, ONLY TWO 
AMERICANS WERE KNOWN TO BE IN CUSTODY. 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From a huge archive of documents about the Vietnam War declassified in recent 
months, new evidence is emerging that some American pilots held prisoner in 
Laos were not released at the end of the war, and that U.S. intelligence 
officials might have known where some of them were. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department lists 330 Americans, almost all pilots and crew, as 
missing in action in Laos. Most were certainly killed when their planes crashed 
in the remote jungles of the mountainous, sparsely populated country. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, only two American fliers, Col. Charles Shelton and Lt. Col. David 
Hrdlicka, are known for certain to have been alive in custody of pro-communist 
Pathet Lao rebels. Shelton and Hrdlicka died in captivity in the 1960s, 
Pentagon officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But declassified documents from the State Department, the Central Intelligence 
Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency provide some support for those who 
argue that the number of prisoners was considerably higher, perhaps as high as 
41 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some military intelligence specialists and prisoner of war activists have 
believed for years that U.S. prisoners may have been left behind in Laos. 
Senior officials of the Richard Nixon Administration, in anguished testimony 
before a Senate committee in September, 1992, acknowledged that they feared it 
was true at the time but said they decided then there was little they could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 591 Americans released by North Vietnam in "Operation Homecoming" in 
1973, only nine had been captured in Laos, and those nine were in custody of 
the North Vietnamese, not the Laotians. None had been held by the Pathet Lao in 
areas of northeast Laos where, according to some intelligence documents, groups 
of downed U.S. fliers were kept prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the negotiations with North Vietnam that produced the Paris Peace Agreement 
and ended U.S. involvement in the war in January, 1973, Nixon's national 
security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, repeatedly sought assurances from the 
North Vietnamese that they would deliver all U.S. prisoners "throughout 
Indochina" in the postwar prisoner exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States never acknowledged officially participating in a war in 
Laos, and Laos was not a party to the Paris accord. U.S. negotiators believed, 
however, that the Pathet Lao communists were, in Kissinger's term, "stooges" of 
the North Vietnamese and would deliver their prisoners if ordered to by Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials were shocked when only nine were delivered from Laos, according 
to declassified documents and testimony at the 1992 hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence S. Eagleburger, then a senior Pentagon official and later secretary 
of state in the final months of the George Bush Administration, wrote in a memo 
to his then-boss, Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson, that after the last 
of the acknowledged prisoners had been released, the United States should stage 
a "demarche," or diplomatic initiative, on the Laotians about the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This initiative should plainly and forcefully assert that the U.S. will no 
longer play games with the POW issue in Laos," said the memo, written a week 
before the final prisoner release. The Laotian communists "should be told that 
we have reason to believe they hold additional U.S. prisoners, and we demand 
their immediate release, as well as an accounting and information on all those 
who may have died." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, in an address to the nation at the conclusion of Operation Homecoming, 
said: "All of our American POWs are on their way home." Later in the same 
speech, he said provisions of the Paris agreement regarding Laos "have not been 
complied with," but he did not indicate there might still be U.S. prisoners 
there. Several times in the next few months of 1973, he repeated that all 
prisoners had come home. 
</P>
<P>
 But the declassified documents show there was intelligence information that 
the Pathet Lao held some U.S. fliers in caves near Pathet Lao headquarters in 
Sam Neua, in northeastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by a House committee in 1976 how it could be that none of more than 300 
Americans lost in Laos could be a prisoner, Vernon E. Walters Jr., then deputy 
director of the CIA, replied in writing that "this question has been very 
disconcerting to the intelligence community also. We have information that some 
of these 300 individuals survived their shoot-down incident. Admittedly, the 
number is small." 
</P>
<P>
 If any of the intelligence information were correct, the apparent conclusion 
is that some men were abandoned to their fates when the last U.S. troops left 
Indochina, unless the Pathet Lao killed them, as some U.S. officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the documents supporting this view: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A January, 1973, CIA listing of "confirmed enemy prisons" in Laos, with 
locations. Several of these carry descriptions of the likely inmates: "American 
prisoners," "American pilots (possibly 20)," "approximately 15 American 
prisoners" and "American pilots (possibly in a cave.)" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minutes of a Washington interagency meeting, about the same time, in which 
the Defense Department representative is recorded as saying: "We don't know 
what we will get from Laos (in postwar prisoner exchanges.) We have only six 
known prisoners in Laos, although we hope there may be 40 or 41. We have known 
very little about the caves where they keep the prisoners in Laos. We just got 
the first photos of those caves recently and our impression is they are pretty 
big. We think they are holding a lot more than six prisoners there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Defense Intelligence Agency account of a Laotian communist soldier, 
described as "cooperative . . . intelligent . . . sincere . . . has a good 
memory," who entered a cave in northeastern Laos in March, 1972, to replace the 
batteries in a field telephone. There, he said, he encountered three American, 
four Thai and four royalist Laotian prisoners, all said to be healthy and 
adequately fed. They had books and a guitar for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 1970 CIA report saying that "until recently, the Ban Nakay Neua VH 1965 
(a location designation) prison complex was the only prison facility in Laos 
known to contain American POWs." Ban Nakay Neua was the region of northern Laos 
where prisoners were believed to have been held in caves. None of the Americans 
released from Laos in Operation Homecoming had been held there, so what 
happened to the prisoners "known" to have been in the caves? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 1992 deposition given to Senate investigators by Bobby Ray Inman, 
President Clinton's nominee to be secretary of defense and a senior naval 
intelligence officer at the time of the 1973 prisoner releases, in which he 
testified that "in '73 a large number of us thought there were (prisoners in 
Laos), simply because we had known people had gotten to the ground, that there 
were substantial prisoners in Laos that were unaccounted for." 
</P>
<P>
 Inman added, however, that he later changed his opinion. When none of those 
men ever surfaced or was found, he said, he decided that either the original 
assumption of their safe landing was incorrect or the Pathet Lao shot the 
prisoners rather than keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the files is a 1992 CIA memo saying that "photographs taken by a 
reconnaissance aircraft in October, 1969, show what may be as many as 20 
non-Asians accompanied by Pathet Lao guards near caves" at Ban Nakay Neua. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a reference to the "volleyball photos," a subject of furious 
disagreement in the intelligence and MIA activist community since their 
existence became known almost a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To the untrained eye, these aerial photographs of a jungle clearing appear to 
show 20 non-Asian men in identical clothing, surrounded by armed men in the 
black uniforms often worn by the Pathet Lao. In some of the prints, the 
non-Asian men appear to be playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials long have insisted that expert analysis of these 
photos shows they are not what they appear to be. But activists -- including 
Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) -- who believe the Pentagon has a "mind-set to 
debunk" such information are citing the CIA memo as validation of their belief 
that the photos show American prisoners who never came home. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the evidence is conclusive. The Defense Intelligence Agency repeatedly 
has argued that no information has ever been verified that would show specific 
American individuals at specific locations, aside from Shelton and Hrdlicka.

 A man clearing snow from his driveway was robbed of his shovel at gunpoint, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me the shovel. I need the shovel right now," the robber said after he 
stopped his car Thursday night, jumped out and grabbed the shovel, Woodbridge 
Police Detective Joe Joraskie said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tugging match, the robber pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the 
victim, who surrendered the shovel. The robber then handed it to a passenger, 
got back into the car and drove off, police said.

 A young Brazilian man was found dead inside a jetliner's cargo bay Saturday 
after sneaking onto a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Rome, airport officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the 20-year-old man was discovered by a ground crew after the 
Varig airline flight landed at Rome's main airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, from Rio de Janeiro, was exposed to extremely low temperatures and 
apparently froze to death, the officials said. The cargo area where he hid also 
had little oxygen, they added.

BOY FOUND DEAD IN MONTANA AVALANCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A frantic search for a 7-year-old Canadian boy buried in an avalanche ended 
sadly Saturday with the discovery of his body. The death of Miles Merrill 
brought the death toll to five. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's body was found at 1 p.m., about 24 hours after he and six others 
were caught by the avalanche during a snowmobiling outing on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles and three other victims were from Cardston, Alberta, just north of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 The agricultural town of 3,500 residents was in shock, Cardston Mayor Fred 
Spackman said. Flags were lowered to half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles' body was found beneath the snow by a rescuer using a 10-foot probe, the 
Flathead County Sheriff's Department said. Search dogs had also been used. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles' father, Jamie Merrill, suffered hypothermia when he was caught in the 
avalanche. He was with the searchers Saturday, but it wasn't known if he was at 
the hillside when his son's body was found. He has refused to talk to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles' mother was in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Both survivors, Merrill and snowmobiler Sandy Sherman, who suffered broken 
ribs and other injuries, were found within two hours of the avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't known if Miles was killed by the force of the slide or he suffocated 
under the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Potter, director of emergency services in Flathead County, said about 50 
people searched at the scene, about 6,000 feet up the Swan Range, some 15 miles 
east of Kalispell, Mont. Another 40 to 50 people were at a command post some 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling snow reduced hillside visibility to only a few feet Saturday, and the 
mountainous terrain hindered radio communication. During the search, Flathead 
County Sheriff Jim Dupont complained: "God's not cooperating." 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's office turned down a flood of volunteers who offered to help. 
Only people trained in avalanche work were allowed to participate, Dupont said. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers used portable generators to power lights and worked until 4 a.m. 
Saturday. The search resumed four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed were Sandy Sherman's husband, Gordon Sherman, a 47-year-old Cardston 
rancher whose herds included exotic animals such as caribou; Bart Nelson, a 
35-year-old Cardston farmer, and Kendall Smith, 40, who ran a salt business in 
Cardston with his brother. Also killed was Patrick Buls, 46, from Kalispell, a 
town of about 12,000 people in northwestern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen snowmobilers had teamed up Friday to go to Strawberry Lake. One group 
led the way through fresh, powdery snow, then pulled off while the others broke 
trail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail breakers included Jim Pierce of Bigfork, Mont., who said he saw the 
snow break loose and overcome the group that had pulled over to wait. The 
avalanche stopped before reaching Pierce's party. 
</P>
<P>
 He used a cellular telephone to call for help and members of his group began 
searching for their companions. Pierce and another rider rode 2 1/2 miles to 
the trail head to guide searchers to the slide.

LEARY HALLUCINOGIC DRUG TESTS ON INMATES IN 1961 REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Leary, the 1960s drug guru, gave inmates at a Massachusetts prison 
doses of hallucinogenic drugs in tests to see if it would stop criminal 
tendencies, the Boston Globe said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe reported that Leary, who was overseeing the 1961 tests as a faculty 
member at Harvard University, was fired by state officials after the 
hallucinogenic tests had been under way for some time because he was seen as 
inciting inmates to rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was disruptive to the system," said one unidentified former Massachusetts 
prison official. "We knew that he was creating more strife and internal stress 
than could be contained." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, famous for encouraging Americans in the turbulent 1960s to "turn on, 
tune in, drop out" was fired two years later by Harvard after his wide-ranging 
drug experiments became public knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison tests involved giving inmates at Concord State Prison psilocybin, a 
narcotic with many of the same hallucinogenic properties of the better-known 
LSD, which is formally known as lysergic acid diethylamide. 
</P>
<P>
 Psilocybin can cause hallucinations, perception distortion and psychosis and 
can be psychologically addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary claimed the drug did reduce criminal tendencies and tried to pursue the 
Concord tests on grounds that "no other method of reducing the crime rate 
exists," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unnamed ex-prison official told the Globe that testing on the inmates using 
hallucinogenic drugs was not perceived as negative at the time.

REHNQUIST URGES FILLING VACANT JUDGESHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is urging President Clinton and the Senate 
to fill 113 vacant federal judgeships in 1994, including some that have gone 
unoccupied for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is perhaps no issue more important to the judiciary right now than this 
serious judicial vacancy problem," Rehnquist wrote in his year-end report on 
the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that in the coming year the executive and legislative branches will 
take the necessary steps to fill these vacancies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate confirmed 28 new federal judges last year, but Rehnquist noted that 
the remaining vacancies represent more than 13% of all authorized judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
 He said 64 of the 113 vacancies have existed for over 18 months, "some as long 
as four years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Were it not for the dedication of our hard-working senior (semi-retired) 
judges, the courts would be addressing an even more serious backlog today," 
Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said federal courts must continue to adjust to the demands of "an era 
of austerity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as now we have a clearer sense that federal budget resources are finite, 
we need also to recognize that the judicial machinery the budget supports is a 
scarce commodity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist, the nation's top judge, said "doing justice" in the future will be 
based on "the greatest good for the greatest number, not simply on . . . which 
litigant has the most resources, is the most insistent or can best manipulate 
the system." 
</P>
<P>
 He said federal courts must provide more management of litigation, more 
control of lawyer and litigant choices and more assurances that costs don't 
diminish too greatly the value of any recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater fiscal responsibility, accountability and efficiency is needed, 
Rehnquist added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our challenge will be to preserve the best of our current adversary system -- 
and thereby do justice -- while recognizing the new realities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly, some of the changes that will come about as a result of these 
efforts will please neither judges, court employees nor the legal profession."

GALLEGLY WAGES HIGH-POTENCY WAR OVER VITAMINS; HEALTH: LEGISLATOR EMERGES AS 
STRONG OPPONENT OF NEW LABELING RULES. HE IS ACCUSED OF ECHOING INDUSTRY SCARE 
TACTICS THAT FDA HOPES TO LIMIT ACCESS TO SUPPLEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly, who says his total dietary supplement intake is Vitamin C 
when he feels a cold coming on, has become a champion of the $4-billion 
industry in its high-profile battle to minimize new labeling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Republican has staked out a position that is even more 
aggressive than that of the supplement industry's two leading congressional 
advocates, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). He has 
done so by sponsoring a bill that Hatch had introduced in the last Congress but 
has since moderated. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such legislation, Gallegly said in an Oct. 6 letter to Richardson, 
"Millions of consumers will soon be unable to obtain the vitamins, minerals, 
herbs, fish oils and other supplements that they have been relying on and 
require for their nutritional needs and their personal health." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of dire warning has been criticized by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), a leader in the House on health issues, and the Food and Drug 
Administration, which oversees the dietary supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Gallegly is echoing industry scare tactics that falsely accuse the 
FDA of seeking to limit access to vitamins, minerals and herbs. Rather, they 
insist that the agency is merely trying to protect consumers from fraudulent 
and even harmful health claims that some such products can do everything from 
curing cancer to reversing the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some ingredients marketed as dietary supplements have demonstrated serious or 
even life-threatening hazards," the FDA said in a July report that the industry 
says overstated the problem. "As a result, millions of Americans are spending 
billions of dollars every year on dietary supplement products, many of which 
have shown little or no evidence of either safety or effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the FDA issued rules that would require dietary supplement makers 
to provide evidence -- under the same truth-in-labeling standards that apply to 
most foods -- for any health claims about their products. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David Kessler said that in contrast to industry warnings, the 
rules do not take any supplements off the shelves or require a prescription for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers should have access to dietary supplements that are truthfully 
labeled and marketed," Kessler said. "These rules enable the public to make 
informed choices. They will not restrict access." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, however, has indicated that he shares the view of many in the 
industry that the FDA is not to be trusted with too much regulatory authority. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Richardson, he said: "This is an agency that has a dismal 
record of approving any health claims for new dietary supplement products and 
is biased, in the view of many in the industry, against dietary supplements or 
any other products for which a prescription is not required." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently spurred by the concerns of constituents and small-supplement 
manufacturers, Gallegly has become a player on a complex issue that has aroused 
widespread alarm among the millions of Americans who regularly take dietary 
supplements. Nothing else has sparked as much mail to legislators in recent 
months -- much of it encouraged by vitamin makers and health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent critic of what he regards as excessive regulation of business, 
Gallegly calls this a case of "the government thinking it's smarter than the 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gallegly is better known for his legislation to crack down on illegal 
immigration, he has quietly become the House's leading Republican proponent of 
the dietary supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He discussed the issue briefly in an interview in early December. But in 
recent weeks, he has not returned phone calls seeking elaboration of his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the battle concerns implementation of the 1990 food labeling law 
written by Waxman that treats supplements like foods. The standard set by the 
law is that health claims be supported by significant scientific agreement 
among qualified experts. 
</P>
<P>
 This requires manufacturers to obtain the FDA's approval that each product 
meets this test before using the claim to market it. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry pressure, however, led to a moratorium while Congress attempted to 
devise regulations. Negotiations have thus far been inconclusive and the 
moratorium ended Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new regulations proposed by the FDA will not take effect until July 1. 
Pushed by pro-industry legislators, Congress is expected to refocus on the 
issue when it returns from its winter break later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has harnessed an unusual coalition of right-wing libertarians 
and left-leaning New Age activists who share an interest in alternative 
medicine," said Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, a national consumer advocacy group that strongly supports 
the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a longstanding tradition in American society of resistance to 
traditional medicine," Silverglade said. "It's often been called the health 
freedom movement and congressman Gallegly would seem to represent that part of 
the debate." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "The freedom to choose alternative medicine doesn't mean much if 
it's influenced by misleading marketing hype on dietary supplement labels." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly introduced legislation in the last Congress written by Hatch that 
would give the industry far greater leeway to make health claims. Gallegly 
reintroduced the bill last January. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Health Freedom Act permits a manufacturer to make a claim if it 
is "truthful and not misleading and there is scientific evidence, whether 
published or unpublished, that provides a reasonable basis for such claim." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also prohibits any requirement that manufacturers obtain approval 
prior to making the claim. Gallegly has become a co-sponsor of a similar bill 
by Rep. Richardson that gives the FDA 30 days' notice before marketing a 
product with a specific claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA opposes Richardson's plan, which has more than 200 sponsors. Gallegly 
has more than 60 sponsors -- all but one of them Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will weaken FDA's ability to make sure that dietary supplements 
are safe and properly labeled," said Mitch Zeller, FDA special assistant for 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of the FDA deciding whether there's enough science to support the 
claim, the companies would do so and that really turns the last 50 years of 
food and drug law on its head. It's not practicable, it's not feasible and it's 
just not good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Zeller said that under the weaker scientific standard, a company 
"could conceivably make a health claim relying on a preliminary study of a 
couple of dozen people as long as it was truthfully described, even though it 
is inconceivable that one study could establish the scientific validity of a 
relationship between a nutrient and a disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 years as a consumer advocate, congressional investigator and FDA 
employee, Zeller said, he has not seen any evidence of bias by the agency 
against the supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the FDA remains the enemy to many of those whose cause Gallegly 
has espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is representing what the majority of his constituents want," said Elliott 
Balbert, chairman of Natrol, a Chatsworth company. Gallegly represented 
Chatsworth prior to the 1992 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Balbert said that Gallegly's 23rd District "includes a very, very active 
consumer base that utilizes dietary supplements. . . ."

HOUSE FIRE KILLS ARLETA WOMAN AND 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

<P>
 An Arleta woman and her 7-year-old daughter were killed in a house fire early 
New Year's morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified by relatives as Mercedes Tenorio and her daughter, 
Linda Alvarez.Survivors said they last saw Linda trying to warn others about 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Five others survived the blaze, although one man, identified by authorities as 
Severo Gutierrez, 26, was severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to get back into the house to get others out when we arrived," 
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis said. "He had to be 
restrained." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and 
transferred to the burn unit at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. A 
hospital spokesman said Gutierrez was in intensive care suffering from severe 
smoke inhalation. He was also badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
 The other injured people, including a firefighter who was burned on his face 
and a hand, were treated and released. The fire, which caused an estimated 
$125,000 damage to the single-story home in the 9900 block of Beachy Avenue, 
was under investigation, Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenorio and her daughter were unable to escape from the house, which quickly 
filled with smoke, fire officials said.

AFTER 22 YEARS, STREISAND RETURNS TO LIVE CONCERTS; MUSIC: SINGER PERFORMS 
BEFORE 13,000 PEOPLE. MICHAEL JACKSON MAKES A SURPRISE APPEARANCE, ALONG WITH 
STEVEN SPIELBERG AND MICHAEL MILKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a town built on the concept of risk, Barbra Streisand proved on New Year's 
Eve to be the ultimate pop high roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Combatting the stage fright that has kept her from concerts for 22 years, the 
singer returned to live shows with a triumphant performance before 13,000 
people in the MGM Grand Hotel's Grand Garden arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an elegant two-hour affair that won her six standing ovations and set a 
U.S. record for a pop concert gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Edler, an Army production assistant from Salt Lake City, said she paid 
$500 Thursday for a $400 ticket to Friday's show, the first of two weekend 
performances by Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my whole life did I think I'd see her live," said Edler, 41, who 
lined up hours before the arena doors opened at 6 p.m. so she could be the 
first concert-goer into the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to be here. What if she doesn't feel comfortable on stage and decides 
to never do another concert?" 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the show was delayed an hour beyond the scheduled starting time 
of 8 p.m. because everyone except VIPs had to go through a single entrance that 
for security purposes was lined with airport-style metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a 64-piece orchestra conducted by Marvin Hamlisch, Streisand wove 
more than two dozen songs -- from signature hits such as "People" and "The Way 
We Were" to a number from the new stage musical "Sunset Boulevard" -- into a 
series of autobiographical vignettes that touched on childhood dreams, 
relationships, family ties and social optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone whose stage manner was once called humorless and aloof, the singer 
-- who has concentrated for the last two decades on recordings and films -- was 
consistently warm and often witty as she proceeded through a scripted show, 
aided by TelePrompTers. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert was originally scheduled to be taped for a television special but 
those plans were canceled because Streisand felt the cameras would detract from 
the concert experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's biggest surprise was when Streisand was joined on stage by Mike 
Myers, the "Saturday Night Live" comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the guise of alter ego Linda Richman, an obsessed Streisand fan 
whose adoration is expressed in an exaggerated Long Island accent. Streisand 
joined in the fun as they bantered like longtime chums. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rumors last week that President and Mrs. Clinton would celebrate the 
evening by attending the concert, they were not on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Virginia Clinton Kelley, the President's mother, did watch from a 
front-row seat and was introduced to the crowd, along with Coretta Scott King, 
the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Other celebrities ranged from the film world's Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, 
Peter Bogdanovich and Sydney Pollack to the music world's Quincy Jones, Prince 
and Michael Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrity surprise at a second show given Saturday was Michael Jackson, 
who took his seat near the stage, along with Steven Spielberg and Michael 
Milken. Jackson acknowledged the crowd's cheers with a shy wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel officials have refused to say how much Friday's and Saturday's shows 
grossed, but industry insiders believe it to be more than $6 million per show. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than twice any previous pop gross, including rock stadium dates 
that sometimes attract up to 90,000 fans. The average gross for a 12,000- to 
18,000-seat arena sellout in 1993 was about $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert souvenir merchandise, ranging from $100 bottles of Streisand-signature 
champagne to $25 T-shirts, were expected to generate more than $1.5 million 
alone -- another record for a single event. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the two concerts were priced from $50 to $1,000, with 4,000 of the 
seats each night at the top level. The average price was more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans reportedly paid brokers three and four times face value for choice 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there didn't appear to be any grumbling over the high prices for the 
shows, which were designed in part as a test for a possible national Streisand 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Baldwin, 44, and her husband flew in from Long Island and she wasn't 
even upset that their $300 seats were 10 rows from the rear wall -- about as 
far as you could be from Streisand and still be in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her in 'Funny Girl' on Broadway, but it has been so long since she has 
done concerts that I thought the odds of seeing her again were a million to 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said, though, that if she does a show, I'd be there -- and here I 
am." 
</P>

Grand in Las Vegas will appear in Monday's Calendar section.

FIRE KILLS ARLETA WOMAN, DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arleta woman and her 7-year-old daughter were killed in a fire that swept 
through their home early New Year's morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified by relatives as Mercedes Tenorio and her daughter, 
Linda Alvarez. Survivors said they last saw Linda trying to warn others in the 
house of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Five others survived the blaze, although one, identified as Severo Gutierrez, 
26, was severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to get back into the house to get others out when we arrived," 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis. "He had to be 
restrained." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and 
transferred to the burn unit at County-USC Medical Center. A hospital spokesman 
said Gutierrez was in intensive care suffering from severe smoke inhalation. He 
was also badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
 The other injured, including a firefighter who was burned on his face and a 
hand, were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which caused an estimated $125,000 damage to the single-story home 
in the 9900 block of Beachy Avenue, was still under investigation Saturday, 
Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the knock at the door and there were two women and a couple of kids," 
said Max Love, a next-door neighbor who called the Fire Department about 3:30 
a.m. "They came for help. I looked out and the flames were really shooting 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The women were friends visiting Tenorio from out of town. One of the two boys 
was Tenorio's son and the other was a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenorio and her daughter were unable to escape from the house, which quickly 
filled with smoke, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors later told relatives and neighbors that they didn't see Tenorio 
after the fire started. But the daughter had been helping to alert others in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "She died while trying to get them out," said John Tenorio, Mercedes' brother, 
standing outside the house. He had been called from work and arrived at the 
scene in time to talk to some of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little girl was banging on doors to get them up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believe the girl became disoriented. Firefighters 
found her in her brother's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes Tenorio had two older daughters that had moved away from home, John 
Tenorio said. He said his sister had worked hard to achieve financial security 
since arriving in Los Angeles from El Salvador in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had nothing when she came here, I lent her the money to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he said, she had owned several small businesses, including a bar 
in Pacoima. "I think she was the only woman in the whole San Fernando Valley to 
own a cantina, " he said. "That took a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes Tenorio bought the three-bedroom house in 1987 and put in a front 
garden of succulents, roses and other plants. The garden survived the fire, 
which gutted the interior of the house, but left much of the exterior intact. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had several dogs, a couple of which wandered around the fenced-in 
driveway Saturday afternoon. Animal shelter officials had been called.

WOMAN TRIES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON STREETS WHERE SISTER WAS SLAIN; OAKLAND: 
DEBORAH WILLIAMS WAS KILLED AS CROWD CHEERED. SURVIVORS WANT TO RESCUE DRUG 
ADDICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day Teresa Williams heard a crack addict had been chased down and stabbed 
as a crowd of toughs cheered, she thought how easily it could have been her 
troubled sister dying in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she found out it was. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day last August, Williams declared her own private war on drugs, 
vowing to return to the bleak neighborhood where her sister was murdered and 
open a center for drug-addicted women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just had enough," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa also wants to organize a free clinic that offers classes in budgeting, 
good health habits, family counseling and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants churches to ask parishioners to "adopt" one woman, spending an hour 
a month with her to reinforce the message that the community cares. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a fitting memorial for Deborah Leeann Williams. But it also would 
be a crowning irony of a life that started with so much promise and ended in so 
much ignominy -- such a center might have saved its namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 Child of a politically active family, a trombone player so talented that the 
school gave her an instrument, Deborah was the first graduate of the East 
Oakland Community Learning Center, a Black Panther elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 On graduation day 1974, tall and proud in a long, white dress, she declared, 
"One of the most important things I have learned . . . is what freedom means." 
</P>
<P>
 The moment is captured on the front page of a yellowing, much-thumbed copy of 
the Black Panther newspaper, a remnant of the past -- carefully wrapped in 
plastic -- that Deborah Williams hung onto for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she was homeless and on the street, she carried that newspaper with 
her," Teresa Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the pinnacle of her life; the downward slope started in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started hanging out with the wrong crowd, being cool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, she remembers Deborah "came in the house and she was begging for money . 
. . she said she needed money for cigarettes." Teresa would watch her sister 
leave, penniless and hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an adult, I look back and it looks like it was more than cigarettes she 
was begging for. . . . I think that's probably when she started on the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a succession of abusive boyfriends and three children, one 
permanently hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she started having babies . . . she'd use the kids to try to get money. 
(She'd say) 'Can I borrow $20 to get the kids some diapers?' And you knew if 
you gave her $20 she wouldn't spend it on diapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Deborah Williams would enroll in a recovery program. Sometimes, she 
would enroll in college classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But then would come the inevitable relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, Teresa and her mother, Mary Williams, tried to get 
custody of Deborah's children and put her in a recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deborah finally broke down, she (said), 'I have a drug problem, I'm out of 
control, but I want to keep my kids. I'll get in a rehab program, I'll do 
whatever it takes,' " Teresa Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, Deborah Williams' lopsided battle against drugs ended when she was 
chased out of her apartment building by a knife-wielding neighbor who told 
police she was angry at Williams for smoking crack in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At a street corner, Williams was surrounded by a crowd of youths, many of them 
suspected drug dealers, who tripped her, stomped her and egged on her attacker 
with cries of, "Kill her! Kill her!" witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Camille Lee, the 19-year-old woman charged with murdering Williams, has 
said the killing would not have happened without the crowd's interference. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client would never have been able to catch her," defense lawyer Deborah 
Levy said of her nearly 200-pound client. "Who murdered this woman? I don't 
think Stacey did; I think the crowd did." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's such a cop-out," countered prosecutor Therese Drabec. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected sometime next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 When Deborah Williams died, she was using the alias of Dione Wells, the name 
carried in news reports. "I looked for my sister's name. I said, 'Thank God, 
it's not Deborah,' " Teresa Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the family got the bad news in a midnight call from Deborah's 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears are not far away as Teresa Williams recalls how her sister died alone in 
a county hospital, but she blinks them aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have time for that right now. I'm too busy trying to start something 
and do something positive," she said in a recent interview at the modest 
Oakland home where she is bringing up her 8-year-old daughter. She and her 
mother share custody of two of her sister's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Williams' life has not been simple either. Like her sister, she became 
pregnant as a young woman, and her first three efforts to go to college ended 
dismally. But she always knew she wanted something more. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a graduate student in geophysics at UC Berkeley, she credits friends and 
faculty there with supporting her efforts to open the Deborah Leeann Williams 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's try to listen to these people (drug addicts)," she said. "Let's ask 
them what they need." She wants to put addicts' welfare money into special 
accounts that will pay bills automatically; she wants to encourage people in 
the neighborhood to report criminal activity to police. 
</P>
<P>
 And most of all, she wants to find a way to reach the women who, like her 
sister, "stop dreaming of something better."

UCI LOSS OF MEDICAL DEAN LEAVES A GAP; * HIS SUCCESSOR MUST WORK TO BRING MORE 
WOMEN INTO TOP POSTS AT THE MEDICAL COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Walter L. Henry did good work in helping rescue the UC Irvine Medical 
Center from financial disaster. His surprise resignation as the university's 
chancellor of health sciences and dean of the College of Medicine will leave a 
major gap. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry's record on filling top-level posts at the medical college with 
women was less sterling, and his successor's task in that area likely will be 
as tough as balancing budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry resigned last month after UCI's new chancellor, Laurel L. Wilkening, 
rejected his proposals for organizational change as too expensive. Henry, 
identified in a fall University of California study as the top-paid 
administrator in the UC system at $211,400 a year, wanted to remain as vice 
chancellor but have someone else be dean of medicine and report to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said that at a time of budget cuts, she could not approve the 
creation of such a high-level post. She is right. The entire university system 
has been told to cinch in the belt, but students have complained that they are 
being asked to pay too much more and the top administrators are giving up too 
little. To establish a new, top-level position like dean of medicine would have 
sent the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even Henry's foes on campus must remember that when he took over nearly 
five years ago, the medical center's deficit was around $12 million a year. 
That's because the hospital treats most of the county's poor, people who can't 
pay at all or who have insurance that covers only a small fraction of the cost 
of their treatment. It took a concerted effort by the hospital and university 
staff, the county and the state to turn the situation around, but the financial 
health of the medical center remains fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of female professors at the medical center is also weak. A report 
last spring found only 10 of the 168 full professors at the college are women, 
putting it last among the five UC medical schools. Henry's successor must hire 
and promote more women and ensure everyone supports the goal of equality. 
</P>
<P>
 While University of Washington provost, Wilkening was a strong proponent of 
hiring more women and minorities. As UCI chancellor, she said the medical 
school and the hospital demanded her "immediate attention" during a time of 
proposed health care reform. Juggling the competing demands of the hospital and 
the teaching school, watching finances and correcting gender imbalances present 
a formidable challenge for Wilkening, and for Henry's successor.

SANTA ANA'S POLICY TOWARD HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times last November noted that Santa Ana lacks "a coherent long-term 
plan" to provide for "adequate provisions" for dealing with the problems of the 
homeless. In a December editorial, The Times complimented Santa Ana for making 
a start to deal with homeless issues if other cities would match Santa Ana's 
commitment. In the same editorial, The Times notes "we in the county have to do 
more to reduce those numbers (of homeless)." 
</P>
<P>
 So, we then have the curious situation of The Times encouraging a countywide 
solution, yet ready to quit before the work begins. "Given the difficulty of 
getting Orange County cities to agree on such an issue, Santa Ana should be 
ready to act on its own even if other cities don't join in." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a regional problem and a regional responsibility. One city cannot hope 
to resolve this problem single-handedly, nor should The Times encourage 
anything short of a broad-based, countywide approach to address homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 As our City Council has discussed this issue, several principles for 
developing a broad-based approach have begun to crystallize. The effort must be 
countywide, and participation should be equitable and fair. Second, the 
emphasis needs to be aimed at direct services, rather than bricks and mortar. 
Third, starting a brand-new government program makes little sense when our 
county has a wide range of capable service providers, and, fourth, the effort 
stands the best chance for success when supported by the countywide religious 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, a group of religious leaders, representatives of the Orange 
County Homeless Issues Task Force, and members of the Santa Ana City Council 
have been meeting to craft a program based on the principles described above. 
To fund the effort, I have suggested Santa Ana offer $300,000 (roughly matching 
$1 per capita) as a challenge grant to be authorized when nine additional 
Orange County cities match our commitment on a per capita basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Please note that this is above and beyond our current commitments that include 
expansion of YWCA and YMCA single room occupancy projects (SROs). 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of work remains to make this dream a reality. The Times ought to 
encourage this broad-based effort rather than expecting Santa Ana to solve a 
regional problem (really a national problem) on its own.

INFERENCE OF PILOT SPEEDING IS INCORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to your editorial, "Averting Future Air Disasters" (Dec. 24): 
You state more than once that the Westwind jet was going too fast and that the 
pilot was "warned" of this several times by air traffic controllers. Your 
inference seems to be that the pilot of the Westwind was "speeding" and this 
was a negligent operation of the aircraft which contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite to the contrary, the Westwind pilot was operating his aircraft at a 
speed which he considered prudent for the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit for such airspace is 200 knots, and the Westwind was well 
below that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Once within five miles of the airport, air traffic control must relinquish all 
speed control to the pilot -- this is primary to safe flight operations. The 
John Wayne tower controller was likely concerned that the Westwind would arrive 
at the runway before the 757 had exited the runway after its landing roll. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happened, the controller would have had to direct the Westwind to balk 
his landing approach and fly another circuit for landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the only real concern the tower controller had was one of efficient use 
of the runway, not a concern that the Westwind was "speeding' toward disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, your technically flawed editorial suggests otherwise. You 
should research the matter more carefully, then set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the FAA has belatedly declared the 757's wake vortices to be 
dangerous, the ground rules are different. But, based on the rules in place on 
December 15, neither the pilot of the Westwind nor the John Wayne tower 
controllers did anything wrong as to speed and separation of airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, the approach controllers who worked both aircraft before 
they were handed over to the tower could have provided better spacing -- but 
again only to make sure both airplanes would have the runway available 
separately in order to land. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making false accusations, you might want to instead explore the 
rules which still permit a heavy airliner to operate above the electronic 
glide-slope on approach to landing. That is likely what caused this disaster 
more than any other factor.

HOW MARINE BIOLOGISTS BUILD MUSSELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to a letter written by Roy L. Lay, "Marine Forester Flexes His 
Mussels (Dec. 19)," we would like to clarify the record regarding his statement 
that we are "obviously prejudiced against the Marine Forest Society and its 
many volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 We have absolutely no reason to believe that the volunteers or members of the 
Marine Forest Society are anything but honest and sincere citizens whose wish 
is to make the oceans a more productive place, to the benefit of everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as marine biologists whose job is to oversee the research and 
development of artificial reefs off the California coast, we have concerns 
about the Marine Forest Society's plans to construct a tire "reef" in the 
waters off Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tires generated interest as a reef material during the early 1970s. They're 
cheap and we do seem to have an unlimited supply. Unfortunately, the years have 
shown us that they make a very poor substrate for reef building, compared to 
other abundant and low-cost materials such as surplus concrete. We also want to 
clarify the second point concerning where mussels grow. The California mussel ( 
Mytilus californianus ) does not grow next to the sand in open water. 
Therefore, they will not grow on tires half buried in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay states that the photograph which appeared with the Dec. 12 article "Mussel 
Man Fights Hunger" shows fish, sea stars and even kelp growing on the tires. We 
have recently visited this site, to document for the Fish and Game Commission 
what is actually there. There was no kelp growing on any of the tires. The 
"kelp" which appears in the photograph may have drifted into and became 
entangled on one of the tires, as commonly happens with other obstructions on 
the bottom.

ANAHEIM SHOULD HOLD LINE ON RAMS; * NFL TEAM IS IMPORTANT, BUT DON'T GIVE THE 
STORE AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the possible loss of the Rams, and uncertainty about the Disneyland 
expansion, Anaheim faces its most difficult challenges in years. The city must 
protect itself from being taken advantage of, while also trying to keep these 
important pieces of the puzzle in place for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The new year thus finds Anaheim at a critical juncture. The news this season 
has not been all that might be hoped for from a place intimately associated 
with Jiminy Cricket, who reminded us that dreams come true if only we wish upon 
a star. Wishing is clearly not enough in a shaky economy and the often-restive 
world of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times last month, Georgia Frontiere, owner of the 
Rams, acknowledged that she was exploring the option of moving the professional 
football team. At the same time, the resignation of the project director for 
the $3-billion Disneyland Resort and Westcot theme park fueled concern that the 
anticipated new theme park might not be built at all. The difficulties of the 
Euro Disneyland project and the vicissitudes of the state's economy reportedly 
are giving the Walt Disney Co. some second thoughts about going ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 If merely providing the good weather were sufficient to catapult Anaheim 
successfully into the next phase of its growth and development there would be 
no problem. But the Southern California climate alone doesn't seem to guarantee 
much of anything these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, when Anaheim provided perfect football temperatures, and even as 
a number of National Football League games were played around the country on 
ice, the Rams drew the fewest fans for a non-strike game since they moved to 
Anaheim from Los Angeles 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the team without giving away the store -- now there's the trick. The 
Rams are an important component of civic pride in Anaheim and Orange County. 
The city very much needs to retain them, but the team has an escape clause in 
its lease for the use of Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma is complicated by the fact that the team is not winning on the 
field, which increases the attractiveness of "the-grass-is-greener-elsewhere" 
as a solution for poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans will attend if the team will just win, but it also seems clear that 
the city is going to have to make concessions. Last week, a meeting of 
community and city leaders was held to discuss the situation. That was useful. 
It likely will take dollars to keep the Rams when football-starved cities like 
Baltimore are offering to lease them a stadium for $1 a season, and all 
proceeds from ticket sales, luxury boxes and parking fees. Mayor Tom Daly 
correctly observed that if the city had the talent to get the Rams in the first 
place, it should be able to put something together now. County business and 
political leaders should do what they can to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a once sure thing, the Disneyland expansion, now is in question. 
The entertainment giant has sought up to $1 billion in public improvements from 
the city and state. Will recent talk of abandonment result in greater 
generosity from the city than otherwise might have been forthcoming? The city 
is in a difficult position, but it must hold its ground on this one. It must 
ensure as before that any public investment in infrastructure pencils out for 
the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 If only providing the sunny setting were all that Anaheim had to do at this 
critical juncture in its history to generate new business. But it's not. 
Clearly, there are a lot of intangibles. The city's leadership is being tested 
as never before.

GATES' SNUB OF ANTI-GANG TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Prior to retiring as a Parks and Recreations administrator for Los Angeles 
County, I was an active member of the Los Angeles County Interagency Gang Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in the task force consisted of many jurisdictions, including 
representatives from the Probation Department, district attorney's office, Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles Police Department, Parks and 
Recreation, school districts, Youth Gang Services, Board of Supervisors, city 
councils and various other community-based agencies and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force meets on a monthly and as-needed basis and maintains a united 
goal of reducing gang-related activities. It also has many other 
responsibilities such as identifying and tracking gang members and printing 
publications that educate the public. It has been a very successful and 
much-needed program that has earned support and respect from communities 
throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major reasons for the success of the program (has been) the 
personal commitment and leadership role of (Los Angeles County) Sheriff Sherman 
Block. He mandates active participation from all of his substations as well as 
his gang-specialist units. He has demonstrated support to the task force by 
utilizing the full resources of his department. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very surprised to learn from recent articles in The Times ("O.C. Orders 
In Strike Teams to Quell Gangs" Dec. 15) that Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates 
chose not to participate in the Orange County Gang Task Force or the strike 
teams designed to "quell gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sheriff's Gates' decision not to participate is politically motivated or 
because he doesn't want to share the spotlight with Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi's office, then he is shortchanging not only other participating police 
departments, but the citizens of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Gates, no man is an island. If you have a good reason for choosing not 
to participate in this much-needed program, we would certainly like to know 
about it.

IT'S TIME TO STOP THE MUDSLINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I think it is time to refer the Lee A. Branch matter to the Orange County 
Grand Jury for review.Branch has served the community well in his years in 
office (as county recorder), and a personal relationship with an employee 
should not be a factor in their review. This type of mudslinging is no longer 
considered an issue, when we compare other elected officials who have broken 
the rules more severely, i.e. draft dodging, womanizing, lied in their resumes, 
accepted bribes, etc. Our county supervisors already have a candidate in the 
wings (Gary Granville), and would be very disappointed if their political 
maneuvering failed them.

BOLSA CHICA'S WETLANDS AGAIN UNDER SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The future of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands is once again in public focus and the 
county of Orange has this time put forward an alternative development plan less 
dense than its forerunners. This is especially significant in that 2nd District 
Supervisor Harriett Wieder has been quoted as giving support to the less 
intense plan with its lowland recreational element. 
</P>
<P>
 From my perspective as a three-term past president of the Amigos de Bolsa 
Chica (1983-85), I have to wonder what grand progress we might be making now in 
the 1990s on funding the wetlands restoration if the county's planning staff 
and supervisor Wieder had reached these same conclusions in the early 1980s 
when the county and the landowner were in lock step promoting a marina, hotel 
complex, and a waterfront residential community on the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Those early plans and "compromise" plans were vigorously fought by the Amigos 
de Bolsa Chica all the way through the Coastal Commission and the Legislature 
twice, as well as in the court. 
</P>
<P>
 During this same time frame, the early 1980s, the future of the Irvine Coast 
was also being argued. 
</P>
<P>
 It is noteworthy that in the case of the Irvine Coast, there was more timely 
resolution (albeit as an indirect result of a lawsuit settlement). Once 
moderate development rights and open-space acquisition terms were agreed upon, 
elected officials' support quickly followed and behind it public funding from 
all levels -- local, state and federal. Now in the 1990s we are all enjoying 
the sight and use of the public open space that was gained. 
</P>
<P>
 How are these two environmental/open-space issues different yet the same? They 
are the same in that there was an effective, vocal opposition advocating 
preservation. Each property was owned by a large, powerful development company. 
The county planning staff was the same then as now. What strikes me as being 
different is the fact that the properties are in different districts with 
different seated supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad the Sierra Club in the 1990s has a more committed local membership 
supportive of maximizing preservation, that the new Bolsa Chica Trust exists to 
participate, and that our county's planning staff has redirected its efforts. 
We are all now moving in the right direction.

 * The Environmental Impact Report concerning the proposed Koll development 
project on the Bolsa Chica has identified a biodiversity park as the 
environmentally superior alternative to the Koll project. The report states, 
however, that there may not be funds available for the alternative -- one which 
would keep the Bolsa Chica free from any residential development. This raises 
the question: What is the worth of the Bolsa Chica? 
</P>
<P>
 The monetary value of the Bolsa Chica can, with an appropriate appraisal, 
probably be determined with some accuracy. This appraisal would have to 
consider the value of the property as it stands now -- with no building 
entitlements -- as opposed to the Bolsa Chica's value should Koll persuade the 
county that the county's general plan should be amended so that building could 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer's representatives, apparently assuming that the county will 
approve its request to build 4,884 homes on the Bolsa Chica mesa and wetlands, 
has stated that the value of the Bolsa Chica is as high as $1 million per acre. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica Land Trust, formed in May, 1992, is one of thousands of land 
trusts formed throughout the country in recent years to protect special places 
like the Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust hopes to persuade Koll to sell its interest in the Bolsa Chica to 
the trust so that it may be preserved for future generations as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 We in Orange County are wrestling with significant issues relating to growth. 
In this regard, the county of Orange has been given the responsibility of 
reviewing the environmental concerns inherent in the Koll project.  
</P>
<P>
 The county must hear from us about our concerns for quality of life in our 
urban culture. How do we redefine community development? Are corporate property 
rights and community rights compatible? Who speaks for the citizens, who have 
no paid lobbyists? Where will we go when open space is no longer there to offer 
respite? 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening days of 1994 and as we approach the end of the 20th Century, we 
can take the opportunity to reflect on these questions, to listen, and to make 
a decision about Bolsa Chica from which our children will benefit.

 * Re: "Developing Wetlands Criticized (Dec. 22)," addressing the recent 
publication of an Environmental Impact Report for the Bolsa Chica Wetlands in 
Huntington Beach: The purpose of this letter is to point out that this new 
Environmental Impact Report has convinced me that 4,000 new homes adjacent the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands appears to be inconsistent with the highest and best use 
of this area. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in Huntington Beach for 20 years and never gave those "mud flats" 
a second thought. However, in the last year or so, two new events have come to 
my attention via The Times: a) Wetlands were routinely filled before I realized 
what they really meant to me personally, and b) A large body of scientific 
study has evolved, enough that I believe that I and others have now been 
provided with sufficient information to quantify the cost vs. effective value 
and make a judgment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that we property owners in Huntington Beach could use the 
added tax base that 4,000 houses and families would generate. But I have to 
bite the bullet on this one; it looks like we had better leave my mud flats and 
adjacent open area as they are.

 * Why the Bozo bashing of Brad (Gates) and the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department? 
</P>
<P>
 I head a small state investigative unit office in Orange County. We utilize 
the technical and support services of the OCSD to assist in our investigations 
and can personally attest that the OCSD is a "can do" organization. From the 
booking deputy to the warrant clerk to the criminalist, they are arguably the 
best Sheriff's Department in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments on deputy training displays blatant ignorance. Training is a 
state of mind. Training is ongoing at the office, in the patrol car, at the 
academy and yes, even at home. Training is not limited to specific set times 
and locations. 
</P>
<P>
 A field deputy places his personal safety in the hands of his fellow officers. 
The level of training and the adequacy of the training that his comrades 
possess can have a life or death impact on him personally. The deputies had 
identified a shortcoming in the training of a fellow officer and were taking 
immediate corrective action. This is to be commended, not criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Let this tragic accident be a positive lesson plan for further training. Keep 
the faith, OCSD, we support your superior efforts on our behalf.

 * Does the "code of silence" among police officers still apply when a good 
officer is shot in the face and killed by a bad officer? So far this seems to 
be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain aspects of the limited information being fed to the public have made 
me more suspicious than I was when the story first broke. 
</P>
<P>
 As this surreptitious event unfolds, the stink of a cover-up becomes more 
noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly recommend that someone in the department who knows the truth come 
clean and not burden their fellow officers and their entire department with 
this scandal.

 * Police officers are thoroughly trained in the use of guns. They carry them 
daily, load and unload them daily, and take regular target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on Christmas Day, an Orange County sheriff's deputy was accidentally 
killed by a gun while role-playing on duty. How then can the average citizen, 
less familiar with firearms, be expected to safely possess and use guns? 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the media's preoccupation with violent crime, the chief danger 
from guns comes not from their use by "criminals" but by the hands of careless 
or hot-tempered average people. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns kill people.

By MARK BALDASSARE and CHERYL KATZ, Mark Baldassare, chair of the Department of

survey of 1,000 households is in its 12th year.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County, like the rest of Southern California, is in the midst of the 
most challenging time in its modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year that saw crime rising to the forefront of residents' concerns, 
and no relief in sight for a distressed local economy, the county is facing 
growing fears as we enter 1994. The 1993 Orange County Annual Survey of 1,000 
residents found several key trends that will be felt in the year ahead:  
</P>
<P>
 * Half of the residents are now mentioning crime (29%) and jobs and the 
economy (20%) as Orange County's most important problems. Concerns about crime 
have nearly doubled since 1986, while the economy has become the chronic worry 
of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 * One in three residents say they are afraid of walking in their neighborhood 
at night, significantly more than a decade ago. Nearly half say they believe 
the crime rate in their neighborhood is on the rise. Crime fears are most acute 
among lower-income residents, but are having an impact today on all economic 
groups and regions of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * One in three residents say they worry that they or someone in their family 
will lose their job in the next year. Pessimism about the local economy 
continues, and most expect bad economic times in the nation next year and even 
throughout the next five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Why have people become so fearful? 
</P>
<P>
 While violent crimes and joblessness are very real problems today, residents' 
concerns in these areas surpass the actual rates. What people are really 
expressing with their high levels of anxiety is fear of change.  
</P>
<P>
 The county is reeling from the effects of many economic changes taking place 
at once. Corporate downsizing, reductions in defense spending, real estate 
woes, the closing of military bases and the restructuring of the economy have 
undermined consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Orange County that prospered so much during the Cold War appears 
to be foundering in its aftermath.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the past few years have seen spreading gang activities, making 
residents nervous about the safety of local streets, beaches, parks and 
schools. And after being alerted to crime and safety threats by the Los Angeles 
riots in the spring of 1992, residents got a powerful reminder about their 
vulnerability to criminal acts by the arson fire that ravaged Laguna Beach last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as the county becomes more urban and diverse, many residents are 
wondering how much they can trust strangers, and even their new neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 But all is not gloomy in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 If we take a look at the problems that plagued the county in the 1980s, there 
are visible signs of progress. Here are some of the positive trends that are 
likely to carry through this year:  
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation woes are easing. Compared to the late 1980s, traffic is less 
of a problem for commuters today, and fewer think congestion is getting worse. 
Also, the number of employed residents who drive alone to work has declined.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rapid population growth is no longer troubling residents. Fewer than half 
now complain about local growth or say the growth control regulations in their 
communities are not strict enough. * Housing costs have stabilized. After rapid 
escalation in the 1980s, there has been little change in housing costs so far 
this decade. Most homeowners and renters still consider buying a home in Orange 
County to be an excellent or good investment. These trends help the county 
remain an attractive location for industry and residents.  
</P>
<P>
 * Fears of environmental problems are declining. While people continue to care 
greatly about protecting the environment, they feel the threat to their 
personal health and well-being is less serious today. Residents have been 
reassured by recent improvements in air quality.  
</P>
<P>
 * Charitable giving is on the rebound. A surge in donations this past year, 
especially evident among the most affluent residents, may signal a growing 
recognition of local problems and a willingness to help.  
</P>
<P>
 * There have been no swings to political extremes. County voters have remained 
moderate to somewhat conservative, and few are found at either end of the 
political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 This profile indicates that voters will respond to problem-solving and 
performance, rather than ideology and party allegiance, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that some of yesterday's problems are being solved should help lessen 
residents' fears about our current troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But confidence can only be restored by devising a positive plan for rebuilding 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Local business organizations, colleges and universities, charities, new 
immigrant groups and elected officials must take part in the rebuilding 
process. And the various branches of local government and localities must learn 
to cooperate in working toward this goal, or residents and businesses will give 
up and seek more encouraging conditions elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation will also be needed to ease fears about public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not enough to treat certain parts of the county as dangerous and to be 
avoided, while other areas are considered "havens." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and gangs are highly mobile today, and in a compact county such as ours, 
any area is a potential trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring residents' sense of safety will take coordination among law 
enforcement, social service agencies, public education and neighborhood groups, 
and will require cooperation across city, and perhaps even county, boundaries.

FAIR TRIAL REGARDLESS OF WHO'S PAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article ("Jury Rejects Bicyclist's $23-Million Injury Suit" Dec. 16) 
raises some valid and telling points regarding lawyer and jury 
responsibilities. Neither the plaintiff nor her lawyer expressed sour grapes 
about losing; instead, they recognized that they could not produce enough 
evidence to the jury that the highway was defective.Both the lawyer for the 
City of Huntington Beach and (the) plaintiff's lawyer agreed that the jurors 
looked at the evidence carefully and refused to let their emotions sway them. 
This is exactly what juries are instructed and sworn to do and exactly what 
they almost always do. 
</P>
<P>
 Erroneous verdicts, few as they may be, are often caused by overzealous 
attorneys who are more interested in winning than in a fair trial. Your article 
contained a classic example of such irresponsibility, i.e., Santa Ana City 
Atty. Edward J. Cooper's remark that "juries just seem to forget that the 
taxpayers are footing the bill -- and that they are taxpayers." In over four 
decades of practice, I know of no judge who would either allow Mr. Cooper to 
present such an argument or would give such a prejudicial instruction to a 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Cooper should respect the difficult task that the jury accomplished, as 
did both the plaintiff's and defendant's attorneys. He should also be thankful 
that when his client is in the courtroom, the rule is not who is footing the 
bill; the rule is that his client is entitled to the same "fair and impartial 
consideration and to justice by the same standards" as all other parties in the 
courtroom.

TEACH VALUES WITHOUT RELIGIOUS TONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am responding to a letter from Peter R. Wilkinson (Dec. 26).I want to 
congratulate Wilkinson for his advocacy of teaching values in the public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned that in teaching values, words might be used that resonate a 
religious tone and bring dogma into the picture where it does not belong. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that the teacher will emphasize that good values are not the exclusive 
domain of the religions and are not related to any rituals, legends, myths, 
traditions, vestments, visions, protocols, superstitions, prayers or fears of 
hell's fire and damnation. A practical value system adopted and used by all 
citizens can and should function entirely independent of any religious 
teachings.

HER TRUE COLORS AREN'T BLUE, GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Once again Georgia Frontiere has shown her true colors, and they're not blue 
and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Rams struggle through another poor season, it seems as if the Queen of 
the Golden Horns has chosen to either wallow in mediocrity or move to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that neither of those two options is good for the team or the 
thousands of dedicated Rams fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that there is only one option left -- sell the team!  
</P>
<P>
 If Georgia really has a collective spirit and a love for her cute boys in blue 
and gold, she should sell the team to someone who will strive to turn the Rams 
into a winning organization.

IN TRYING TIMES FOR CHARITIES, ELIMINATING WASTE IS CRUCIAL; $4 MILLION 
UNWISELY DONATED TO 3 AREA GROUPS COULD HAVE HELPED MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of articles last week by Times reporter Doug Smith -- "Charities in 
Need: The Declining Support for Valley Philanthropy" -- highlighted a tough 
situation. Many Valley-based charities are struggling with dramatic declines in 
donations and resources at a time when the demand for their services is greater 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, for example, the United Way Campaign's North Los Angeles 
Region distributed $5.9 million to its 63 affiliate agencies across the Valley. 
In 1993, however, that figure dropped to just $2.9 million. Meanwhile, on the 
front lines, there are groups such as MEND in the northeast Valley. It feeds 
and clothes the poor and has seen a 30% increase in its caseload. For three 
straight years, MEND has been spending more than it brings in, and it has 
nearly depleted its emergency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, this has also been a time of government retrenchment, 
with cutbacks in the state and local funding that recipients depend on to eke 
out a reasonable existence. That has swept folks like Clyde Rossberg out of a 
manageable fiscal situation and deeply into the red. Rossberg, who suffers from 
Lou Gehrig's disease, was evicted and forced to seek the help of the 
Independent Living Center when his state benefits check was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals have less to donate to charity because of the recession, and many 
of the businesses that have been such dependable contributors to charity in the 
past have scaled back their donations, moved, or ceased to exist. So, what 
should be done? 
</P>
<P>
 At such times, it is imperative that every dollar is donated as wisely as 
possible. Recently, however, more than $4 million in donations have rolled in 
to just three fund-raising groups situated in the Valley and its environs. 
About $600,000 of that went to a Burbank-based professional fund-raising group 
that passed on just $76,000 to its client charities. It kept the rest. Another 
$400,000 went to a Glendale fund-raising group that had been illegally using 
the name of a veterans organization. And $3 million went to a group that 
claimed it was collecting money for the Los Angeles Police Department. The LAPD 
didn't see a dime of the money. That $4 million could have wiped out the 
deficits of several local charities, had it been donated sensibly. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid such waste, call the city's Social Services Department at 
1-800-77-DONAT. It has files on thousands of reputable charities, including 
many in the Valley. You could also pick a charity that is well-known by friends 
or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 If you receive telephone solicitations, ask the callers whether they represent 
for-profit organizations, and ask how much of your contribution will go to the 
charity. They are required by law to answer you. Before you donate anything, 
ask them for a call-back number and an address. Those who refuse and offer to 
send a courier are often trying to avoid violating postal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And something else can be done, by the courts, oddly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Valley-based charities have been forced to devote more of their staffs to 
fund-raising activities, and some have had to cut back on the number of workers 
to reduce costs. In the past, many small-time offenders and those who had 
committed traffic violations had been been ordered to perform community service 
by Los Angeles municipal court judges. But the judges have largely moved in the 
opposite direction, leveling fines against those individuals. It might be very 
reasonable indeed if the judges took the city's deteriorating social service 
climate into consideration. Local charities could certainly use several more 
hours worth of helping hands.

AN ADDED PERSPECTIVE ON THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may have noticed that the title of this page changed three weeks ago, From 
"Valley Editorials" to "Valley Perspective." We're taking a moment to explain 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, The Times has produced a separate page of editorials on Sundays 
devoted to matters of interest to the San Fernando, Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys, and Glendale. But events often require immediate attention, such as 
the first reports, in November, of a serial child molester at large in the San 
Fernando Valley. The Times' first editorial on those crimes appeared on the 
following day, a Wednesday, and ran in every edition of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 On many occasions, the news that happens here is mirrored by events in other 
parts of Los Angeles or Southern California as a whole. At such times, an 
editorial addressing the problem of graffiti vandalism, for example, might 
highlight solutions that have worked here or in other parts of the state or the 
nation. Those Valley-area editorials frequently appear during the week, on The 
Times' main editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Valley Edition readers will now find it easier to locate these weekday 
editorials on matters of importance to them. They will be highlighted by the 
headline "Valley Perspective." To prevent confusion, the Sunday Valley Edition 
editorial page now carries the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another sign of our belief that the valleys and their environs have 
evolved into far more complex and diverse localities that are deserving of more 
attention, opinion, debate and comment.

NIMBY CRAZINESS KILLS BENEFICIAL DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I commend the column by Mr. Gideon Kanner entitled "When NIMBY Craziness 
Goes Bananas" (Valley Commentary, Dec. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 We developed the Center at Coldwater, including the Bistro Garden at 
Coldwater, which was referred to in Mr. Kanner's article.As experienced 
developers, we were fully aware of the existing zoning and its permitted uses 
when we purchased the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the irrational activities and baseless protests of a few neighbors 
and some of the neighboring homeowner groups not even located in Studio City, 
we encountered never-ending delays and tremendous architectural, construction 
and interest costs, which could not have been contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 It has reached the point in Los Angeles where any developer would have to be 
out of his mind to try to develop a shopping center or other commercial project 
anywhere on Ventura Boulevard from Studio City to Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless something changes for the better, the long-term result will be only 
old, unattractive buildings, which would be a shame for Ventura Boulevard, the 
San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles.

GUN VIOLENCE IS OUT OF CONTROL; A SINGLE DAY'S NEWS PROVIDES AMPLE REASONS FOR 
TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took only one day last week to present several reminders of the 
pervasiveness of guns and gun violence in our region. On Monday, a 14-year-old 
Sylmar boy was arraigned on charges of premeditated attempted murder, attempted 
robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the Dec. 15 
shooting of a Chatsworth High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, a timely bit of kindness eased a family's financial 
concerns, but not its pain. A Newhall mortuary decided to provide a casket, 
funeral service and burial free of charge to the family of Rayshaun Love. The 
family didn't have the money to pay for it. Love was shot and killed on Dec. 19 
when he tried to shield two girls from gunfire at a party. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, a federal judge raised to $350,000 the bail for a Valencia 
man who was accused of keeping such an arsenal of unregistered guns, ammunition 
and explosives in his house that 32 nearby homes were evacuated before all of 
it was removed. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the same pages that day, there was yet another indication of the fact 
that some folks just haven't gotten the point yet. It came from an interview 
with a Chatsworth gun instructor who said, "An armed society becomes a very 
polite society. Very polite." 
</P>
<P>
 But we are already living in the midst of one of the most heavily armed, free 
and so-called civilized societies in the history of humankind. There are some 
200 million firearms in circulation in the United States right now, and the 
number is continually on the rise. Since October, 500 people in Los Angeles 
County have died from gunshots. Gabriel Gettleson was wounded when he refused 
to give up his book bag to a robber. Love was killed when another teen-ager 
allegedly grew upset over spilled beer on his shoes and started shooting. And 
one wonders how safe a particular Valencia neighborhood felt when it was 
learned that one resident was so heavily armed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many guns in circulation that a detective with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department laughed bitterly when asked how youths might 
acquire one. "Everybody has them,' the detective said. "They are accumulated, 
stored, sold or traded on a daily basis. There is a general ease in obtaining 
them. Everybody seems to know who has them (guns). It's just like drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
 When gun possession is that easy, it ought to be painfully obvious that the 
gun problem has spiraled out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to end this type of senselessness and potential danger is to 
impose a near-total federal ban on the manufacture, sale and private possession 
of handguns and assault weapons. With few exceptions, possession should be 
restricted to law enforcement officers alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such a ban, the wishful "it can't happen here" map will continue to 
dwindle in size.

CSUN'S COUNSELING IMPROVEMENTS IGNORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My ragged dictionary defines "editorialize" as "to introduce opinion into 
the reporting of facts." Although opinion is certainly present in "Time for a 
Counseling Consolidation" (Los Angeles Times, Dec. 19) at least two important 
facts appear to be misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Cal State Northridge has since its inception been a commuter school: 
the full-time dorm resident, "fresh out of high school" student image portrayed 
in the editorial has never been representative of the average CSUN student. 
Until very recently, in fact, CSUN had no residential students. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the development of a more centralized and coordinated approach to 
academic advisement was proposed during the tenure of former President James 
Cleary by Dr. Elizabeth Berry, who was at that time associate vice president 
for academic programs. The recommendation was integrated into the WASC 
self-study of the campus by CSUN faculty and administrators as one way of 
improving academic advisement, and did not reflect the editorial's contention 
that academic advising "is an area in which CSUN has been particularly remiss." 
The implementation of this and other campus recommendations was delayed or 
deferred in large part as a result of personnel changes in the presidency and 
other campus administrative positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is perhaps commendable that the Los Angeles Times has finally 
discovered that Cal State Northridge exists, the extent to which this and other 
editorials and articles about CSUN have misrepresented "the facts" is 
troubling. San Fernando Valley residents and CSUN students might be better 
served by more accurate and thoughtful reporting and editorializing.

CHINESE DESERVE CREDIT FOR BUILDING RAILROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Probably few of the thousands who travel Highway 14 to and from the Antelope 
Valley realize they overlook the spot where the young city of Los Angeles was 
joined to Northern California, and ultimately the rest of the nation, by a rail 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lang Station article (Dec. 5) provided a historical glimpse of that 
momentous event and of the Chinese laborers who did the actual construction. 
However it failed to mention that a second monument exists at Lang, placed by 
the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California to honor more than 3,000 
Chinese who helped build the railroad and tunnel.

CITY OFFICIALS NEGLECT A DANGEROUS EYESORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is upsetting to see how continually callous the L.A. Department of 
Building and Safety is when it comes to Valley concerns. The area on the south 
side of Ventura Boulevard, between Woodman Avenue and Ventura Canyon Avenue, 
has been an eyesore and a danger to the community now for more than three 
years, but (the department) chooses to take no action. 
</P>
<P>
 It defiles the very essence of the community. It's a graffiti writer's nightly 
challenge, requiring constant vigilance by a committee to wipe out their 
scribblings. The Fire Department is often called to put out fires created by 
individuals who are living there. I personally have seen dope pushers openly 
selling their wares in the areas behind the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Building and Safety Department, none of this matters. I wonder 
whether it would make a difference if one of those worthies lived in the area?

COUNCILMAN DEFENDS EFFORTS TO STEM PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times has made factual misstatements and misleading comments in addition 
to missing the point of my efforts to deal with complaints about prostitution 
believed occurring in motels on Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 First, contrary to The Times' suggestion, I do not intend to pursue 
indiscriminate proceedings against 11 motels along Sepulveda Boulevard. I am 
not, to use the newspaper's words, on a "fishing expedition." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I have done what my constituents consistently tell me they expect me 
to do. I have responded directly to multiple complaints about criminal activity 
(in this case, prostitution) believed to be occurring in the community by 
seeking to use the city's resources to determine if such activity is occurring 
and, if it is, to abate it through well-established zoning practices. 
</P>
<P>
 After many months of constituent complaints about prostitution in and around 
several motels on Sepulveda Boulevard, I asked the zoning administrator to 
review the motels in that immediate vicinity to see if there were any 
conditions on their operation which were being violated or any required 
mitigation steps not being taken. (Though I did not see the list submitted to 
the zoning administrator, I was well aware of the problem and asked my staff to 
follow through). It is this process which will determine whether the 
community's complaints can be resolved through zoning actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 350 crime reports from the Police Department's Van Nuys station were 
submitted with my request, so the evidence indicated that a problem exists. In 
a few cases, the number of reported crimes was quite low; however, crime 
statistics offer only one view of a business's operation, and revocation 
actions can be undertaken because of impermissible activity -- such as the 
violation of a conditional-use permit or zoning variance conditions -- which 
may not be the subject of a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I am certainly not seeking to take action against responsible business 
operators, the fact is that there is no way to determine which are the 
responsible ones and which are allowing prostitution, unless the practices of 
each are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Los Angeles expect their elected officials to respond when 
neighborhoods are besieged by crime. They expect city government to extend a 
helping hand, and not turn a deaf ear, when complaints about neighborhood 
deterioration are made. I plan to continue helping them pursue it.

MCA EFFORT TO RELOCATE PROPOSED RAIL STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A recent letter writer (Dec. 12) takes MCA to task for supporting a new 
alternative location for the Universal City subway station. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, MCA would be happy if this new location were approved.And so too, would 
the hundreds of small retailers and other small businesses located in the 
Universal City area who would benefit from the commuters and tourists using the 
subway station. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents would benefit as well. There will be relief from added traffic 
congestion along Lankershim Boulevard if the station is built on the new site. 
And commuters coming and going will be able to park right next to the subway 
station, instead of in lots that are inconvenient and far removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new location would benefit virtually everyone. Lets hope the MTA makes the 
wisest decision and gives a "thumbs up" to this site.

 * I have just read about Universal Studios' request that a subway station 
proposed for the area around Lankershim and Ventura boulevards be located at 
its CityWalk attraction (Sept. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 Asking the tired workers to climb the hill to the studios is about as 
thoughtless as you can get. Yes, I think it would help their business on the 
hill, but is that the focus of the city's attention, or is it for the workers 
who must make this trip every day, unlike tourists at CityWalk? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the entire Valley supports resistance to this suggestion.

SOKA EXPANSION PLANS DESERVE A FAIR REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was amazed to see the Sierra Club, of all organizations, wrongly criticize 
the Soka University project as one of the worst developments in the area. This 
is the same group that did not stand up to, and even praised, Ahmanson, Micor, 
Baldwin and a lot of other developments that are incredibly more destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson project is grading 400 times more earth than Soka. Micor, which 
is right across the street from the campus, is removing five acres of native 
wetlands. It is also cutting into a wildlife corridor. Baldwin is removing 30 
times as many oak trees as Soka. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which has gleefully supported all of 
these projects, has consistently demonstrated its double standard when it comes 
to Soka University. 
</P>
<P>
 The university is providing a greater percentage of open space than even the 
Ahmanson project is setting aside, and in Soka's case the public won't have to 
pay for it. I think that the public is starting to see what the Conservancy is 
really up to now.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; LET'S PUT THE CARING BACK IN 'MANAGED CARE' MEDICINEH; A 
RECENT ENCOUNTER WITH A RESPECTED HMO AFTER AN AUTO ACCIDENT POINTS OUT THE 
FLAWS IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM OUR COUNTRY IS MOVING SO RAPIDLY TO ADOPT. DOCTORS 
DID NO HARM -- BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSELLE M. LEWIS, Roselle M. Lewis of Tarzana is a free-lance writer who 
teaches English at Pierce and Valley colleges. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I totaled my car recently, I worried more about auto insurance than 
medical insurance. For years I'd been covered by what is considered the 
country's best health maintenance organization, the group that promises 
comprehensive womb-to-tomb care. I'd had some checkups but hadn't used the 
system much. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, my first real encounter with the so-called "managed care" 
system toward which the country is moving so fast -- and which is the 
cornerstone of President Clinton's health care plan -- proved to be traumatic 
in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
 When the paramedics gingerly got me on a gurney, after I'd been knocked 
unconscious and was bleeding from the nose, I was told they had to head for the 
nearest hospital, not my health maintenance organization. Here I was given an 
EKG and X-rays which revealed no broken bones. A seemingly indifferent doctor 
chewed gum as he performed a one-minute exam and pronounced me "alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left alone for several hours until my husband could be reached, I shivered and 
floated in and out of consciousness. No one checked me or offered a blanket. 
Finally I summoned my strength and crept down the corridor to the bathroom like 
a wounded animal. In the mirror, I was horrified at my bloody face and cleaned 
myself with paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 When I returned to my cubicle, new patients filled the place. It was the hour 
of triage. I'd become a GOMER. "Get out of my emergency room" was written in 
every gesture of the attendant who stripped my sheet and threw my things on a 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
 I was discharged without pain medication because, the duty nurse explained, my 
HMO was now responsible. It would have been a blessing to be transferred to its 
hospital for a night of observation. But, cost-containment being the first 
consideration, I walked to our car dressed in blood-spattered shorts and blouse 
to spend a hellish night of incredible pain. 
</P>
<P>
 To my surprise, when I arrived at my HMO's urgent care department the next 
day, no one knew of my accident, though both hospitals had been in touch the 
night before. Someone asked why I hadn't brought my X-rays. We started from 
square one. Tests revealed a broken nose. "You might need surgery later," an 
anonymous doctor on duty commented, writing a prescription for pain killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I'd assigned this health plan both parts A and B of my Medicare 
coverage, I was a captive of the system and could not select my own doctor. My 
"primary physician," whom I'd been assigned about a year before and seen only 
once, didn't know me from Eve when he finally returned my call. When I asked to 
see an orthopedic specialist for my badly hurt right knee, he said to use ice 
packs and heat; later on he'd recommend physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost two months after my accident, neither orthopedist nor internist 
has checked me. It's been telephonic advice amounting to "take two aspirin and 
don't call me in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite my highly touted coverage, a flurry of bills has arrived in the mail 
with warnings to pay in 30 days. They total $1,700, including $150 for the 
gum-chewing emergency doc. At this point all parties engaged in managing my 
care seem bent chiefly on passing on the costs to my auto insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I'm fortunate to have survived and feel strong enough to write this. I 
can't prove my care was inadequate at any point along the way. But I wonder at 
the cold indifference of modern medicine. I wonder if I should have spent at 
least one night in a hospital after being knocked out in the crash -- or at 
least have had the benefit of an unhurried explanation from a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember my late uncle, Dr. Hymen Frank, who practiced on New York's Lower 
East Side for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiethnic patients filled his waiting room. A general practitioner, he made 
those long-lost house calls. Double-parking his Buick on narrow, snowy streets, 
he mounted flights of stairs to treat children with fevers, pregnant women, the 
elderly infirm. There was more medicine in his black bag than in all of today's 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We've come a long way with antibiotics, surgery and life-saving techniques. 
But for routine care, medicine is sadly deficient. As I experienced it, 
emergency room treatment proved an outrageous rip-off, whereas "health 
maintenance" is performed on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 We certainly need universal coverage for all Americans, but it ought to be 
patient-oriented and compassionate. The healing profession is in serious 
trouble when doctors follow only the first tenet of their profession, to do no 
harm.

MR. CLINTON GOES TO CANOGA PARK: NOTES ON A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT; THANKS TO THE 
LUCK OF THE DRAW, AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER WINS THE RIGHT TO WAIT HOURS FOR THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S ADDRESS TO ROCKETDYNE WORKERS ON THE FUTURE OF THEIR 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. JANOWSKI, Kenneth R. Janowski is an engineer at Rocketdyne. 
Clinton's visit to the Rocketdyne plant was Dec. 4. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Didja hear that President Clinton is gonna be at Rocketdyne on Saturday?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Bill Clinton would participate in a business round-table, then address 
Rocketdyne employees. An employee ticket lottery would be held first thing 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 I entered it. It isn't every day I can see the leader of the newly free world 
-- and, incidentally, the man who controls Rocketdyne's budget. I wanted to 
hear firsthand what he thought of defense conversion and the space station. A 
lot of futures, including mine, depend on this guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 9 a.m. Friday, the boss called to say that I was in. I can't exactly 
say today that I'm a Friend of Bill, but I did join the thousands of Americans 
who've had brushes with our hard-traveling President. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon I picked up my badge and instructions on what to wear (dress 
casually), where to park (the company lot), what not to bring (signs) and how 
to act (cooperative). 
</P>
<P>
 Some notes on The Event: 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 10:30 a.m. -- Arrival. Parking lot full. Line of employees snakes 
around lot into the cavernous building where many of them build space shuttle 
engines. I find parking place across the street at Topanga Plaza, walk past 
bunch of protesters, join line. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five minutes later -- Inside! Floor is packed in front of temporary 
dais. Company veeps elbow-to-elbow with bean counters. Manager in suit clings 
to massive milling machine, hanging onto control knob. Secretary balances 
precariously on toolbox, leaving machinist to deduce Monday why top is concave. 
I scramble atop hooded workbench to sit on a motor-housing cover. View mediocre 
but unobstructable, as real estate ads say. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon -- Rocketdyne VIP says Clinton is 20 minutes behind schedule. VIP's 
candor draws scattered polite applause. 
</P>
<P>
 12:20 -- VIP tries to quell restlessness by saying round-table is breaking up 
"even as I speak to you." Significant applause as he guarantees this is his 
last appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 12:47 -- Crowd fidgety, begins rhythmic clapping. I wonder if we'll do The 
Wave. 
</P>
<P>
 1:05 -- Machinist with "We Need Our Space" button speculates Clinton has 
detoured to Topanga Plaza food court. Lucky few in temporary bleachers wear 
sunglasses, shielding eyes from overhead lights. 
</P>
<P>
 1:20 -- Mike check by guy in dark suit. Applause. 
</P>
<P>
 1:25 -- Suit brings out glass of water. Sporadic, unenthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
 1:31 -- Suit conveys presidential seal to front of podium, installs, steps 
back for seal check, readjusts, departs. All eyes follow. Enthusiasm builds. 
Momentum is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 1:34 -- Mike check by suit. Rejuvenated crowd joins in count up to 3 and 
backward to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 1:36 -- Press photogs swarm platform near podium. Boos from workers with 
blocked views. 
</P>
<P>
 1:40 -- VIPs agglomerate. Dais resembles suit department. 
</P>
<P>
 1:47 -- No. 1 black suit tries to explain delay. I remember Clinton is always 
late, wonder if suit is official White House personal apologist. 
</P>
<P>
 1:50 -- Suit sets notes on podium. Perfunctory applause. 
</P>
<P>
 1:55 -- Authoritative voice intones, "Ladies and gentlemen, the President of 
the United States!" 
</P>
<P>
 1:55:15 -- "Looks just like him," someone says. Yep. 
</P>
<P>
 The President strode onto the dais accompanied by Rockwell International 
President Don Beall. Clinton's hair looked better than anyone else's in the 
place. The lesser president introduced the greater one while a translator for 
the hearing-impaired signed. Those of us off to the right could have benefited 
from sign language too, since despite all the mike checks, the vast shop 
swallowed up the President's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton launched into his speech and I cupped my hand to my ear. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 minutes, his hands chopping the air and his eyes darting occasionally to 
notes, he touched on defense conversion, taxes, employment, housing, jobs, the 
information superhighway, new technology, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, worker productivity, overseas marketing, technology reinvestment, 
fuel-efficient autos, health care, interest rates, the Brady bill, crime 
control, family disintegration, tariff reduction. Then he swung by defense 
conversion again. 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-speech, he waded into the crowd to press the flesh, with mike booms 
hanging over him like fishing poles angling for quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show didn't last long and the seating could have been better, but I left 
satisfied. He had endorsed both defense conversion and the space station and, 
more important, he had taken the time to address the people who designed and 
built the engines whose exhaust thawed the Cold War. These are folks who put 
footprints on the moon but are afraid of tomorrow's economic uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton didn't give us the Gettysburg Address, but he voiced concern for this 
country, its people and today's problems. We could do worse. 
</P>
<P>
 As I walked back to my car at Topanga Plaza, my fellow employees looked 
typically Southern California, stuck in the parking lot. These were probably 
the same people who got a good view and heard everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice was served.

FLYERS SPREAD MESSAGE OF HATE IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They seem to be everywhere, these vile racist flyers exhorting their readers 
to violence in defense of a white and pure nation. 
</P>
<P>
 They've shown up in school lockers and store-bought Christmas stockings from 
southern Los Angeles to Ventura County, in popcorn packages and children's 
crayon boxes and backpacks, in soda 12-packs and pantyhose containers. 
</P>
<P>
 They ask, "Is the White Race Extinct?" and contain a vitriolic message about 
how Los Angeles and the nation are being overrun by fast-breeding immigrant 
"mud people" who beat, rape and murder white men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say books in county libraries and bookstores also have been 
stamped with similar hatemongering messages. Some, like the flyers, urge 
readers to call a hot line linked to the White Aryan Resistance, or WAR, and to 
give the racial separatist group money and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares me," said one woman who found a flyer in an Agoura Hills Thrifty 
store and who asked not to be identified. "Even though it's a minority, it's a 
very violent minority. I don't like them being around." 
</P>
<P>
 The most current flyer, similar to other flyers calling for racial separatism 
found in the past, pose several conundrums for authorities. Among them: Why 
bother investigating the passing out of flyers that appear to be protected by 
the First Amendment, no matter how hateful? And how can you tell whether the 
threats are real if you don't know who is passing out the flyers, or who is 
reading them? "Some people just like to state their bigoted opinion and that's 
enough," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Kay Shafer, who monitors hate 
crime activity. "Other people go further." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows if the flyers are the work of one or two racial separatists with 
a lot of time on their hands or organized hate groups. But some authorities 
worry they may signal that such groups are becoming more active and 
camouflaging their activities by hiding behind unsigned recruitment flyers and 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another concern: With the recent arrest of several self-described 
Fourth Reich Skinheads -- suspected of plotting to kill Rodney King and to 
commit other violent acts and murders to incite a race war -- authorities now 
fear some elements of this radical fringe are far more dangerous than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers have prompted stores across the county -- especially in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys -- to scour their shelves and pull 
down whole product lines, at least until they could examine them. Headquarters 
of some major supermarkets and other stores have notified their managers to 
alert employees and security. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also on the lookout, to see if there are links between those 
spreading leaflets and the ever-increasing number of hate crimes throughout the 
area. Such links are nearly impossible to prove, they say. And catching vandals 
defacing books and passing out flyers takes time away from investigating 
violent crimes, and results in misdemeanor prosecutions at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are masters of staying right on the edge, skirting the law," 
said Glendale Police Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen, an expert in WAR-affiliated white 
supremacists, who he says have been active recently in the foothills around Los 
Angeles. "By and large, they're not real swift. But they are dangerous. . . . 
Certain simple-minded individuals are swayed by the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have been found sporadically since at least last summer, the 
flyers have been showing up with increasing frequency since Dec. 11, when five 
of them were found in a Lucky market in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen stores have been hit, some as recently as last week. They 
include Lucky, Vons and Ralphs markets, Toys R Us and drugstores such as 
Sav-On, Longs and Thrifty, police said. But no one knows how widespread the 
problem is because few customers report the flyers and no police agency is 
collecting regional statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say most flyer activity has been in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys, and that they have been flooded with calls, from stores and 
from concerned shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer, tapped by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to be his hate crime coordinator, 
is working with various police departments to investigate the flyers. And she 
is trying to determine if those distributing leaflets can be charged with 
crossing the line from free speech into committing hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, lead prosecutor of the Fourth Reich 
defendants, said he too is looking into the flyers to see if those passing them 
out can be prosecuted under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Such flyers, as crude and juvenile as they may seem, he said, can often be a 
precursor to far more nefarious doings. Greenberg said the teen-age Fourth 
Reich members' involvement in the white supremacist movement escalated from 
passing out similar flyers with referrals to the WAR hot line and other groups 
to painting swastikas to violence -- including at least one firebombing and 
plans to blow up the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that is clear is that these kids do not come up with these 
thoughts on their own," Greenberg said. "Someone is influencing them." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Shafer said, she has had to tell police from all over the 
county that there is little they can do unless property is physically damaged 
or a flyer is targeted specifically at a minority person. Even then, a 
misdemeanor vandalism charge usually is all that can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some laws prohibit people from tampering with products. Another misdemeanor 
code prohibits people from using "offensive words in a public place which are 
inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction." That law 
apparently has not been tested in such cases. And authorities would have to 
catch someone in the act before deciding to prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," said Sheriff's Detective Jerry Johnson in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, who has received many reports of racist flyers. "These things 
take days to investigate and we don't have the time. But you can't ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is freedom of speech," Johnson said, "but you still can't say fire in a 
movie theater or say something that will incite violence. And this advocates 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the most recent flyer is certainly enough to prompt a violent 
reaction. It contains a crude drawing of a pregnant Latina with a baby that is 
already pregnant, saying minorities are reproducing so fast that whites are in 
jeopardy. "It is trying to destroy you," the flyers say of the rising minority 
population, "and it will succeed unless you fight back VIOLENTLY." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer advocates the expulsion, within 30 days, of all nonwhites from the 
United States, to preserve the purity of the Aryan race. And it urges everyone, 
particularly women, to take matters into their own hands: "You may not have the 
strength to swing a bat, but you can buy a large can of Mace," and spray any 
white person and minority seen in public together. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone number on the flyer leads to another number of the WAR hot line. WAR 
is run by former state Ku Klux Klan leader Tom Metzger, a toupee-wearing 
television repairman who lives an hour north of San Diego and boasts of having 
followers all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger keeps in touch with WAR followers in Los Angeles, he said in an 
interview, and sometimes visits the area. Most notably, he came to the Valley 
in 1983 for a WAR cross burning, for which he was arrested. Three years later, 
he led a controversial meeting for local WAR members at a popular San Fernando 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, he has limited his direct involvement with WAR 
followers after a Portland, Ore., jury found him personally liable for $12.5 
million for inciting skinheads who later confessed to beating an Ethiopian man 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger, 54, now promotes a "leaderless revolution" in which he isn't visible 
enough to be a lightning rod for civil and legal troubles. Although he says he 
knows many of the WAR activists in Los Angeles, Metzger said he does not 
control them or urge them to commit violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying one group is responsible would be giving me too much credit," he said. 
"But we do our little bit to make white people aware of the dangers they are 
facing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure material gets distributed all over the country with our name stamped 
on it," Metzger said, "and for the most part, we say that's great. I've done it 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Some watchdog groups fear WAR leaders stay an arm's length away from 
committing violence by using impressionable followers to carry out their goals. 
The Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith has long accused WAR of trying to 
expand by recruiting skinheads and other impressionable youngsters through 
flyers and other means. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take whatever action is possible to stop these people," the ADL's 
Valley coordinator, Mary Krasn, said of the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, police are seeking a warrant for the arrest of one man in connection 
with an incident at Simi Valley High School in which he punched a janitor who 
tried to stop him from putting the racist flyer in student lockers at night. 
The suspect, Allan Carlson, 30, of Glendale, was arrested in August on 
suspicion of vandalizing books in a Covina bookstore with hate messages. Police 
said they also found racist paraphernalia in his car, along with a list of 
targeted stores from around the county. Carlson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities say one man couldn't have put out all the flyers that have 
been found recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me sick," said an employee of a Sav-On, who found some of the first 
flyers. "I couldn't believe it. Especially out here. I always felt really 
comfortable about the people living in this community." Hate Flyers 
</P>
<P>
 Recent incidents related to racist flyers and other acts of vandalism in 
northern Los Angeles County include: 
</P>
<P>
 February, 1989 -- Vandals spray-paint swastikas and "Skins Are Back" on an 
Encino temple and put WAR stickers, reading "White men built this nation and 
white men are this nation," in mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 April 21, 1992 -- About 150 anti-Semitic and anti-black flyers are placed in 
lockers at Nobel Junior High School in Northridge, linked to a group called the 
National Socialist White American Party. 
</P>
<P>
 June 4, 1992 -- Racist flyers are found inside lockers at Burbank High School, 
containing anti-black and anti-female messages and phone numbers for the WAR 
hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 21, 1993 -- About 180 notebooks are pulled from K mart stores in Burbank 
and Sunland after customers find white supremacist messages in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 28, 1993 -- Allan E. Carlson, 30, of Glendale, is arrested at a Covina 
market on suspicion of vandalism. Police say he was using a rubber stamp to 
imprint white supremacist messages in dozens of notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 2, 1993 -- A black Saugus High School student is beaten by a group of 
white students who taunted him with racial slurs, a day after he gave a speech 
in class about the dangers of racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 11, 1993 -- Five flyers attacking Latinos and other nonwhites are 
discovered stuffed inside soda packs at a Lucky supermarket in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 11, 1993 -- Flyers are found, including one in a Christmas stocking, at a 
Sav-On drugstore in Canyon Country; one woman returns with it, saying she 
almost gave it unwittingly to her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 12, 1993 -- Flyers are found in children's backpacks at a Target store in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 15, 1993 -- Flyers are found in cosmetic products at a Ralphs in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 22, 1993 -- Flyers are discovered in 12-packs of beer at a Lucky store 
and in soda 12-packs at a Vons in Palmdale.

HATE CRIMES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after making a classroom speech about racial equality at Saugus High 
School a month ago, 17-year-old Mohamed Mostafa was assaulted by a group of 
white teen-agers who taunted him with racial slurs and then beat him up on his 
way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said keep your mouth shut," while punching and kicking him, Mohamed 
recalls. "And go back to Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 He said in an interview that he did not recognize the six or seven youths, and 
that he didn't think they went to Saugus High or belonged to the several 
student groups there "that don't like other races." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a hate crime? 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure, but the FBI and detectives in the Santa Clarita 
Sheriff's Station are investigating to see. Were followers of white supremacist 
groups or skinheads involved? Did racist flyers motivate the attackers? 
</P>
<P>
 No one can say, although one sheriff's deputy says the incident appears 
unrelated to the flyers. But as is frequently the case when it comes to hate 
crime, authorities say it is nearly impossible to determine what drives such an 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there have been many other incidents that could be considered hate 
crimes in Los Angeles, "It's kind of a hidden crime," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kay Shafer. "People tend to think, 'Oh, I got beaten up, robbed, my home was 
vandalized.' A lot of times they don't recognize that the motive was bias or 
racism. A lot of times law enforcement doesn't recognize it either." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has made hate crimes a top priority in his fledgling 
administration, Shafer said, after years of disjointed monitoring by 
prosecutors and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles Police Department tracks them, few other police 
agencies in the state log hate crimes: An FBI report issued last January showed 
that California lags far behind most other states in implementing the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act of 1990, which calls for such monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 New York state, for instance, had 773 participating police agencies that 
logged 943 hate crime incidents in 1991, and even Iowa had 201 agencies that 
reported 89 incidents. But only two police agencies in California participated, 
reporting five crimes, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 And white supremacist groups such as WAR -- the White Aryan Resistance -- now 
practice "leaderless resistance," in which no one takes credit for any 
conspiratorial behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very, very difficult," to link hate groups to specific crimes, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, "and it is by design." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith opened a special Valley 
satellite office in November after it determined that half of all the 
complaints from the several counties that make up the regional district come 
from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches and temples have been vandalized, people get threatening messages and 
flyers and crosses have been burned on lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to regard the Valley as being immune to those sort of 
influences," said the ADL's Mary Krasn. "We're not."

NIGHTMARE BECOMES DREAM; ORANGE BOWL: AFTER YEARS OF BEING HAUNTED BY MISSED 
KICKS IN BIG GAMES, FLORIDA STATE FINALLY IS THE BENEFICIARY IN 18-16 VICTORY 
OVER NEBRASKA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a game for the ages, or more precisely, a game that aged Bobby Bowden 
and anyone else who survived Florida State's 18-16 victory over a Nebraska team 
that probably is being treated for shock. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre ending that crammed enough emotion, tension and confusion to last 
a lifetime, the No. 1 Seminoles watched in agony as Nebraska kicker Byron 
Bennett's 45-yard attempt sailed high and left of the uprights as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 21 seconds earlier, Florida State freshman Scott Bentley had kicked his 
fourth field goal of Saturday evening, a 22-yarder that put the Seminoles ahead 
by two. The national championship that Bowden craved, the one that had eluded 
him for his 28-year career, finally seemed his for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing comes easy for the 64-year-old coach, who saw the Seminoles 
penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after Bentley's go-ahead kick. Instead of 
kicking from its 35-yard line, Florida State had to tee off from its 20. Dan 
Mowrey's kick squirted into Kareem Moss' hands, and he returned it to the 
Nebraska 43 with 14 seconds remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornhusker quarterback Tommie Frazier's first pass fell incomplete. Seven 
seconds were left. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier dropped back for a final desperation pass. He found tight end Trumane 
Bell open down the middle of the field. The completion to Bell covered 29 
yards. Better yet for the Cornhuskers, Bell's knee touched the Orange Bowl turf 
with one second remaining on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no one knew that at first. According to the scoreboard, there was 
no time left to play. Florida State fans stormed the field. Seminole players 
happily danced away. Bowden, soaked after an ice water shower, began to make 
his way across the field in search of Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, after about a five-minute delay, officials shooed the teams of the 
turf, placed the ball at the Florida State 28-yard line, put one second on the 
clock and then watched history take its course. 
</P>
<P>
 A stunned, confused Bowden returned to the sidelines. Meanwhile, Osborne 
called a timeout, Nebraska's last, and then sent Bennett onto the field for the 
kick. If he makes it, Osborne wins his first national championship and ends a 
six-game bowl losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett missed. Florida State, which had lost at least two shots at national 
titles because of missed field-goal tries in recent years, savored the sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we finally won one when someone missed a kick," Bowden said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornhusker players dropped to the ground in exhausted disbelief. What had been 
theirs -- a lead, an undefeated season and a national title -- was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we win or lose this one?" Bowden said. "It's hard to believe you won the 
doggone game. Every time I looked up, someone else was winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is left to the poll voters. Florida State ends its season 12-1, its 
only loss at the hands of Notre Dame at South Bend in mid-November. As for the 
Irish, they beat Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl on Saturday and finished their 
season with an 11-1 record, the defeat coming at home against Boston College. 
Previously undefeated West Virginia blew its opportunity at the title when it 
was routed by Florida, 41-7, in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz will argue that his team deserves the championship 
because of the victory over the Seminoles. And who could blame him? Bowden 
offered another view. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would I tell the voters?" Bowden said. "So if it comes down to us and 
Notre Dame, I personally feel like Florida State and Notre Dame are the two 
best teams in the country. I think you need to take the championship on the 
basis of the season, not one ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think Florida State should win a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 If it happens, the Seminoles will forever remember their final drive of the 
season. It began at the Florida State 35 with 1:46 to play. It ended with 
Bentley's winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
 But in between, there was Orange Bowl MVP Charlie Ward completing passes when 
it counted the most. And then, when Nebraska could least afford a mistake, 
there was cornerback Barron Miles committing a personal foul against tailback 
Warrick Dunn long after the Seminole player had run out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-hit infraction helped move the ball to the Nebraska 18. Two plays 
later, Ward lofted a ball for wide receiver Kez McCorvey, who had safety Toby 
Wright draped on his back. Pass interference and first and goal at the Nebraska 
three. One play after that, Bentley kicked the field goal that fulfilled the 
remaining gap in Bowden's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was just our time," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain symmetry to Florida State's victory against the 
Cornhuskers. Fourteen years ago in Lincoln, Neb., Bowden brought his 
little-known team to Memorial Stadium and scored an 18-14 victory against the 
then-No. 3 Cornhuskers. Bowden would later call it the biggest victory of his 
career, a claim that didn't surprise Nebraska defensive coordinator Charlie 
McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a lot of people in business, let's put it that way," McBride said 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bowden will have to amend his list. As usual, he has Nebraska to thank. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. Despite the bloated point spread, the 
Cornhuskers truly believed that this year's game would be different. Frazier, 
one of the best option quarterbacks in the nation, had a full season's worth of 
experience. The last time he faced Florida State, the nervous Frazier had 
played in only six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the new and improved Nebraska defense, which had been 
redesigned with the Florida States and Miamis in mind. Gone was the traditional 
five-man defensive front, replaced by a 4-3 setup that took advantage of the 
Cornhuskers' speed and star linebacker Trev Alberts. In fact, Seminole 
linebacker coach Jim Gladden had visited Nebraska's spring practice last year 
and shared some of Florida State's 4-3 secrets with the Cornhusker staff. 
</P>
<P>
 And as always there was the beefy Nebraska offensive line, which this time 
outweighed Florida State's defensive line by an average of 32 pounds, and an 
I-back to be proud of, 1,000-yard rusher Calvin Jones. Nebraska coaches had 
hoped to do what Notre Dame did in its Nov. 13 upset of the Seminoles -- that 
is, control the ball on the ground, use the option and pass only when 
necessary. It worked for the Irish, who gained 239 rushing yards and scored 
four times by the run. 
</P>
<P>
 But something happens to Nebraska when it reaches the postseason. Maybe it is 
the quality of competition or simply the weight of their bowl losing streak. 
Whatever the reason, the Cornhuskers have made losing a New Year's tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Saturday night's game, Nebraska hadn't led a bowl game since the 
second quarter of the 1990 Fiesta Bowl. The whole thing has become as 
predictable as harvest time: The Cornhuskers, at least during the previous six 
bowls, would arrive with gaudy statistics and promptly commit double the 
turnovers and gain half the yards they averaged during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the Cornhuskers played as well, if not better than, Florida State. 
But they also made those key errors -- Frazier, who finished 13 of 24 for 206 
yards and one touchdown, threw two interceptions, including a killer late in 
the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberts did his part -- three sacks -- and the Cornhuskers had five in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones got hurt, but true freshman Lawrence Phillips filled in nicely, gaining 
64 yards and rushing for one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they couldn't win. They quieted the oddsmakers and critics who had said 
Florida State deserved to be a 17-point favorite, but when they had their 
chance, the Cornhuskers were unable to leave with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Florida State center Clay Shiver knew something that the oddsmakers 
didn't: Nebraska was no pushover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to put them away early, but it's not going to happen," Shiver said 
as kickoff approached. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, not much of anything happened in the first half -- 
especially a Florida State runaway. The Seminoles, who had worried that gaudy 
point spread would motivate Nebraska, soon discovered that the Cornhuskers were 
serious about ending their bowl slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hint that there would be no blowout occurred during Florida State's 
second possession of the game. With the ball on the Nebraska 10-yard line, the 
Seminoles proceeded to lose 20 yards in three plays. To make matters worse, the 
inconsistent Bentley missed a 47-yard attempt wide left to end the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two minutes remaining in the first period, the Cornhuskers saw 
a 71-yard punt return nullified by an illegal block. It cost Nebraska a 
touchdown that in the end proved decisive.

<P>
 No eye is dry today, from Omaha to Ogallala, from Grand Island to Lincoln. The 
University of Nebraska had the national championship, gave it back, got it back 
and then saw it fly away again, all in a span of 76 seconds, in an Orange Bowl 
game Saturday night that provided college football with a season that was 
thrilling until its final play. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing splendidly, overcoming injuries, overcoming the odds, making fools of 
those who suggested they had no business being on the same field with Florida 
State, the inspired Cornhuskers came as close as can be to being undefeated and 
traveling home to the heartland with joy in their hearts. Had Byron Bennett's 
last-second kick been a wee bit straighter, Nebraskans today would be sitting 
not in the middle of America but on top of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they collapsed into prone positions at midfield, writhing in anguish 
as happy fans from Florida State danced all around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Out there among the fallen was Lawrence Phillips, an 18-year-old from West 
Covina who came through when Nebraska needed him most, running for the 
touchdown that put his school back in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Out there also was Trev Alberts, as good a linebacker as the college game has, 
who personally put Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward flat on his back three 
times as part of Nebraska's five-sack quarterback attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Out there was Tommie Frazier, the elusive Nebraska quarterback who originally 
hails from Florida, who slipped through holes beautifully on quarterback draws, 
found his receivers when time was all but up and arguably outplayed Ward in the 
game of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of them were out there, more than a hundred Nebraska players who 
dressed for the game, who gave their all on the field or yelled for those who 
did. There was Calvin Jones, the fine tailback who strapped his pads back on 
after throwing his shoulder out of joint. There was Abdul Muhammad, the 
sure-handed little pass-catcher from Compton who was taken to the locker room 
needing X-rays on his ribs. Somewhere there was even Lorenzo Brinkley, the 
senior linebacker whose last game for Nebraska left him with a busted leg. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them gave all they had. 
</P>
<P>
 Few had given them a chance. Some had not even taken them seriously. One of 
Florida State's cornerbacks, Clifton Abraham, had gone so far as to mock the 
typical Nebraska player in the days before the game, describing one as a "big 
boy, probably drives an old pickup truck, a '76, a little rust . . . overalls, 
probably a hat, straw in his mouth, chewin' his chaw." Abraham had to find out 
the hard way how tough these big boys were, spending much of the night getting 
his chaw chewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier found receivers whenever and wherever he needed them. He even found 
Reggie Baul, another 5-8 peanut who along with Muhammad and Corey Dixon form 
what is known around Lincoln as the "Itty-Bitty Committee," a trio of 
pint-sized pass receivers. Aiming for one target, Frazier's pass was tipped 
into the fingertips of Baul, the first ball Baul had caught in six games, for 
an immaculate reception of a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 That one gave notice that Nebraska was not going to get pounded by four or 
five touchdowns, the way so many had moronically forecast. Take, for example, 
Jim Mandich, the former Miami Dolphin player, who in a local television segment 
on the eve of the game called the Cornhuskers "fraudulent, phony . . . this 
isn't much of a national championship game." Like heck it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 On came Phillips, the true freshman who had dazzled UCLA with 137 yards 
rushing near the beginning of the season. He split a seam in the Florida State 
defense and ran into the end zone practically untouched, and suddenly Nebraska 
was a two-point conversion away from tying the score. It was the sort of run he 
had done so many times for Coach Tony Zane while at Baldwin Park High, where he 
had scored 25 such touchdowns and rushed for 1,752 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier was doing it all, faking reverses, finding receivers. After he failed 
to run across the extra points himself, all Frazier wanted was one more crack, 
and he got it with the clock winding down. He pitched to Phillips on an option 
play that sprang for 17 yards to the Nebraska 37. He passed to Clester Johnson 
for a first down at the Florida State 48. He ran a quarterback draw for eight 
more yards, then made a 19-yard connection aided by a facemask penalty that 
moved the football four yards shy of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett kicked the field goal that gave Nebraska everything -- the game, the 
unbeaten season, the national title. Nobody dreamed that Nebraska would let 
Florida State get back in the game with two costly, ghastly penalties. Same as 
nobody dreamed that Nebraska would come back again , finding Trumane Bell, 
calling time just in the nick of time, giving Bennett a chance to be a hero 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no justice for Bennett, who graduated last month with a degree 
in criminal justice. His kick veered wide to the left. Nebraska was defeated, 
then victorious, then defeated. It was as good a football game as most of the 
Cornhuskers were capable of playing. It is a game it will take them a lifetime 
to forget.

ROSE BOWL / WISCONSIN BADGERS 21, UCLA BRUINS 16; BADGERS LOVE HOME COOKIN'; 
WISCONSIN EATS UP UCLA'S TURNOVERS AND HOLDS ON, 21-16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA talked some trash, then littered the field with footballs. Wisconsin took 
out the trash and the Bruins, 21-16, in the 80th Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 After living by the turnover all season, UCLA died by it Saturday, with a Rose 
Bowl-record five fumbles and an intercepted pass. Add 95 yards in penalties, 
and it was really ugly for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they might have been guilty of believing their own reputation and 
that of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking trash from the warm-ups on," said Badger wide receiver Lee 
DeRamus, who was among four players ejected after a third-quarter fight that 
began after UCLA had stopped a fourth-and-one play on the 10-yard line. "They 
were saying, 'We're going to kick your . . . . 'We'll show you how to play 
physical' and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strange thing to do at a road game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the approach that it was a home game for us," Wisconsin Coach Barry 
Alvarez said. "That's why we chose that locker room. We walked on the field and 
I told them, 'Isn't Camp Randall painted up great today?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Enough Wisconsin fans got Southern California's toughest ticket in years to 
lend no less than an emotional balance among the 101,237 at the Rose Bowl, 
UCLA's home stadium during the regular season. The Badgers wore their home red 
and, defying tradition, told UCLA they would use the home dressing room at the 
stadium, sending the Bruins on the road, about 150 feet, to the other corner of 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 That home dressing room made a great place for a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our fault," said UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, whose voice came back 
Saturday morning after a week of flu and a sore throat. "We didn't score enough 
early and take those fans out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook passed for 288 yards and tried to rally the Bruins in the final minute. 
But he was tackled at the Wisconsin 15 instead of throwing the ball away with 
15 seconds to play and time ran out on UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins took a 3-0 lead on Bjorn Merten's 27-yard field goal that ended a 
drive in which UCLA was penalized 25 yards, 15 of them for a personal foul when 
wide receiver J.J. Stokes -- who caught 14 balls for 176 yards, both Rose Bowl 
records -- slapped Kenny Gales in the helmet for holding a tackle too long out 
of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin came back on the running of Brent Moss, the game's most valuable 
player with 158 yards in 36 carries. He got three of those on a touchdown run 
that capped a 78-yard drive that included a pass interference penalty on Teddy 
Lawrence in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Badgers' longest scoring drive all day. UCLA helped shorten the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept shooting ourselves in the foot," Cook said. "That's the bottom line 
of this game. We had six turnovers, and we beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin had plenty to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain the turnovers," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "We lead the 
country in turnover ratio the whole year, and we get in the biggest game of the 
year and turn the ball over six times. I believe it's a combination of their 
good playing and nervousness on our part that worked against us." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems started in the second quarter, when first the Bruins and then 
Wisconsin exchanged interceptions -- only the fourth of the season thrown by 
Cook -- and UCLA had the ball at its 32-yard line with a third-and-six play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook hit Stokes, who had the first down, but in his haste to get loose from 
the Badgers' Jeff Messenger, Stokes got loose from the football. Lamark 
Shackerford recovered for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight plays later, the Badgers had a 14-3 lead on Moss' one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, we really played a good second half," Cook said. "We 
got the team to where we could win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's fumble when sacked by Wisconsin's Carlos Fowler cut off UCLA's 
second-half-opening drive at the Badger eight. Wisconsin then went the other 
way until the drive ended on fourth down at the UCLA 10 and was followed by 
fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin defensive backs Marvin Goodwin and Donovan Gallatin were ejected at 8:16 
of the third quarter. Also going to the sideline were Wisconsin's DeRamus and 
Mark Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin and DeRamus had been rivals in high school in New Jersey, "but we 
weren't that close," DeRamus said. "We were never as close as we were in that 
scuffle on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
 Back UCLA came, from its 10, moving downfield to the Wisconsin 33. Again, Cook 
faded, being hit by Rob Lurtsema and fumbling, with Henry Searcy recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come back to why we got inside the 30 and didn't get points," 
Donahue said, "and why we got inside our own 30 and gave up points. It's going 
to come back to that." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ricky Davis scored on a 12-yard run to cut it to 14-10, it came back to 
that. Davis fumbled on the UCLA 34, and five plays later Wisconsin quarterback 
Darrell Bevell scrambled 21 yards for a touchdown and a 21-10 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 After another fumble, Cook led UCLA on a 15-play, 90-yard drive. Mike Nguyen's 
five-yard reception, his first collegiate touchdown, cut the Bruins' deficit to 
21-16 with 3:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough time, given a defensive stand. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough time, given Brent Moss. He ran five consecutive times, once 
for a first down, but was stopped short and the Badgers punted the ball away. 
UCLA had the ball at its 38 with 1:43 to play and no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook told the Bruin huddle, "We're going to win it." He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Passes over the middle to Brian Allen and Stokes, a run by Cook and another 
pass to Allen moved the ball to the Wisconsin 31. 
</P>
<P>
 An incomplete pass and a penalty made it third down with 25 seconds to play, 
and a pass to Stokes for 18 yards put the ball on the Badger 18 with 15 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 15 seconds to go and no timeouts, a quarterback's the only person who 
can pull off the job," Donahue said. "Wayne faced two options: one, throw the 
ball into the ground and kill the clock; and two, call for a pass into the end 
zone. He elected to call the pass in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook looked for a receiver and found none. He tried to make something out of 
nothing, running for three yards and out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have thrown the ball into the ground," he said. "It was my mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 It ended a game of mistakes and the Bruins' eight-game bowl winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It began a celebration, Wisconsin acknowledging its first 10-victory season, 
first Rose Bowl victory in its first Pasadena appearance in 31 years and the 
first question of what are you going to do for an encore for Alvarez, who in 
four seasons has taken the Badgers from 1-10 to the Big Ten championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "A victory like this naturally gives our program a lot of credibility," he 
said. "I start recruiting Monday. I've got three home visits out here . . . and 
it's an awful lot better if you win a bowl game when you go into a living room. 
It gives you credibility and gets you into the living rooms of some of the top 
players in the country."

JIM MURRAY: THIS TIME, 'RUBES' PLAY WITH OWN DICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Listen! Do you ever like to see a hustler get hustled? Like to see some guy 
climb off a load of pumpkins and pick the shell with the pea under it that the 
dealer thought wasn't there? 
</P>
<P>
 You would have liked Saturday's 80th Rose Bowl game. You get the sense that 
was the story of the New Year's game? 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin Badgers came out here and got a reception as the kind of guys 
you sell the Brooklyn Bridge or Florida swampland to. You know, guys you lure 
in the pool hall and say, "You wanta break, kid?" Or you pull out your deck of 
cards and say, "I'll deal." You sell them vegetable peelers that won't cut 
carrots, watches that can't tell time, rings that turn green on their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the image of Wisconsin. Cheeseheads. With brains to match. Guys who 
went around wearing a block of Brie on their haircuts and talking with the slow 
brogue of the town they pronounced, "M'wacky." The original big butter-and-egg 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The wise guys were rubbing their hands at the news they were coming to the 
Rose Bowl. They drove the price of tickets into the stratosphere. Rose Bowl 
ducats which went begging the last couple of years went for $500 a seat. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, look how they got flimflammed. They thought that just because they 
sent their checks, they got seats. Ha! Gullible, right? Marks. Pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute! Listen to their football coach before the game: "They 
(UCLA) just have a different kind of athlete than the Big Ten has. They look 
like a bunch of thoroughbreds. I don't mean to put the Big Ten down, but UCLA 
just doesn't have pluggers like you see in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that a perfect con? Is this guy onto them? Has he got his own deck? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes. The stingers got stung. The slickers outslickered. The bumpkins 
turned the tables on the wise guys. They turned over their hole cards and they 
were aces, and they said wickedly, "Are these any good?" They ran the table on 
the Fast Eddies. Sneaked their own dice into the game and faded the shooter. 
Sold their vegetable peelers to the guy on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to think the Bruins went into this thing thinking they had all the 
edge. Their own deck, a mirror on the ceiling, a rigged wheel. Any time a 
Pacific Coast team looks across a line of scrimmage and sees Ohio State or 
Michigan is not there, it presses the bet. It relaxes. It got a bye. Wisconsin 
had never won out here. Why should it start now? Piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
 So, UCLA started out with the kind of bored disinterest of a guy playing poker 
with his mother. The Bruins seemed more bemused than challenged. You would have 
thought it was San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, meanwhile, had stacked the deck in another category. From the 
cascade of red that rose from the stands, it is safe to say three out of every 
four persons in the crowd was from or for Wisconsin. "I told the players this 
was a home game for us," Alvarez boasted after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say UCLA was overconfident. But every gambler in the country 
threw out the fact Wisconsin finished five or six places ahead of UCLA in the 
national polls and installed UCLA as a seven-point favorite. Rodney Dangerfield 
gets more respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin beat the odds, beat the Bruins and left town with the pot, playing 
smart, quick, resourceful football. 
</P>
<P>
 They picked UCLA's pockets. The Bruins turned the ball over six times. Some 
times it was their own fault. But just as often the fingerprints in the crime 
were Wisconsin's. The story of the game was that the funny little team from the 
cornfields, the egg-candlers outwitted -- and outplayed -- the guys in the 
checked suits. The wise guys went home in the barrel. They never did get the 
egg money. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was ultimately decided by one of Murray's Immutable Laws of Football. 
That is this: On an obvious passing situation in today's game, a quarterback 
with the ball can help himself to 15 to 20 yards running the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness Saturday's Rose Bowl game. It is the fourth quarter, 11 minutes to 
play. The score is 14-10 but UCLA is coming. The Bruins have just opened the 
quarter scoring to close the gap to four points. A Wisconsin drive sputters and 
the Badgers have to punt. But UCLA fumbles. A couple of plays later, on an 
obvious pass setting, quarterback Darrell Bevell drops back to throw. About 
nine Bruins drop back to cover. Bevell pulls down the ball and sets sail. He 
goes 21 yards and into the end zone for the touchdown that wins the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Wisconsin called every hand, saw the raise, hid its openers, threw sevens 
when it had to. It made UCLA put the ball in the air 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, the Badgers won the war with a surprise weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Moss couldn't figure to terrify the Bruins in the exchange films. He 
might be a household word north of Sheboygan, but he wasn't big in the Heisman 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, he's only 5 feet 9. He doesn't run, he scoots. UCLA had 
difficulty finding him -- and difficulty holding onto him when they did. He ran 
through them for 158 yards and, as much as anybody, was the difference 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the guys from the place where they milk the cows and mow the hay had the 
last call. "I'll play these," they said, and UCLA had to fold. You had the 
feeling they had run in their own deck on the riverboat guys and every time the 
Bruins lost the ball -- which was a lot -- the "rubes" were the guys holding it 
up and saying sweetly, "Is this what you're looking for? Aw, too bad. You 
should take better care of it."

RAIDERS' PLAYOFF CHANCES ARE VARIED AND CONFUSING; PRO FOOTBALL: BUT THIS MUCH 
IS CERTAIN -- A VICTORY OVER THE DENVER BRONCOS TODAY AT COLISEUM WOULD ENSURE 
POSTSEASON PLAY FOR LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just before the ball is kicked off at the Coliseum today, the Raiders might be 
tempted to pick it up and spike it in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be the case if, at a little before 1 p.m., the public address 
announcer, giving the results of the early games, tells the crowd, "Final score 
from Pittsburgh, the Cleveland Browns have defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 If Pittsburgh loses, the Raiders are in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Steelers win, the Raiders will take the field knowing they must 
defeat the Denver Broncos in today's regular-season finale to ensure a spot in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Raiders lose and Pittsburgh wins, the Raiders could still be 
alive. If the Miami Dolphins lose to the New England Patriots earlier in the 
day by at least 17 points more than the Raiders' margin of defeat, the Raiders 
would be rooting for their last remaining postseason hope, a Houston Oiler 
victory over the New York Jets in today's late game. That complicated series of 
results would also put the Raiders into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? 
</P>
<P>
 When the various scenarios were presented to Raider Coach Art Shell, he put 
his hand up to halt the conversation, shook his head and said: "We've just got 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the mind-set for the Raiders is to ignore the computers and the charts 
and the out-of-town scores and simply plan on guaranteeing themselves a playoff 
spot by beating Denver. Their opponents today also have something to play for. 
The Broncos already know they will be in the playoffs, but they don't know 
where. A victory today would guarantee the Broncos a home game in next 
weekend's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing this like a playoff game," Denver Coach Wade Phillips said, 
"because it is a great opportunity to play (a postseason game) at home." 
</P>
<P>
 If recent history is any guide, today's score probably will be close, with the 
Raiders having the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 They have won seven of the last eight meetings between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have won five in a row over the Broncos at the Coliseum, the last 
Denver victory in L.A. coming in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been easy. Thirteen of the last 20 games between these teams 
have been decided by three or fewer points, five of the games going into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 When the clubs met at Denver's Mile High Stadium this season, the Raiders won, 
23-20, on a 53-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger with 16 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On that cold October night, the leading rushers were Rod Bernstine for the 
Broncos and Greg Robinson for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither will be back for today's rematch, causing major concern for both 
teams. Even if both make it into the playoffs, how far can they get without 
their leading ground gainers? 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstine rushed for 816 yards and scored four touchdowns before suffering a 
dislocated shoulder in last week's loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson suffered torn cartilage in his left knee against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 How valuable had Robinson, a rookie, become to the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 His injury occurred four weeks ago, yet Robinson still leads the Raiders in 
rushing with 591 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos will fill in with former Ram Robert Delpino, third-year player 
Reggie Rivers and multitalented rookie Glyn Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, the Raiders were still committed to Nick Bell, who had a bad first 
half in Green Bay with two fumbles and a dropped pass. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't called upon in the second half, and is not expected to be called 
upon today, except on third-down, short-yardage plays. 
</P>
<P>
 If fullback Steve Smith, who has been hampered by a sore ankle, can play, he 
will. If not, the backfield will consist of Napoleon McCallum at fullback and 
rookie Randy Jordan at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Raider question mark this week hangs over the head of quarterback 
Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent part of the second half of last week's game in a Green Bay hospital 
after suffering a concussion when thrown to the frozen surface of Lambeau Field 
on a sack by Packer linebacker Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler is expected to play, but he'll be watched closely. If it turns out 
the game is meaningless, or if Hostetler receives another punishing blow, watch 
for the return of backup Vince Evans.

 It's fan appreciation day at Anaheim Stadium, and if long-suffering Ram fans 
are to be really rewarded for their loyalty, the Chicago Bears will triumph 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, after all, need one more loss this season if their future is to 
appear brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 One more loss, and if tiebreakers fall their way, the Rams will have one of 
the top two picks in the 1994 draft and the opportunity to start anew with 
Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler or Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 One more victory and all might be lost. One more victory and the 
quarterback-poor Rams risk falling as low as fifth in the first round of the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Dilfer and Shuler, who are expected to make themselves available for 
the NFL draft by the Jan. 10 deadline, are considered the only two Rick Mirer- 
and Drew Bledsoe-like candidates in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 One more victory and the Rams will have to spend their off-season trying to 
trade valuable draft picks or key performers to move forward from the fifth 
pick in the draft to land one of the top two spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-11) are one game behind the Cincinnati Bengals (3-12), who play at 
New Orleans, and tied with the Indianapolis Colts (home against the Buffalo 
Bills) and New England Patriots (home against the Miami Dolphins). 
</P>
<P>
 One more victory and the Rams can finish no better than Cincinnati and the 
Washington Redskins (4-12), who lost to the Minnesota Vikings on Friday. One 
more victory and the Rams could tie with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-10), but 
fortunately for the Rams they already hold a decisive strength of schedule 
tiebreaking advantage over the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 One more loss and Ram fans will have the opportunity -- as they do in playoff 
cities -- to do some scoreboard watching on the final day of the season. Losses 
by the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers and New York 
Giants and victories by the New York Jets, Dolphins and Bills improve the Rams' 
tiebreaking numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about the draft or tiebreakers," Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"I'm thinking about winning a football game." 
</P>
<P>
 One more victory, however, and Knox will talk about how it gives the Rams 
something to build on for next season, the same thing he said after the Rams 
won their final game last year. Players, who contribute to such a victory, will 
point out later they didn't quit. Some might even ask for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 One more loss, however, provides Ram fans with a reason to get excited about 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But then it's not going to be easy for the Rams to lose today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to play hard," said Knox. "I'd like to think we're not 
going to have a run for the buses. We got a game to play and a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will be motivated and trying to win the NFL rushing title for rookie 
Jerome Bettis, who starts the day 35 yards behind Emmitt Smith of the Dallas 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I have a great chance of doing it because the Bears are tough 
and have the fifth-ranked defense," Bettis said. "But that doesn't mean I won't 
be trying to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Henry Ellard needs 79 receiving yards to reach the 1,000-yard 
mark for the fifth time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (7-8) don't have anything on the line. The Vikings' victory over the 
Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday night eliminated the Bears from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears have scored fewer touchdowns than the Rams. They come to California 
with the NFL's No. 28-ranked passing attack and No. 28-ranked offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, of course, have their own problems on offense, which makes losing 
such a priority. As a starting quarterback, Jim Everett has lost 40 of his last 
57 starts. T.J. Rubley, who replaced Everett as the team's starter, has one 
victory in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubley, who passed for a career-high 294 yards last week, is trying to 
impress. Although the Rams have already decided that he's not the answer to 
their quarterback woes, Rubley hasn't gotten the message and will be trying to 
win today. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who has earned a reputation for having "happy feet," is not scheduled 
to start, but there's always a chance he could be called on to relieve in what 
is expected to be his final appearance as a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett's belly-flop this year, which included an 0-4 exhibition start, 
probably will forever remain a mystery. But in hindsight it ignited the team's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had not counted on that situation," Knox said last week. "It kind of blew 
up on us." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are to be any fans in attendance for next season's fan appreciation 
day, the team will need to acquire a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have already studied the free-agent market and have come to the 
conclusion that there isn't going to be much available. They will probably try 
to trade for Jeff George of the Indianapolis Colts, but securing one of the top 
two picks in the draft reduces the urgency of finding a quality veteran 
quarterback.

FLORIDA STAKES ITS 41-7 CLAIM TO A HIGHER RANKING; SUGAR BOWL: GATORS DEAL WEST 
VIRGINIA ITS FIRST DEFEAT AND FIGURE THEY'RE AT LEAST NO. 2 IN THEIR OWN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Turns out West Virginia is no more a national championship team than Jed 
Clampett was a linguist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountaineers, go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk was as cheap as Minnie Pearl's hat this week, considering it was hard to 
get a word in edgewise on West Virginia while it railed against the 
establishment of a poll system that, instead of looking at the Mountaineers' 
11-0 record and handing over the trophy, considered variables such as strength 
of schedule and viability. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the course of Florida's 41-7 victory over West Virginia 
Saturday night before a Superdome crowd of 75,437 in the USF&G Sugar Bowl, the 
course of national championship discussion switched from one sideline to 
another, as the Gators put down a deposit for the rest of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Gators spoke of this being a beginning for Florida, so long the third football 
wheel in the state behind Miami and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 The loudest cheering of the fourth quarter came when Gator fans struck up a 
rousing mock Florida State cheer when it was announced that Nebraska had 
overtaken the Seminoles in that other game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead was short-lived, but in the fight for state stature, any Florida 
State misery is Florida joy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gators' hearts, their dominating victory over West Virginia demands 
that No. 8 Florida move up in the final polls and remain there when next season 
opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly proud of what the team did this year," Gator Coach Steve 
Spurrier said after the victory. "We're trying to be the best team in the 
state. We'll let the media do the rankings. But it's certainly nice not being 
third in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators, under the hand of Spurrier, the offensive whiz, ran the 
Mountaineers every which way but loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida led at halftime, 21-7, scored on its first two possessions of the 
third quarter to make it 35-7, and cruised home from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another day at the office as the Gators racked up 482 total yards to the 
Mountaineers' 265. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are ready to do a walk on Bourbon Street," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Gators win? Let them count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior tailback Errict Rhett ran through the Mountaineers, rushing for 105 
yards in 25 carries and three touchdowns, good enough to earn him the game's 
most-valuable-player award. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhett's next stop will be the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I wanted to go out," he said. "This is the game I'll always 
remember as a Gator, the last game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Terry Dean, on a personal comeback quest, threw over the 
Mountaineers, completing 22 of 37 passes for 255 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Receiver Willie Jackson jumped over the Mountaineers, making nine catches 
for 131 yards, including a 39-yard scoring catch with 51 seconds left in the 
first half when he leaped over defender Mike Logan to make the grab and then 
pranced untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freshman safety Lawrence Wright? Well, he ran circles around West Virginia, 
turning what appeared to be a routine second-quarter interception into a 
spectacular 52-return for touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It unfolded with 9:12 remaining before halftime with the score tied, 7-7, and 
turned the tide of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping back to pass from his own 34, Mountaineer quarterback Darren 
Studstill's pass was tipped by defensive back Monty Grow, who was blitzing. The 
pass fluttered to Wright, who made the interception at midfield, ran right to 
the 40, reversed his field to the left, cut back to the middle, then right 
again, all the way to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while Spurrier was pulling his hair out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was hollering, 'No, Lawrence, run forward,' " Spurrier said. "Then 
he goes in untouched. It was the dangdest thing I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright called it, "Destiny. It was meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountaineers will spend the winter trying to figure out how the game got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserved to win," Mountaineer Coach Don Nehlen said. "We got whupped. We 
got whupped big time. There's very little else to say." 
</P>
<P>
 They actually led, 7-0, scoring on their opening drive on a 32-yard pass from 
Jake Kelchner to Jay Kearney. 
</P>
<P>
 But two key defensive penalties by West Virginia extended Florida's next 
possession, allowing Rhett to work some magic on a three-yard run in which he 
changed direction, from left to right, then ran through a defender and in for 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Wright's interception return for touchdown, Jackson's circus catch 
near the end of the half and two short touchdown bursts by Rhett in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhett's third touchdown was set up by a fumbled kickoff return on which Logan 
fumbled after running into one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of night. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dean, the junior quarterback, it was a special night to cap what has 
already been an emotional career. He spent three years on the bench behind 
former Florida star Shane Mathews before finally being named the Gators' 
starter last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a role that lasted six quarters before Dean was benched during the 
Kentucky game on Sept. 11, replaced by redshirt freshman Danny Wuerffel, who 
would star off the bench and be named Southeastern Conference player of the 
week. Dean almost quit, but his father, Frank, told him it "was not an option." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Dean began the paperwork to get his MBA. He was going to finish out 
the season, then get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But he got a second chance in Week 7 against Georgia, when Wuerrfel struggled 
and returned to the bench. Dean returned to the lineup, earned back some 
respect and shared the position with Wuerrfel the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's Sugar Bowl was Dean's baby. Wuerrfel was in street clothes, out 
with a knee injury. And Dean never flinched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember two weeks ago," said Dean, lost in the moment. "This 
really helps to put everything behind you. It's easy to do when you get a win 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Gators, for the sake of argument, can boast: What about us? Florida 
finishes with its first 11-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another step toward overtaking Florida State and Miami? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know we were behind Miami right now," Spurrier said.

ROSE BOWL / WISCONSIN BADGERS 21, UCLA BRUINS 16; PASADENA IS THEIR PASTURE; 
CHEESEHEADS HAM IT UP AND MAKE WISCONSIN REALLY FEEL AT HOME AS COWED BRUINS

 " Wisconsin 6 Iowa 0 right there on there own gridiron and on there own snow. 
What more could be fairer? " -- ROUNDY COUGHLIN, Wisconsin State Journal, 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Mr. Coughlin, a character-newspaperman who never let spelling, 
grammar or punctuation mess up a good story, would have related very well to 
Wisconsin's Rose Bowl victory Saturday, would have remarked about the Badgers 
beating the Bruins right their in their own stadium, their own January 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no way UCLA's Coach Terry Donahue and his Bruins could have known 
beforehand what they were up against. There is no way they could have 
anticipated being the visiting team in the stadium where they play their home 
games. No way they could have predicted a crowd that was at least 60% 
Wisconsin's. No way they could have expected to be engulfed by the red sea in 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 And most certainly, there is no way they could have known they were standing 
between a victory-starved state -- not a team, a state -- and one of the 
sporting world's juiciest ham -- and cheese, of course -- sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning is not exactly new to Wisconsin. The 1957 Milwaukee Braves won the 
World Series. Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers of the '60s were the scourge 
of the NFL. Heck, they won the first two Super Bowls. Wisconsin and Marquette 
have won NCAA basketball championships. The Milwaukee Bucks won the NBA title 
in '71. 
</P>
<P>
 But, my, it has been a terribly long time since Wisconsin really has had 
something to crow about. The Brewers were in the World Series in '82, but they 
couldn't beat the Cardinals. And then, of course, there was that old Rose Bowl 
bugaboo for the Badgers -- three trips, three defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Badgers became surprise winners this season, they found an eager, 
appreciative fan base. Badgermania was back, with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, today in Wisconsin, Badgers are celebrating -- not just at the 
Brathaus in Madison, but all over the state. From the Holler House and the 
Polka Palace in Milwaukee to the Silver Dollar in far northern Hurley. From 
Footsie's in Sheboygan on Lake Michigan to Sloopie's in La Crosse on the 
Mississippi River. They're humming the Budweiser song, then yelling at the top 
of their lungs when they get to the right place in that little ditty, "When you 
say WISCONSIN, you've said it all!" 
</P>
<P>
 How in heaven's name could Donahue and the Bruins have expected that? How 
could they have guessed that they weren't playing just a football team? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, their chivalry showing, chose to make light of the obvious and 
vocal enthusiasm of Badger fans. But they couldn't deny that it was at least 
slightly unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested quarterback Wayne Cook, who came close to pulling it out for the 
Bruins in the closing minutes, "I think the reason why it looked like there was 
so much red out there today was they were always standing up, 'cause we were 
giving them something to cheer about. They had something to cheer about all the 
way up to the end of the game. We needed to take their fans out early and we 
couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins certainly had a chance, driving to the Wisconsin 10 in the first 
quarter, then having to settle for a field goal. A touchdown might have quieted 
some in the Badger entourage, but a field goal? 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said he had not anticipated so many and such vociferous Badger fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like there was certainly not a home-field advantage (for UCLA). It was 
a little bit surprising that it was so one-sided so early." 
</P>
<P>
 If UCLA was unnerved by the show of red, Wisconsin was energized by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were in Camp Randall (the Badgers' home stadium)," offensive 
tackle Joe Panos said. "That just shows what kind of fans we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Darrell Bevell added: "This was a home game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 And a victory, too, as it turned out. Not necessarily a pretty one, 
considering that it was achieved in a game of flags, fumbles and fisticuffs, 
but a victory, just the same, where before there had never been one. 
</P>
<P>
 And proud Wisconsinites figured they had one coming. No way Donahue and the 
Bruins could have figured that into the equation. Roundy would have liked it. 
What more could be fairer?

ROSE BOWL / WISCONSIN BADGERS 21, UCLA BRUINS 16; BADGER TAILBACK ROTATION 
LEAVES BRUINS SEEING RED; WISCONSIN: MOSS AND FLETCHER AREN'T PARTICULARLY BIG, 
BUT THEIR EFFORT -- AS ALWAYS -- IS HUGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wisconsin was the home team Saturday in the Rose Bowl and red-clad Badger fans 
-- who seemed to outnumber UCLA backers by more than two to one -- made it look 
and sound like merely another Saturday in Camp Randall Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who must have wondered where all the red shirts came from in the 
stands, must have wondered, too, where all the red-shirted tailbacks came from 
in the Wisconsin backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher, junior running backs who have shared time all 
season in leading Wisconsin to the Big Ten championship, ran over and around 
UCLA defenders for 222 yards in a 21-16 upset of the Bruins. Moss got 158 yards 
and two touchdowns in 36 carries, earning him the game's most-valuable-player 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a typical performance by Moss," Badger Coach Barry Alvarez said. "Very 
workmanlike. He gets his 150 to 200 yards like a guy packing his lunch pail and 
going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Alvarez, victorious in his first Rose Bowl game as a head coach, 
thought the Badgers could have done better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we could run the ball better than we did today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moss-Fletcher system works this way: Each player -- each is 5 feet 9 and 
about 200 pounds -- runs the ball for two series of downs at the start of the 
game and whoever does better gets most of the calls the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss set the tone on the first scrimmage play when he went through the Bruins' 
line for eight yards. After a UCLA field goal, Wisconsin got the ball back and 
it was Moss around right end, Moss over center, Moss off left guard for 11 
yards -- mixed in with some Darrell Bevell passes -- and finally Moss going 
over tackle for the Badgers's first touchdown after a 78-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher's turn came next, but he wasn't able to generate a first down. When 
he got another chance, at the start of the second half, he swept around right 
end for 33 yards -- the day's longest gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing this all year long," Fletcher said. "Every place we've been, 
no one thought we could do it. People said we were too slow, we were too small, 
we couldn't do the job, but we kept on doing it. We had a lot to prove, 
Wisconsin never winning here before, and stuff like that. I think we quieted 
down a lot of people today. I think we did the Big Ten proud, and that's 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, after receiving the MVP award from former Olympic decathlon champion 
Rafer Johnson -- who was wearing a UCLA sweatshirt -- said he was overwhelmed 
by the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't put it into words what it means to me," Moss said. "Winning the Rose 
Bowl, then getting the MVP, I just don't know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I did because I had a lot of red-shirted guys in front of me, and 
I just went where they led me. I felt I was successful because I am a physical 
running back who stays low and level when moving, and I have a great offensive 
line and fullback." 
</P>
<P>
 The fullback, Mike Montgomery, was one of four players -- two Bruins and two 
Badgers -- who were ejected midway in the third quarter for scuffling after a 
play had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Montgomery really hurt us," Alvarez said. "He is not only our best 
blocker, but he is also one of our best receivers. When he and (wide receiver 
Lee) DeRamus went out, it took away a lot of our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell, not known for his running, took up the slack for the Badgers, running 
21 yards for Wisconsin's third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never ran that far with a football in my life," Bevell said. "And I'd never 
carried one in for a touchdown, either. It was supposed to be a pass play to 
the right, but everyone was covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked over to the left, I saw all this room. I figured I'd got as far 
as I could. I never expected to get all the way to the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 In 34 carries during the season, Bevell gained 46 yards but lost 70 for a net 
minus-0.7 average.

ASLEEP IN SEATTLE; FOR FIRST TIME IN FOUR YEARS, HUSKY FANS GREET NEW YEAR'S 
WITH A YAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The waitress at the University Sports Bar and Grill near the University of 
Washington campus wore a Rice sweatshirt and killed time by slowly wiping 
holiday flocking off the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Post-Intelligencer filled much of the top of its Page 1 with a 
photograph of a Hawaiian resort where local software billionaire Bill Gates was 
getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraternity row at the university was as quiet as if there had been a sudden 
brewery strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone could see, this was a different kind of New Year's Day in Seattle. Way 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Times put it in perspective with a five-column headline Saturday 
morning on a tournament victory by the red-hot Garfield High basketball team. 
Right next to that was a one-column story with this headline: "Rose Bowl gets 
key makeover." 
</P>
<P>
 As in, the Huskies are out. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. For the first time in three years, the Pacific 10 Conference team did 
not wear the purple and gold in Pasadena. Worse, the Californians, the Los 
Angeles Californians, were back in it, nevermind their fumble-fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, do we color Seattle blue? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, a little. After all, few cities have ever indulged themselves in the 
kind of civic tantrum Seattle threw last year when the Huskies were stripped of 
their television revenues and banned from bowl appearances for two years for 
violating Pacific 10 rules governing alumni support of players. 
</P>
<P>
 You might remember something of those events: Coach Don James quit in a snit 
over the punishment, and alumni called for the head of university President 
William Gerberding. Practically any fan who could say something outrageous was 
considered a legitimate newsmaker. Like those who said, let's get out of the 
sissy Pac-10; those teams aren't in our league anymore, anyway. Or, the Pac-10 
has ruined our life. Or, let's see if the NFL will take us. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, and there were the promises to run up the score on an 11-0 season and 
make the Pac-10 send some also-ran to collect the roses. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the disappointment of a 7-4 Husky season. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot-heads cooled off, or at least the public stopped listening. The 
sanctions against the Huskies seemed to accomplish one of the things they are 
supposed to: Bring on civic reflection about a sports program where winning had 
become so common that it was demanded, and where the means were not necessarily 
the only consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice to see someone else down there this time," said John 
Dolecki, owner of the University Sports Bar and Grill, one of the principal 
hangouts near the campus. Even as he spoke magnanimously, however, he was 
paying the price of the Husky decline. His saloon was quiet and barely a 
quarter filled Saturday for the Rose Bowl kickoff. Last year, you would have 
needed a blocker to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were spoiled by victory. Today I guess there are pockets of 
hard-core Husky alumni who still think it was a vendetta. But that has subsided 
with many of the students," Dolecki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Jones, a teacher and Washington alumnus, agreed: "Those sanctions seemed 
so harsh at the time. But in retrospect, everybody has calmed down a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Calmed down in some cases to near stupor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, in Washington, I'd say there is about as much interest in the Rose 
Bowl as in the Peach Bowl. The interest level I'd say is zero," said Dave 
Grosby, who is the host of a nightly sports call-in show on radio station KIRO.

ROSE BOWL / WISCONSIN BADGERS 21, UCLA BRUINS 16; ON THIS DAY, NATION'S BEST 
ARE THE WORST; TURNOVERS: UCLA LED THE COUNTRY IN TAKEAWAY RATIO BEFORE RUNNING 
INTO A BADGER-LIKE DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Football is often said to be a game of turnovers, and if this is true, 
Wisconsin followers need look no further for the key to the Badgers' 21-16 Rose 
Bowl victory over UCLA on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA took the field with the best turnover ratio in the nation, plus 19, 
compared with Wisconsin's 14th-place ratio of plus nine. When the game was 
over, the teams were tied at plus 14. The Bruins committed six turnovers, five 
on fumbles; and the Badgers committed only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mind set is geared to force turnovers," said cornerback Jeff Messenger, 
who had the Badgers' interception. "We pride ourselves on being able to smack 
them hard, smack them in the mouth. That's how you get turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Linebacker Yusef Burgess: "It's what defense is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Alvarez noted that the six turnovers saved the day for a defensive 
unit that gave up 500 yards, 212 rushing and 288 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys play hard and they hit hard," Alvarez said. "Our defense isn't as 
good as we want it to be, but when you keep getting the ball back, that yardage 
doesn't mean as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Second quarter -- UCLA took over on its 32-yard line. On the first play, Wayne 
Cook's pass was intercepted by Messenger on the 44. 
</P>
<P>
 On UCLA's next possession, Cook passed to J.J. Stokes, who fumbled at the 
Bruin 32, and nose guard Lamark Shackeford recovered for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Third quarter -- UCLA drove from its 20 to Wisconsin's eight, then Cook 
fumbled while scrambling and tackle Mike Thompson recovered for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bruins' next possession, they drove from their 10 to Wisconsin's 33, 
then Cook was sacked and fumbled, and cornerback Henry Searcy recovered for 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth quarter -- After scoring a touchdown that cut Wisconsin's lead to 
14-10, UCLA started from its 23 and Ricky Davis fumbled on the first play. 
Thompson again recovered for Wisconsin, and the Badgers turned the turnover 
into what was to be their winning touchdown, a 21-yard run by quarterback 
Darrell Bevell. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the next kickoff, UCLA moved from its 23 to its 41, then Kevin 
Jordan caught a pass from Cook and fumbled after a 12-yard gain. Safety Scott 
Nelson recovered for Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was asked which of the Badgers' six takeaways had been the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, they got the ball back with two minutes left," he said. "If we 
had taken the ball away on their last drive, that would have been the turnover. 
As it is, I don't know if there was a crucial turnover." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson cited the fumble by Cook that ended the UCLA drive inside Wisconsin's 
10 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That came at a key time," Nelson said. "They were getting on a roll, and we 
needed it badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, though, that no turnover was as big as the one on Davis' fumble 
that gave Wisconsin position for the touchdown that made it 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's offense was struggling at the time, the result of a fracas in the 
third quarter that led to the ejection of two members of each team. The Badgers 
lost their outstanding blocking fullback, Mark Montgomery, and their best wide 
receiver, Lee DeRamus. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Montgomery to lead the way for tailbacks Brent Moss and Terrell 
Fletcher and DeRamus to serve as Bevell's prime target, the Badgers were 
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Montgomery and DeRamus went out, both of their backups dropped passes," 
Alvarez said. "It was definitely a big loss for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The backups Alvarez left unnamed were fullback Jeff Wirth and wide receiver 
Michael London. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wirth's credit, though, he made some good blocks for Moss when the Badgers 
needed first downs down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Wisconsin's defense is of the bend-but-don't-break variety, and 
Alvarez was asked what had gone through his mind when UCLA drove all the way to 
the Badgers' 15 before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt all along that we could stop them somehow," Alvarez said.

ROSE BOWL / WISCONSIN BADGERS 21, UCLA BRUINS 16; BRUINS HAVE ONE OF THOSE 
(AWFUL) DAYS; UCLA: TURNOVERS, PENALTIES AND MISTAKES IN GENERAL PROVE TOO MUCH 
TO OVERCOME AGAINST WISCONSIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Probably the most surprising thing about a Rose Bowl game in which UCLA 
fumbled the ball away five times and had a pass intercepted was that the Bruins 
actually had a chance to win in the last few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't win, of course. That would be asking too much from a UCLA team 
that spent the majority of Saturday's 21-16 loss to Wisconsin, well, goofing 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the various theories of explanation began surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like someone put a hex on us or something," said running back Daron 
Washington, who wins the award for most creative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything bad happened," linebacker Nkosi Littleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could argue with that. The way it looked, UCLA's best offensive play 
was the untimely fumble and its best defensive play the always popular pass 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, it was a robust Bruin performance, except maybe for the nine 
times they backed up for 95 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept shooting ourselves in the head, not in the foot," Coach Terry Donahue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Add one really bad decision by Bruin quarterback Wayne Cook in the waning 
seconds, and the mostly red-hued crowd of 101,237 got sent home happy, even 
that Badger fan wearing the red helmet with the box of Velveeta glued to the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook threw the ball 43 times, but made a huge mistake when he didn't throw it 
once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of timeouts, UCLA took over on its 38-yard line with 1:43 left and moved 
to a first down at the Wisconsin 18. The clock showed 15 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook chose to scramble instead of throwing the ball away to stop the clock and 
he was tackled at the 15, and the clock ran out before the Bruins could get off 
another play. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cook had been able to stop the clock with an incomplete pass, UCLA might 
have had enough time for two or three plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction was to run," Cook said. "It was a mistake on my part." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly was, said Donahue, who stuck up for his quarterback nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes a lot of blame for a lot of things," Donahue said. "But you can't 
take a sack in that area. You can't scramble if you can't score the touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the other pesky problems that kept cropping up. Things such as 
tackling. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, what do the UCLA defense and a rolling stone have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither one gathers any Moss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins didn't have much luck bringing down Badger tailback Brent Moss, 
whom they held to 158 yards in 36 carries. Credit Wisconsin's mammoth offensive 
line, roughly the size of, say, Eau Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play smash-mouth," Bruin defensive tackle Sale Isaia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Isaia was one of the several frustrated Bruins -- and Badgers for 
that matter -- who ran afoul of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 After one play, Isaia grabbed the facemask of a prone Badger and sort of 
dribbled his head on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaia, who was assessed a personal foul, said he felt better afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but it didn't help out the team any," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the quadruple ejection -- a dubious Rose Bowl record -- 
affecting Marvin Goodwin and Donovan Gallatin of UCLA and Lee DeRamus and Mark 
Montgomery of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 All four were tossed for their parts in a brief but spirited third-quarter 
skirmish along the UCLA sideline that wasn't broken up until Wisconsin Coach 
Barry Alvarez sprinted across the field and began peeling players apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin and DeRamus wound up on the ground, arms and legs entwined. Goodwin, 
who is said to be considering turning pro, might consider the World Wrestling 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to protect Nkosi and the next thing I know, I felt someone hit 
me in the back," Goodwin said. "Then DeRamus and I started wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the refs felt they lost control and had to throw somebody out. It's 
just unfortunate I was the one." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but what was really unfortunate for UCLA were the turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turnovers by us, there goes the game right out the window," Donahue said. 
"When I look back on this game, I'll just be sick of the fact . . . six 
turnovers."

PATERNO DRAWS ON INSTINCT, PENN STATE PULLS AWAY; CITRUS: TOUCHDOWNS AT END OF 
FIRST HALF AND START OF SECOND PROVE TOO MUCH FOR TENNESSEE AS NITTANY LIONS 
WIN, 31-13. DROPPED PASSES HURT SHULER.

 You can forget all the talk that Tennessee might be playing the best college 
football in the country right now. And you can forget all the talk that Penn 
State quarterback Kerry Collins was no match for Tennessee wunderkind Heath 
Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 But you should remember that the venerable Joe Paterno, still boring after all 
these years, is a pretty good football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeming mismatch that was the CompUSA Florida Citrus Bowl between 
Tennessee and Penn State Saturday afternoon was indeed that. But few had it 
figured to be lopsided in the Nittany Lions' favor. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fifth-ranked Volunteers grabbed a quick 10-0 lead, Penn State, 
ranked 13th but moving on up, took control and rolled to a 31-13 victory. It 
was Paterno's 15th bowl victory, tying the mark of Paul (Bear) Bryant of 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State (10-2) was clearly better prepared than Tennessee (9-2-1) and the 
Nittany Lions even used the first-down pass on seven occasions. The game left 
the mostly orange-clad crowd of 72,456 sitting silently, hoping to hear another 
chorus of their school song "Rocky Top." 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some small adjustments to our defense and offense, but generally we 
played the same game we played all year," Paterno said. "I never felt we were 
an underdog and it rankled some of our kids to be 10-point underdogs. We never 
thought Tennessee was better than us." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Penn State won the game with 11 seconds to play in the first half. 
On second down and 10 and the ball at the Tennessee 14, Collins went to the 
bench for instructions. There was enough time for one play, maybe two if there 
was an incompletion. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State called a draw up the middle to Ki-Jana Carter. With the Tennessee 
defense expecting a pass, Carter was virtually untouched as he scored the first 
of his two touchdowns. The extra point gave Penn State a 17-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Joe gave me the call, I looked at him and said, 'Are you sure?' " 
Collins said. "He just looked at me and said, 'Yup.' I have a feeling that 
broke their back." 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno remembered it this way: "The offensive coaches called the play. They 
develop the game plan, I stick in my comments, take credit for the good calls 
and chew them out for the bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The play-calling resulted in Collins completing 15 of 24 passes for 162 yards 
and two touchdowns. The two touchdowns came in the second half, one for seven 
yards to Kyle Brady in the third quarter and a 15-yarder to Bobby Engram early 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Engram was the game's leading receiver with seven catches for 107 yards. He 
was also voted the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to get into the fact that it was Heath Shuler on the other side 
of the ball," Collins said. "I had to do my own thing. . . . All I heard was 
Tennessee this and Tennessee that all week. People saying that if maybe there 
was a miracle, we might pull it out. It was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State took control when it took the second-half kickoff, went 60 yards in 
11 plays, and scored on Brady's seven-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Penn State's touchdown right before the half and the score right after the 
half were big factors in the outcome of the game," Tennessee Coach Phillip 
Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler completed 22 of 42 passes for 205 yards and one touchdown, a 19-yard 
pass to Cory Fleming in the first quarter. He was also the victim of several 
dropped balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was uncharacteristic for us to drop passes," Fulmer said. "Heath threw 
well, but dropped balls and penalties caused us to stay in trouble. Penn State 
caused us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler agreed. "It was one of my best games as far as being on top of things," 
he said. "But we just didn't catch well. But I can't get down on my teammates. 
There have been times when I wasn't doing well and they carried me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler has contemplated giving up his senior year at Tennessee and making 
himself available for the NFL draft. He plans to announce his decision on Jan. 
9, the day before players have to declare themselves eligible. If he stays, 
he'll be the early favorite for the Heisman Trophy, having finished second in 
balloting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, he wouldn't hint at which way he was leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road is forked and I have to decide which way to go," Shuler said. 
"Normally, a road goes right and it goes left. By my road has two rights. I 
can't make a bad decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to the Tennessee program expect him to leave now and avoid being 
taken by one of the expansion teams -- Jacksonville and Charlotte -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams most likely to take him, providing probable top pick Cincinnati 
doesn't trade down, are Washington and the Rams, both in need of quarterback 
help. Scouts from Washington, Tampa Bay, the New York Giants and New York Jets 
were in attendance Saturday. Presumably, Ram scouts watched on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee might also have had a better time watching television. Bowl 
Victories

 With the Citrus Bowl victory over Tennessee, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno tied 
Bear Bryant for the all-time lead in bowl victories. A look at the leaders:

HALL OF FAME BOWL; MICHIGAN GOES OUT IN STYLE -- WHEATLEY, TOO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Tyrone Wheatley placed the team before himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the junior running back played his last game for Michigan on Saturday, he 
went out in style with two touchdowns and 124 yards rushing in a 42-7 rout of 
North Carolina State in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In helping the 23rd-ranked Wolverines (8-4) close strong with their fourth 
consecutive victory, Wheatley scored on runs of 26 and 18 yards. He has until 
Jan. 10 to decide if he'll skip his final year of eligibility to make himself 
available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the 226-pound tailback said he hadn't made up his mind. On 
Saturday, he didn't answer questions about his future, preferring to focus on 
Michigan's strong finish after a 4-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seniors and the captains gathered everybody up and said, 'Hey, we have to 
play.' . . . Coach (Gary) Moeller stressed that you just can't lay down and 
expect everyone else to lay down with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley was far from a one-man show against the Wolfpack as the Wolverine 
defense forced North Carolina State (7-5) into six turnovers before 52,649. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Thompson ran back one of Michigan's four interceptions 43 yards for a 
third-quarter touchdown, while Derrick Alexander returned a punt 79 yards for a 
second-quarter score and Todd Collins combined with Amani Toomer on a 31-yard 
touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan outscored its last four opponents, 153-24, including a 28-0 victory 
over Ohio State. North Carolina State was looking to rebound from a 62-3 loss 
to Florida State in its last game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to remember all the good things that happened this season," said 
Wolfpack Coach Mike O'Cain, "but the back-to-back losses will stay with me for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan took control after a scoreless first quarter in which North Carolina 
State had the ball for more than 11 minutes in a light rain. The Wolverines led 
at halftime, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the middle of the season, we've been a little embarrassed with 
ourselves," Collins said. "After winning the last four games, we wanted to show 
the country we're the Michigan of old and we can dominate people like we used 
to and win any time we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley was named the game's most valuable player. He carried 18 times before 
leaving the game midway through the third quarter.

WORDS DESERT MIAMI AS ARIZONA ROMPS; FIESTA BOWL: EMBARRASSED HURRICANES ARE 
LIMITED TO 35 YARDS RUSHING AND NEVER GET PAST THE WILDCATS' 40. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It took Arizona only 3 minutes 50 seconds to score on Miami in Saturday's 
Fiesta Bowl and only slightly longer to totally embarrass the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score was 29-0, and the game was nowhere near that close. This New 
Year's Day contest only missed by one letter of being correctly named. It was, 
indeed, a siesta bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleeping through this one was a Miami team and program that has become known 
for big victories and big mouths. This is the same program that, under then 
coach Jimmy Johnson, marched its team into Phoenix for the 1987 Fiesta Bowl 
showdown against Penn State wearing battle fatigues, then marched it out of a 
joint pregame dinner with the now classic pronouncement from the late Jerome 
Brown: "Did the Japanese go and sit down and have dinner with Pearl Harbor 
before they bombed 'em?" 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State won that one, and the national title that went with it, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Coach Dennis Erickson brought the Hurricanes to town with a 9-2 
record, a No. 10 national ranking that was six places better than Arizona's, 
and a chance to rack up a ninth consecutive 10-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there were no battle fatigues or warlike pronouncements, there was 
certainly not total quiet. This was, after all, Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wee hours of Thursday night, Erickson's son, Bryce, a fourth-string 
quarterback, was the central figure in an incident at the team hotel involving 
a female who claimed she was "slapped" by Erickson. Details have been sketchy 
and no arrests were made, but the younger Erickson was suspended for the game 
for "rules violations," and his father refused to take questions on the matter 
at the postgame news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 So, surrounded by controversy -- a familiar situation for the Hurricanes -- 
Miami took the field and got trampled. The mouths that usually roar barely 
whimpered, as Arizona's often suspect offense ran up 409 yards and its vaunted 
defense played up to expectations by holding Miami to 182, only 35 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most telling statistics of all were those of field position. 
Miami's deepest penetration was to the Arizona 40, twice in the first half. In 
the second half, the Hurricanes' only venture across the 50-yard line was on a 
pass play to the Arizona 45, where they fumbled the ball away on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's postgame news conference centered on one phrase, and variations 
thereof: "We got our butt kicked," he said, perhaps eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the last time a Miami team had been shut out was in its 1979 game 
against Alabama, the same team that deprived the Hurricanes of a national title 
chance last year with a 34-13 victory in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arizona and Coach Dick Tomey, there was really no turning point, other 
than just showing up. The Wildcats, who shared the Pacific 10 Conference title 
with USC and UCLA and finished with a 10-2 record, got two touchdown plays from 
the passing combination of Dan White to Troy Dickey. Dickey's first reception, 
of 13 yards with 11:10 to go in the first quarter, occurred after Miami had won 
the toss and elected to kick off. Arizona went 75 yards in eight plays and 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey also scored on a nicely executed 14-yard play from White in the left 
corner of the end zone, completing the scoring midway through the final quarter 
and driving many in the crowd of 72,260 to the exits. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, running back Chuck Levy rushed for 142 yards, including 68 on a 
touchdown run that was a dazzling example of his skills. Those skills will be 
tested in the NFL next year, since the junior from Lynwood High in Compton 
announced afterward that he would forgo his final season of eligibility at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the work in putting points on the scoreboard was done by Steve 
McLaughlin, a junior kicker who is frequently remembered for barely missing a 
51-yard kick in the last seconds of the classic 8-7 Miami victory over Arizona 
at Miami in 1992. This time, McLaughlin connected on three of four field-goal 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's defense made three interceptions, recovered a fumble and more than 
lived up to its "Desert Swarm" reputation. One of its leaders, flamboyant 
sophomore Tedy Bruschi, had one of the four Arizona sacks for a 16-yard loss 
and was voted the defensive player of the game. Levy won the offensive honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, all that was left for the respective coaches was some summing up, 
and both went right to the heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tomey: "It was just our day." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Erickson: "A 9-3 record is just not good enough at Miami."

CARQUEST BOWL; FOLEY HAS RECORD DAY FOR BOSTON COLLEGE, 31-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boston College quarterback Glenn Foley was true to form Saturday, and so was 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, who has broken several of Doug Flutie's school records, broke or tied 
most of the four-year-old Carquest (formerly Blockbuster) Bowl's passing marks 
in leading the No. 15-ranked Eagles to a 31-13 victory over the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a good ride for me. This was a fitting end to my college career," 
Foley said after Boston College (9-3) scored its first bowl victory in seven 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia (7-5) lost its fourth consecutive bowl game, and defensive end Mike 
Frederick said: "We're sick of ending our year like this all the time. This 
takes all the fun out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers were limited to 85 yards rushing, 213 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley needed less than three quarters to set a bowl record for passing 
yardage. He also set a record for attempts and equaled completion and touchdown 
marks. Foley, who displaced Flutie as Boston College's career leader in passes, 
with 1,275, and touchdowns, with 72, finished the game with 391 yards on 
25-of-36 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles set bowl records for points and yards, with 557. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glenn did a super job," Boston College Coach Tom Coughlin said. "The ninth 
win means a lot for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Coach George Welsh said: "That's as good a pass offense and as good a 
pocket passer as we've seen in a while. He just kept hitting them. You have to 
get a pass rush on Foley to slow him down, and we just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia lost for the fifth time in seven games. "I think we were ready to 
play," Welsh said. "I thought the preparations were all right. And I thought we 
played well for a half. We just didn't play a full 60 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 There were three lead changes in the first half before an announced crowd of 
38,516, by far the smallest in the bowl's brief history. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, the game's most valuable player, put the Eagles ahead to stay, 17-13, 
with a five-yard touchdown pass to Clarence Cannon with 3:42 left in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the third quarter, Foley directed a 70-yard drive that ended 
when he connected with Keith Miller, who got behind linebacker Tom Burns for a 
46-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell Campbell closed the scoring with a 12-yard touchdown burst on the 
opening play of the fourth quarter. Campbell led all rushers with 99 yards in 
22 carries.

SPEEDSKATING; BLAIR PUSHES HERSELF TO TWO RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since so few other speedskaters can beat her, Bonnie Blair found that to push 
herself to greater feats, she'd have to compete against herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to different tracks around the world . . . I try not necessarily 
to beat the track record, but my record," said Blair, a three-time Olympic gold 
medalist. "This is something that I use and I look at basically every place I 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair set track records in the 500-meter and 1,000-meter sprints Saturday at 
the U.S. Olympic long-track trials, each time breaking the standard she had 
established at the Pettit National Ice Center. Her times of 39.76 seconds in 
the second staging of the 500 and of 1:20.86 in the first staging of the 1,000 
strengthened her already firm hold on Olympic berths, which will be decided 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen also set track records with times of 36.30 in the 500, bettering 
his first-day showing by 0.12, and 1:13.59 in the 1,000, which was 1.1 seconds 
off the world record set by Kevin Scott of Canada. Despite having flu, he is in 
such good position that his coach, Peter Mueller, said Jansen might skip one of 
the two remaining 500-meter races scheduled next weekend in order to rest. 
Jansen is the world-record holder in the 500 at 35.92. 
</P>
<P>
 The 500 is staged four times, and each competitor's slowest time is discarded. 
The other times are converted to points to determine the standings, and the top 
four finishers will make the Olympic team. The 1,000 is held three times, and 
the top two times will count toward point standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan's skating better every race he skates," Mueller said. "We were satisfied 
with D.J.'s 500, even though he made a couple of mistakes. He's been sick and 
he skated a 36.3, so think of what he could have done without a slip in the 
backstretch . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "His mistakes were nothing major, but that's the difference between a 36.3 and 
a 36.1. That 36.3 would have been a world record six months ago. He's at such a 
level that no one in the world could go out and do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair was especially pleased with her stamina in the 1,000-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to try and go under 1:21, so 1:20.8 was a real good, solid race for 
me," she said. "I felt strong in that race. I actually felt I could have kept 
going, and I haven't felt that way in that race for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who holds the world record in the 500 at 39.10 seconds, leads the 
women's 500 standings with 79.68 points. She's comfortably ahead of 1992 
Olympian Michelle Kline of Circle Pines, Minn., who has 83.10; two-time 
Olympian Peggy Clasen of St. Paul, Minn., who has 83.21, and Kristen Talbot of 
Schuylerville, N.Y., who has 83.48 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen leads the men's 500-meter standings with 72.72 points. David Cruikshank 
of Northbrook, Ill., who was second to Jansen each day, is second with 74.85; 
Nathaniel Mills of Evanston, Ill., has 75.31 points, and David Besteman of 
Madison, Wis., has 75.39.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; LOVE IS HOPING FOR A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is customary to think of Davis Love III as one of the veterans of the PGA 
Tour. Although he is starting his ninth season on the regular tour, is a Ryder 
Cup star and has won eight tournaments, the former North Carolina golfer is 
only 29. 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepares to defend his title in the Mercedes Championships, the first 
event of the season, Love seems to be maturing into one of the top players. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known mainly for his prodigious drives, Love will be one of the favorites 
at La Costa in what used to be the Tournament of Champions. The $1.5-million, 
72-hole tournament, which has separate regular and senior events, starts 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Love won five tournaments in the last two years, but was considered only one 
of the many solid players on the tour until the Ryder Cup last fall. One down 
with two holes to play against Italy's Costantino Rocca on the final day, Love 
rallied to win the last two holes. His six-foot uphill putt on the final hole 
clinched a 15-13 victory for the United States over the Europeans. Coming 
through under heavy pressure put Love in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raymond Floyd said that if you can withstand the pressure in Ryder Cup 
competition, you should be ready to move to the next level," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine any more pressure than that last putt. I knew I had to make 
it. Seeing it later on tape, it was harder than it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't played well in majors. Before anyone's ready to call you a 
standout, you have to win a major. Two years ago his play in the Ryder Cup made 
a star of Freddie (Couples). He went on to win a major and get 
player-of-the-year honors." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a marked similarity in the careers of Couples and Love. Both were 
first recognized for their long driving ability. Both are now recognized for 
their complete games, but it took a while. One difference is that Couples is 
five years older. Another: The slender Love is 6 feet 3, four inches taller 
than Couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professional golfers often don't mature until they are in their 30s," Love 
said. "I should have my best years in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning at La Costa, Love had a disappointing year by his standards. He 
was in the same boat with the three previous winners. Paul Azinger (1990), Tom 
Kite (1991) and Steve Elkington (1992) didn't win another tournament in those 
years, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Love missed the cut in the Players Championship, the British Open and the PGA. 
After taking a rest late in the season, he decided to use the Las Vegas 
Invitational as a tuneup for the Ryder Cup. What a tuneup! He won the 90-hole 
event by eight shots, once leading by 11. Obviously, he had his game together. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Love sank the six-footer to beat Rocca, some had questioned whether he 
could handle pressure. There is no longer any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who teamed with Kite in three matches before the final day, was 
generous in giving credit to his partner, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing three rounds with a great player like Kite enabled me to see how a 
veteran handles himself in these situations. Tom also helped me with my 
putting, getting me to concentrate more. He helped me turn a poor season into a 
great finish." 
</P>
<P>
 With only tournament winners playing at La Costa, Love will be facing a tough 
field, which includes Kite, Couples and Greg Norman. Norman, who won the 
British Open and was third on the money list despite competing in only 15 
tournaments, calls this past year his best. 
</P>
<P>
 La Costa will be his only winter tournament on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he finished 12th on the money list in the United States, Love is 
ranked No. 9 in the world, one spot behind Kite, the lifetime money leader on 
the PGA Tour. In 22 years, Kite has earned $8,500,729. In eight years, Love has 
made $4,037,672. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, I probably should have won more than I have, but winning five 
tournaments in the last two years must mean I'm maturing," Love said. "A 
victory at La Costa would give me a running start at my next goal -- winning a 
major." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Jack Nicklaus, after an absence of nine years, makes this 
week's senior field the strongest ever. Al Geiberger will be trying for his 
third consecutive victory in the senior event. Besides Nicklaus, he'll face 
Raymond Floyd, Lee Trevino, leading money-winner Dave Stockton, George Archer, 
Mike Hill and Bob Charles. Stockton and Charles, golf's top left-hander, each 
won more than $1 million last year. It will be interesting to see if any 
regular tour player will draw as big a gallery as Nicklaus will. . . . Among 
winners who won't be at La Costa are ailing Paul Azinger, leading money-winner 
Nick Price, David Frost and senior Gary Player. . . . Six seniors, including 
PGA champion Tom Wargo, are first-time winners.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; DE LA HOYA: STILL GOOD AS GOLD OR SHOWING TRUE COLORS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is free of his contractual obligations, but not unscathed. He is poorer, 
but has such a promising financial future that it hardly matters. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not turn 21 until next month and has never won or even fought for a 
world title, but corporate executives and boxing's most powerful men continue 
to contort and twist in reaction to his every decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya, where exactly do you go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 The boxing career will move forward, of course, but how far will he advance? 
</P>
<P>
 His story is without a likely ending yet, with millions of dollars and a 
reputation in limbo. This is about boxing and greed, fathers and sons, loyalty 
and power. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, despite all the recent seismic activity he created by leaving 
his co-managers, De La Hoya's short-term future has not changed drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 With those former co-managers receiving a cash settlement to terminate their 
contract, De La Hoya will be free to venture up to Big Bear soon to train for 
his fight on March 5 against Jimmy Bredahl, the World Boxing Organization 
junior-lightweight champion, to mark the reopening of the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 He will sign a $7.5-million contract with HBO that instantly makes him one of 
the richest fighters in the world. He will seek and certainly find lucrative 
endorsement and movie deals to feed his dreams of becoming a crossover 
superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ugly battle to free himself from the management contract he signed 
more than a year ago with Bob Mittleman and Steve Nelson has left deeper marks, 
made him vulnerable to deeper wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to some boxing observers, as De La Hoya prepares to enter his 
prime earning years, it hints at deeper flaws in the fighter himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change in management by itself doesn't lead to problems, but it's 
indicative of what I believe is a flaw in someone's character," said Dan Duva, 
who promotes Evander Holyfield and Pernell Whitaker and remembers all too well 
when De La Hoya walked away from Duva's associate, Shelly Finkel, to sign with 
Mittleman and Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fighters that have really been the most successful, like Marvin Hagler, 
Michael Spinks, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Muhammad Ali, they kept 
the same core group of advisers with them throughout their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loyalty shows strong character -- because there are always people waving 
money in your face. It takes a very strong person to not give in to that 
temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes the same kind of strong will to win tough, grueling fights when 
you're hurt, out of gas and need to dig down deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, if De La Hoya wins the WBO title, then proceeds on course to take a 
lightweight title and move upward through three or four weight classes, this 
will be nothing more than a minor moment. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya himself says he probably will manage himself, and spin off the 
management of parts of his career -- endorsement deals, matchmaking, movie 
deals -- to a series of business lieutenants. Promoter Bob Arum apparently will 
continue to have a strong hand in guiding De La Hoya's fight career. 
</P>
<P>
 And local businessman Mike Hernandez, a longtime family friend, has emerged as 
a quiet, stabilizing force in the De La Hoya camp. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO, whose deal with him will place him as a spokesman for the cable network, 
says it will welcome De La Hoya into the fold anytime he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it a sign of level-headedness and maturity that he wants 
everything in order before he goes ahead with his career," said Bob Greenway, 
HBO vice president for sports programming. "Too many fighters tend to careen 
forward without having everything straightened out. I don't think anyone would 
think less of him simply because he wants to resolve some outstanding issues 
with his management team. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the scale of whether this tarnishes his image, this might register 1 on a 
scale of 100." 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers believe that De La Hoya's father, Joe, was the key player in 
the decision to spurn Finkel for Mittleman's and Nelson's richer deal. Some who 
know De La Hoya suggest that the recent action has been the fighter's way of 
showing his family that he -- not his father -- is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But can someone who has demonstrated such a clear desire for short-term 
benefits manage himself over the long haul? Mittleman and Nelson said that he 
needed close supervision, that without it, De La Hoya would get out of shape 
and lose focus. 
</P>
<P>
 They had him fighting about once a month, but he has never made it down to the 
130-pound junior-lightweight limit. He will go four months between bouts before 
his March fight, which must be contested at 130. 
</P>

 "I'm not saying it will be easy, but he can make 130," said his trainer, 
Robert Alcazar, who also will apparently have increased say in De La Hoya's 
career. "All he needs is the discipline to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya was the Barcelona golden boy when he came back with the U.S. boxing 
team's only gold medal in 1992, but he never really was a naive cherub -- 
though his smile sometimes made him seem to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a sharp mind, with a fixed idea of where he wants to be in 10 years: He 
wants to win championships in five or six weight classes, then he wants to 
retire and become an entertainment star. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became convinced -- with help from his new advisers -- that Mittleman 
and Nelson were not delivering on their grand promises, he decided to leave 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he did with Finkel, he never told them face to face that he was leaving 
and never sat down for serious discussions to try to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He simply left. And, Nelson said, what makes anyone think he won't leave 
anybody else when he feels like it? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first signed him, we were told that his image was a little bit hurt 
because of what happened between him and Shelly," Nelson said. "That one could 
be explained away.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's happened twice now, so you start to think it can happen over and over 
again. We did a real good job for the kid, and we gave our all for him. I don't 
know if anybody else can give as much time and commitment as we did. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's looking for more and better, I don't know if he's going to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the one question that leaves some people around De La Hoya with 
chills: Isn't it natural that his search for more and more money and a bigger 
profile might lead him to Don King? 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya has laughingly called King "a crook," and King says he received 
calls from people purporting to represent De La Hoya, but has "never, never 
ever," discussed signing De La Hoya with anybody in the fighter's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean he won't. De La Hoya's promotional contract with Arum runs 
out in two years. Perhaps the richest potential non-heavyweight fight in the 
next two or three years would be a De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez matchup. King 
represents Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to have De La Hoya," King said. "If we can get him free and 
clear, man, I could make millions for him. Everybody De La Hoya can fight to 
make the big money is with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an open invitation to him, as long as he can remove any type of 
legalities. Nothing would please me more than bringing him to the top level he 
belongs." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya, is that where you go from here? Boxing Notes

 The renovation of the Olympic Auditorium has been moved into high gear. With 
the official reopening set for March 5, the building will be a whirlwind of 
activity for the next few months. "Back when my father bought the place, there 
were scores of articles saying that we were going to knock it down and make it 
a parking lot," said Steve Needleman, who has taken over the building along 
with his brothers. "Well, take a look, this is not a parking lot." The new 
seats are scheduled to be installed in mid-January, the new dressing rooms are 
already being built in what used to be the ticket offices and a building on the 
same lot is being readied to become a combination office building-community 
gymnasium. Planners recently discovered that they could fit 500 more floor 
seats than originally thought, boosting the fight capacity to 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent actions of Rock Newman, manager of Riddick Bowe, to land a third 
Bowe-Evander Holyfield heavyweight title fight seem to have done nothing more 
than harden Holyfield's desire to fight anybody but Bowe. Newman, suggesting 
that Holyfield promoter Dan Duva is not looking out for his best interests, 
tried to begin negotiations with Hammer, Holyfield's adviser, for a third bout, 
offering a guaranteed purse of $20 million. But Holyfield's reaction has been 
to draw closer to Duva and downplay Hammer's role in his career. Michael 
Moorer, the No. 1 contender who also is a Duva fighter, now appears to be 
Holyfield's next opponent.

BURGLARY CAN LEAVE EMOTIONAL SCARS; ANGER, FEAR MAY BE MORE DAMAGING THAN 
MATERIAL LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Davis is free-lance writer who 
lives in Orange. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Carol Willis enjoyed a vacation out of town at her parent's house, 
burglars went through her Orange County apartment and took everything of value. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I discovered what happened, I was horrified," said the marketing 
executive. "Before that, burglaries were just statistics I heard on TV. I never 
dreamed it could happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis' surprise at having her house broken into isn't uncommon, said Lt. Ross 
Moen, commanding officer of the West Los Angeles detective division. Despite 
the fact that 186,000 burglaries occurred in Los Angeles, Orange and San 
Bernardino counties in 1992, according to the California Department of Justice, 
"people generally don't think that their time has come," Moen said. "Instead, 
they are usually very shocked that their safe haven has been invaded." 
</P>
<P>
 When they hear the word "burglary," many people think of monetary loss. The 
truth is, those who have been burglarized find that the emotional damage can be 
much more devastating than losing material possessions. After a burglary, it's 
normal to experience a variety of emotions, including a feeling of being 
violated, helplessness, anger, sadness and fear. The key to healing after a 
break-in, experts say, is to let these emotions run their course. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the hardest thing to deal with after a burglary is the realization 
that your private space has been invaded by a stranger, said psychologist Mory 
Framer, who is with Los Angeles-based Barrington Psychiatric Center, which has 
a division that treats individuals involved in traumas such as bank robberies 
and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who've been burglarized used to believe that their home was the last 
safe place, but that security has been breached and they feel violated," Framer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most burglary victims take this intrusion into their private world very 
personally. "For many people their home, which they see as an extension of 
themselves, has been penetrated and defiled, and that which was valuable, 
brutally taken," said Dr. Louis West, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 This feeling of being violated is more common among women than men. "Some 
psychoanalytic studies show that many women identify their homes with their 
bodies," West said. "They tend to decorate their homes in the same manner in 
which they dress. So, when their home is violated, they feel violated." 
</P>
<P>
 Another common feeling that burglary causes is helplessness, Framer said. "If 
the police come and can't find fingerprints and don't seem to have many clues, 
you may think no one cares," he said. "Even though logic tells you they deal 
with a lot of burglaries, emotionally you feel like yours is the special case." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by this feeling of helplessness is often a fantasy about seeking 
revenge on the person who stole from you, Framer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger is also common, said Amy Stark, a Santa Ana psychologist who specializes 
in child and family therapy. Her office was burglarized three times before they 
installed an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are usually angry at a lot of people," she said. "The jerk who stole from 
you, the police (where were they, anyway?), society (what's wrong with 
everyone?) and yourself for not having safeguarded your property well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 It is especially heart-breaking when you lose irreplaceable items during a 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Items such as artifacts, pictures and jewelry that were given to you by your 
parents or other significant people are links to your past, and it is very 
painful to lose them," said Framer, who had a rare and valuable watch given to 
him by his father stolen from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personal, nostalgic items, whether they are valuable or not, are 
irreplaceable," Stark said. "Their sentimental value is immeasurable, and you 
will probably always be sad about losing them." 
</P>
<P>
 After that first burglary, Willis' home was broke into three more times. "The 
first time, I was younger and hadn't accumulated much," she says. "They stole 
my television and stereo, but insurance replaced them. What was really 
upsetting was the third and fourth burglaries when they stole irreplaceable 
jewelry that had been given to me over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Willis keeps all of her good jewelry in a safe deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most unsettling emotional reaction to being burglarized is fear. 
"Most of us think of our home as a safe castle, and it's very frightening to 
have that last bastion of our security breached," Framer said. "It's not 
uncommon for burglary victims to feel unsafe and have trouble sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, sleeplessness can last a couple of weeks, while others will 
remain extremely vigilant and easily startled out of slumber for many months 
afterward. "There's no definite timetable (for recovery), Framer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you do after a burglary, never minimize your feelings. "People may 
say to you, 'Thank goodness you weren't home.' Although it is fortunate you 
weren't harmed, it doesn't mean you shouldn't feel anything," Framer said. 
"You've been intruded upon and it's OK to feel badly." 
</P>
<P>
 To make yourself feel better after a break-in, there are several things 
experts suggest doing and not doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "While your first instinct may be to move, don't act on that initial reaction; 
wait and see if you still feel that way in a few weeks," Framer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of wringing your hands, the best approach is to take preventive 
action. "Be aware and informed and educate yourself because that is likely to 
give you some control and power back," Framer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact your local police and have them come out and talk to your neighborhood 
about burglary prevention and what you can do to make your home more secure. 
Form a Neighborhood Watch, which will make you feel less alone and could very 
well prevent future burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every possible precaution you can take is positive because it gives you a 
feeling of empowerment," Stark said, "Just don't go overboard and barricade 
yourself in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much you do to protect yourself against burglary, it's also 
important to realize that lightening does strike twice or even four times, as 
in Willis' case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no absolute immunity from anything in this world," Framer said. "You 
can take every possible precaution and still be vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Willis took the police's advice and did everything they suggested 
after her first burglary, she was burglarized again. At one point she even 
moved to a nicer neighborhood and thought she was finally safe, but she came 
home one day to an open door and a missing VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember thinking that I just couldn't get away from it all," she says. "I 
did everything you were supposed to do, but it happened over and over, and it 
was really hard to feel secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're burglarized once or four times, you're not likely to ever 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very scary to have a stranger in your home uninvited, and a part of you 
will always remember that it happened," said Stark, who never leaves valuables 
in the office anymore. "Since it occurred once, you know that it could occur 
again and it makes it very hard to plan ahead -- it's like the threat of an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she married seven years ago, Willis hasn't been burglarized. She is 
aware, however, that it could happen again at any time. "When I'm the last one 
to leave the house and I'm locking up, I think about it every single time." 
When to Seek Help 
</P>
<P>
 No one reaction to being burglarized is wrong, says Amy Stark, a Santa Ana 
psychologist. People do, however, have different levels of coping skills when 
it comes to trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 If your life is already chaotic or the burglars vandalized your home, you may 
be having a difficult time coping. It might be a good idea to consider getting 
professional help if you answer yes to two or more of the following question: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you have chronic insomnia since the incident? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have you lost your appetite, and do you find it difficult to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is it getting harder to perform daily functions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you often agitated or anxious? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you have recurring nightmares? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have you turned to alcohol or drugs for comfort? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you too frightened to leave the house? When Your Neighbors Are 
Burglarized 
</P>
<P>
 If your neighbor's home is burglarized, don't be surprised if you're happy it 
was him and not you, said Mory Framer, a psychologist with Barrington 
Psychiatric Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common reaction to a neighbor's loss is becoming nervous and worrying 
that you'll be next. Help yourself and your neighbors at this time of crisis by 
considering the following tips: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't withdraw from your neighbors. Avoid acting as if having anything to 
do with your neighbors will contaminate you, says Dr. Louis West, professor of 
psychiatry at UCLA. Also don't blame them for what happened; it could have been 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offer a helping hand. If there was damage, help clean up. You can also 
bring food. Your neighbor will probably be too distraught to think about 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never minimize. "While it's true that it is fortunate your neighbors 
weren't hurt in the burglary, don't insist they feel lucky about being 
unharmed," Framer said. "The fact is they were emotionally damaged and you 
probably have no idea how they feel, so be supportive of their sense of loss." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take action. Do what you can to safeguard against this happening to another 
member of the neighborhood. Have the police come out and explain how you can 
burglar-proof your homes and take their advice. Explaining a Break-In to Your 
Children 
</P>
<P>
 If you have children, a burglary can be doubly stressful as you try to calm 
them and explain what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Be very sensitive to your children's reaction to the burglary, said Santa Ana 
child psychologist Amy Stark. "It's best to let them ask you questions about 
what happened. Even if they ask the same question over and over, let them talk 
about what happened as much as possible," she says. "This is their way of 
coming to terms with what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 To make your kids feel safe again, demonstrate how you've safeguarded the home 
by showing them new security devices such as deadbolts and/or an alarm and 
explain how they work. 
</P>
<P>
 Many kids will have difficulty sleeping after a burglary. "This is perfectly 
normal and will pass," Stark said. "They may need to sleep with you for a few 
nights until they feel comfortable again, and that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Although you don't want to hide the fact from your children that you are 
upset, don't appear to be too distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids get their cues from you. When they see you go into recovery, they will 
too," she says. "If you need to talk to someone about how upset you are over 
the burglary, talk to another adult, not your children."

HOT PROPERTY: ARTS CZAR HAS CAPITAL IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress JANE ALEXANDER, who was sworn in this fall as chair of the National 
Endowment for the Arts, and her husband, Ed Sherin, co-executive producer of 
the New York-based TV series "Law & Order," have sold their Santa Monica condo 
and are moving to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, 54, won a Tony Award in 1969 for her Broadway performance as the 
white mistress of a black heavyweight champ in "The Great White Hope" and she 
earned an Oscar nomination for the film version. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 
play was directed by Alexander's husband when it opened in Washington with the 
help of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander also won the TV Critics Circle Award for her portrayal of Eleanor 
Roosevelt in the miniseries "Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years" 
(1977) and was nominated for a Tony last summer for her role in "The Sisters 
Rosenszweig." 
</P>
<P>
 She and Sherin sold their condo for close to its listing price of $449,000, 
sources say. Martin Leeds, an entertainment attorney who was a vice president 
of CBS and an executive of Desilu Productions, and his wife, Shirley, were 
identified as the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The penthouse unit has an unobstructed view of the ocean and two bedrooms in 
about 1,500 square feet. Built in 1979, the condo was owned by Alexander and 
Sherin for seven years. Randi Pollock and her mother, Phyllis, both with Fred 
Sands' Santa Monica office, handled the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Grammy-winning record producer MICHAEL OMARTIAN has moved to Nashville, and he 
has listed his home in Northridge, with its eight bedrooms and 10 baths in 
about 10,000 square feet, at $995,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Omartian, 48, moved to Los Angeles from Chicago in 1970 to pursue a career in 
music, working as a keyboardist and arranger. Now, with a number of gold and 
platinum records behind him, he has produced recordings by stars such as Rod 
Stewart, Michael Bolton, Whitney Houston and Amy Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Omartian, who is a songwriter and recording artist himself, is the first 
producer to have No. 1 hits in the 1970s, '80s and '90s, according to Billboard 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Omartians moved to Northridge about four years ago and paid $1.45 million 
for their new home, which they renovated at a cost of "additional hundreds of 
thousands," said listing agent Georgiana D'Angelo of Coldwell Banker, Estates 
Division, in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 BUDDY SHEFFIELD, a head writer for "In Living Color" who created the 
fast-moving variety show "Roundhouse" for Nickelodeon in 1992, has purchased a 
Hollywood Hills home once owned by Oscar-winning screenwriter Preston Sturges, 
who died in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturges, one of the first of the sound-era screenwriters to become a director, 
was known for such innovations as using a voice-over narrative to advance the 
story, as he did in the 1933 film "The Power and the Glory," a model for 
"Citizen Kane." During the 1940s, Sturges was hailed as a comic genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he became a screenwriter, he managed his mother's cosmetic shop in New 
York and invented kissproof lipstick in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Chaplin was married in the living room of the house that Sheffield 
bought, and Bette Davis climbed on top of a 60-foot-long bar and left dents 
where she danced in her high heels, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield reportedly bought the 6,000-square-foot home for just under its 
asking price of $619,000. Dan Sager of Jon Douglas Co., Hancock Park, 
represented Sheffield in the purchase, and Denny Kagasoff of Jon Douglas Co., 
Sunset Strip, represented the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie producer JAMES G. ROBINSON has purchased the former Bel-Air home of the 
late John C. Tyler, co-founder of Farmers Insurance Group, for about $2.6 
million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who owns Morgan Creek Productions, was executive producer of "True 
Romance" (1993), "Freejack" (1992), "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992), "Robin 
Hood: Prince of Thieves" (1991), "Pacific Heights" (1990) and "Young Guns II" 
(1990). 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which was built in the 1930s, has five bedrooms and five fireplaces 
in just under 7,000 square feet, on about an acre. Priced originally at $3.9 
million, the house had been on the market since Tyler's widow, Alice, died last 
March at 80. The insurance executive died in 1973 at 85. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tylers were known for their philanthropic work, and they co-founded the 
Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, with $150,000 given annually to a 
deserving scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson plans to refurbish the Roland Coate-designed house "to keep its 
classic charm," a source said. Stan Richmond of Jon Douglas Co., Beverly Hills, 
represented the buyer, and Chris Forrest of Jack Hupp & Associates, Beverly 
Hills, represented the Alice Tyler Trust.

THE ANDERSON-GOLDSWORTHY FAMILY; DURING THE COMING MONTHS, WE'LL CHRONICLE 
THEIR TRIALS BY FIRE AS THEY STRUGGLE TO REBUILD THEIR HOME AND LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; O'Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scanning the mountains for smoke has long been an integral part of Nancy 
Goldsworthy's routine. The Pasadena native and life-long veteran of canyon 
living in dry Southern California has always accepted the threat of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Goldsworthy, 45, remembers many occasions during her childhood and 
later when approaching flames forced her and her Pasadena Glen neighbors to 
evacuate the enclave of older homes and cabins tucked beneath a thick canopy of 
trees and foliage at the base of the San Gabriel mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until 1975 that the nightmare of fire became reality for her. 
However, a faulty floor furnace -- not mother nature -- sparked that blaze, 
which consumed the house, devoured photos and destroyed irreplaceable mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought lightening would strike twice," Goldsworthy, an architect, 
said recently. "But it did." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 27, flames from the Altadena fire raced through the Pasadena-adjacent 
neighborhood in unincorporated Los Angeles County, destroying 28 of 33 Pasadena 
Glen homes, hers included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look and sound like whole people," Goldsworthy said recently of her 
husband, their daughter and her son from a previous marriage. "But we're really 
shells. We're brain dead from all the trauma and disassociation from familiar 
routines, habits and accouterments of life. There's so many disorienting 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just after 5 a.m. on Oct. 27 when Bob Anderson, Goldsworthy's husband, 
awakened. The power was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a building contractor, got up to check the electrical breaker. But 
when he stepped outside, he noticed the rest of the Glen, as residents call the 
neighborhood, was dark as well. Then he glanced toward the mountain ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see the glow from the fire," Anderson said. "I just remember how 
eerie it was -- big enough to see but far enough away not to feel imminent 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, he said, there were no wailing sirens from fire and rescue 
vehicles, only silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson told Goldsworthy, who immediately ran out to look for herself. The 
fire was to the west of the Glen, and all the mountain fires she had witnessed 
had burned west. She hoped that would be the case this time too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called a couple friends in the Glen just to warn them," Goldsworthy said. 
"Then I got the pictures that were scattered around in different places and 
loaded them in the car. I said to Bob, 'Am I being stupid getting this stuff? 
Am I paranoid because the house burned down once before?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But both agreed to err on the side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the electricity returned and the couple's daughter, Calista, then 
22 months old, awakened and was content to watch "Sesame Street" as Mom and Dad 
undertook the difficult task of choosing what to save and what to leave. 
Goldsworthy's son, Jeff Hackett, 14, had moved out a few months earlier to live 
with his father and step family in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last fire, I kept thinking, if only I had five minutes to get the 
stuff," Goldsworthy said. "And we had probably more than an hour (this time) 
and it still wasn't enough time." 
</P>
<P>
 At first it went smoothly. They quickly began packing up family photos, 
important documents, Anderson's company papers and his construction tools. But 
as the flames became more threatening, their efficiency gave way to disarray 
and forgetfulness: 
</P>
<P>
 They grabbed their good, but easy-to-replace clothing instead of their 
comfortable favorites. Goldsworthy took a pony saddle but overlooked the nearby 
rocking chair her great-grandfather had given her at her birth. They picked up 
other easy-to-replace items, but forgot a handmade quilt from Goldsworthy's 
grandmother and the box of toys her son had played with as a child and still 
cherished. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think about was the stuff I couldn't take," said Anderson, who 
did much of the evacuation himself as Goldsworthy prepared the family's two 
horses and pony to leave the one-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe the house was going to burn. I was completely shell-shocked 
. . . in that first hour, we had gotten most of the stuff that we now consider 
to be the really important things. We look at the stuff in the last hour after 
Nancy left, and it all seems inconsequential." As Goldsworthy prepared the 
horses, white ash rained down on the property and smoke was heading their way 
-- the fire had broken from its historic burn pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see the fire coming east," she said. "The gray and brown smoke was 
punctuated by these big black puffs of smoke and I knew they were houses." 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to leave. Goldsworthy loaded the horses in the trailer and 
gathered up Calista. A neighbor led the pony to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson packed the last few items in the family truck and joined other 
neighbors in a safe vantage point from the approaching flames. By about 8:30 
a.m., the fire had engulfed the Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't absolutely sure (the house) had burned until I went back that 
afternoon, then I could see it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsworthy's son, Jeff, was the first family member to arrive at the charred, 
smoky home site. The devastation left him in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the lot where the house used to be and charred trees. It just looked 
like a pit," the teen-ager said of the burned two-story home that had collapsed 
into its basement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days immediately after the blaze, the family sifted through the 
blackened pile of ash and melted, twisted rubble that was their home and 
possessions. But the flames burned so hot, little was salvageable or even 
recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the toughest tasks was coping with the trauma of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, I just couldn't face the fact that the house was gone," said 
Anderson, also a Pasadena native. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emotional part didn't come out of me until three or four days later when 
I would start bursting into tears at times when I'd see all the help people 
were giving," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was often surprised when objects unlikely to evoke a reaction would 
bring on the sting of tears, like the roadside portable toilet for residents 
set up by the sanitation department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just sort of tragic joy," he said. "Everyone was lending a helping 
hand and that's the thing that's blown me away since this thing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Even young Calista didn't escape the emotional upheaval. Anderson said that 
became clear to him recently when a family friend offered to meet him and the 
toddler at the burned home site to drop off a wooden high chair for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calista saw the chair and said, 'Oh, no!"' Anderson recalled. "But the way 
she said it and and the look in her eyes made it clear she knew she had a high 
chair and she was getting another high chair and this wasn't her high chair." 
</P>
<P>
 But much of that discomfort seems behind the 2-year-old, who is once again 
eager to help Anderson with the twice-a-day feeding of the family horses, who 
are back on the home site. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first she didn't want to go up there," Anderson said. "But now it's like 
old times. It's like re-establishing rituals." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the comfortable routines of life are a long way off. Since the fire, 
the couple, who met in kindergarten and married in 1990, and Calista have 
shared a roof with Goldsworthy's parents. "We have all of Calista's clothes in 
little baskets on the floor. It's an obstacle course to get anywhere," Anderson 
said. "We get a little cabin fever sometimes and I'm feeling disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says he spends literally hours daily developing a list of lost 
possessions for the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a nightmare," he said. "It's unbelievable. It's easy to remember 
the big bulky things but then you have to open up drawers in your mind and it's 
really hard to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The couple is close to settling with their insurance company and are expecting 
to get $180,000 for the 1,700-square-foot house, which they expect won't cover 
the cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life is returning to the Glen. Bright green sprouts of bulbs have 
pushed through the ash and mud. New leaves have sprouted along branches of the 
less-damaged oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every little bit of green is exciting," a smiling Goldsworthy told a visitor 
one recent, cold morning. "When we first saw it, it looked like hell, like 
Dante's inferno . . . there were still spot fires burning. There was smoke. It 
was really eerie. But with the bits of green, it now makes you feel like 
there's life here."

YOUR MORTGAGE; FED GIVES BUYERS ACCESS TO THEIR APPRAISALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key federal agency has put the finishing touches on long-awaited rules 
governing your rights as a home mortgage borrower to obtain the complete 
appraisal documents your lender used in deciding whether to approve -- or deny 
-- your loan application. 
</P>
<P>
 Although first authorized two years ago via amendments to the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act, widespread consumer access to home appraisals nationwide has 
awaited issuance of regulations by the Federal Reserve Board. Before heading 
home for the holidays, the Fed's governors did precisely that. The new rules 
won't be mandatory for lenders until June 14, but industry experts say many 
banks and mortgage firms will attempt to comply far sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick overview of what the Fed's appraisal "bill of rights" means to 
you. Beginning in the new year, don't be surprised if the loan company you 
apply to provides you a copy of your real estate appraisal automatically -- 
without your even requesting it. That's because the Fed's new regulation 
actively encourages banks and mortgage companies to cut red tape and 
administrative hassles by furnishing appraisal copies to every applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 For lenders who choose not to go the automatic route, the Fed requires that a 
new, written disclosure be delivered to every consumer who applies for a 
mortgage. The Fed's wording almost sounds like a reading of Miranda rights: 
"You have the right to a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with 
your application for credit." You have a right to it, the notice goes on, but 
only if you write for it within 90 days after the lender has informed you of 
its decision on your loan. Alternatively you can write for it within 90 days 
after you withdraw your loan application. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything clear so far? 
</P>
<P>
 For the lender, the new Fed rule answers questions raised by industry and 
consumer groups during the past 12 months of debate over appraisal disclosures. 
For instance, it confirms that you not only have a right to the independent 
appraiser's official report -- paid for by you -- but also to any in-house 
valuation report that caused the lender to assign a higher or lower market 
valuation than called for by the independent appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly important for two reasons: Civil rights investigators 
have found that when a lender "redlines" or illegally discriminates against 
borrowers from a geographical area or neighborhood, low-balling on appraisals 
often plays a key role. Armed with the legal right to see not only the 
independent appraiser's evaluation but also in-house modifications to those 
conclusions, rejected loan applicants may be able to document redlining abuses 
more readily. 
</P>
<P>
 A second advantage: Federal banking regulators have proposed that on home 
appraisals below $250,000, the use of state-certified, independent appraisers 
will not be mandatory for lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they would be able to rely on unlicensed, in-house "valuators" for 
data on a property's market worth. If consumers' access was restricted solely 
to third-party, independent appraisal reports, they could be cut off from these 
potentially crucial in-house appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fed senior attorney, Michael Bylsma, noted that the new rule doesn't give a 
consumer carte blanche right to see every shred of paper used by the lender in 
the valuation process. If a lender conducted a formal review appraisal -- 
essentially a lender's double-check on the original outside appraisal -- the 
borrower would have no automatic right to that report unless it caused a 
different final valuation on the property, said Bylsma. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Fed rule, you have the right to see internal staff appraisal 
documents and notes if they reveal "why the value assigned by the (independent 
outside) appraiser is not the appropriate valuation." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you find that out, if your mortgage application is turned down for 
property valuation reasons? You ask. You now have the right to know, and you 
have the right to see whatever data caused the turndown. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you want to get your hands on your appraisal for other reasons -- such 
as reopening the bargaining process with the seller of the property before the 
deal goes to closing? Say, for example, that the formal appraisal reveals 
negative factors about the house itself, environmental risks in the area, or 
neighborhood property value trends that you'd not been aware of? Under the 
Fed's new rule, you merely have to file a written request and your lender has 
to furnish a copy of the appraisal with 30 days after the receipt of your 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 With negotiating skill and the appraisal report in hand, who knows? You could 
walk away with a lower price on the house or more generous financing terms from 
the seller. Or you might be able to get out of the contract itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is: Without the appraisal -- now yours by legal right -- you might 
have bought the wrong house for the wrong amount of money.

RENT WATCH: WHEN ARE RENTERS ENTITLED TO GRACE PERIOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times; This column is prepared by Project Sentinel, a rental 
housing mediation service in Sunnyvale, Calif.

<P>
 QUESTION: I rent a one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month basis, and my 
rent is due on the first of the month. When I ran into financial problems last 
month, my landlord told me that I could have a few more days to come up with 
the money, and I paid my rent by the sixth of the month. My financial problems 
continued this month and forced me to pay my rent on the fourth. However, this 
time my landlord gave me a three-day notice to pay or quit when I was late 
paying my rent. What is the rule, aren't renters entitled to a grace period? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: No, renters are not automatically entitled to a grace period unless 
such a period is actually written into the rental agreement. If your landlord 
verbally agreed to bend the rules the first month, it does not mean that he/she 
has to provide you with extra time every month. It is important to read and 
understand a rental agreement before you sign it, since a written document will 
often prevail over an oral agreement should your landlord try to evict you for 
late payment of rent. Finally, remember to make any changes in your contract, 
including changes establishing or affecting a grace period, in writing so that 
you will have adequate proof in the event of a dispute. Owner Refuses to Rent 
to AA Participant 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am an alcoholic who is presently in a recovery program. Recently, I tried 
to rent an apartment, but I was turned down because the owner found out I was 
attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Is it illegal for the owner to refuse 
to rent to me for this reason? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, it is illegal for the owner to discriminate against you because you 
participate in AA. The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 provides 
protection for people like yourself who are in recovery from a disability, 
although it will not protect you if you are currently using drugs illegally. 
You may want to contact your local fair housing agency to file a complaint 
against the owner for discriminating against you because of your disability. If 
the owner is unaware of the law, he may reconsider after he has been informed 
by the agency. Can 30-Day Notice Be Waived Due to Theft? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A tenant called me today to tell me his apartment had been broken into last 
night and some of his possessions were stolen. He stated that he would need to 
move out immediately as he no longer feels safe in the neighborhood. He 
believes that under the circumstances, he is relieved from the 30-day notice 
requirement. Can I lose my rights to a 30-day notice because of a situation my 
tenant brought on himself by leaving his window open? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ordinarily, a landlord is not responsible for the unlawful acts of third 
parties unless the landlord knew or should have known that a criminal act was 
likely to take place on his property. Even so, there are some situations when a 
landlord may be responsible for injuries caused by a third party. A landlord is 
held to a higher standard of care when he advertises the property as a 
"security building." The landlord is also responsible when he knew or should 
have known of a condition on his property that would make the commission of a 
crime easier to perpetrate, i.e., if lights on the property have burned out and 
should have been replaced but weren't, and as a result, a tenant was raped or 
mugged. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were not aware of other incidents of theft at your complex, the fact 
that your tenant was robbed does not relieve him of his obligation to give you 
a 30-day notice. If you tenant does not feel safe there, he has the option to 
move, but not at your expense. Your only obligation is to try to re-rent the 
apartment, as quickly as possible to minimize the financial loss of the tenant.

THE END OF THE AGE OF EUPHEMISM; THE GRAPHIC QUALITY OF DAILY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Neal Gabler, author of An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews 
Invented Hollywood (Anchor/Doubleday), is now working on a book about columnist 
Walter Winchel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a young boy, I remember racing through our morning paper, on my way to the 
sports section, when my eye was caught by a small item. It involved a 
controversy over the movie, "Anatomy of a Murder." The film used the word 
"rape," thus offending delicate sensibilities and sending local censors into 
session to determine whether they would allow the film to be shown. I had no 
idea what "rape" meant, but I recall the item these many years later because 
whatever the word meant, I knew it was illicit -- a term not permitted in 
general discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 My children, now roughly the same age I was then, will have no such memories. 
Today, there are no forbidden words because there are no longer any taboos. 
Virtually every day this past year we were inundated by sexually explicit 
material -- everything from Michael Jackson's alleged child molestation to Amy 
Fisher's affair to Heidi Fleiss' call-girl ring to John Wayne Bobbitt's severed 
member. For the first time, words like "masturbation," "anal intercourse," 
"orgasm," "vagina" and "penis" were appearing regularly in the mainstream press 
and on prime-time entertainment -- making 1993 the year that the age of 
euphemism finally came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the end hadn't been coming. For decades, we have been subjected to 
ever more graphic depictions of sex on the movie screen, in literature, in 
music and in art. For nearly as many years, we have exhibited greater frankness 
in our public discussions about sexual matters. As nearly everything else in 
America has become awash in image, sex has been a lonely island of candor. The 
wider we feel the sea of hypocrisy grows, the more graphic the sexual 
depictions become. 
</P>
<P>
 But until recently, certain protocols were still observed in the general 
media. Sex, especially deviant sex, was treated gingerly, clinically. Some 
words were just not used. Some actions had to be inferred. Even the tabloid 
press, which traded freely in sensationalism, spoke in code or rationed its 
explicit descriptions of sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years the protocols have been falling. Almost every TV talk 
show from Sally Jessy Raphael to Geraldo to Donahue to Oprah now features 
women, and occasionally men, baring their deepest sexual secrets. Syndicated 
shock jock Howard Stern has pioneered graphic sexual language on the radio. Rap 
music is largely dedicated to the raunchiest sexual expressions. Political 
talk, from President Bill Clinton to Sen. Bob Packwood, is soaked with sex. But 
it wasn't until 1993 that the protocols fell entirely and we got what seemed a 
daily diet of sexual stories told in terms once reserved for pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has this happened? Though conservatives blame permissiveness for a 
declining sense of propriety -- as they blame it for every social malfunction 
-- it is not easy to impute the media's obsession with sex to any sudden burst 
of licentiousness. If anything, the AIDS crisis has curbed promiscuity, so the 
new explicitness might be partly a product of the new chastity -- denied real 
sexual gratification, people are driven into vicariousness as the safest sex of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also powerful pressures within the media that give vent to explicit 
sexual coverage. It is strange to think of the news as titillating -- but 
newsmen and media mavens are certainly thinking that way. Sex sells, and while 
that might not have been a consideration for news executives in years past, it 
has become a consideration as straight news edges into and competes with 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, whatever the impact of AIDS on sexual thinking and whatever the economic 
imperatives to sell sex in the media, the end of euphemism may ultimately have 
less to do with our preoccupation with sex itself than it has to do with how we 
use sex metaphorically. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex has always been a metaphor. To write about sex, to discuss sex, to use 
sexually graphic words and descriptions, as Henry Miller and Anais Nin did, 
were ways of flaunting what they saw as the calcifying, old social order. Both 
the provocateurs and the custodians of that social order understood this. They 
knew that what was at stake in the censorship battle wasn't sex at all -- but 
rather control of the culture. Sex was merely the gauntlet the provocateurs 
threw down; it was their metaphor for honesty and free expression in a world 
governed by what they regarded as bourgeois hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the literary avant-garde was not alone. While it was hammering at the 
social order from the top, the foot soldiers of mass culture were opening a 
second front at the grass roots. These warriors weren't intellectuals and 
didn't have the imprimatur of art, but they did share the avant-garde's 
distaste for the old cultural commissars who had long determined what was and 
what was not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the provocateurs, proponents of mass culture used sex as one of their 
battering rams. Movies, popular music, pulp novels and other mass media 
introduced sex into the general culture. Gradually, this bombardment of sexual 
imagery, most largely circumspect and euphemistic, would chip away at the old 
official culture and breach its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the protocols held. Even as the general media doted on Mae West or 
Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield or even Christine Jorgenson -- all walking 
euphemisms -- the most sexually explicit material was held to the margins, in 
pornographic magazines and novels. Certainly none ever made its way into the 
traditional press. For that to happen, as it has now, the metaphor of sex had 
to acquire a new energy so virulent that the protocols could not withstand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years there have been several sources that have fueled, as 
well as changed, the sexual metaphor. One of them is our own sense that 
American society, beset as it is with a host of intractable problems, is now 
somehow less governable. Explicit reports of sex, especially deviant sex, are a 
way of reinforcing the idea that no one is really in control anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sex has become a metaphor for intimacy in an increasingly 
atomized and mobile society where there is little enough intimacy of any other 
kind. That may be why sex is a staple of the afternoon talk shows. By telling 
us about their sexual fantasies, the pathetic women of the talk-show circuit 
are trying to create some bond with us, however transient.  
</P>
<P>
 But finally, the end of euphemism and the new sexual explicitness may really 
be products of the old metaphor of "sex as honesty" now revived in a different, 
more urgent context -- one in which honesty is given the highest possible 
premium. That is because we are more aware of the techniques of duplicity: spin 
doctoring, infomercials, PR campaigns, dirty tricks. We feel a pervasive lack 
of authenticity in politics, art, religion, athletics, even human relations. We 
no longer believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the fakery, we want something real. And just as the sex act itself rips 
through layers of inauthenticity to something fundamental, so, metaphorically 
speaking, does sexually explicit language rip through the layers of 
prevarication, manipulation, image and euphemism to something basic, primitive 
and genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeking beneath the sheets of some housewife on Geraldo or of Michael Jackson 
promises us truth. So does Howard Stern telling us in vivid detail about his 
sex life. So does every new graphic sexual revelation about priests molesting 
choir boys or fathers abusing daughters. If sex isn't hidden, then nothing is. 
That is why euphemisms finally had to go -- because euphemisms are just another 
form of concealment. Only the shock therapy of brutal language, graphic 
language can shake us from the perfidy of deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the battering ram of sex now pounds away each day, providing a kind of 
social ground zero. We know everything. We hear everything. And if it sometimes 
feels as if we are living within one endless pornographic movie, it is the 
price we pay for candor. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything else would seem dishonest.

IN POST-COLD WAR ERA, IT'S FREE WORLD THAT'S SHIFTING; DIPLOMACY: RELATIONSHIPS 
THAT WERE ALLIANCES OF CONVENIENCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION ARE 
NOW BEING RE-EVALUATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). He is now writing a book about U.S. foreign policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Cold War ended and the Berlin Wall came down, many people looked for 
huge political changes in Eastern Europe and expected that the rest of the 
world -- what we used to call the Free World during the Cold War -- would stay 
pretty much unchanged. It hasn't worked out that way, and there are important 
lessons here for the United States to learn.  
</P>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe the communists, ex- and not-very-ex, are on a roll. A string 
of election victories and near-victories has put heirs of Josef Stalin's 
parties in or near power in half-a-dozen countries in Eastern Europe. In East 
Germany, the ex-communists pushed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats 
into third place in the most recent local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the winds of change are blowing -- through the West. In Japan, 40 
years of power by the (misnamed) Liberal Democratic Party ended last summer and 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan, a party long opposed to Japan's role in 
the U.S. system of Cold War alliances, is now the largest bloc in a new 
government.  
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, the heirs of the Italian Communist Party are now the most powerful 
political force in a disintegrating political structure. Their strongest rivals 
are a party that wants Italy to break up and a neo-fascist movement that ran 
Benito Mussolini's granddaughter for mayor of Naples. The people U.S. policy 
tried to exclude from Italian politics look set to control the next stage in 
Italy's evolution.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinistas are, in effect, part of the governing coalition in Nicaragua; 
the current president of South Korea was a dissident during the Cold War; a 
socialist jailed by America's military allies is the front-runner for the next 
presidential election in Brazil; the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
African National Congress, both denounced by Cold-War American leaders as 
terrorist organizations with communist links, now look like 
governments-in-waiting.  
</P>
<P>
 None of this was in the script. The Cold War was supposed to be a battle 
between the United States and the Free World against the Soviet Union and the 
Slave World. Our allies, we kept telling ourselves, were members of the Free 
World; their allies were satellites and puppets. Fidel Castro was a puppet of 
Moscow, while El Salvador's murdering oligarchy was "making progress toward 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But life is never as simple as political rhetoric would have it. In some 
countries, U.S. allies were genuine democrats; in others they were, well, 
puppets and satellites. The shah, Manuel A. Noriega before he bit the hand that 
fed him -- we can all add names to the list.  
</P>
<P>
 In many countries the lines between satellite and genuine national democracy 
were blurred. Italy's Christian Democrats and their allies were genuine local 
movements that had close ties to the CIA and the U.S. government at various 
points in their history. During most of the Cold War, governments in West 
Germany and Japan considered themselves dependent on the American "big brother" 
who had defeated them in World War II and now protected them from the Soviet 
Union.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. alliances in the Cold War were not always alliances with entire 
countries; sometimes they were just with a regime or one political party. This 
was particularly obvious in countries like Greece, South Korea, South Vietnam, 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Taiwan. In all these countries, the U.S. government 
supported one side in a civil war, and communists supported the other. In other 
countries the Americans did not need to be so heavy handed, but their influence 
was still felt. Both the United States and the Soviet Union interfered in the 
internal affairs of other countries throughout the Cold War; both infiltrated 
political parties, sent financial assistance to friendly political factions and 
generally did their best to control the outcome of political processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now both sets of foreign influences are being withdrawn, and countries are 
trying to find a new political balance based on the strengths of their internal 
political forces. Communist parties in the Western world have been deprived of 
financial support and liberated from the ideological connection to Moscow. 
Pro-Western parties are also forced to get by on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes will not be trivial. Greece, an honorary part of the West during 
the Cold War, is beginning to look and act more like a Balkan country than a 
Western European one. Germany and Japan must now decide whether they wish to 
belong to the Western world or not. During the Cold War, they had little choice 
-- the alliance with the United States was both welcome and necessary. Now they 
must choose for themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 All this suggests a new interpretation of America's victory in the Cold War. 
Conventional wisdom originally assumed that the United States won the Cold War 
the way we won World War II: The end of the conflict left the America 
unchallenged in the world. What was true of the United States was true of our 
principles: Free markets and free political institutions were about to sweep 
the globe.  
</P>
<P>
 We wish. The United States does not bestride the world like an invincible 
colossus. Soviet Union or no Soviet Union, the United States cannot impose its 
will on Somalia or even on Haiti. Our Cold War allies can, when they wish, 
thumb their noses at us with impunity. Over Bosnia and on trade issues, the 
Western allies demonstrated an independence that would have been unthinkable at 
the height of the Cold War.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans will have a clearer idea of the international situation if they 
compare our Cold War victory to Britain's victory in World War I. Britain was a 
superpower going into the war and it remained a superpower coming out of it; 
and Germany, Britain's great rival, was decisively defeated. For a few years 
after the war, the British behaved like an unchallenged superpower. They sent 
troops to trouble spots around the world; they bombed Iraq into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the British soon found that they were overextended. They were helpless to 
establish democracy in Russia or to prevent ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. In 
the end, they gave up the effort to establish world order, retreated to 
relative isolationism and ignored the dangers posed by the rise of fascism in 
Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 These mistakes would be easy for the United States to repeat. Overconfidence 
has already led us to commit ourselves too often and too far overseas; we may 
be on the verge of an equally excessive retreat into misguided isolation.  
</P>
<P>
 In the rapidly changing world, the United States needs a realistic sense both 
of its powers and its limits in foreign policy. The "Free World" is changing as 
fast as the Communist World as the '90s roll on; our ex-enemies aren't changing 
as much as we hoped and our old friends are changing in ways we can't always 
predict and often don't like. The world is a far more complicated place now 
than during the Cold War -- and it gets more complex every day. The Clinton 
Administration will need all the skill and luck it can get to find its way 
through the pitfalls and land mines so thickly scattered across the post-Cold 
War international landscape.

1994 -- A YEAR OF HOT SPOTS AND FRAGMENTING COUNTRIES; NATIONS: IS THE CYCLE OF 
THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY AROUND THE GLOBE JUST ABOUT OVER? CAN THESE NEW 
GOVERNMENTS FULFILL THEIR CITIZENS' EXPECTATIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robin Wright, Robin Wright covers global affairs for The Times and is the 
co-author, with Doyle McManus, of Flashpoints (Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fasten your seat belts, folks, because 1994 is here. In contrast to the often 
euphoric five years since the onset of global change, 1994 could well be the 
bloodiest and most frustrating period of the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have redeeming moments -- particularly as the Middle East and South 
Africa implement peace pacts this spring. Indeed, from history's perspective, 
the mid-1990s are likely to be regarded as critical in shaping a new epoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from the short-term perspective of those living through it, 1994 will 
often feel hellacious, as a host of flash points from central Africa to Central 
Asia implode, as the scramble for the deadliest weapons accelerates and as even 
states experiencing positive change go through rough, sorting-out periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The year will have its share of sexy headline grabbers. Washington is already 
speculating, for example, about whether North Korea's nuclear potential will be 
for Bill Clinton what Cuba's missile crisis was to John F. Kennedy -- though 
Pyongyang has more to gain from mediation, including aid, than confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will defy the odds if he survives the year. His 
passing offers a pretext for change, or new demands for it, in the world's last 
empire -- even though China's course, post-Deng, appears charted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several 1993 holdovers offer hopeful prospects -- even if based more on 
wishful thinking than reality. New scuttlebutt suggests Iraq's Saddam Hussein 
survived a roadside bombing during a trip last fall known only to his inner 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the year will have its "surprises" -- though many are already 
predictable. In Algeria, Muslim resistance since the 1992 military coup is 
becoming the kind of landmark for the broader Islamic movement that the 
legendary battle of Algiers was to Third World independence three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And upheaval seems unavoidable in Zaire, the massive country in the belly of 
Africa where the currency has fallen against the dollar -- from 300 to $1, in 
1990, to more than 100 million to $1 last month. Human-rights abuses are 
reportedly the worst since the 1960s civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than specific hot spots, 1994's place in history is likely to be 
judged by overall progress on democracy -- a trend now in serious trouble. "The 
cycle's about run out," Joe Ryan of Freedom House, a human-rights monitoring 
group, reflected on the eve of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Andes to the Atlas mountains, from Siberia's frozen tundra to India's 
steamy slums, the basic problem is that democracy is failing to penetrate deep 
enough into either state apparatus or societies to survive myriad challenges. 
Threats will play out on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is in elections, where the results of change are likely to be 
increasingly uneven -- often bringing to power either the undesirable or the 
unexpected, and altering the agenda. The rise of ultra-nationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky in Russia's parliamentary elections last month, for example, 
ensures that states on the periphery -- from Latvia in the Baltics to 
Kazakhstan in Central Asia -- will increasingly be flash points in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky has threatened trade restrictions and even military intervention 
in response to real or alleged problems of Russian minorities in former Soviet 
republics -- an issue Boris N. Yeltsin will have to address to preempt his 
powerful rival. Yet, not surprisingly, the new states are installing their own 
officials and agendas, unsettling local Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum is Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, 
a socialist planning to run for president of Brazil in 1994 -- and favored 2 to 
1 over his nearest rival in recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many new democracies, Brazilians' faith in pluralism is being tested by 
painful economic reforms, crime and corruption. In Latin America, only Chile 
has successfully mixed market economics with social policies to reduce poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's annual inflation last year hit 2,500%, as free markets helped widen 
the already enormous gap between rich and poor. A corruption scandal forced 
Brazil's democratically elected president to resign in 1992, while, in 1993, 
congress launched investigations into corruption charges against dozens of 
deputies, governors and former government ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zhirinovsky and Lula are symbols of broader challenges in young 
democracies unable to meet expectations of newly empowered constituents. Their 
rise is due as much to fear as to personal appeal. But either way, they are 
unlikely to be lone examples by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, demands for greater participation will often contribute as much to 
dismembering states as to changing them within -- again, in part, because 
democracy hasn't penetrated deeply enough or calmed nationalist insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
 But disintegration is less likely to be along neat, predetermined borders -- 
as when the 15 Soviet republics became 15 independent states in 1991. Redrawing 
the world map will often be messier, opening up whole new conflicts -- and 
perhaps making Bosnia a model for the 1990s as Lebanon was to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems are not limited to developing countries. Canada's Quebec question, 
for example, may be settled by 1994 elections. If the separatist Parti 
Quebecois wins, as polls suggest, a vote on secession is expected to follow. 
The party has already set June 24, 1995 for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the easy part. Quebec then has to deal with native Americans -- and 
whether they, too, gain independence. Since the late '80s, a growing 
native-rights movement has had both peaceful and bloody confrontations with 
Quebec authorities. Canada has already agreed to create a self-governed Inuit 
homeland, called Nunavut, in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia, attempting to forestall 
greater participation, will also be bigger flash points in 1994. Besides 
Algeria, crises are already looming in states from Egypt to Tajikistan, where 
Islam appears to be a popular alternative but governments are balking rather 
than accommodating strong public sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, democracy's progress is affected by peace in unusual ways. Precedents 
in 1993, between Palestinians and Israelis and between South Africa's blacks 
and whites, bode well this year in other areas of prolonged conflict. Barring 
unexpected events -- such as death of a major player or tangential crises -- 
Israeli pacts with Syria and Jordan are likely in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet peace opens up as many issues as it resolves. Ending the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, for example, eliminates the defining issue for several Arab leaders. 
Rather than stability, peace may instead usher in greater short-term 
instability -- as an opposition sees change is possible and wants more of it. 
So even in lands of peace and hope, the ride may get rough. 
</P>
<P>
 But the democracy movement isn't being derailed. Too many people now know 
their rights to allow a long-term reversal. The biggest challenge of the year 
will thus be helping democracy overcome the obstacles and take permanent hold 
-- so 1995 will be better.

BUT IS THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY A HIGHWAY?; ECONOMY: BUSINESSES ARE BETTING 
BIG MONEY BY LAYING NEW CABLE -- WHICH COULD BE OBSOLETE BEFORE IT'S USED. 
MAYBE IT'S AN INFORMATION OCEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles R. Morris, Charles R. Morris, a Wall Street consultant, is the 
author of Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a Post-IBM World (Times 
Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with the Clinton Administration's fascination for 
building its much-touted "information superhighway" -- except it probably won't 
be a highway and the federal government can't build it and shouldn't try. The 
real challenge is not to get the federal government into the communication 
business, but to get it adroitly out. 
</P>
<P>
 Both President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are fond of using the 
analogy of the Eisenhower-era federal highway program for the job of building a 
modern, end-of-century, information infrastructure. But the highway analogy is 
decidedly unhelpful as a blueprint for the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, people knew how to build highways. Construction technology and 
road design was a lot better than, say, in 50 BC, but in truth, not that much 
better. U.S. highways were laid out and built in much the same way as the ones 
the Romans built 20 centuries earlier. And in both the Roman and American 
cases, only the central government had the resources and the strategic vantage 
point to put such a system in place -- hardly the case when it comes to 
information technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The most useful learning from the experience of the federal highway program, 
aside from its scale and cost, may be that none of its more profound 
consequences -- like the hollowing out of older cities and proliferation of 
strip developments -- were anticipated by its planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Gore seemed to hit on the highway analogy from the success of the 
"Internet," a set of high-capacity data connections linking universities and 
federal research centers, developed mostly with federal money. Internet use has 
soared, creating an arcane cyberspace party land for wonks, but also speeding 
the dissemination of new research. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending months mining campaign contributions from Silicon Valley 
executives, Clinton and Gore both became impressed, correctly, that the next 
wave of computer technology would involve connecting computers rather than just 
making them run faster. The country with the lead in communications technology 
would be well positioned to take the lead in the global high-tech sweepstakes. 
America had a good shot at cementing a winning position, and the federal 
government should help. Again, correct. 
</P>
<P>
 The logical, but probably incorrect, conclusion was that the brave new 
information infrastructure would just be an extended Internet. The conventional 
wisdom also had it that only the federal government had the financial capacity 
to pay for the thousands of miles of high-capacity fiber-optic cable that most 
people expect to be the backbone of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Confounding expectations, however, business is smelling gold in high-tech 
"multimedia" entertainment and business products, and is laying down an 
information infrastructure faster than anyone imagined just a short time ago. 
TCI and Time-Warner, which together serve more than a third of cable 
households, are spending some $7 billion over the next several years on fiber 
optics. Telephone companies are spending even more. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it's not obvious that the final information "highway" will be a 
highway. Current broadcast technology uses hardly 1% of the available 
electromagnetic spectrum. New technology -- at microwave frequencies and above 
-- can rival fiber optics in capacity, clarity and freedom from interference. 
New cableless "cable" offerings from Hughes and the newest versions of 
microwave telephone service under development could, in theory, make much of 
the frenzied cable laying obsolete before it's ever used. 
</P>
<P>
 An "information ocean" may be closer to the future reality than a highway. 
Information might be transmitted by launching tiny packets of specially coded 
information out into space. Your computer would pick up only those specifically 
intended for you and assemble them into a coherent message, which could be a 
personal letter or a hit movie -- no cables, no central switching system 
required. Or, instead of being beamed into space, they could be pumped into a 
"dumb" fiber network, a sort of universal river of information, with the 
movies, or memos, or data bases, being reassembled by computers sitting on the 
river bank watching the stream zip by. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much uncertainty, many, probably most, technology and marketing bets 
will turn out to be wrong. The driving force may be entertainment -- 
interactive video, home movies, video games distributed by television channel 
or that holy grail of home viewing, virtual-reality pornography. Or it may be 
business -- portable data networks, video conferencing, electronic books and 
catalogues, home shopping. Or some unexpected combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning technology may be wire, fiber optic, microwave, CD ROM, switched 
networks or passive information "oceans." The missing ingredient may simply be 
Hollywood production values -- much of what now passes as "multimedia" 
educational or entertainment material is poor. Home viewers may flock to 
interactive new features or prefer couch-potato passivity. Nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain is that some companies will make a lot of money -- and a lot 
more will lose out. It's also obvious that it makes no sense for the federal 
government to weigh in and start building things. Judging by Gore's more recent 
speeches, the Administration has now come to that same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 But what should the federal government do? The communication industry is now 
one of the country's most regulated. And the regulatory apparatus is a huge, 
ramshackle structure. One of the system's keystones, in fact, is an elderly 
federal judge who supervised the AT&T antitrust case more than a decade ago, 
and therefore still has the final, sometimes quirky, say on what businesses 
phone companies may enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it's grown like a coral reef, the system is honeycombed with special 
interests -- some more laudable than others. Local telephone regulators keep 
local service charges artificially low -- voters seem to like that -- but sock 
it to business and callers connecting from out of state. Newspapers are 
panicked that regulators will let phone companies provide electronic "Yellow 
Page" services, cutting into lucrative advertising revenues (and, incidentally, 
preserving forests). Powerful congressmen, business executives and consumer 
groups stand like so many Horatios, ready to defend their pet interests to the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewing some sort of sensible new regulatory pathway through the current maze 
-- in particular, trying to decide what to stop regulating -- is the kind of 
problem politicians shun. All you can do is offend people; it's far more fun to 
break champagne bottles over a federally subsidized TVA for information 
technology. But this is the kind of nasty task that we elect governments for, 
and is a real opportunity for the Clinton-Gore team to make a long-term 
contribution to the country's economic leadership.

EXCERPTS FROM THE DIARY OF A SIMPLE FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time I met the Fuhrer, I was admiring my beautiful body in the 
mirror in the Ladies' Room of the Adlon Hotel in Berlin, when he came in, with 
Mussolini, Goebbels, Speer, Goering, Himmler, Adm. Horthy and von Ribbentrop. I 
will always believe they had wrongly thought it to be the Men's Room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ach! Excuse us!" he stammered in that way I would learn to know so well -- 
but not too well -- and retreated like a schoolboy, much abashed. I thought 
nothing more of it and went on to attend the premiere that evening of my new 
film, "Amazon Pilots of the Zugspitze." When it came to the dance sequence on 
the glacier, as one, the audience -- which included Enrico Fermi, the king of 
England, Garbo and my mother -- fainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Another success! Too bad poor Sepp could not be there to share it; but I had, 
in the excitement, completely forgotten to raise his bail money! I have often 
wondered, in the years since, if Sepp found the happiness that had always 
eluded him, or if he ever thought about the 50 Reichsmarks he still owed me. 
Somehow, the I.O.U. has survived to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine my lack of surprise when, the next day, a new Mercedes, wrapped in a 
red ribbon, appeared in front of my tiny villa in the woods near the 
Reichschancellery. I was so busy editing the dailies for my newest film 
(retitled "Victory of the Ruthless" by the Propaganda Ministry, despite the 
fact I had intended it as a high-school hygiene documentary), that I failed to 
notice the card attached to the steering wheel. "Just put it in the car park," 
I told my devoted assistant -- I think her name was Irmtraud. So many cars had 
been delivered, from so many men so tiresomely pursuing me! 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the telephone rang. "Nice wheels, nein?" I was hypnotized, 
entranced by that voice, at once crude and seductive, and have often wondered 
since how I ever managed to blurt out a request for 400,000 Reichsmarks and the 
use of the Luftwaffe for my new film project before agreeing, in a daze, to 
have tea with this strange man, of whose politics I knew nothing, while knowing 
that I would despise them if I ever asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual was always the same: Hitler would order oat tea and kelp cakes and 
a liter of vegetable juice for himself and nothing for his guests -- and then 
stick Goebbels with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Goebbels, crafty in all things, would have packed the pockets of his leather 
greatcoat with candy bars and pastries and stand behind the Fuhrer, munching 
them out of his eyesight. He was insanely jealous of my sitting in the Fuhrer's 
lap at those boring teas, little knowing that I had sprained my ankle while 
filming "Flying She-Devils of the Arctic Mists" in 1928, and was in agonizing 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, after tea, the Fuhrer would always make the same joke. "Goebbels, 
you take a hike, while we take a walk." I shall never forget hobbling beside 
him as he confided his innermost thoughts, and will wish to my dying day that I 
had listened more carefully -- but then, amnesia has run in my family for many 
generations, as I was later able to convince the Denazification Tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been so preoccupied in preparing for my film on nude Gypsy horsemen of 
the Spanish plains that World War II was already in its final stages before I 
realized that those loud bangs I had been hearing from my windowless editing 
room were not midnight street repairs but bombs, ruining all the cinemas in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was now that I decided that I hated the Fuhrer, who had brought devastation 
to the film industry and, as I later discovered, much else besides. I was 
writing him a note, telling him how I really felt, when Bormann barged into my 
simple little bunker. "Three Reichs and you're out, kitten -- Adolf's gone to 
Valhalla and I'm off to Paraguay!" 
</P>
<P>
 I often wish I could bring back that moment and tell Bormann -- who never 
liked my films -- what I thought of him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was around this time that I found myself dining at U.S. Army Headquarters 
with Generals Patton and Eisenhower, who appeared not to know who I was and who 
rebuffed my offer to make a documentary film of the hanging of the Nazi war 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Eisenhower, I later learned, who issued the order confiscating the 
meager few gold bars I had buried in my garden, mistaking them for mulch bags 
in the chaos that engulfed the film community. 
</P>
<P>
 I had had my mother press my best gown, and rubbed his leg all evening, and 
screened the only remaining print of "Air Maidens of the Blue Ice" -- for this. 
But a film maker must accept betrayals, cruelty and misunderstanding as 
consequences of being a true Artist. Within hours, I was on the phone to 
Hollywood.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JAMES WOOLSEY; THE INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR SEEKING 
TO DEFINE A NEW ROLE FOR THE CIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Mann, Jim Mann covers national security for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his bald head and thin glasses, R. James Woolsey Jr. might have been cast 
as an East German spymaster in some John Le Carre plot. In fact, Woolsey had 
had no first-hand experience with the world of spies until President Bill 
Clinton appointed him Director of Central Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Woolsey, 52, has spent much of his life involved in national security 
issues. A graduate of Stanford and Yale Law School (and, like Clinton, a Rhodes 
scholar), he began working for the Pentagon and the National Security Council 
after serving as an Army captain in 1970. In the two decades since, he has 
alternated between government and private law practice. During the Carter 
Administration, Woolsey served as under secretary of the Navy. Though a 
Democrat, he enjoyed unusually close ties with the Bush Administration, in part 
because of his friendship with Bush's national security adviser, Brent 
Scowcroft. From 1989 to 1991, Woolsey served as special ambassador to the 
conventional armed forces in Europe talks, and, in 1992, he headed a special 
task force on the use of satellites in intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 As DCI, Woolsey not only heads the Central Intelligence Agency, but oversees 
the entire U.S. intelligence community -- including the National Security 
Agency, which monitors overseas communications; the National Reconnaissance 
Organization, responsible for satellite imagery, and the Defense Intelligence 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Woolsey's task to help define the role of U.S. intelligence now that the 
Soviet Union has disintegrated and the CIA's old adversary, the KGB, has been 
disbanded. But during his first year, Woolsey avoided bold new initiatives. 
Instead, he focused much of his time and effort on Capitol Hill, fighting 
drastic cutbacks in the intelligence community's still-secret budget -- 
estimated at $28 billion. In these budget battles, Woolsey sometimes ignored 
and overcame resistance of congressional Democrats by successfully courting GOP 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has hammered away at one basic theme: Though the Cold War has ended, 
the need for the CIA remains strong. "Yes, we have slain a large dragon," he 
said at his confirmation hearings. "But we live now in a jungle filled with a 
bewildering variety of poisonous snakes." At least once or twice each week, 
Woolsey makes the early-morning trip to the White House to give Clinton his 
intelligence briefing -- an update on the snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is married to Suzanne Haley Woolsey, an executive for a nonprofit science 
organization. They have three teen-aged sons. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: Let me start by asking you about the post-Cold War CIA. What are its 
two or three principal missions?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think one is a complex of countries involved in both terrorism and 
proliferation -- of which I'd say North Korea and Iran are front and center; 
because the combined problems of proliferation of nuclear, chemical, 
bacteriological weapons, and ballistic missiles to carry them, and terrorist 
orientations create a very difficult set of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A second would be keeping close attention toward major countries which could 
be of concern to the United States if their politics and their economics turn 
negative: Russia, China, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 A third would be the whole field of trying to help the United States 
government ensure that American business gets to play on a level playing field 
abroad. We are not in the business of conducting industrial espionage -- with 
the CIA against foreign companies to try to give information to American 
companies. But we are in the business of understanding when other countries and 
foreign companies -- some of them countries quite friendly to the United States 
otherwise -- are engaged in bribery in order to take contracts away from 
American corporations. We spend a good deal of time and effort trying to help 
the secretary of state and the secretary of commerce be able to level that 
playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At your confirmation hearings and since, you've used a metaphor about the 
end of the Cold War: "The dragon is slain, but there are a lot of snakes out 
there." That raises the question of whether you need the same tools to fight 
the snakes as you did the Soviet dragon. Why do you need an intelligence 
community of the same size and budget and with the same structure?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not the same size and focus nor budget. The budget has come down 
substantially in real terms since the beginning of the decade. The number of 
satellites, for example, is being substantially reduced and their orientation 
changed. The way in which we do espionage is being reoriented to focus very 
hard on targets such as terrorists and weapons proliferators. There are a lot 
of changes going on. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of slimming down that's taking place. Civilians in the 
intelligence community will be reduced by between 20% and 25% from the 
beginning of the decade to the end, and the number of military will come down 
by a third. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You say the way we are doing espionage is changing. What do you mean by 
that? Do you still have human assets in these countries?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's very hard to say a great deal about that in public. It's just that 
when the United States and the Soviet Union were directing espionage against 
one another, it was a very important contest, but it was a contest that was 
played according to certain rules. If one or another case officer was arrested, 
they were normally traded, for example. They had diplomatic immunity because 
they were ostensibly officially from the embassies. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorists and weapons proliferators don't come to many embassy cocktail 
parties. One has to work very hard in a lot of very different ways. In some 
ways it's analogous to what the FBI does in penetrating the Mafia. We have to 
work in very complex and subtle ways overseas to get a handle on what weapons 
proliferators and terrorists and people from states such as Iraq, Iran, North 
Korea are doing. I can't really go beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you give me an example of the sort of work the CIA does in the field of 
economic intelligence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's awfully hard to be explicit in public, because what tends to happen is 
that we will learn that Company X or Country X is trying to bribe it's way, 
let's say, to a contract in the Mideast, and we will then make it possible for 
the secretary of state or secretary of commerce to go to his counterpart in 
that country, or to the ruler in that country, and say, "Your 
telecommunications minister is on the take, and the United States doesn't favor 
business being done this way." Quite frequently, this results in at least some 
part of the contract, or sometimes even all of it, being dealt with in a much 
fairer fashion for American corporations. We are doing that sort of thing all 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me ask about Haiti. There was an incident last fall in which the 
elected president of Haiti was characterized as mentally ill. And this was 
attributed to a CIA psychological profile. What happened, what went wrong 
there? And, if the agency wasn't at fault, then specifically who was?  
</P>
<P>
 A: About a year ago, just before this Administration came in, the intelligence 
community did, collectively, all parts of it, a very thorough estimate on 
Haiti. I'm not going to say anything one way or the other about what was in it 
or whether any part of it dealt with President Aristide. I'll simply say that I 
think, overall, it was a well-prepared estimate. And over the last year, it has 
been briefed -- both in the executive branch and on the Hill -- rather 
extensively. There's nothing odd about the intelligence community briefing on 
the Hill. On any given day when Congress is in session, someone in 
intelligence, some team or group, is at some meeting on the Hill four or five 
times a day. I was up myself, better than once a day when Congress was in 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 We work for the Congress, too. We have vigorous oversight committees, and we 
brief on virtually everything that we do. Unfortunately, during some briefings 
this fall on the Hill, some portions of things that were in this Haitian 
estimate were, by some individuals in either the executive or the legislative 
branch -- we're not sure exactly whom -- were taken out of context. Some things 
were distorted when they were reported publicly. There's really not more that 
we can say on that.  
</P>
<P>
 We've been told by the President to call them like we see them, and I've told 
the agency and the intelligence community to call them like they see them. We 
are not going to be in the business of trying to twist or distort our analysis 
to fit policy. The President doesn't want that, and neither do I. We do expect 
both the executive branch and legislative officials to maintain classified 
briefings as classified when we give them. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'd say only one further thing on this, not as an analyst or as head 
of the intelligence community but just as a human being. Haiti is a country 
wherein there has been and continues to be a lot of violence. I think if you 
and I had sitting here before us all of the work that we had done on Haiti and 
on the individuals who are involved, potentially, in governing Haiti, and you 
look at some of the possible strong men down there, and some of their behavior 
and conduct in the past, both you and I would agree that, as individuals, a 
national policy for the United States of supporting President Aristide -- who 
has been elected by two-thirds of the people of Haiti -- was a reasonable 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You said last year you wanted the agency to be more open, and yet you won't 
make public even the overall annual budget figures for the intelligence 
community. Why not? (Former CIA Director Robert M.) Gates, I think, at his 
confirmation hearing said he had no problem with that.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are a number of things I'm willing to be more open on and a couple 
I'm not. The things I'm willing to be more open on are history. We've taken the 
lead in declassifying the Kennedy files that we have inside the government; 
declassifying estimates about the Soviet Union up until the early '80s, and 
starting a somewhat detailed, but nonetheless thorough and eventually useful 
process of declassifying information about some of the covert actions back in 
the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 I have spent a lot of time on the Hill with individual members going over the 
budget. Over 150 meetings last year. Most of that going around one on one to 
congressmen and senators, going through our budget totals, our budget figures, 
our programs -- including a lot of members not on our oversight committees. 
I've had the "Today Show" out here. I've been on both Larry King and Diane Rehm 
call-in shows. I've given several public speeches about the future of 
intelligence. All of this is an effort to open up where we can. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are two things that I don't think can be done in public. One is to 
debate effectively the numbers and scope of the intelligence programs. The 
other is to give current assessments in any degree of detail of our substantive 
views. The reason is that we cannot build electronic or print fences around the 
United States. When I am talking publicly to Congress about our budget, I'm 
also talking to Saddam Hussein and Mr. Rafsanjani and Kim Jong Il and so on. We 
don't want to set out for them what we are emphasizing by way of funding for 
intelligence collection or analysis or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm opposed to starting down what I fear would be a slippery slope of 
making one budget totally public, and then having people say, "Well, can't you 
make an X% reduction?" Then I have to say, "Well, no, because that money is 
going for X." Then I have to explain what X is. 
</P>
<P>
 Each step I take in that direction reveals something more about the way we do 
business in collecting against targets such as the weapons proliferators. I 
don't think it's a sound approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are some critics who say the CIA has become too cautious -- that in 
places like Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, there have not been as many initiatives 
as there might be to either amplify or substitute for military action.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, we can only conduct covert action pursuant to a formal presidential 
finding that is transmitted in proper fashion, in a timely way, to Capitol 
Hill. This whole business of taking action politically or economically or with 
propaganda or with supporting some group with arms transfers such as the 
moujahedeen in Afghanistan -- that whole side of the agency, covert action, is 
way, way down compared to what it was back during the 1980s. There will not be 
any free-lancing during this Administration by anyone on that dimension. If the 
President signs a finding that instructs us to undertake some sort of covert 
action and it's properly transmitted to the Hill, then we'll do it. But over 
99% of the intelligence community effort these days is in the business of 
intelligence collection and analysis and not in the business of covert action.

FOUL FORECAST FOR A 4-DECADE-OLD FREEWAY PLAN; FOE OF INTERSTATE 710 EXTENSION 
WILL ASSUME KEY POST IN U.S. HIGHWAY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To paraphrase Bob Dylan, at times you don't need a weatherman to know which 
way the wind blows. This is one of those times for supporters and opponents of 
the final extension of the Long Beach Freeway, Interstate 710, through El 
Sereno and South Pasadena: The wind is blowing, very hard, against the 
long-delayed project. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction of the gale became clear last week when U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena confirmed that he will appoint Evelyn Fierro, a former 
mayor of South Pasadena and one of the most vociferous opponents of the 710 
Freeway extension, to a key post in the Federal Highway Administration. A 
public relations executive and long-time Democratic Party activist, Fierro will 
go to work later this month as a top assistant to the federal highway chief, 
who will decide whether the Clinton Administration provides the federal share 
of the estimated $1 billion it will cost to complete the final 6.2-mile leg of 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fierro claims she will approach the decision on the proposed Long Beach 
freeway extension with an open mind. "Personally, I don't want the freeway to 
go through, but I am a professional," she told one interviewer. Anyone who 
really buys that is probably also gullible enough to buy the whole 710 Freeway 
from Fierro. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, one of the leading opponents of the freeway extension 
will soon be able to delay for at least three more years a project that, even 
if construction began now, would not be finished until about the year 2010. And 
without substantial federal aid, it could well be impossible to complete this 
freeway, which now runs from the port of Long Beach to the Los Angeles-Alhambra 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed extension, which has been planned -- and bitterly opposed -- 
since 1949, would link Interstate 710 with Interstate 210, the Foothill 
Freeway, in a major interchange just west of downtown Pasadena. There have 
always been sound reasons for closing this major gap in the region's freeway 
network. In fact, The Times supported doing so many years ago, when it was 
argued that Interstate 710 would provide an alternative route to congested 
Interstate 5, near downtown Los Angeles, for trucks traveling between the 
Central Valley and the L.A.-Long Beach Harbor. But there have been enough 
changes over the last 40 years -- fiscally, environmentally and legally -- that 
it would probably be wise for the freeway extension's backers to use this 
latest political setback to consider some alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, Fierro and some other freeway opponents in the affected 
communities are not thoughtless obstructionists. They acknowledge the 
nightmarish traffic congestion in Alhambra caused by the 710 Freeway's 
termination on a busy surface street, and they have tried to devise solutions 
that they claim are both less costly and could be done much more quickly than 
the freeway extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some of the alternatives are, at least for now, as much products of 
wishful thinking as completion of the freeway is -- like the Alameda Corridor 
project to speed trains moving goods inland from the harbor, or completion of 
the Blue Line trolley to carry more commuters from Pasadena to downtown Los 
Angeles. But others, like a quarter-mile extension of the existing freeway to 
diffuse some of the traffic that currently backs up on Valley Boulevard, 
certainly seem both sensible and doable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the challenge to prove that these alternatives are viable now lies 
with the freeway's opponents, especially Fierro. She is now in a key position 
not only to halt a project she detests but to help relieve the very real 
problems caused by a freeway gap that should never have been left open so long. 
She and other 710 Freeway haters can prove their good faith by working hard to 
make their alternatives real.

SECULARISM AND CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your Dec. 24 "Spiritual Connection" editorial, you say, "Christmas 
is a secular holiday." Who decided that? I'm unaware of legislation in that 
regard. 
</P>
<P>
 You say, "Merry Christmas!" has yielded . . . to "Happy Holidays!" By whose 
count? I wish my Christian friends a "Merry Christmas!" and my Jewish friends 
"Happy Holidays!" You say, "The church campaign to put Christ back in Christmas 
is a faded memory." But how does one take Christ out of Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 You say, "Even the clergy send generic Christmas cards." Has Gallup taken a 
survey on that? My own Christmas card greeting reads, "May your Christmas be 
rich in the peace, love and joy that Christ gives." And that would include 
editorialists who may not be fully in touch with their subject matter.

 * I take exception to the description of Christmas as a secular holiday. 
Secular means not involving or belonging to a religion. Christmas, however, is 
a Christian festival commemorating Christ's birth. That many Christians have 
chosen to celebrate one of their holiest days by rampant commercialism and 
pagan symbols rather than purely Christian ones does not make it a 
non-religion-based holiday. It is clearly not the celebration of a President's 
birthday but rather the birth of the Christian godhead in human form. To refer 
to Christmas as secular is to presume the worst sort of Christian narcissism -- 
that the non-Gentiles, Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, atheists -- all see Christmas 
as secular too! Trust me, we don't. If it were truly secular, let us change its 
name and call it Winter Solstice or year-end break or even extend the 
celebration of the new year to a four-day weekend, like the secular holiday of 
Thanksgiving. If you want to create a genuine secular holiday, let us take the 
Christ out of Christmas.

SYBIL BRAND INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to respond to the letter regarding the release of female 
prisoners from the Sybil Brand Institute for Women (Dec. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil Brand Institute does care about the women in its custody; and this 
concern continues when those women are released from confinement, whether it is 
pursuant to a court order or at the completion of their sentence.Those inmates 
who are released by order of the court are released in the afternoon or 
evening, and always before midnight. Those who are released at the completion 
of their sentence are released each morning after breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Our release policy takes into consideration that the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority has a bus stop directly in front of the facility, 
which runs daily from 5 a.m. to midnight. Sybil Brand Institute provides free 
bus tokens to any inmate upon request. Taxi service is available 24 hours each 
day, and telephones are located in the release area and front-gate area of the 
institute. The gate is manned 24 hours each day by deputy personnel, who will 
assist released inmates as needed. As an additional measure of security, no 
inmates are released between midnight and 6 a.m., unless they have someone to 
pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 For those inmates who have an impending release, and are in need of 
assistance, we have support groups such as Friends Outside, Mary Magdalene 
Project and the multidenominational chaplain's office, which assist in 
providing transportation or locating overnight housing.

INFORMATION HIGHWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 * A cynic once observed that leadership is the art of finding a parade and 
running in front of it. Vice President Al Gore's speech on the "information 
superhighway" (Dec. 22) shows all of the huffing and puffing of this style of 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The information highway is coming to your house, but unlike the interstate 
highway system, it needs no government subsidies. Satellites are being 
launched, cellular networks are being built, and software is being developed, 
all financed by the capital sources of private enterprise -- a large percentage 
of which are the funds for our own pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 I laughed heartily at the part where Al Gore said that "regulations are needed 
to ensure access for all." The whole point of regulation is to keep prices high 
by restricting competition and especially technology change, which is the only 
way to achieve dramatically lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Why subsidize an industry to produce electric cars that can go only 50 miles 
per hour, when we already have a pollution-free "electric car" that can go 
180,000 miles per second -- our home computer/television attached to a 
high-speed electronic network. Furthermore, this superhighway has worldwide 
access, without paying gasoline taxes, license fees, insurance, speeding 
tickets, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Gore and bureaucrats everywhere are caught like scared animals in the 
headlights of this revolution, because they cannot figure out how to control 
it.

 The Times is to be commended for its editorial "There Is Room at the Inn,

year. 
</P>
<P>
 As you mention, "That is not enough to rent a room, unless the recipient is 
lucky enough to get one of the few (hotel rooms) subsidized by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency." Luckily we just reopened the La Jolla Hotel, which was 
rehabilitated with agency funds. We now have 49 newly renovated rooms for rent 
to general relief clients for $180 per month.

RELIGION AND SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' editorial "Participate, Yes; Proselytize, No" (Dec. 21) 
unintentionally reveals where the real proselytizing has been taking place. The 
article condemned the Vista school board's decision to require the teaching of 
creation theory as a violation of the 1947 Supreme Court decision which forbade 
"practices that . . . endorse or prefer religion over no religion." 
</P>
<P>
 But what we quite obviously have now in our public schools is a reverse 
situation where no religion is preferred over religion. Currently, state 
science curricula permit only the teaching of atheistic evolutionary theory in 
the study of origins, despite a rapidly accumulating body of scientific 
evidence supporting a theistic interpretation. Is this not proselytizing on 
behalf of no religion? If endorsing religion over no religion is wrong, can 
endorsing no religion over religion be right? Of what value is censoring a 
widely held perspective simply because it has religious roots? Where scientific 
facts are concerned, shouldn't both hypotheses be allowed to compete together 
in the educational marketplace, especially since they both have such large 
followings? How could it hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 In requiring that the science of creation theory be taught alongside that of 
evolutionary theory, the Vista school board was not seeking to proselytize its 
students but only to even the playing field.

 * I agreed with the basic thrust of your editorial. But there was one sentence 
that was so egregiously incongruous that I didn't know what to make of it. It 
said, "The United States, especially in its public schools, does not 
discriminate against those who do not believe in God." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that this sentence is inconsistent with the context, my first 
guess is that the word "not" was inadvertently added as a misprint. Or that the 
entire editorial was written by a religious person who wishes to support the 
continued discrimination against atheists by denying their existence. Suffice 
it to say that when President Bush stated, repeatedly, that he didn't think 
atheists should be considered patriots or citizens, because "this is one nation 
under God," there wasn't a ripple in the mass media. Whereas, if he had said 
the same thing about any other minority, there would have been nationwide 
headlines screaming for his impeachment.

 You imply that including creationism, "a religious doctrine," into the 
curriculum is an attempt to proselytize -- to change the beliefs of the 
children. Can any educational system avoid proselytizing in one way or another? 
</P>
<P>
 The articles written by Douglas Frantz and Elizabeth Shogren (Dec. 10 and 11) 
included an incident that led to controversy in the Meridian, Idaho, school 
district. "Battle lines solidified in the fall of 1992 after two lesbians spoke 
about their lifestyle to three high school classes." Do you believe that these 
two people were not there to influence or possibly change the beliefs of 
children?

THE TREASURE OF SEWAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles may not have enough cash to fill the growing number of 
potholes in city streets or to add many new police officers to our understaffed 
force, but the city is nonetheless rich in . . . sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps recalling the old adage about making lemonade when life deals 
lemons, the Public Works Department is about to go commercial with its own form 
of lemonade: garden fertilizer made entirely from sewage processed at the 
Hyperion water treatment plant in Playa del Rey and garden clippings collected 
by city trash trucks.This "100% city product" has been used successfully for 
the last several years to augment the heavy clay soil in city-owned gardens. 
The compost meets strict federal standards and can be used on almost any type 
of vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 The fertilizer, to be sold under the name Topgro, is unlikely to generate big 
money for city coffers. Indeed, Topgro sales are expected to only slightly 
reduce the city's costs in disposing of sludge from processed sewage. But 
commercial sale of the product in gardening shops and home improvement stores, 
to begin in the next couple of months, bespeaks a welcome new environmental 
consciousness and entrepreneurial spirit among city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 As landfill space grows tighter and disposal costs rise, public interest in 
composting and recycling has increased. The challenge for cities like Los 
Angeles is to make use of the materials generated by collection and recycling 
programs. Topgro could be a win-win for the city.

CREATIVITY IN THE WAR ON CRIME; GIFTS-FOR-GUNS EXCHANGE COLLECTS MORE THAN 700 
FIREARMS IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A successful gifts-for-guns swap that has attracted more than 700 firearms in 
a violent, drug-ridden area of New York City should be expanded to other 
cities. Every gun that's off our streets makes America a tiny bit safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, which donated $5,000 
to the New York effort, plans to expand the program beyond New York, through 
its extensive system of branches, by working with authorities in the 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ben Chavis, executive director of the NAACP, and Fernando Mateo, 
founder of the New York effort, will begin with a visit to Los Angeles this 
week. Chavis said last Tuesday that the civil rights organization will ask 
businesses to support this campaign. NAACP leaders now view freedom from 
violence as a civil right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, violence is pervasive in most cities. Americans own -- legally and 
illegally -- more than 200 million firearms of various kinds. No gifts-for-guns 
exchange will rid the United States of all firearms, but good riddance to every 
one that such offers attract. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful New York program was set up recently by Mateo, a civic-minded 
young businessman. He decided to do something after his 14-year-old son 
indicated he would willingly trade his Christmas presents to get guns off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mateo quickly got help from businesses, including the major retailer Toys R 
Us, and from police officers and concerned citizens who donated more than 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal in New York: Anyone who turned in a gun by the end of Christmas Day 
would get a certificate for toys. The offer later included gasoline, athletic 
shoes and other goods. Teen-agers, parents and grandparents responded, taking 
to a local police station weapons that included machine guns, hunting rifles 
and semiautomatic pistols.  
</P>
<P>
 Police officers wisely asked no questions, and they were pleasantly surprised 
by the turnout. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, "Clearly this program 
has national implications." He also said, "What we can't measure are the lives 
that have been saved . . . the crippling injuries that were not sustained." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the initial toys-for-guns appeal prompted further generosity. 
Foot Locker, a chain of athletic shoe stores, donated gift certificates worth 
$25,000. The New York exchange program is expected to continue through Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Ticketmaster has given away hundreds of tickets to concerts 
and sports events in exchange for firearms. Elsewhere, police have used 
buy-back programs to collect weapons; as part of the deal, officials make no 
attempt to trace the guns to any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing gun violence will take such creative exchanges and buy-backs, but it 
will also take much tougher laws -- laws that all but eliminate the private 
possession of handguns and assault weapons.

DOCTORS DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW BEST; CESAREANS: TOO MANY WOMEN ARE BEING FORCED TO 
GIVE BIRTH SURGICALLY WITHOUT CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI B. ANDREWS, Lori B. Andrews is a visiting professor of law at 
Chicago-Kent College of Law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Wednesday night, a healthy baby boy came into the world through natural 
childbirth at Prentice Women's Hospital in Chicago. The only thing remarkable 
about his birth was the controversy that preceded it. Two weeks earlier, the 
mother's doctor had sworn in court that the baby would not survive labor and 
delivery if the mother did not undergo a Cesarean section. The public guardian 
said the baby was "imprisoned in the womb" by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother refused the surgery on religious grounds, and the Illinois courts 
upheld her rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was not unique. In a Georgia case, a doctor claimed that there was a 
99% chance the baby would die and a 50% chance that the mother would die if she 
did not undergo a Cesarean section. The courts ordered the surgery, but the 
woman escaped the hospital and gave birth naturally, again to a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
 These cases, and many others with similar results, underscore that doctors do 
not know best. Yet some courts have been willing to order Cesarean section on 
women based on a single doctor's testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 A physician I met at a conference said he had gone to court 50 times to get 
Cesarean section orders against his unwilling patients. Judges had ordered 
involuntary surgeries in 49 of those cases. Who knows how many of his patients 
and the patients of other doctors would have had healthy babies if they had 
been allowed to deliver those children naturally as they wished? In some 
instances, the women were tied down to the hospital bed with leather bindings, 
screaming, while they were cut open against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 For every woman whose case has gone to court, there are probably dozens of 
others who have been forced into Cesarean sections because their doctors have 
threatened them with legal action and they have not had the resources to 
challenge the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of court orders against unwilling pregnant women found that the 
procedure also is often discriminatory: 81% of the women were black, according 
to the report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 The doctors in the Illinois case were wrong legally. They were wrong 
medically. They made the last weeks of a woman's pregnancy, which should have 
been one of the happiest, most fulfilling and intimate times of her life, into 
a living hell. And yet they are getting away scot-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is time to hold the doctors responsible for wasting money and 
terrorizing pregnant women by invoking the massive power of the state.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE HOLOCAUST; WHEN WILL JEWS LET IT REST?; 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' 
SANCTIFIES AN AMORAL WAR PROFITEER; THIS IS THE LAST STRAW IN THE OBSESSION 
WITH VICTIMIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELI HECHT, Rabbi Eli Hecht is past president of the Rabbinical Council of 
California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the life of me I can't understand what possessed Steven Spielberg to make 
"Schindler's List," to glorify a latter-day Robin Hood who profited at the 
expense of Polish Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, this is Oskar Schindler, as depicted in the film, which, being shot 
almost completely in black and white, conveys the impression of a documentary: 
Schindler, a failed German businessman, goes to Krakow in 1939 to make his 
fortune as a supplier of the German army. He takes over a factory that the 
Nazis have appropriated from the Jewish owners. He persuades Krakow Jews, whose 
bank accounts are being frozen, to provide him with the capital he needs to 
start the manufacture of cookware; since they can't own money, he pays them 
back in pots and pans. He hires Jews because they are cheaper than Poles. He 
ingratiates himself with the most vile of the Nazi Establishment to keep his 
contracts -- and his obscene profits -- growing. 
</P>
<P>
 In his personal life, too, Oskar Schindler is less than heroic, to put it 
mildly. He indulges in every excess of vanity and sensuality. With a wife back 
home, he keeps a mistress in Krakow while maintaining a years-long affair with 
his secretary. He lives like a prince (in a home expropriated from Jews), wears 
the finest silk suits and jewelry, drives -- or is chauffeured -- in the most 
luxurious cars. 
</P>
<P>
 All that he has is afforded by the round-the-clock labor of Jews, his virtual 
slaves. I would call it "Swindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 As the movie evolves, Schindler decides to help "his" Jews for one of two 
reasons: because man also has a soul and he will have to give an accounting to 
G-d after death; or that he play G-d by saving his worker-victims from the Nazi 
ovens and make even more profit. We really never know. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end -- and this I find incredible, almost blasphemous -- Jews anoint 
him a tzadek, a righteous person of great rarity, sending the message: No 
matter how evil man is, he can change. I don't think so. Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a fifth-generation American growing up in the Williamsburg section of 
Brooklyn in the 1950s. With survivors of the Holocaust all around, it was like 
living in the Twilight Zone. The butcher had a tattoo number from the Nazi 
camps, as did the baker and the teacher. Almost everyone had a number. I 
thought that when you came from Europe you received a number on your hand 
together with your passport. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember visiting a family and being told by the woman, "How lucky you 
are, yingela, sonny-boy, that you have a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, 
uncles, aunts and even grandparents. The only thing I have left from Germany is 
this!" She shoved her hand with the blue tattoo in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
 My teacher, a survivor of the camps, often would start to cry, thinking of the 
suffering he and his family had experienced. Many of my classmates were from 
second marriages, with half-brothers and -sisters 10 or 15 years older. Either 
their father's or mother's first spouse had been killed and the survivor had 
remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost every household I visited, the fear of death and persecution 
persisted. There was hardly a holiday or happy occasion that didn't end in a 
funeral speech for the family members who weren't there. At parties for newborn 
babies or Bar Mitzvahs, there was always talk about a dead or martyred relative 
for whom the child was named. 
</P>
<P>
 At times I felt like a victim myself for having been born free, healthy and 
safe in rich America. Survivors of the Holocaust would point to me and say, 
"Look at this American! How old are you?" I would state my age. "Yes, that's 
how old my son would be, but he was killed in the camp." Others would ask, "How 
many brothers or sisters do you have?" After I answered, they would say, "Lucky 
you! Mine were killed before their Bar Mitzvah age." I became very sensitive to 
their cries of misery and untold misfortune.  
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, I am wondering why Jews in Hollywood are singing the 
praises of "Schindler's List" and its sanctifying of Oskar Schindler. He should 
be shown for what he was, a war profiteer, an opportunist, a carpetbagger of 
the worst kind, and not a "righteous Gentile." Why did he make an effort to 
save Jews near the end of the war? Was it because he knew that Germany was 
losing and wanted to have some Jews on his side? Was it because he wanted to 
outsmart the Germans, or establish himself as a more superior Aryan than the 
other Germans? What moral awaking occurred in this man driven to play G-d? I 
really don't care to know. He went to his grave with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that for many Jews this film is a sacred cow and nothing bad 
should be said about it, just as the museums of the Holocaust are considered 
beyond criticism. However, truly speaking, for young Jewish Americans, these 
films and museums add nothing but fear. The message is that the world is never 
a safe place for Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Jewish history there have been untold catastrophes. Beginning with 
the enslavement in Egypt, millions of Jewish brothers and sisters were 
sacrificed; millions more were dispersed; all that they put into building new 
lives in the diaspora was lost, again and again. Yet there never was a need for 
museums.  
</P>
<P>
 I am sick and tired of this generation identifying Judaism with suffering. Why 
is it imperative for our children and young people to visit Holocaust museums? 
Why do they need to hear lectures about skinheads and neo-Nazis and growing 
anti-Semitism? Why should they see every film about the Holocaust, always 
portraying Jews as victims running for their lives?  
</P>
<P>
 I know what I am talking about. I may not make movies, but I run a school for 
children. What we should be doing is teaching the richness and everlasting 
greatness of our noble religion and not the negative experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 It is preposterous to think that an American filmmaker can help preserve 
Judaism by showing a most horrific and pitiful scene of naked Jewish women 
huddled in the gas chamber. This doesn't make better Jews, just better-selling 
movies. If for a moment you think that there is a moral lesson to be learned 
from "Schindler's List," tell it to E.T. 
</P>
<P>
 These movies, museums and displays only cause more pain. There is no 
enlightenment to be gained from seeing Jews as victims over and over again. If 
anything, it gives Jewish young adults further reason to think they should 
assimilate. "Why be Jewish?" they ask after viewing such material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" is expected to make millions for its producers. If only 
this money were channeled into building Jewish schools and rehabilitating the 
children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims, then it would make some sense. 
</P>
<P>
 What is sincerely needed is a commitment to end all negative portrayals of 
Jews. What is needed is for Jews, first of all, to say to Steven Spielberg and 
anyone else tempted to present Jews as victims and call it entertainment: 
Dayeno! Enough!

COLUMN LEFT / HARRY BERNSTEIN; IT'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN PROFIT AND GREED; 
ANTI-LABOR LAWS, HARD-NOSED EMPLOYERS AND A PRESIDENT LUKEWARM TO LABOR 
CONSPIRES AGAINST WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to know where and how corporate executives draw the line between 
their legitimate quest for profits and ugly greed when they are fighting unions 
or slashing the size of their work force. 
</P>
<P>
 But either way, workers almost always get trashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, organized workers can win if they fight long and hard enough, as 
members of the United Mine Workers of America showed recently when they were 
victorious after a grueling seven-month strike during which not one of the 
17,000 miners crossed the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of seldom-seen labor unity and militancy can pay off, although it 
costs workers their paychecks while their bosses' regular incomes continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strikes are hard to win because of our anti-labor laws, hard-nosed 
employers and a President who isn't against unions, as former Presidents Reagan 
and Bush were -- but Clinton is no close friend of labor, either. 
</P>
<P>
 So, wins like that of the miners are all the sweeter, especially when they win 
a decent contract agreement as the miners did, giving them, among other things, 
a guarantee of 60% of the jobs created when a coal operator opens a new mine. 
Usually such mines are run non-union. 
</P>
<P>
 Even such agreements don't automatically mean the end of the workers' 
troubles. The miners' union still faces devastating, hard-to-justify civil 
contempt fines of more than $60 million -- among the highest ever -- in a case 
stemming from a 1989 strike against the Pittston Coal Co. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the Clinton Administration, a Virginia court is pressing hard 
to collect the fines even though the UMW and the company had agreed to a new 
contract and to drop all charges and countercharges. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court, though, refused to accept the settlement. Some Clinton 
officials wanted the Administration to at least stay out of that case, as it 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it went to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it is pending, Clinton's 
appointee, Solicitor General Drew Days III, joined the fight against the union 
anyway. It was Days' call, legally, but Clinton made no public objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Militant labor unity has paid off without subsequent legal fights in other 
cases, though, such as the strikes of flight attendants against American 
Airlines, the machinists against Boeing and telephone workers against NYNEX. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputes like those might well have been avoided entirely or been shorter if 
our labor laws were more even-handed and the President more concerned about the 
plight of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions showed great political strength when they almost won the fight against 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, battling against great odds, including 
the President. And while they still support Clinton as a sharp contrast to 
Reagan and Bush, they cannot expect much help from him in many of their other 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most workers are non-union, and they are usually doing even worse than those 
who belong to unions. In just the past three months, major American 
corporations announced plans to lay off more than 90,000 workers, even though 
productivity is still rising. That means the firms can produce more with fewer 
workers and executives don't seem to give a second thought to the plight of 
those they drop from the payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest large layoff announcement came, surprisingly, from Xerox Corp. that 
has -- or maybe had -- an excellent relationship with its major union, the 
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. Xerox says that it will dump 10,000 
workers even though the company is highly profitable. Among those who will be 
laid off are people who helped the company earn more than $600 million last 
year. By slashing its work force by 10%, the company executives and 
stockholders expect to make even more profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the thousands of dismissed workers will ultimately find new jobs 
elsewhere, but often lower-wage ones or in part-time or temporary positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-union workers, though, have no protection against corporate decisions 
that can wreck their lives. Xerox will at least discuss the layoffs with 
Amalgamated to try to ease the impact, although the company apparently hasn't 
convinced the union that the layoffs were caused only by a "normal" hunger for 
profits at the expense of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 We won't start creating a just society until we require employers to give at 
least the same consideration to the needs of workers that they do to profits. 
Corporate executives must pay as much attention to the length of unemployment 
lines as they do to the bottom lines.

WHEN PERCEPTION IS REALITY: BLURRING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS; CITY: MAYOR 
RIORDAN IS RIGHT TO BRING IN NEW VOICES TO ADVISE HIS ADMINISTRATION. BUT EVEN 
THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST MUST BE AVOIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden, a visiting scholar at the Center for Politics 
and Economics at the Claremont Colleges, is the author of Surviving Power (Free 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Riordan was elected mayor of Los Angeles to put the city back on its 
economic feet. Toward that end, he is appointing business people to positions 
of authority, adopt ing businesslike approaches to mu nicipal finance and 
considering privatizing many city services. Along the way, he has blurred the 
line separating the public and private sectors -- raising questions of ethical 
propriety and of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem of bringing these two worlds together is now being 
explored in discussions between the mayor's office and the Los Angeles Ethics 
Commission over the legal status of volunteers and of privately raised money in 
the mayor's quest to reorganize city government. The task forces are being put 
together by William Ouchi, a UCLA management expert and Riordan adviser. His 
salary, as well as those of other members of his staff, are paid through 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the vehicle for citizen input in L.A. city government is through 
service on commissions. Commission members, by law, must disclose how their 
private interests relate to their commission work. The procedure allows us to 
recognize potential conflicts of interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan task forces will issue public reports and recommendations. Like 
the Christopher Commission and the Cowan Commission, their members are 
appointed by the mayor and their costs paid for privately. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is an important difference between Riordan's task forces and the 
commissions. The study of policing methods and of ethics to guide political 
behavior -- the missions of the Christopher and Cowan commissions, respectively 
-- did not, presumptively, hold out the possibility of economic rewards.  
</P>
<P>
 But task-force members who end up urging the sale of Los Angeles Airport, for 
example, may benefit financially. Sweetheart deals between the business world 
and City Hall are not unknown in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, an infusion of new ideas on how to run the city is needed. But the 
boundaries of volunteerism in government must be defined to embrace the 
standard that even a question of a conflict of interest risks credibility -- a 
more important priority in government than efficiency will ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration faces an added burden because the mayor comes out 
of the private sector and defeated a candidate who stood for inclusion. While 
it is natural for Riordan to turn to his business associates and the 
constituents who elected him, there is also an expectation, because of the 
office he holds, that he needs to involve others. Communities that did not 
support him legitimately ask whether he will be their mayor as well.  
</P>
<P>
 The more enduring question involves the relationship between the public and 
private sectors. There is a strong tradition that business is more efficient -- 
and government would be better served if it behaved more like business. The 
other tradition believes the function of government is to ensure the fair 
distribution of goods and services, and that unfairness -- or the appearance of 
unfairness -- threatens the integrity, indeed, the legitimacy of government. 
Normally, we don't face up to the fact of how antithetical these traditions 
are. Yet, Riordan would meld the two, arguing that much is gained in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be true. But fairness means giving everyone the same chance by 
setting up rules, and that inevitably leads to bureaucratization -- because 
rules reflect general needs, and almost everyone has an individual problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is overrun by rules and decision-making authorities. Government 
needs to be simplified -- but not at the expense of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a more efficient government, especially in this time of economic 
stress. But the Riordan Administration, so far, seems insensitive to the 
differences between the public and private sectors.  
</P>
<P>
 They may well fear that disclosure will have a "chilling effect on the 
willingness or ability of persons to come forward and offer help," as one top 
official put it. But even he went on to say, "Perception is more important than 
reality in this business." Running city government, without acknowledging the 
importance of credibility, risks running it into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you bring outside views -- both from the top and the bottom of the 
economic ladder -- into government? How do you reach out to community leaders 
in business, or even at the community level, without jeopardizing the sense 
that those not asked for input could give it, if they chose? There is a 
difference between expressing an interest and having a conflict of interest. 
Let's hope that the discussions going on between the Ethics Commission and the 
mayor's office will draw that line clearly and find some way of 
institutionalizing vehicles for participation that are fair and credible.

BILL BOYARSKY: SOME REASONS FOR HOPE AND GOOD CHEER IN THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL BOYARSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend asked me to write something cheerful for New Year's. He said my 
columns have been depressing him lately. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't say I blame him. I tend to take a bleak view of life, possibly because 
I started in the newspaper business on the Oakland Tribune. We used to put out 
six or seven editions a day, half of them with big screamer headlines dedicated 
to the proposition that bad news sells newspapers. It's hard to escape your 
early training. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, I made a special effort to sort through what's coming up this year to 
see if I could find something diverting, amusing or at least with the potential 
for a happy outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Power politics -- Many of you might not find the politics of transportation 
diverting. But it will be followed closely in 1994 by those of us who are 
amused by ruthless and bloody political combat. The action is expected at the 
Pentagon of Los Angeles government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
a free-spending, pork-barreling monster fed by a steady flow of revenue from 
the sales tax and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, which runs buses and trains and builds the subway, is led by a board 
composed of a variety of Los Angeles County elected officials. The real boss is 
the chairman, the Eastside's wily Richard Alatorre, a powerful member of the 
Los Angeles City Council. While others relax, Alatorre plots. Thus he's been 
able to install loyalists in key jobs that influence all the major aspects of 
the huge agency, which awards many millions of dollars in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But a threat to Alatorre lurks in the West in the form of his rival, the 
equally powerful City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the Westside 
and part of the San Fernando Valley. Yaroslavsky is favored to be elected to 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this year, a post that would 
automatically make him a member of the MTA board. Like Alatorre, he plays the 
political game with cunning, subtlety and pure power, and their rivalry on the 
transportation board promises to be of championship class. Most interesting of 
all is the probable referee, a friend of both Yaroslavsky and Alatorre. That's 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, also a member of the MTA board. It's going 
to take a lot of cunning of his own for Riordan to avoid offending either of 
the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Red tape -- Here's good news for anyone who has ever tried to get a 
construction permit at L.A. City Hall, an experience that is even worse than 
going to the DMV or the post office. Riordan has started an attack on the red 
tape and bureaucratic foul-ups that result in delays of weeks, even months, in 
the permit process. Recently, he called a meeting of city planners and berated 
them for taking too long in preparing environmental impact reports for 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was an opening shot in what will be one of the hottest and most 
interesting battles in City Hall this year. In addition to trying to cut red 
tape, Riordan intends to pare down the large number of city-sponsored social 
welfare and economic development programs, which are run under contract by 
hundreds of nonprofit agencies, many of them backed by influential City Council 
members. The aim is to reduce a budget deficit estimated at $200 million. As 
Bill McCarley, Riordan's chief of staff, said last year, "Not withstanding a 
budgetary commitment of nearly $550 million, 718 authorized positions and . . . 
more than 300 contracts," the city's economic development program is 
inadequate. McCarley wrote that report before he joined the Riordan team, when 
he was legislative analyst. Now he's in a position to act on it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor had better act carefully. Many of the nonprofit agencies provide 
badly needed services. Among them are home rehabilitation, after-school care, 
and anti-drug, anti-gang and recreation programs for teen-agers in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
 New faces -- On the theory that most any change may be good, look at the Los 
Angeles County Hall of Administration and L.A. City Hall. Four new City Council 
members and a new mayor have been in office for half a year, and it's time for 
them to produce. The same is true at the Hall of Administration, where Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, elected last year, is the recently chosen chairwoman of the 
board. And the new county administrative officer, Sally Reed, has been on the 
job long enough to start delivering her promised efficiencies. The county will 
be short of money again in 1994. Let's hope the supes don't do anything as 
stupid as last year, when they tried to have the Legislature wipe out L.A.'s 
anti-smoking ordinance in exchange for a bigger share of the tobacco tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are other hopeful prospects. Phase 1 of Riordan's plan to put more cops 
on the street sailed through the Los Angeles City Council, indicating that 
chances may be good for the remainder of the program. The Southland and the 
rest of California are high on President Clinton's agenda. He needs to carry 
the state for reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, at year's end, L.A. County's congressional delegation and 
politicians from several cities and the county government put aside narrow 
differences and began working together on regional job-creating schemes. If the 
economy revives, their efforts may speed the recovery and help end the 
recession that is at the heart of most of our troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the best news of all.

CAN YOU TELL WHO'S OLDER?; NEW YEAR'S DAY: FIRST BABY OF 1994 DEBUTS ONE SECOND 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. 'THEY PLANNED THAT ONE,' NURSE AT A RIVAL HOSPITAL SAYS WITH A 
LAUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As New Year's Day dawned in the Southland, teams were assembled for a fabled 
contest. No, not the Rose Bowl, but the spirited competition among area 
hospitals to claim the honor of delivering the first baby of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner, it would seem, is Suburban Medical Center in Paramount, which 
delivered a healthy 7-pound, 4-ounce boy named Antonio Miajarez one second 
after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Margarita Castaneda, 23, was in good condition after the timely 
birth. Doctors and nurses in the hospital's maternity ward, however, were 
reported to be in a state of high excitement, what with the gaggle of media 
attention focused on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I wasn't called for the delivery until about 11:15 p.m. and I 
really didn't think we were going to have the New Year's baby," said Dr. Jose 
De La Rosa, the on-call obstetrician. "Then we started to realize we were 
getting closer and closer. I have delivered thousands of babies but this was 
the first one that was on the dot." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost on the dot. In any case, no other hospital appears to have come 
close. Suburban Medical nurses reported receiving an excited call a little past 
midnight from staff at their sister hospital, Long Beach Memorial, claiming a 
birth at half a second past midnight. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Memorial's first baby, a girl, didn't appear until 4:56 a.m., a 
nursing supervisor there conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center trumpeted the arrival of 7-pound, 
6-ounce Maiya Paola Martinez, born at 2:01 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, Marbella Sanchez Martinez, and baby were said to be doing fine. 
Hospital officials did not let the earlier birth at Suburban Memorial dampen 
Maiya's debut. They sent out press releases and invited photographers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 A nursing supervisor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which delivered a healthy 
6-pound, 4-ounce girl at 4:01 a.m., suggested, good-naturedly, that perhaps a 
birth at a second past midnight was not entirely nature's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They planned that one," said the nurse, laughing. "When you're that close 
it's, 'Don't push! Don't push!' " 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Rosa pleaded innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I didn't plan it. You can't really predict these things, you know," he 
said. "It was pretty exciting but I don't think I'm winning any prizes, right?"

RAND SEEKS TO BE THE THOUGHTFUL THINK TANK; RESEARCH: COMPANY TRIES TO POLISH 
ITS IMAGE. A LONG-STALLED EXPANSION PLAN MAY HINGE ON THE EFFORT'S SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When she was offered a job at the RAND Corp., economist Julia Lowell made one 
thing clear: "No bombs or bullets" research for her. 
</P>
<P>
 In associating the international think tank with military hardware, Lowell had 
fallen prey to a common stereotype, one she soon found was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My perception of what RAND does, even in security areas, was incorrect," said 
Lowell, 32, whose research concerns international monetary policy. "They study 
really important national security things . . . like arms control." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there are no bombs in the RAND Corp. basement, as some folks 
still believe. Nor is the place swarming with mad scientists hellbent on 
blowing the world to smithereens. Although the Defense Department is still its 
biggest client, the Santa Monica-based think tank is as likely to be studying 
child care in the military as plotting missile sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, RAND has begun trying to improve its public image, which was 
tinged by the company's involvement in landmark Cold War defense decisions and 
as a site for protests against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort is particularly important now: RAND needs the goodwill of the 
Santa Monica community to implement long-stalled plans to expand its 
headquarters, located between City Hall and the beach. The project would allow 
the think tank to put all its workers under one roof and add more conference 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the expansion and create an endowment that would make it less 
dependent on government and foundation funding, RAND is also seeking to develop 
its nearly block-long stretch of investment property on Ocean Avenue, just 
south of its offices. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of study, the expansion was approved unanimously by the 
Santa Monica City Council in November as part of an overall plan to revamp the 
Civic Center area. But a referendum on the proposal appears to have gathered 
enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, so voters will probably get the 
final say. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves RAND in the position of selling itself to a city that has been its 
home for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The groundwork for the sales pitch is already in place. After decades of 
aloofness in the face of criticism of its defense work, RAND has been busy 
mending fences with residents of one of the nation's most liberal cities. The 
think tank has scored points by doing good works ranging from leading a holiday 
charity drive to giving the city technical advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception, however, has not been uniformly warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the end of the Cold War, opposition to the headquarters expansion 
project is tinged with anti-RAND sentiment. Some Santa Monicans, including 
Democratic state Sen. Tom Hayden, are not willing to let bygones be bygones. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, it seems, RAND is forever epitomized by a thinly disguised reference 
to the think tank in the 1964 black comedy film "Dr. Strangelove," in which the 
BLAND Corp. coldly performs a cost-benefit analysis for a "doomsday device." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't get away from the vision of Dr. Strangelove," RAND computer 
scientist David McArthur said. "I love the movie, but it's not RAND." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is RAND then? It's somewhat akin to a university without students, 
populated by highly educated, intellectually curious sorts who become so 
engrossed in their work that the company pays them a bonus for using their 
vacation days. Called researchers or policy analysts, they grapple with the 
problems of today and look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the think tank was involved in one of the country's hottest issues 
-- gays in the military. Plucking staff analysts from several departments to 
study the matter from all angles, RAND concluded that sexual orientation is not 
germane to military service, advice the Pentagon and President Clinton did not 
heed. (Instead, the Pentagon and the President agreed to a compromise that 
continues to place restrictions on gay soldiers.) 
</P>
<P>
 RAND's health care experts, meanwhile, quietly advised Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's task force this year on health care reform. And other researchers 
made headlines with a controversial, explicitly worded sex survey of Santa 
Monica High School students. 
</P>
<P>
 On the aerospace front, a study released in December recommended against 
building more Milstar communications satellites, at a cost of $1 billion 
apiece, to help wage nuclear war. No need, RAND said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security is evident at the think tank's offices. Visitors must present 
identification and are not allowed to stroll the corridors without an escort. 
</P>
<P>
 In one building, nondescript offices flank long, dark hallways that appear 
uninviting, but were designed by a mathematician to maximize encounters between 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of intellectual work we do here is stimulated by casual interaction," 
said Iao Katagiri, the think tank's community relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress tends more toward Levi's than tweeds or pearls. And on a recent workday 
there was nary a pocket protector in sight, although RAND President James A. 
Thomson admitted a careful search of the premises would surely find a few. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they study Japanese currency, transportation systems or gender bias in 
the courts, all of the dozen RAND employees interviewed for this story gave 
similar descriptions of their workplace. It is, they say, a casual, 
non-hierarchical, even nurturing place that honors creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they prefer RAND to academia because of the think tank's 
trademark interdisciplinary approach and their preference for working to 
resolve real-life problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interchange of ideas . . . is much more intellectually exciting and 
challenging than research done in academic institutions," said Elizabeth A. 
McGlynn, a health policy analyst with "Sylvia" cartoons taped to her door. 
</P>
<P>
 Who pays for all this thinking? Essentially, we do. Currently, 65% of RAND 
research is defense-related and paid for by the government, which funds some 
domestic research as well. RAND is in the middle of a five-year plan to 
equalize the ratio of defense to civilian work, "domesticating" some of its 
defense specialists and offering early retirement to others. 
</P>
<P>
 This is essentially a best-of-times, worst-of-times period for think tanks. 
The post-Cold War era offers lots of new problems to analyze, but there is less 
public funding available to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, RAND is trying to broaden its funding base, going beyond 
government and foundation grants to reach out to private industry and 
individual donors, without sacrificing its independence. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND -- an acronym for research and development -- evolved from Project RAND, 
a research group formed at the close of World War II. The idea was to continue 
the relationship between scientists and the military that bloomed during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND incorporated in 1948 and bought the land for its offices from the city in 
1952 for $250,000. RAND acquired most of the property on its block as it became 
available, boarding up the dilapidated buildings in anticipation of turning 
them into a mix of office space and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although RAND officials say they cannot put a price tag on the think tank's 15 
acres of seaside property because the property's zoning status is in limbo, 
estimates of its worth have varied over the years from $65 million to twice 
that much.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The RAND location, although idyllic, became a popular site not only for 
anti-war demonstrations over the years, but also for protests against nuclear 
testing and research. As recently as the Gulf War, the think tank drew 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, RAND was in the limelight when peace activists tried to make Santa 
Monica a "nuclear-free zone," a proposal that, if passed by voters, would have 
prevented RAND from even researching nuclear subjects. It lost by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst brouhaha involving RAND was the publication of the Pentagon 
Papers, which exposed lies the government told the public about the Vietnam 
War. The secret documents were stolen from the RAND building by their author, 
Daniel Ellsberg, and leaked to the New York Times, resulting in the loss of the 
think tank's security clearance for a time and highlighting its classified 
military research. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder RAND kept a low profile in the community for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, RAND is broadcasting its community involvement. Employees are 
involved in about 70 local organizations, led by Vice President Rae W. 
Archibald, chairman of the board of the city's largest homeless service agency, 
the Ocean Park Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from its economic worth as the city's third-largest employer (1,100 
employees and a $65-million annual payroll), RAND is an asset to a "cutting 
edge" place like Santa Monica, City Manager John Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalili said he just picks up the phone to pick some of the best brains in 
America, experts who have helped Santa Monica set up its public computer 
network and counseled the city on its programs for seniors, youth and the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its fence-mending effort, RAND has for the last two years been the 
lead organizer of Share the Holidays, a multi-agency drive to gather food, 
clothing and toys for needy people. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts have not moved Hayden, a leading opponent of the Civic Center 
plan, who has said that an agency with RAND's history does not belong in a 
Civic Center at all. Initially, he tried to persuade RAND to swap its land. And 
he is definitely not of a mind to accommodate the think tank's quest for 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 In written testimony to the City Council recently, Hayden said the city should 
insist on knowing whether RAND is conducting research on "nuclear, chemical or 
bacterial weapons." Only then can the city "make an informed decision about 
whether to allow such a private developer to cast the tallest shadow over the 
symbolic center of our civic life, the public square," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, RAND is not playing its trump card by threatening to sell its 
property and move. "We've had to listen to a lot of malarkey about this 
institution . . . (but) we like it here," Thomson said. "We've been here 
forever."

MAN SAVED FROM FIERY PILEUP; RESCUE: L.A. COUNTY FIRE CAPTAIN EN ROUTE TO WORK 
FREES A TRAPPED VICTIM FROM A FLAMING FREEWAY WRECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles County Fire Department captain on his way to work got an 
unexpectedly early start Saturday when he pulled over to aid victims at an 
accident and ended up rescuing a man trapped in a burning car. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Dave Thies was westbound on the San Bernardino Freeway about 6 a.m. when 
he saw an accident near Holt Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just stopped to ask if he could be of assistance when several other 
cars, apparently unable to avoid the first accident, plowed into one another. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thies and others watched in horror, two of the cars burst into flames. 
Passengers in one of the vehicles were able to escape but the driver of the 
other car remained trapped as the fire began to engulf the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole back and driver's side were on fire," Thies said. "I tried to open 
the door but it was locked. I ran over and tried to break the glass with my 
fist, but I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, someone handed him a flashlight and Thies used it to break the 
window on the passenger side. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man, who was semiconscious, was still wearing his seat belt. By then, 
the man's clothes were on fire, Thies said. Nevertheless, he jumped in, 
released the seat belt and pulled the man to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a nurse who had also stopped "rolled him around on the pavement to 
extinguish the flames," Thies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Jorge Nunez, 25, suffered second-degree burns over about 25% of 
his body, West Covina Fire Department Battalion Chief Al Cheramie said. He was 
taken to Inter-Community Hospital in Covina and later transferred to Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Thies, 35, said he suffered second-degree burns on both hands, his forehead 
and ears. His hair was also singed. He was treated and released from 
Inter-Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his injuries, Thies insisted on going to work Saturday at Station 98 
in Bellflower. His boss took one look at him and ordered him home. 
</P>
<P>
 He will end up taking about a week off to recover, he said in a telephone call 
from his Upland home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thies said he gave no thought to his own safety when he jumped in to save 
another's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it had to be done and it had to be done quickly," he said. "Any 
fireman being there at the time would have done the same thing. It's something 
you prepare for." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the initial accident is being investigated, Cheramie said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the six vehicles involved was a van transporting a body from a Las 
Vegas funeral home to a mortuary in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Thies and Nunez, three other people received injuries, none of them 
serious, Cheramie said.

'COPS AND ROBBERS' ENDS IN BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A game of "cops and robbers" turned deadly when a 12-year-old boy using a 
loaded pistol shot a 6-year-old friend to death in a Diamond Bar house, 
sheriff's deputies said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the boys' names was released.  
</P>
<P>
 "The older boy found the gun under a mattress and, apparently unaware the gun 
was real, incorporated it into the game and at some point discharged the weapon 
at the 6-year-old, striking him in the head and killing him," Deputy Rich 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans to file charges against the parents involved, although the 
matter will be turned over to the district attorney's office for final 
disposition, sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear said.

1993: THE YEAR IN REVIEW. THE MIGHTY DUCKS STEAL THE SHOW; DUCKS: DIAMOND IN A 
ROUGH YEAR

 They wear some of the ugliest uniforms ever seen outside the Hot Dog On A 
Stick stand at your local mall -- an unsightly, unholy union between a 
California Raisin and a pair of Donald Duck pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a team name that makes grown men blush, a team name that was 
borrowed from a patently unoriginal kids movie that should have been subtitled, 
"The Bad News Bears Go Skating." 
</P>
<P>
 They exist, first and foremost, as a marketing tool for the Walt Disney Co., 
which was eager to tap into the sporting goods/paraphernalia business because 
it simply wasn't making enough money in the children's home-video field. 
</P>
<P>
 They are an anonymous collection of grunts and working stiffs, unwanted in 
their previous ports of call, most of them either over the hill or not much 
into hiking in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also the most exciting thing to happen to the Orange County sports 
scene since Jim Everett the Great ventured north to San Francisco for the 1989 
NFC championship game . . . and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks -- for better or for worse, where would the paying sports 
fans of Orange County have been in 1993 without them? 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Angels turn Anaheim Stadium into the largest-scale garage sale 
this side of San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
 Covering their eyes while Everett melts down like a dime-store candle at 
mid-field, Chuck Knox ages faster than the picture of Dorian Gray and the Rams 
wink and giggle as the city of Baltimore whispers sweet nothings into their 
ears? 
</P>
<P>
 Drumming their fingers while waiting for Rod Baker to turn the UC Irvine 
basketball program around -- and wondering how going from 7-22 one season to 
6-21 the next can be classified as "rebuilding"? 
</P>
<P>
 Sidling up to their relatives from Chicago and Dallas, proudly thumping their 
thumbs into their chests and announcing, "Well, we have the Bullfrogs"? 
</P>
<P>
 If not for ice hockey, 1993 would have been mighty chilly around here. The 
Ducks caught a county's fancy because they were everything the Rams and the 
Angels and the other resident underachievers were not -- new, fresh, 
hard-working, feisty, pleasantly surprising, heart-warming rather than 
heart-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning life as table scraps from such notoriously underfed households as 
Hartford, Ottawa and San Jose, the Ducks have succeeded beyond the tritest 
Disney "high concept" -- winning the first road game in their history (over the 
Rangers at Madison Square Garden); sweeping a November road swing through the 
Western Conference (going 4-0 at Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg); 
winning 14 of their first 38 games; taking more standings points (28) into 
Christmas than the cross-town, defending conference champion Kings, and taking 
60% of their defeats down to the wire. Thirteen of the Ducks' first 21 losses 
were decided by one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the Ducks' first season has been startling, especially when 
one considers these inauspicious milestones in the franchise's infancy: 
</P>
<P>
 March 1, 1993 -- Disney CEO Michael Eisner is joined by Mickey, Minnie, 
Donald, Pluto, Goofy, the Disneyland brass band, beaming Disney cheerleaders 
and a hundred or so pee-wee hockey players on the confetti-strewn floor of 
Anaheim Arena to announce that Disney's hockey team would begin play in 1993, 
would be named "the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim" and would play its home games on 
"The Pond." As purists from Newfoundland to British Columbia sobbed in their 
Molsons, Eisner handed NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and King owner Bruce 
McNall, president of the league's board of governors, duck calls and led them 
in a group quack. 
</P>
<P>
 June 24 -- The Ducks and their expansion brethren, the Florida Panthers, draft 
their inaugural rosters. The Panthers select the best goaltender on the board, 
former Ranger all-star John Vanbiesbrouck, and pay the price; Vanbiesbrouck 
earns more than $1 million a season. The Ducks, keeping a constant eye on the 
bottom line, counter with Guy Hebert ($400,000) as their first goaltender, 
Alexei Kasatonov ($650,000) as their first defenseman and Steven King 
($365,000) as their first forward. Eventually, the Ducks enter the 1993-94 
season with a payroll of $7.9 million, the lowest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 8 -- The Ducks play their first regular-season game, are routed by 
Detroit, 7-2, and are completely upstaged by a garish pregame show that 
features exploding rockets, flashing lasers, rainbow-colored spotlights, a 
flying duck mascot, skating sequined cheerleaders, ear-splitting heavy metal 
music, a Zamboni from Space Mountain and a singing/shouting guy named "Iceman" 
whose express purpose that night was never clearly defined. (Apparently, he was 
there to annoy the crowd. "Iceman" succeeded at this so thoroughly that he lost 
his job the next day.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of pregame show: More than $450,000, which is more than the annual salary 
of every Duck player except Kasatonov and goalie Ron Tugnutt -- in case anyone 
was still wondering where Disney had placed its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these foreboding obstacles, or maybe because of them, the Ducks pulled 
together by the end of October, playing an aggressive, no-frills brand of 
hockey that belied the goofball cartoon logo on their chests. Coach Ron Wilson 
rallied his troops around an us-against-the-world work ethic, leaned heavily on 
the unflappable goaltending of Hebert and Tugnutt, and prayed for two or three 
goals a game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was anything but flashy, but Orange County appreciated the effort. Through 
their first 18 home games, the Ducks were averaging 16,637 in attendance -- 
nearly 97% capacity. A Dec. 26 meeting with the Kings brought a sellout crowd 
of 17,174, which was more than half the audience at Anaheim Stadium earlier the 
same day, on hand to watch the Rams lose to the Cleveland Browns, 42-14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That Ram crowd -- 34,155, the lowest total for a non-strike game in the team's 
14 years in Anaheim -- was the culmination of one of the worst seasons in the 
franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, the Rams have lost more games in a single season than they did in 
1993. At 4-11 with one game remaining, they are a shoo-in to better 1991's 
3-13. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are merely numbers. The wretchedness of this Ram season must be 
measured in other terms -- in indictments (cornerback Darryl Henley's, for 
alleged drug trafficking), in irritating rumors (the Rams and Baltimore have 
discussed a mutually beneficial franchise shift), in career-shattering 
benchings (Everett's, after 3 1/2 seasons of declining production), in shaken 
confidence in a system (Knox's) that appeared to be firmly on track 12 months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Rams finished 6-10, doubling their victory total from 1991. Then 
they added free agents Shane Conlan, Henry Rolling and Fred Stokes to the 
defense. Then they added Jerome Bettis, 1,300-yard rusher and NFL rookie of the 
year candidate, to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 And they backslid. 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas weekend, the Rams were playing the worst football in the league. 
Their 28-point loss to the Browns prompted one Cleveland assistant coach to 
remark that the Rams were the worst NFL team he had seen in two years. Only one 
club, 3-12 Cincinnati, had a poorer record than the Rams, but that record 
included a 15-3 victory over them on Dec. 19 at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame? Everett was the most obvious target, since his personal 
undoing triggered the Rams' unraveling. After four games, the Rams stood at 
.500, 2-2, before Everett turned in back-to-back clunkers against New Orleans 
(a 37-6 loss) and then-winless Atlanta, the latter prompting an angry 
chair-throwing incident between Ram teammates in the Georgia Dome locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 The season began to swirl down the drain that Thursday night in Atlanta. 
Finally, the defense, which had performed respectably to that point, became 
demoralized. Finally, Knox lost faith in Everett, one of the primary reasons he 
hitched up, at age 60, for the Herculean assignment of returning the Rams to 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Knox looked at this team in early 1992, he saw a lot of major problems, 
but quarterback, he thought, wasn't one of them. In Everett, Knox figured, he 
had a player to rebuild around. With most projects of this nature, quarterback 
is the last, nagging piece. In Everett, Knox thought he was arriving in Anaheim 
one big step ahead in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half later, Everett was on the sideline while a former 
ninth-round draft pick from Tulsa, T.J. Rubley, was lining up over center, 
getting a crash course in on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, as green as the grass beneath his feet, was the people's choice, 
largely because he wasn't Everett. By Game 11, he was Knox's choice as well, 
albeit reluctantly. Rubley forced Knox's hand by energizing the offense in two 
relief appearances against Detroit and Washington, but not nearly as much as 
Everett, who compounded his collapse in the pocket by criticizing Knox's 
offensive strategy as "obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox kept Rubley on a very short leash, allowing him, basically, to throw 
10-yard out patterns and hand the ball to Bettis. For one game, Dec. 12 in New 
Orleans, it worked spectacularly well -- Bettis rushed for 212 yards, a Ram 
rookie record, and the Rams upset the Saints, 23-20. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubley was shaky when throwing deep and a bigger threat running than 
passing, and the Rams closed out their schedule resigned to the prospect of 
looking outside the organization for a new quarterback in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 They were also looking into the prospect of moving the organization outside 
the organization -- to Baltimore or St. Louis, two cities slighted in the NFL's 
latest round of expand-o-rama. The Baltimore Rams? In a late December interview 
with The Times, the first she had given in eight years, owner Georgia Frontiere 
didn't say yes, but she didn't say no, either. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1993, the mood of the fan on the street had turned surly. The 
prevailing sentiment: Move the Rams anywhere you want, Georgia -- and please, 
take the Angels with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' Great Youth/Austerity Movement (the choice is yours) had one great 
month, April, where so many things went so well that it was widely presumed 
Whitey Herzog had sold his crew cut to the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, acquired in the much-reviled trade that sent local hero Jim Abbott 
to the Yankees, reprised the Wally World splash of '86 and then some -- batting 
.343 with six home runs and 17 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sanderson, acquired in an attempt to fill Abbott's spot in the rotation, 
won his first three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon, one of four rookies force-fed in the everyday lineup, hit five 
home runs with 14 RBIs while another, Damion Easley, batted .298. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels recorded back-to-back sweeps of Cleveland and Boston, beat Roger 
Clemens and Frank Viola, won 13 of their first 19 games and jumped to the top 
of the American League West standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Angels were forced to play the next five months. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of July, Snow was in the minors, Sanderson had been released, 
Easley was out for the season, facing leg surgery, and the Angels were 48-55, 9 
1/2 games out, fading from front-office indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office did nothing to help Manager Buck Rodgers in midstream, 
primarily because this unexpected contention thing was proving to be a royal 
pain in the wallet. Keep winning, and you know how these kids are. Next thing 
you know, they'll be asking for a raise.  
</P>
<P>
 September became an open tryout for any prospect in the organization, real or 
imagined -- Mark Holzemer, Brian Anderson, Jim Edmonds, come on down! -- and 
the Angels finished their schedule 71-91, one game worse than their 1992 
record, despite a career-high 112 RBIs from designated hitter Chili Davis and 
rookie of the year numbers (.283, 31 home runs, 95 RBIs) from Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on whittling their payroll to an anorexic $19 million, the Angels 
devoted the first three months of the off-season to dumping the contracts of 
leadoff hitter Luis Polonia, valuable utilityman Rene Gonzales and saves leader 
Steve Frey. They also dangled Mark Langston and his $4 million salary to see if 
there were any takers -- there have been some nibbles; stay tuned -- and 
announced they were raising season ticket prices on certain premium seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, they also made one acquisition of note: shortstop Spike Owen, who batted 
.234 in 1993 and will be asked in '94 to play second base, a position Owen 
hasn't handled since high school. Owens makes a lot of money -- his contract 
calls for $4.25 million through 1995 -- but the Angels, shrewd dealers, were 
able to talk the Yankees into agreeing to pay $3.25 million of it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the college level, nothing much proceeded according to plan, with the 
possible exception of Cal State Fullerton football. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to play no games in 1993, the Fullerton football team (1970-1992) did 
just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Fullerton's baseball team, seemingly headed back to Omaha for a 
second consecutive College World Series appearance, didn't get out of the 
regionals; Fullerton's basketball team, expected to struggle under first-year 
coach Brad Holland, was surprisingly competitive, finishing 15-12, and UC 
Irvine's basketball team, christened by many preseason magazines as a Program 
To Watch, could be seen winning six of 27 games -- one fewer victory than the 
previous season's 7-22 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-dormant Fullerton-Irvine rivalry exploded again on Jan. 16, in an 
ugly postgame brawl prompted by a kick to Titan forward Bruce Bowen's head by 
Irvine reserve Uzoma Obiekea. Obiekea drew a two-week suspension for the 
incident, a sad headline-grabber in an Anteater season best forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's community college and high school championship roll call 
included the Rancho Santiago College baseball team, the Golden West College 
water polo team, the Orange Coast College women's swim team and the Brea-Olinda 
High girls' basketball team -- State champions all -- and the Los Alamitos High 
and Irvine High football teams, both three-time Southern Section titlists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, Orange County athletes were at their best competing in 
sports most commonly associated with Canada and Brazil. Hockey and soccer. As a 
warm-up act for the Ducks, the Anaheim Bullfrogs won the county's first 
professional championship since 1977 by going 13-0-1 in the new Roller Hockey 
International league. The Bullfrogs averaged nearly 9,000 for home games at 
Anaheim Arena, despite the fact you couldn't tell the players with a program, 
despite a bare concrete playing surface -- known, in professional roller hockey 
circles, as "the slab" -- that more closely resembled the oil-stained floor of 
your Uncle Leo's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Two soccer teams based at Cal State Fullerton, Al Mistri's Titans and the 
Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League, advanced far into the 
playoffs -- the Titans reaching the NCAA final four, the Salsa falling to 
Colorado in the APSL final, 3-1, in front of an overflow crowd of 11,000 at 
Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a controversial defeat, too, as Salsa Coach Rildo Menezes, hoping to 
protect a 1-0 lead, decided to pull his best scorer, league MVP Paulinho, and 
replace him with a better defender with four minutes remaining. The strategy 
worked about as well as Gene Mauch's decision to pull Mike Witt in Game 5 of 
the 1986 playoffs. Colorado rallied for three late goals to win, and Rildo 
found himself out of a job a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 But a loss in a finals is a loss in a finals -- rarefied ground in Orange 
County. The Rams haven't been to a Super Bowl since 1980. The Angels haven't 
been to a World Series in 34 years of existence. Neither has made the playoffs, 
or even placed above .500, since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at last check, they had 30 points in the Pacific Division standings and 
were on pace for 66, which would be a post-1968 expansion record. Eighty points 
are generally the minimum required for an NHL playoff berth, so this Christmas 
what-if talk is probably a tad wide-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the Angels also got off to a good start in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the very least, the Ducks have given local fans a reason to peek at the 
morning sports section, a reason to come out to the arena, a reason to root for 
the home team without risk of persecution or humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Orange County, circa 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Orange County, a.k.a. Hockey Country.

RAMS' VETERAN RECEIVER LOOKING FOR DIRECTION; FOOTBALL: ELLARD WONDERING WHAT 
COURSE HIS CAREER AND THE TEAM WILL MAKE AFTER THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Ellard delivered the foam-rubber football in a perfect spiral, one that 
his 9-year-old son, Henry Jr., turned into a textbook catch, just like his 
father has done hundreds of times with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 This was how the Ellards killed time after a recent Ram practice, a father, a 
son, and a football. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes basketball more than football," Ellard said, watching his son chase 
after the ball, "but he's thinking about playing Pop Warner football next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the question is . . . where? 
</P>
<P>
 What NFL city the Ellards play in next season depends on what the Ram front 
office does with the veteran wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, 32, becomes an unrestricted free agent after Sunday's regular-season 
finale against the Chicago Bears, and he isn't sure if he will be back for his 
12th season with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good question," he said. "And I won't know for sure until it's time 
to negotiate. Being with the Rams for 11 years, it would be nice to finish my 
career here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they (front office) haven't made a move yet, so I have to sit back and 
wait and see what happens, what other teams that might come in and talk to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a disappointing season in which he caught only 47 passes for 727 
yards, Ellard rejuvenated his career with an off-season training program and 
leads Ram receivers this season with 60 catches for 921 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the best of seasons might not help Ellard in a free-agent market 
limited by the salary cap, which will probably discourage teams from signing 
players older than 30. It will certainly become a buyer's market, something 
that Ellard has been made aware of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My actions speak for me," he said. "People see what I've done this year. When 
I was called on this year, I answered it. That's the main thing. I'm not a 
person who likes to stand here and brag about what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-11) will be playing for little more than pride and draft position 
Sunday. It's also an opportunity for the team's 13 unrestricted free agents, 
including Ellard, to showcase their talents.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't necessarily look at it as showcasing myself," Ellard said, "but I 
try to lock on to the fact that I have 921 yards and I can try to get 1,000. 
That's something that could be good, considering how things went this year. 
That gives me something to focus on, to keep myself going." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ellard's 1992 season, the Rams sought a free-agent wide receiver to 
replace him. They failed to find one, and Ellard's off-season improvement made 
it a moot point anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard has heard more whispers this season about replacing him. Two of the 
Rams' biggest needs are a quarterback and a speedy wide receiver, preferably a 
young one. Two potential draft selections are UCLA's J.J. Stokes, should he 
decide to declare himself eligible for the draft, and USC's Johnnie Morton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised, the way they've talked about this and that," Ellard 
said of drafting a receiver. "But anything can happen in a draft. Whatever 
happens, I'm ready for any challenge that comes about, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard figures it couldn't be any more difficult than what he has endured in 
the past year. Bothered by hamstring pulls and other leg injuries in 1992, he 
stumbled to his worst season in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 season, Ellard came to a conclusion: At his age, he needed to 
be stronger and faster if he was going to have a future in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying Henry was getting a little old and he was at the end of 
his career," said Milt Jackson, the Rams' receivers coach. "He wanted to 
rejuvenate his career. I had mentioned to him before that I had coached guys 
who had played for 11 years or more who were in as good a shape as first- or 
second-year guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Stanley Morgan played 15 years and he could run all day. He took care of 
himself in the off-season; Drew Hill did that, too. Henry and I talked about 
that, that the older you get the more you have to take care of yourself and 
prepare in the off-season. The younger guys can get away without having to do 
some of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard enlisted the help of track and field coach Randy Huntington, who has 
worked with world-record long jumper Mike Powell since 1987. Three times a day, 
Ellard ran sprints and lifted weights in Fresno, his hometown, under 
Huntington's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to Randy because he was the one who committed me to doing this," 
Ellard said. "He put me through the test, that's for sure. It was a different 
type of workout, but the one I needed to wake my body up all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a man on a mission and I let Randy know that from the start. I'm 
looking forward to doing the same thing this off-season, and I'll be even 
stronger next season." 
</P>
<P>
 While other players on the offense have complained about playing time and 
their roles, Ellard has quietly done whatever has been asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking for rookie tailback Jerome Bettis? No problem. Ellard did plenty of 
blocking for Eric Dickerson early in his career. Need a punt returner to 
replace the injured Todd Kinchen? No problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Henry has had a good year in a season where we haven't really thrown the ball 
very well," Jackson said. "The great thing about Henry is that he's a real 
disciplined player and will do whatever is necessary to win. He won't 
(complain) about not getting a lot of balls thrown his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the game plan) requires him to block, and he does a nice job of it. He's 
a good team player, and there's a place in the league for guys like that until 
physically they can't do it anymore." Keeping Up 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ellard, an 11-year pro who will be an unrestricted free agent at 
season's end, leads the Rams in several receiving categories, and games of 
eight catches against Cleveland and nine against Pittsburgh this season rank 
among the top four of his career.

CRITICS: IT'S JUST ANOTHER BEAUTY PAGEANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's Miss Galaxy, Ms. Fitness USA, Fitness America Pageant and most 
recently the Professional Women's National Physical Fitness championship. 
What's the difference? To women's rights groups, there is none. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, is against any competition in which a woman's appearance is judged 
subjectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pageants in any form that focus on scoring women like cattle are abusive and 
to be looked at as archaic," Bruce said. "I don't care whether it is 
traditional beauty contests or bodybuilding. It's sad in general women don't 
have enough self-esteem to say no to this type of garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynnore Lawton, the director of communications of the Women's Sports 
Foundation in New York, questions the motive for swimsuit and evening gown 
competitions in the fitness contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as if the only reason they've included any athletic endeavor is 
to keep (organizers) from being the bad guys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors find no fault with the format. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Dobbins, 30, of Costa Mesa, who tied for second in the 1993 Miss Galaxy 
competition and placed third in the 1993 Ms. Fitness USA contest, said "the 
physique" rounds gives competitors an opportunity to showcase a body achieved 
through arduous conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimiko Tanaka, 28, of Marina del Rey, a host on ESPN's "Bodyshaping" who will 
compete in this month's Galaxy contest, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In art, you have a contest to display your work," Tanaka said. "When you've 
trained so hard and spent so much time and energy to sculpture your body into 
an art form, it's a positive thing to want to display your art." 
</P>
<P>
 The differences in fitness pageants are slight: 
</P>
<P>
 * Miss Galaxy is based on a swimsuit and obstacle-course competition. Each 
event is weighed equally. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ms. Fitness format consists of three rounds -- swimsuit, evening gown 
and fitness routine -- each counting a third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fitness America is also judged on three rounds of equal value, with a twist. 
It has a swimsuit and fitness routine, but the evening gown portion also has an 
interview segment. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Women's National Physical Fitness championship is based 50% on swimsuit, 
25% on evening gown and interview and 25% on fitness routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ms. Fitness final is scheduled for Feb. 12-13 at El Camino College. The 
$125,000 event will be televised internationally.

SECOND COMING OF KAREEM?; ABDUL-JABBAR JR. MAY NEVER MATCH HIS FATHER'S 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT DAD TAKES PRIDE IN HIS SON'S IMPROVEMENT IN CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 The name evokes images and memories spanning three decades of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's all-time leading scorer. The 7-foot-2 center nicknamed Cap, who led 
his teams to six NBA titles, including five with the Lakers. The former Lew 
Alcindor who led UCLA to three consecutive NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequestered from the national attention, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr. practices his 
jump shot at Brentwood School, a small Westside L.A. prep school. Abdul-Jabbar 
Jr., a 17-year-old senior, is the second of Abdul-Jabbar's five children. A 6-4 
forward/center, he is the leading scorer for the Eagles, averaging 17.7 points 
and nine rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine Abdul-Jabbar, the sequel. Can he keep pace with his teammates running 
up the court on a fast break? Will he be the player to continue leading UCLA 
back to national prominence? Will he bring back Showtime to the Lakers? 
</P>
<P>
 Doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is being recruited by some Division I schools, he is a longshot to 
even approach his father's NBA or collegiate accomplishments. It's a fact that 
Abdul-Jabbar Jr. can accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'd like to play college basketball," Abdul-Jabbar Jr. said. "If at 
all possible I'd like to play in the NBA, but I'm prepared to do other things 
besides that, because it's a slim chance and only so many people make it." 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger challenge for him is meeting the academic expectations of his father, 
who was an above-average student at Power Memorial High in New York City and at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has the talent physically. But I'm not sure he has the drive," the 
elder Abdul-Jabbar said. "He has to be prepared to do a lot of things and make 
a lot of sacrifices to be a successful winning athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar, 46, has had to push his son to give as much attention to 
academics as he does athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play a lot of sports -- baseball and soccer," Abdul-Jabbar Jr. 
said. "And I also was interested in football. And I still go skiing and fishing 
sometimes. But when I got into high school I didn't have enough time for 
schoolwork and things other than basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with his father, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. has steadily improved his 
grade-point average and scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to counterbalance his enthusiasm for sports with the reminders that 
his academic life is something that he will take with him a much longer time," 
Abdul-Jabbar Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship continues to improve after Abdul-Jabbar spent so many years 
away from his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Jr. lived with his mother Habiba, seeing his father only at 
holidays and during summer months between basketball seasons. That time grew 
shorter each year as the Lakers routinely made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They briefly lived together before Abdul-Jabbar Jr. moved back to his mother's 
home before his senior year at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're playing catch-up (in a relationship), you can't get into the 
depth that you want to," Abdul-Jabbar Sr. said. "I'm surprised that we have 
made the progress that we have. It has been bumpy at first because basically 
for a long part of his life I was like Uncle Daddy. I didn't get to see him 
that much. And so that was difficult on both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was basketball, however, that drew the two closer. 
</P>
<P>
 While his father was holding center court at the Forum, a 5-year-old Kareem 
Jr. began to show interest in the sport and tried to emulate his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father used to take me to practice," Abdul-Jabbar Jr. said. "I'd try to do 
what I could on the sidelines while the Lakers were practicing." 
</P>
<P>
 At 9, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. began playing in his first organized league, at Pan 
Pacific Park in Mid-City Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Sr. said he only pushed his oldest son into learning a martial 
art and that he discovered a love for basketball on his own. "He was good. I 
mean he wasn't exceptional, but he was good and he had fun at it. He had a hoop 
at his house and he shot the ball a lot. He's a good shooter. He had fun. That 
was all that I cared about." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Jr. did not think it was unusual that he spent so much time 
around the Lakers and that players such as Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper 
were his friends. It was only later, when he became a teen-ager, that he began 
to understand its significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really have the same perspective, I guess, as everybody else," 
Abdul-Jabbar Jr. said. "Because to me these were just people I saw every day. 
And I didn't watch the games on TV that much so I really didn't exactly know 
who they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my dad would take me to practice sometimes and I'd play with them. And 
they would teach me how to improve my shot." 
</P>
<P>
 After he retired from basketball in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar began to take a more 
active role in his son's education. After completing ninth grade at Burroughs 
Junior High, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. transferred to Brentwood in 1991 and moved into 
his father's Bel-Air Estates home. It was a tough adjustment for father and 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stricter on certain things. I'm lax on other things that his mom isn't. 
So it probably bewilders my kids for a minute until they get a better read on 
where I'm coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Jr. said he is treated the same as the other students who attend 
Brentwood. Maybe because in addition to Abdul-Jabbar Jr., Ryan West, the son of 
former Laker and current General Manager Jerry West, and Michael Cooper Jr. 
also attend the school as eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "At school I don't get treated any differently, which I like," Abdul-Jabbar 
Jr. said. "On the basketball court usually people either don't know who I am or 
they will know and that makes them play harder and that makes me player harder 
and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Jr., however, struggled his sophomore year in the classroom and 
on the Eagles' junior varsity team. His father was enraged when his son's first 
report card read C+, C-, D+, D- and F. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was on his five academic subjects," Abdul-Jabbar Sr. said. "You know I 
not only hit the ceiling, I hit the stratosphere on that one. I told him if 
this doesn't change you can forget about basketball and forget about Brentwood 
School." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1992 school year, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. turned in passing grades. 
The D's and F's were replaced by B's and C's. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Sr. also helped his son improve his play on the basketball court. 
He spent considerable time teaching him how to dribble and shoot left-handed 
and gave him drills to improve his stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I emphasized to him was his ambidexterity," Abdul-Jabbar Sr. 
said. "He shoots the ball real well. I just taught him that he needs to be able 
to handle the ball with both hands." 
</P>
<P>
 During his sophomore season, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. averaged 10 points a game on the 
junior varsity. As a junior, he averaged 12 points and eight rebounds a game as 
a part-time starter on the varsity. Now he is the leading scorer for the Eagles 
(7-4), who expect to contend for the Delphic League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good outside shooter from middle range," Brentwood Coach Bob Ingram 
said. "He's also good around the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has attempted only one hook shot during a game, Abdul-Jabbar Jr. 
has developed a jump shot that rivals his father's best long-range attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't shoot the hook," Abdul-Jabbar said. "He's got a good jumper though. 
A serious jumper. He can put it down whether he's leaning in any direction. He 
reminds me a lot of (former Golden State Warrior guard) Phil Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Kareem Jr. succeeds as a basketball player, Abdul-Jabbar Sr. 
doesn't believe his name has hindered his son's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to hurt him at all," he said. "Despite the fact that 
we haven't been able to be close physically until recently, he has very strong 
identity with me. He's proud of it and it's something I've always encouraged 
and tried to nourish. He's comfortable with being my son."

NEW FACE OF FITNESS; CONTESTANTS SAY IT WILL TAKE BRAWN AND BEAUTY TO MUSCLE 
THEIR WAY TO FAME AND FORTUNE 
</P>

<P>
 It's a lot of pain in hopes of financial gain, but the investment is worth it 
for Kelly McColgan, who has dreams of pursuing a career in modeling after 
appearing in Playboy and Swimwear Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 McColgan, a 25-year-old Hermosa Beach resident, devotes an hour a day to 
aerobics and lifts weights five to six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff may come this month, when McColgan will be among a field of 175 
contestants from 10 countries competing in the $100,000 Miss Galaxy contest in 
Kissimmee, Fla., a beauty pageant and "American Gladiators" style competition 
rolled into one. The winner of the event gets $34,000, promotional tours and 
appearances and opportunities for endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the 1993 event, Alphie Newman earned about $70,000 in 
endorsements, according to George Snyder, who started the Galaxy contest last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 45, is the founder of the Miss Olympia competition. He was a 
bodybuilding promoter for 11 years, but became alarmed by increased steroid use 
by women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women look better without taking (drugs)," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder envisions Galaxy contestants as role models for the average woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, some of these (bodybuilders) will scare you if you meet them in a 
dark alley. . . . They're not building women's bodies, they're building an 
in-between type of thing, sort of a semi-man, semi-woman type of thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galaxy event is comprised of swimsuit and obstacle-course competitions. 
The obstacle course features tires, monkey bars, a cargo net, hurdles and a 
rope climb over a 10-foot wall. 
</P>
<P>
 McColgan, a flight attendant and mother of a 1-year-old son, recently added 
training sessions on the monkey bars, the rope and hurdles at a local school. 
Time permitting, the 5-foot-8 McColgan runs sprints on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The former collegiate swimmer views the contest as motivation to get back in 
shape. She won't feel out of place competing against the likes of American 
Gladiator Raye (Zap) Hollitt. McColgan was a contender on the 1992 American 
Gladiators Live Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming, though, is McColgan's forte. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was a 16-year-old high school sophomore in Saskatchewan, McColgan 
competed in the 1984 Canadian Olympic Trials in the 100-meter backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 McColgan moved to Danville, Calif., for her senior year and won the North 
Coast Section 200-yard individual medley title at San Ramon High and earned 
All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
 McColgan, who has a best of 2 minutes, 7.56 seconds in the 200 IM, was offered 
scholarships from several Division I universities, including Arizona State, San 
Diego State and Hawaii, but she chose to attend NCAA Division II Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As a college freshman in 1987, McColgan set school records in the 50- and 
100-yard freestyle, 100 butterfly and 200 IM. She also competed in six events 
in the Division II national meet, including a fifth-place finish in the 200 IM. 
</P>
<P>
 A coaching change and uncertainty about the future of the aquatic program at 
San Luis Obispo led McColgan to transfer to UC Santa Barbara for her sophomore 
year. McColgan competed for two seasons at Santa Barbara before dropping the 
sport after her junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swam for 11 months a year for 16 years; I was a little burned out," 
McColgan said. "When you're swimming, there's not much else you can do. You 
swim from 5 to 7 in the morning, go to school and then swim again in the 
afternoon. I just wanted to graduate and try new things to stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 That was part of the appeal of the Galaxy competition. McColgan competed in 
several Ms. Fitness USA competitions in 1991, but was dissatisfied with the 
judging criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ms. Fitness format consists of three rounds -- swimsuit, evening gown and 
a fitness routine -- each accounting for a third of the judging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like everybody was doing back flips and layouts," McColgan said. 
"Unless you had the ability, you wouldn't do well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Galaxy's "obstacle course is pretty cut and dried; you get a time and it's 
not someone's opinion. It's a true test of how athletic you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Dobbins, 30, of Costa Mesa, who tied for second in 1993 Galaxy 
competition, is regarded among the favorites for this year's title after Newman 
elected not to compete. Dobbins finished third in the 1993 Ms. Fitness USA 
competition, but plans to concentrate only on the Galaxy competition this year 
because of the emphasis on gymnastics in Ms. Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges are wooed by whoever has the most impressive routine," Dobbins 
said. "It has its boundaries and limitations. Miss Galaxy and Ms. Fitness are 
two different kinds of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Entry to the Galaxy contest is by invitation only. Snyder said he has received 
close to 400 entry requests, with nearly 50% coming from Florida and 
California. This year's contest at Old Town, a theme park in Kissimmee, was 
scheduled to be a two-day event with 25 contestants. But the contest was 
expanded to six days because of the response. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must submit a photo and a resume. Except for elite competitors, 
contestants are required to pay for their lodging and air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimiko Tanaka of Marina del Rey, a former Raiderette and host of the ESPN's 
"Bodyshaping," is also entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka, 28, a co-owner of a nutritional consulting firm in Venice, decided to 
enter the Galaxy contest because of her lifelong affection for fitness. At age 
14, Tanaka competed on a synchronized swimming team that placed fourth in the 
Junior Olympics. She also competed in basketball and softball at La Sierra High 
in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you graduate from high school and college, there are not many 
opportunities available to motivate people to stay in shape," Tanaka said. "A 
lot of the girls will be competing for trophies and guest appearances. Money 
brings in a different breed of girl and it can become nasty and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going for the fun of it, but just the thought of allowing women to 
compete, and not at the bodybuilder level, is appealing."

TEN WHO MADE AN IMPACT; THEY PROVIDED THE THRILLS IN RECORD NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From fast finishes to fastballs, long bombs to deep home runs and high jumps 
to high intensity, here are 10 area sports figures who made an impact in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (1) Marion Jones of Thousand Oaks High capped a brilliant two-sport high 
school career by winning the girls' long jump and the 100- and 200-meter races 
in the state track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The three victories gave Jones an unprecedented nine state titles in her 
career, breaking the previous best of six shared by several athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state champion in the 100 and 200 as a freshman, sophomore and junior, 
Jones added the long jump to her repertoire in her final year, and her personal 
best of 22 feet 1/2 inch was only 2 1/2 inches shy of the national high school 
record of 22-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a freshman at North Carolina, Jones holds the national high school mark in 
the 200 (22.58 seconds) and ranks second in the 100 at 11.14. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones didn't slow down on the basketball court, either, averaging 22.8 points 
and 14.7 rebounds to earn state Division I player-of-the-year honors. Led by 
Jones, Thousand Oaks advanced to the championship game of the Southern Section 
Division I-A playoffs for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (2) Keith Smith of Newbury Park was one of the most touted high school 
quarterbacks in the country before the season began -- and he exceeded those 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 157 yards and another 
score in Newbury Park's 22-14 come-from-behind victory over Hawthorne in the 
Southern Section Division III title game, and his overall stats were equally 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the NCAA's passing-efficiency formula, Smith had a 179.1 rating. He 
completed 270 of 409 passes (66.0%) for 4,244 yards and 40 touchdowns with 13 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's passing yardage broke the single-season state mark of 4,223 yards set 
by Carson's John Walsh in 1990 and gave him a state record 9,971 yards for his 
career. With 87 touchdown passes, Smith tied for second on the all-time state 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Smith rushed for 774 yards and 11 touchdowns. His 98-yard scoring 
jaunt against Hawthorne gave Newbury Park its final margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his football exploits, Smith averaged 14.8 points and 4.0 assists in 
basketball. In baseball he batted .347 and drove in 18 runs and posted a 7-4 
record with a 2.88 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (3) Coley Kyman's decision to give up a spot on the U.S. men's B volleyball 
team last summer so he could play quarterback at Cal State Northridge in the 
fall seemed an unwise choice. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the ankle injury that Kyman suffered in the season opener against 
San Diego State not only ended his college days but jeopardized a promising 
volleyball career at the international level. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one has to admire Kyman's zeal for playing football, a sport he describes 
as his "first love." 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball, however, is the sport in which Kyman excels. He is a three-time 
All-American middle blocker who led Northridge to a runner-up finish in the 
NCAA championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year starter at Northridge, Kyman is the Matador career leader in kills 
(2,205), total attempts (4,044), digs (831), total blocks (554), solo blocks 
(111), block assists (443) and hitting percentage (.401). 
</P>
<P>
 He is also one of the founders of the Matamaniacs, a group of fun-loving 
Northridge athletes who dress in wild clothes and makeup to cheer Matador teams 
and jeer their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coley's pride in this school is awesome, especially when you consider that no 
one else has it," said John Price, the Northridge men's volleyball coach. "When 
he came in here as a freshman, he was embarrassed by the lack of pride the 
athletes had in their school. He was on a one-man mission to turn that around. 
And he has." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (4) Randy Wolf's pitching statistics weren't quite as impressive as those of 
Crespi's Jeff Suppan, but the left-handed junior from El Camino Real High was 
virtually unhittable at the end of the season as the Conquistadores marched to 
their first City Section 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's tear began May 18 -- when he threw a no-hitter and struck out 14 in a 
3-0 victory over Taft in a regular-season finale -- and ended June 3 when he 
pitched two innings of no-hit relief to save El Camino Real's 7-6 triumph over 
Chatsworth for the City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed the no-hitter with a perfect game in a 6-0 victory over Banning in 
the 4-A quarterfinals May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, he threw a three-hitter and struck out 12 in a 6-0 victory 
over Monroe in the semifinals.

 Wolf posted an 11-1 record for the season with a 1.05 ERA. He gave up 37 hits, 
struck out 118 and walked 39 in 79 1/3 innings. He also batted .338, scored 31 
runs and drove in 27 to earn the City 4-A player-of-the-year award.

 (5) Attracting more than a few hundred people to a junior college basketball 
game in Southern California is not an easy task, yet crowds of up to 3,000 
regularly file into the Ventura College gymnasium to watch their beloved 
Pirates play for Philip Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, in his ninth season of coaching at Ventura, has compiled a 241-52 
record since taking over a program that was 10-20 the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' coaching style -- which includes high-decibel scoldings of players 
who do not meet his performance standards -- has been criticized as overly 
harsh by some. But the bottom line is that the Pirates are consistently among 
the top teams in the state and most players improve their game under the fiery 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, which won the 1987 state title, has posted three consecutive 30-win 
seasons and is working on a fourth. The Pirates are 19-1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, which has been ranked No. 1 in the state poll all season, was the 
top-ranked team last season even after being upset by Columbia, 97-88, in the 
state title game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 (6) In a sport traditionally dominated by pitchers, Beth Calcante of Cal State 
Northridge has made a name for herself as a power hitter on the Matadors' 
softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante earned first-team All-American honors after leading Northridge in 
batting average (.343), hits (61), doubles (seven), home runs (school-record 
12), total bases (110), slugging percentage (.618), average with runners in 
scoring position (.477), runs batted in (school-record 51) and sacrifices (15) 
as a junior. The former Newbury Park High standout was also tied for the team 
lead in triples (three) and runs (33). 
</P>
<P>
 Her home run total tied her for third on the NCAA's all-time single-season 
list and she is tied for fifth on the career home run chart with 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante needs nine home runs to tie the NCAA Division I career record of 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Calcante, Northridge hit an NCAA record 40 home runs last season and 
was ranked second behind UCLA in the final national regular-season poll. 
</P>

<P>
 (7) Jeff Nadeau of Monroe High turned in one of the most stunning performances 
of the year when he cleared a City Section high jump record of 7 feet 2 1/4 
inches in the Valley Pac-8 Conference finals in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadeau entered the meet as a good -- he had a personal best of 6-8 -- but not 
great high jumper, and left it as one of the favorites for the state title. 
</P>
<P>
 That his season best was 6-6 entering the meet, and that the record clearance 
came on his 24th attempt of the competition, made Nadeau's performance all the 
more remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the long jump with a leap of 22 feet 2 inches, Nadeau cleared 
6-0, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, 6-6 and 6-8 on his first high jump attempts, but it took 
him three tries each at 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 7-0, 7-1 1/4 and 7-2 1/4. He missed 
three times at 7-3 1/4 before heading directly to the triple jump where he 
placed second with a personal best of 45-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a huge shot in the arm for City track," then-City Section Commissioner 
Hal Harkness said. "A huge shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Nadeau, a three-sport standout at Monroe now attending Arizona on a football 
scholarship, proved his performance was no fluke by winning the City (7-0), 
Golden West invitational (6-10) and state (7-2) championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He also averaged 13.7 points and 5.1 rebounds for the Viking basketball team 
which advanced to the finals of the City 3-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (8) Newbury Park wide receiver Leodes Van Buren is half of the most productive 
quarterback-receiver combination in high school football history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther senior led the state this season in receptions with 101 for 1,658 
yards and 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the state's all-time leader in receptions (269) and receiving yardage 
(4,446) and ranks second in touchdown receptions (45). 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren also ranks second on the national all-time list in career receptions 
and receiving yardage. Only Maurice Mebane of Cummings High in Burlington, 
N.C., had more catches (292 from 1989-92), and only Stan Rome of Valdosta (Ga.) 
High had more receiving yards (4,477 from 1970-73). 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, Van Buren averaged 14.3 points and 6.2 rebounds in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (9) George Keiaho didn't play for a team that won a section championship and 
missed three games because of injuries, yet the Buena High senior rushed for 
2,248 yards and scored 30 touchdowns as the Bulldogs advanced to the semifinals 
of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho, the Cal-Hi Sports freshman and sophomore player of the year in 1990 
and '91, rushed for 6,585 yards and scored 81 touchdowns in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 His rushing total ranks second on the all-time state list behind David Dotson 
(USC), who ran for 7,257 yards at Moreno Valley Valley View from 1989-91, and 
his career touchdown total ranks fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his 224.8-yards per game average this season, Keiaho could have 
become the second back in state history to rush for 7,000 yards if not for the 
injuries, with Dotson's mark within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the turmoil that engulfed the Cal State Northridge football team for 
much of the season, Robert Trice quietly rushed for 1,362 yards to move to 
third on the Matador single-season list. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-11, 205-pound senior from Rocky Point, N.C., was held to 216 yards 
rushing in the first three games before he posted consecutive school-record 
totals of 261 yards against Sonoma State and 278 yards against Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He had three other games in which he rushed for more than 100 yards, including 
a 187-yard effort against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a 152-yard total against 
Southern Utah in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kane (1,565 yards in 1986) and Albert Fann (1,377 in 1989) are the only 
Matador players to rush for more yards in a season than Trice.

<P>
 Playing the short hop on some of the memorable events in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 DISTINGUISHED SERVICE 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Accardy, the men's and women's swimming coach at Cal State Northridge, 
retired Sept. 1 after guiding the Matadors to 13 NCAA Division II titles in his 
24-year tenure at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge men won nine Division II titles between 1975-85 and the women 
won four -- including three in a row from 1987-89 -- after Accardy took over 
that program in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Accardy's men's teams had a combined dual-meet record of 286-62 and the women 
posted a 139-28 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schreifels, an assistant at Arizona State from 1989-93, took over the 
Northridge program in September. 
</P>
<P>
 MILESTONE 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Cvijanovich, who is in his 36th season as the boys' basketball coach at 
Santa Clara High, notched the 700th victory of his career Feb. 19 when the 
Saints defeated St. Genevieve, 70-52, in a first-round game of the Southern 
Section Division IV-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cvijanovich, who has a 707-224 record, has guided Santa Clara to 12 Southern 
Section titles, including four in a row from 1989-92. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints won state Division IV titles in 1989 and '90. 
</P>
<P>
 UPSET OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Moten hit a three-point shot -- his only field goal of the game -- 
with three seconds left in overtime to give Cal State Northridge an 81-78 
victory over visiting Cal State Long Beach in a nonconference men's basketball 
game Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge guard Andre Chevalier called the victory the Matadors' "biggest win 
ever," and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which later advanced to the NCAA tournament, had earlier defeated 
then-No. 1-ranked Kansas and Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 TRY AGAIN AWARD 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Giordano made two free throws with no time remaining to give the 
Buena High girls' basketball team a 44-43 win over Thousand Oaks in the 
Southern Section Division I-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory snapped a three-game losing streak in the section finals for 
Buena, which lost to Hart in 1990 and to Thousand Oaks in 1991 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 HEARTWARMING STORY DEPT. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Hay, an 11-year-old ball boy for the Cal State Northridge men's 
basketball team, and his father Jacques organized a free-throw shooting contest 
during halftime of the Matadors' Feb. 23 game against St. Mary's that raised 
nearly $15,000 for former Matador recruit John Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers, a former Phoenix (Ariz.) College standout, was involved in a car 
accident in Kansas City on Aug. 10, 1992, that resulted in the loss of both his 
legs above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSISTENCY WAS HIS GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nadeau of Monroe High cleared 7 feet 2 inches to win the high jump in the 
state track and field championships, but no one could match runner-up Jeremy 
Fischer's feat of clearing 7 feet or more in 10 meets during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, a Camarillo senior who has a personal best of 7-2, cleared 6-10 or 
more in 15 meets as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE TROUBLE 
</P>
<P>
 On the mound or at the plate, Crespi High's Jeff Suppan gave the opposition 
fits and led the Celts to the semifinals of the Southern Section Division I 
baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed senior posted an 11-1 record with an 0.92 earned-run average. 
In 91 innings, he gave up 52 hits, struck out 127 and walked only 14. He also 
had a streak of 42 consecutive innings in which he did not give up a run. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hitter, he batted .480 with 10 doubles, 11 home runs and 51 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 MOST INSPIRATIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Phil Sanson of The Master's College suffered a crushed larynx when he 
dived into the bleachers attempting to stop a ball from going out of bounds in 
a basketball game against Dominican College on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanson, a 6-foot-7 forward, underwent a life-saving tracheotomy and missed the 
remainder of the Mustangs' season. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a number of operations, he regained his ability to speak. JOHN

FAITH BAPTIST'S SHATTERING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments before Faith Baptist High took the floor for its first-round game in 
the Thousand Oaks basketball tournament, Coach Ron Colon turned to his bench, 
sighed and said a bit nervously, "Well, here we go." 
</P>
<P>
 I could sympathize with Colon. His squad of seven players was about to take 
the court against one of the best high school teams in the country -- Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Colon mentioned before the game that he didn't want his team falling victim to 
the myth of Crenshaw. Instead, his team became part of the growing legend. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't the only spectator eager to check out the Cougars. The entire 
Westlake basketball team arrived two hours early for its game. Westlake was 
Crenshaw's likely opponent in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Before fans could even settle down on the bleachers, the Cougars were on their 
way to a lopsided first-round victory. They jumped to a 26-2 lead after four 
minutes, scoring at a pace I'd never seen. After each Crenshaw possession, the 
Westlake players' eyes grew wider and their jaws dropped lower. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the Cougars throw down tomahawk dunks and alley-oops, connect 
on 10 of 17 three-point shots and employ a rugged full-court press, Westlake 
players jokingly contemplated throwing their game against St. Monica, just so 
they wouldn't have to face the Crenshaw juggernaut. I couldn't blame them.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a case of Faith Baptist playing poorly: Except for a few blown 
layups, the Contenders played as well as they could, considering they weren't 
nearly as fast or tall as Crenshaw. The Cougars were simply overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the play that left everyone speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2 minutes 40 seconds remaining in the second quarter and Crenshaw holding 
a 69-22 lead, center Leon Watson dunked the rebound of a shot by teammate 
Reggie McFerrin. In the process, Watson shattered the backboard, and the 
disconnected rim cut into his shoulder blade. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd erupted. The entire Crenshaw team ran onto the court to congratulate 
Watson on his awe-inspiring feat. The Westlake players sagged in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 But seconds later, the blood dripping out of Watson's arm indicated a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, Watson was still bleeding, but was able to move his arm. 
His teammates, slightly shaken, breathed a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just shocked at what happened," Crenshaw forward Kristaan Johnson said 
minutes after the dunk. "I can't put anything into words." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of about 200, like Johnson, sat in stunned silence, partly out of 
concern for Watson, but mostly in sheer shock at what had transpired. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics were called as a precautionary measure, but Watson was able to wave 
to the crowd with the injured shoulder as he was wheeled away. He underwent 
minor surgery and would watch the rest of the tournament from the Crenshaw 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans wandered from the bleachers and gravitated toward the broken backboard. 
Ignoring pleas of tournament officials, fans walked directly underneath the 
backboard and stared upward, as if they didn't believe what they saw and needed 
a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 I was one of those fans. I took special notice of the way the remaining glass 
bent outward, primed to fall at any second.  
</P>
<P>
 Watching a backboard shatter before your eyes isn't something that happens 
every day. My only experience is the highlight reel, an old image of Darryl 
Dawkins before the advent of breakaway rims.  
</P>
<P>
 How rare was this? Johnson's father, former NBA standout Marques Johnson, 
attended the game and said it was the first time he'd seen a backboard break in 
person. Marques Johnson has been around organized basketball for more than 20 
years, including playing in the NBA at the same time as Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Westlake players left the gym, heading back to their own school to play 
their rescheduled first-round game, they could only mutter to themselves about 
what they had seen.  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake won their first-round game and faced Crenshaw in the second round the 
next night. The Warriors lost, 111-65, but I could hardly blame them if they 
were intimidated. But at least no one broke a backboard on them.

HE WOULDN'T LET MOORPARK SETTLE FOR LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first chord was struck in August, when Moorpark High football Coach Rob 
Dearborn confided his deepest fear: He would be run out of town if he didn't 
produce a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 My only thought at the time was that Moorpark must be a retirement community, 
because its football team had last won a championship in 1941. Who could 
remember? 
</P>
<P>
 I gave Moorpark little thought until about five weeks later when Bryan 
Wilkins, a returning All-Golden League running back, withdrew from Littlerock 
High and enrolled at Moorpark. Through the first three weeks of the 1993 
season, Wilkins, a 6-foot, 180-pound junior, was leading the Golden League with 
420 yards rushing and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 A savior had come to spare Dearborn his job, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what eventually happened, but this story wasn't so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Wilkins' transfer was the death of his father, Wesley Wilkins, 
who had succumbed to cancer the previous October. Bryan lived in Littlerock 
with his father and stayed there for nearly a year after his death. Now he was 
moving to Moorpark to live with his mother. He knew nobody in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Many boys facing such circumstances, I figured, would just as soon go off on 
their own and quietly grieve than join a new football team. 
</P>
<P>
 But I knew Wilkins was different the instant I met him for a story about his 
transfer. At 16, he had an understanding about life and death. When it came to 
his father, he had accepted the outcome. He was at peace with it. He was ready 
to move on, but, through football, he would always pay tribute to dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about how much I miss (my father), and every game I play for him," 
Wilkins said. "I'm dedicating everything to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, he was strong and well conditioned -- he already looked like a 
Division I football player. But more impressive was his quietly powerful 
demeanor. Dearborn insisted on sitting in on the interview, monitoring the 
subject matter. However, he seemed to disappear once Wilkins started talking. 
</P>
<P>
 When the interview was over, Wilkins grabbed his helmet and shoulder pads and 
went to practice. Dearborn pulled me aside and unfolded a clipping of a 
newspaper story about another Moorpark player who had previous run-ins with the 
law. Dearborn was concerned about negative press. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a trivial concern at the time, which Dearborn could easily 
remedy by giving the ball to Wilkins 20 times each game, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the Moorpark school board acknowledged that it was 
investigating the football program. After an emotional confrontation between 
board and team members, and after the board failed to find evidence of any 
Southern Section rules violations, the investigation was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dearborn's fear of getting chased out of town seemed to have merit. 
</P>
<P>
 By week eight, his team was 5-1-1 and facing its biggest game in 52 seasons. 
If the Musketeers could beat Nordhoff, the defending Frontier League champion, 
they would take a big step toward winning their first league championship in 
more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I had become part of a growing sideline gallery who questioned 
Dearborn's judgment. Moorpark had used three running backs before Wilkins' 
arrival. It was our opinion that Dearborn should find other positions for those 
boys and start handing the ball to Wilkins, who had rushed for 1,279 yards in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Dearborn appeared bent on keeping players happy. He continued to call on the 
other running backs. This policy continued until halftime of the Nordhoff game. 
Moorpark trailed, 14-0, and Wilkins had only 36 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next 24 minutes were precious. The community would celebrate, the 
coach would get respect and at least one sports writer would get to write the 
story he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dearborn Gives Ball to Wilkins; Wilkins Carries Moorpark to Championship."  
</P>
<P>
 On the first possession of the second half, Wilkins scored on a 27-yard sweep 
on which he hurdled a defensive back at the five-yard line to make the score 
14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter with Moorpark trailing, 21-14, Wilkins burst nine 
yards up the middle for a touchdown, capping a 41-yard drive on which he gained 
every yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Wilkins carried 11 times on a 13-play, 82-yard drive 
that took nearly 7 1/2 minutes. Wilkins couldn't be stopped on sweeps, breaking 
loose for 12, 14 and 21 yards before he swept into the end zone on a four-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins raced to the Moorpark sideline, slid on the grass and pumped his fists 
in front of a screaming crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 A stranger who had rescued a beleaguered football community, Wilkins was 
mobbed after Moorpark's 26-21 victory. He finished with 223 yards and three 
touchdowns in 34 carries. He caught two passes for 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark went on to win the league championship, posted the best record in 
school history (9-2-1) and reach the second round of the Southern Section 
Division IX playoffs. He finished the season with 1,402 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilkins: "I'm just glad to be a part of this."

 Tom Sams carries a gun and a badge, not to mention a video camera. Which is 
precisely where this tale begins. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hard news story, the best stuff sometimes gets left out. All the color, 
as it's called in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the most peculiar story to pass across this computer screen went 
unreported, lost in a series of follow-ups about sanctions and recrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams, a licensed private investigator and a volunteer football coach at 
Kennedy High, videotaped Sylmar in apparent violation of City Section rules 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The inescapable question: What prompted a 6-foot-5, 330-pound adult to hide in 
the ivy at Sylmar with a camera in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Sams isn't exactly a novice sleuth and he relishes playing the role of 
his alter ego. During one undercover assignment a few years ago, he dressed as 
a drifter. Sams instructed his daughter, Stacey, to slide down a muddy hill 
behind his house while wearing his clothes. He sprayed a canister of Pam in his 
hair for that never-seen-soap look. 
</P>
<P>
 Voila! Derelict. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the sidelines are not Sams' only sideline. He sells windows and 
sliding-glass doors by day, but when football season is over, P.I. no longer is 
shorthand for pass interference. He has done background work for a segment of 
"Nightline" and has shot videotape that has appeared on assorted television 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was videotape that put Kennedy's latter-day Sam Spade in hot water. In 
fact, when the defensive coordinator of the Golden Cougars busted the Spartans, 
they wanted Sams spayed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Labor Day, five days before Kennedy was set to face Sylmar in a 
high-profile football opener, Sams received a tip that members of the Spartans' 
coaching staff had been spotted that morning in a Sylmar restaurant. Team 
meetings on Labor Day are forbidden under City rules, and Sams' sizable gut 
told him a gathering was about to transpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams drove past Sylmar High on his way home to Santa Clarita and spotted the 
Spartans' coaching staff on campus. He bolted home in his stealth bomber, an 
Olds 98, and grabbed his high-tech video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got a 16-to-1 zoom lens," Sams said. "It's a good one . . . and it's tax 
deductible." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his return to Sylmar, players were filing into the school weight room. 
Cue video. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture Sams -- whose bushy red beard, dark brown coaching attire and rotund 
build make him look like Friar Tuck -- tucked in the ivy behind the visitors' 
bleachers. Tom Sams is no Tom Thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams bought a copy of the L.A. Times -- bless his investigative heart -- which 
he used on camera to verify the date of the violation. He jumped back behind 
the wheel of his Olds and circled the campus in search of a good vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 He filmed players as they walked in and out of the school gym, lifted weights 
and kicked around a football. He shot tape of coaches' vehicles and their 
license plates, took copious notes and observed the three rules of probity: 
"Document, document, document." 
</P>
<P>
 Over his 2 1/2 hours of surveillance, which produced 26 minutes of tape, Sams 
became fearless. At one point, while filming around the corner of a building, 
he was within 50 feet of the players. Later, he drove into the parking lot 
adjacent to the boys' physical education office. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, while filming from the front seat of his car, he was spotted by a 
Sylmar player, who raced around the corner and out of sight. Sams sped away 
from the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Sams circled the campus, the school gates were locked, a car was 
blocking the driveway he'd exited seconds earlier and members of the Sylmar 
coaching staff were standing around looking for some lunatic with a video 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunatic was down the street, recording the moment on film. 
</P>
<P>
 In detective books, they would term this sort of thing a smoking gun. Armed 
with Sams' tape of the violations, the City athletics department put Sylmar on 
probation for one year and forced the team to forgo two practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his efforts, Sams was hardly given a ticker-tape parade. Kennedy Coach 
Bob Francola was furious that Sams had informed the L.A. Times of the 
videotape's existence -- Francola didn't want to incite the opposition. 
Francola even considered firing his genial assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, ranked ninth in the state, fired back. Coach Jeff Engilman said 
tersely: "Some people should worry about what's in their own back yard." 
Principal Linda Ambro called the tape "laughable." A letter to the editor 
vilified Sams and suggested he keep his big nose and private eye pointed 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I was (ticked)," Sams said. "But the thing that was most disappointing 
was that not one Sylmar parent stepped forward to admit (the team had) been 
cheating." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kennedy scored a moral victory with a 7-7 tie, the episode left a sour 
taste in Sams' mouth . . . for a few weeks, anyway. During the playoffs, Sams 
got wind of a prominent City coach meeting with players on a Sunday, which is 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams says he staked out the coach's house, shadowed him all morning and shot 
more incriminating videotape. Sams planned to unveil the details but changed 
his mind when the team in question was eliminated before reaching the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tape? 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhh," he said, "I threw it away."

FOR BEING UNPROFESSIONAL, SHE GAINED AN EXCLUSIVE REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a lifelong fan of athletes and the games they play, it is often difficult 
for me to separate my work as a reporter from my fascination as a spectator and 
my emotions as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Many sportswriters will tell you that they never get emotionally involved. 
Professionals should remain objective, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, truth be told, I am not one of those professionals -- not yet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I am probably too much a fan of sports and the drama that surrounds the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, I feel myself pulling for the underdog, or perhaps the young athlete 
who has overcome a heart-wrenching obstacle. And sometimes I just plain like a 
kid -- for whatever reason -- and want him or her to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case one evening in March as I watched the boys' basketball teams 
from Monroe and Banning highs play for the City Section 3-A Division 
championship. On this night at the Sports Arena, I was on assignment.  
</P>
<P>
 My heart, however, accompanied me to the game and it was tugging for Monroe, a 
team enjoying a Cinderella season with a 23-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning dominated at the outset of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 All season I had told two of my basketball-loving colleagues how exciting 
Monroe's transition game was -- replete with thrilling alley-oop dunks, 
eye-popping no-look passes and breathtaking one-handed jams. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine then my embarrassment in front of those two co-workers -- who came 
only to watch -- when late in the first quarter the scoreboard showed: Banning 
14, Monroe 0. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as I sat at the press table trying in vain to wipe the egg off my 
face, Monroe rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Kenyatta Niles caught fire and scored 12 of his team's 17 
second-quarter points and the Vikings cut the lead to 32-24 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 It pleased me that Niles was leading the Vikings' charge. 
</P>
<P>
 I had gotten to know him well during the season, discovering an friendly and 
considerate young man. I also became acquainted with his mother, Allison, who 
keeps Monroe's score book and who knows more about basketball than the average 
father.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not difficult for me to like Kenyatta Niles, so it stood to reason I 
was unprofessionally pulling for him and the Vikings when his free throw 
brought Monroe to within one point with 25 seconds remaining. Niles was 
preparing for his second shot. 
</P>
<P>
 And about to unfold was probably the longest 25 seconds of his athletic life. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles, who had made six of his seven previous free throws, missed the chance 
to tie the score when his second shot fell short with 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember thinking, What a bummer. I'll bet he'd like another chance at that 
shot.  
</P>
<P>
 As if by magic, Niles was fouled and was back at the free-throw line for 
another one-and-one with 13 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But his shot bounced in and out of the basket and Banning's Bryan Hill was 
fouled on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 My heart went out for my friend and his missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill also missed on his free-throw attempt and Monroe's Marco Rich grabbed the 
rebound. Rich pushed the ball upcourt and fed Niles for one last try. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles, fearful that time would run out before he could get closer, pulled up 
for a three-point shot from the right side with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But that one also missed, bouncing off the back of the rim and into the hands 
of Banning's Chris Shealy. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was over. And so was my agonizing roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles took a seat at the end of his team's bench, cradling a towel draped over 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty feet away a joyous Banning team was in a dog pile near midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people walked up to Niles and put a consoling hand on his shoulder, 
but he never flinched. It was as if he hoped to disappear underneath that 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, disappear into the locker room before I could track him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside that locker room, I knew there was no way he was going to 
talk to all those reporters after what had happened. All too often in high 
school sports, athletes are so overwhelmed with grief after a big loss, they 
can't form words through their tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Some male reporters ventured into the locker room after Niles. I, a female 
reporter, opted to ask for Niles and wait just outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a bit surprised when he emerged, then walked past four or five other 
reporters and headed toward me. When one of the reporters asked him a question, 
Niles turned and said in a level tone, "I'm out here to talk to Paige. That's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the proudest moments of my career. Niles didn't come out of the 
locker room to talk to a reporter. He came out to talk to someone who sometimes 
gets too emotionally involved in the game -- and the players who play them.

TWENTY IN THE NEWS; ORANGE COUNTY SPORTS SCENE, FROM EVERETT TO MISTRI AND A 
WHOLE LOT IN BETWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some were movers, others were shakers, all of them helped to shape the Orange 
County sports year into what it was, and wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The OC 20 for 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1 Jim Everett -- Is that all there is? Is this how the Anaheim chapter of The 
Next Marino closes, with Everett -- decent fellow, off-the-field do-gooder, 
holder of the key to the city in 1989 -- driven to the sideline, derided as 
scourge of the franchise, down to counting the days until he is mercifully 
tendered his release? And if the Rams do indeed move to Baltimore, will Everett 
be remembered as the reason why -- the quarterback whose collapse caused the 
team to collapse, which in turn caused the fans to stop coming, which gave John 
Shaw the daylight he needed to run an off-tackle across the country? If only 
Ronnie Lott hadn't tracked down that long, high lob, with Flipper Anderson in 
the clear . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2 Baltimore -- Get your grubby paws off our football team. We can't be 
distracted while we're devising ways to get our grubby paws on the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3 The Autrys -- If they are truly getting ready to sell the team, their 
decision to carve the payroll, to attract prospective buyers, can be tolerated 
-- even encouraged. The sooner the better. If not, the past two years are 
unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4 Jerome Bettis -- What's this? A Ram running back who doesn't fumble, who 
contends for league rushing titles, who is Pro Bowl worthy -- and likable to 
boot? Just our luck; by 1995, he'll be leading Baltimore to the NFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5 Tim Salmon -- Bettis, Salmon, the Mighty Ducks -- it was the year of the 
rookie in Anaheim in 1993. Salmon became the first Angel to win the American 
League rookie of the year award, achieving something Wally Joyner, Devon White, 
Jim Abbott and Bryan Harvey couldn't. Look where that got them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6 Darryl Henley -- The charges leading to his indictment for alleged cocaine 
trafficking made up the ugliest story of 1993. No Ram had a worse year than 
Henley, whose once-promising career as a defensive back could be shut down for 
good when his case goes to trial next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7-8 J.T. Snow and T.J. Rubley -- J.T. and T.J., the rookie first baseman and 
the rookie quarterback, linked by initials, work address and work habits. Who 
was the real J.T.? The second coming of Don Mattingly in April and September? 
Or the second coming of Lee Stevens in between? Who was the real T.J.? A reason 
to believe, given his two swashbuckling relief outings? Or a reason to draft 
Heath Shuler, given his transgressions in six appearances as a starter? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9 Ron Wilson -- Traditionally, expansion hockey coaches exhibit a shorter 
shelf life than a can of fruit cocktail. Traditionally, expansion hockey 
coaches are out of playoff contention by Halloween. Forty games into his Mighty 
Ducks' first season, Wilson is showing himself to be no traditionalist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10-11 Guy Hebert and Ron Tugnutt -- Hebert was the first Mighty Duck chosen in 
the expansion draft, Tugnutt was the first Mighty Duck to predict a playoff 
berth in 1994. Our immediate reaction: "Poor Hebert, he's so unfortunate." 
"Poor Tugnutt, he's got a loose lug nut." Three months into the inaugural 
season, they are reasons 1A and 1B as to why the Ducks have stopped the 
laughing. Their goaltending has kept the Ducks in enough games to make most of 
them worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 12 Chuck Knox -- One step forward in '92, two steps back in '93. For the first 
time in his 20-year head coaching career, the Knox touch hasn't taken, and 
these Rams, incredibly, will end their season in worse condition than the 
nightmare Rams of '91, regardless of won-loss record. Back then, at least, the 
Rams knew who their quarterback was going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 13 Chili Davis -- The designated hitter who came in from the cold and drove in 
a career-high 112 runs. Where would the Angels have been without Chili and 
Salmon? Starving, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 14 Ex-Angels On Parade -- Dave Winfield collects the 3,000th hit of his career 
. . . as a Minnesota Twin. Devon White wins his second consecutive World Series 
. . . as a Toronto Blue Jay. Jim Abbott pitches his first no-hitter . . . as a 
New York Yankee. Bryan Harvey saves 45 games . . . as a Florida Marlin. That's 
right, rub it in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 15 Luis Polonia -- Standing on the on-deck circle. Upcoming New York Daily 
News headline, slated for November 1994: Polonia Adds Gold Glove To World 
Series MVP Trophy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 16 Jack Ferreira -- General manager of the clearest-thinking, most competent 
sports front office in Orange County. Faint praise, I know, but you get the 
point. Some days, Ferreira must feel like the proverbial parched sailor on the 
ocean life raft -- all this Disney money around him and none of it his to 
spend. With a skinflint budget, Ferreira and his assistant, Pierre Gauthier, 
pieced together as good a roster as could be expected, then hired the right 
coach to wring the most out of it. Trading a third-round draft choice for Todd 
Ewen and Patrik Carnback was another stroke. Saying no to Jimmy Carson was 
another still. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 17 Reggie Jackson -- It isn't every day an Angel makes the Hall of Fame. Now, 
who will be the first to go in wearing the cap and togs of the Angels? Reggie 
went in as a Yankee. Next, Don Sutton, maybe, as a Dodger. Down the road: Nolan 
Ryan, as a Ranger . . . Winfield, as a Yankee or Padre . . . Harvey, as a 
Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 18 Todd Marinovich -- From Starting Raider Quarterback in 1992 to . . . where 
? Someone put a letter in a bottle and send it floating today. Write: "Dear 
Todd, The NFL just added new teams in Carolina and Jacksonville. Established 
teams down to starting Bubby Brister, Rich Gannon, Steve DeBerg, Wade Wilson, 
David Klinger and T.J. Rubley. Phone home. Job waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 19 John Robinson -- The old Ram coach returned to coaching, returned to USC 
and returned to Anaheim Stadium, twice, where he lost to North Carolina in the 
Pigskin Classic and held off Utah in the Freedom Bowl. That Freedom Bowl ended 
an 0-6 streak for Robinson in Anaheim, where he hadn't won since Oct. 13, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 20 Al Mistri -- His Cal State Fullerton soccer team was a mystery, all right, 
until the Titans upset Fresno State, San Diego and San Francisco -- all on the 
road -- to reach the NCAA semifinals, where they lost, admirably, to South 
Carolina, 1-0, in the semifinals. Mistri did it all, too, on $7,500 and a pat 
on the back. In the Year of the Shoestring in Orange County, no one made better 
use of his than Mistri. MIKE PENNER

A LOVE ETCHED IN STONE; INJURED MAN STRANDED IN CANYON CARVES MESSAGE TO WIFE 
ON BOULDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the 12 hours that he was stuck in Laguna Canyon with a broken leg, the one 
thought that constantly crossed Daniel Songster's mind was how much he loved 
his wife, Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 He also thought that she would not like it if he died. So just in case the 
worst happened, and he didn't get a chance to see her again, the 43-year-old 
Lake Forest man used a small, sharp rock to carve a heart on a boulder. Then, 
in awkward block letters, he scrawled: "Elizabeth, I love you!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it so she'd know that I was thinking about her in case something bad 
happened," said Songster, recovering on his hospital bed at South Coast Medical 
Center. "And I'm glad I did it because now, she'll always know that I love 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Songster had surgery on his broken leg and was released from the hospital 
Thursday. For the next two weeks, he will continue physical therapy at his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Songster's ordeal occurred Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, he had gone to Canyon Acres with a friend, Mike Lindsey, to see 
what vegetation had regrown on the barren hills that had been scorched by the 
fires in October. The two men, both groundskeepers for the California Native 
Garden at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, often explored the hills 
together in their spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of heading home after he and Lindsey parted, Songster -- on an impulse 
-- decided to head up Laguna Canyon to see what plants he could find in the 
area. He hiked up the canyon a couple of miles and took pictures of shrubbery, 
flowers and ferns that had sprouted on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Songster began to head back, he stepped on a water-soaked slope that 
gave way. After tumbling and bouncing his way through trees down a 35-foot 
cliff, he finally landed on a ledge, with his left leg out of joint at the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "My left leg was crossed (atop) my right leg at an angle it shouldn't have," 
he said ruefully while Elizabeth Songster cried softly nearby, reliving her 
husband's nightmare once more. "I waited until my head was cleared and begin to 
think of ways to get down the canyon. Once I realized no one really knew I was 
up there, I knew it was up to me to get myself back down." 
</P>
<P>
 But before he began, Songster looked around, found a rock and carved the 
message he hoped his wife would eventually find. 
</P>
<P>
 He then began his difficult 12-hour trip to safety. He braced his broken leg 
with the other so it would not move. He put his weight on his hands and inched 
down the soot-stained canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, Songster kept thinking about Elizabeth. Every once in a while, he 
thought of having a cellular phone to let her know where he was and that he was 
fine. And he would ask her to take him a ham and cheese sandwich because he 
hadn't eaten all day. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun crept behind the horizon and the temperatures dropped into the 40s, 
Songster said, it took all of his willpower to continue down the canyon. Often, 
he would stop to rest and yell for help, hearing only his own echo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was getting harder to go on every time he stopped, Songster recalled. "I 
knew I had to keep moving, because if I didn't, if I fell and lost 
consciousness, I would die." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Songster reached the bottom of the canyon, a spot he recognized 
because it was marked by the three oak trees he had seen that morning. He was 
too tired to move on. Once more, he cupped his hands to his mouth and bellowed, 
"Help!" 
</P>
<P>
 This time, a voice he recognized answered: "Dan, is that you? Dan, I hear 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was the voice of his stepson, Jeb. Help had finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Notified by Elizabeth Songster earlier that night, Mike Lindsey reported to 
police that Dan Songster was lost in the canyon. Lindsey, Elizabeth Songster 
and her family joined paramedics and police in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been praying all night, and I tried to remain calm," Elizabeth Songster 
said Thursday when her husband finished his tale. "When I heard my son say that 
he could hear (Dan), that's when I fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was told of the inscription on the rock, Elizabeth Songster wept 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'How could you even take one minute from saving yourself to do 
something like that?' " she said. "Not only was it a wonderful act, it was so 
romantic."

DANA PARSONS: DISCOVER THE JOYS OF AN INTIMATE, LOST ART: LETTER WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Dana Parsons' column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why don't we all resolve to write more letters this year? 
</P>
<P>
 Done with care, they can be the most intimate form of communication. Better 
than speech, because you often write things you might not say aloud. Better 
than the phone, because taking the time to write tells someone you're exerting 
effort in their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had one great correspondent in my life, Bert Marshall, a guy I've known 
since we were 13 years old in Weeping Water, Neb., where my father was school 
superintendent. Our family left two years later, but Bert and I reunited 
briefly during college only to go our separate ways in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 We still write, but we're down to once a year, at best. What a comedown from 
the days when getting a letter from him would instantly brighten me, if only 
because he's the funniest guy I've ever known and because we have a storehouse 
of sophomoric inside jokes and shticks that we (and only we) still find 
hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 I regret not keeping every letter Bert wrote, but, luckily, a few have 
survived. To get myself in the mood for my New Year's resolution, I browsed 
through them again this weekend for the first time in many a moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was one of his missives from 1976, postmarked Waitsfield, Vt.: "I 
fervently hope that someday you'll acquire a sheep, so that you too will feel 
the elation and inner joy that I have experienced since owning my own goats. 
The rewards are many: they are gentle, intelligent, friendly and almost 
pet-like, and they excrete far less manure than your average cow or buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 I must have mentioned to him in a previous letter that romance was blooming: 
"And then, of course, there is the topic of matrimony, which we all know and 
fear. I sense an intimate relationship developing there, as the signature on 
your Christmas card was obviously forged. That's one of the first sure signs of 
impending union, when the prospective spouse starts signing the greeting 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to say, "I am prepared, of course, to serve as best man. A lesser 
position I would be forced to refuse. I will require a suit of the finest 
garment, a glass of water, and my name printed in all caps wherever it appears 
in the service bulletin, and in all newspaper accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 This one from West Hartford, Vt. in February of 1975: "I recently secured 
employment as a farm person, although I would have preferred becoming a 
psalmist. The farming profession has many distinctive features, not the least 
of which is manure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manure, as you may know, is a putrid substance generally attributed to 
animals, pests, and other species. . . . Among my many duties on the farm, I am 
chief assistant in charge of manure maintenance. I constantly shovel it, scrape 
it, pitchfork it, spread it, step in it and wear it in my navel. For this I 
receive a modest hourly wage." 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1974, he wrote to say: "Yes, I have taken a bride. Unfortunately, the 
judge thought I had said 'bribe' and immediately turned me over to the House 
Judiciary Committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently down on his luck in San Francisco in 1973, he lamented: "It seems 
that no one in this fair city wishes to have me in their employ. I have tried 
to be honest with all prospective employers by telling them straight-out my 
main goal in life is to become an idiot, but it is becoming quite clear to me 
that there is no place for honesty in this country these days; neither is there 
any great demand for idiots, as there seems to be an adequate supply." 
</P>
<P>
 From Christmas, 1973: "I am happy to hear that you are getting into the 
holiday spirit. What a fine decision on your part. . . . Woody Allen's new film 
'Sleeper' opens here this Friday and I shall be there with pad and pencil in 
hand. When I first moved here, 'Play It Again, Sam' was at a theater nearby and 
I attended four showings in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 He last wrote me about a year ago, just after my dad died. "My mother called 
last Saturday night with the news of Bud's passing. After talking to her, I 
went out onto the porch and stared off across the yard, past the big apple 
tree, expecting, well, I'm not sure what I was expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was that I quickly become overwhelmed with a profound sense of 
nostalgia. My memories of your days in Weeping Water are among the most vivid 
of my high school years and they came flooding back there on my porch. I saw 
your dad in the classroom and in the halls, at sporting events, in the old 
office, and I recalled again what a powerful positive influence he had on all 
of us. He was always the consummate educator, involved, caring, dynamic. . . . 
I lingered on the porch long enough to let the full force of our shared 
experience wash over me all over again and, having reaffirmed that it was good, 
I went back inside, saddened but renewed and somehow strengthened." 
</P>
<P>
 Letter writing, my friends. 
</P>
<P>
 May you, like me, make an effort to reacquaint yourselves with its unique 
capacity to keep us all human.

CHILD-SUPPORT OFFICES LOSING PUBLIC SUPPORT; BUREAUCRACY: AGENCIES TREAT PAYING 
PARENTS LIKE CRIMINALS BUT FAIL TO COLLECT FROM 'DEADBEAT DADS,' CRITICS SAY. 
OFFICIALS BLAME A SHARP INCREASE IN CASELOADS BUT ADMIT CHANGES MAY BE 
NECESSARY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Riley considers himself a good citizen and a solid father. But lately, the 
Foothill Ranch man says he has been getting treatment best reserved for some 
deadbeat dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley charges that mistakes by the Orange County agency that collects 
child-support payments have left a "black mark" on his credit report and a lien 
on his house even though he has kept up with payments to his two children. 
</P>
<P>
 An angered Riley has written scores of letters complaining to county and state 
officials. He's even asked the Orange County Grand Jury to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to scream bloody murder," Riley groused. "What they're doing is an 
abuse of power. They're like a gang of Keystone Kops down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the state, disgruntled parents such as Riley have grown 
increasingly vocal in their criticism of the patchwork of offices that handle 
the difficult job of collecting child-support payments in California's 58 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend the agencies are unresponsive and sometimes make dramatic 
mistakes in calculating child-support payments. And since the agencies have 
prosecutorial powers from district attorney's offices, law-abiding parents have 
sometimes found themselves being treated like Public Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every father who goes into the Family Support Division to try to prove 
they made the payments, to try to work it out, is treated worse than the common 
criminal," said Marv Chapman, vice president for United Fathers of America. 
"It's out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Even normally quarrelsome opponents in child-support cases -- which most often 
pit custodial mothers against non-custodial fathers -- find common ground on 
the issue of shoddy government performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups complain that when there are deadbeat dads, the child-support 
programs have been ineffective at cracking down on the offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many are calling for a complete overhaul of the system, including 
a suggestion to shift the responsibility for child-support programs from county 
government to the state welfare offices or federal tax authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is ready to dump the county offices that currently run the 
child-support show. Boosters say many of the problems are isolated issues that 
have been unfairly portrayed as a systemwide failure. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend the glitches stem from the vast proliferation of child-support 
cases, which have more than doubled statewide in the past five years. In Orange 
County, the number of child-support cases handled by the Family Support 
Division has skyrocketed from about 40,000 to almost 100,000 since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising numbers have come in part because the state in recent years has 
dramatically boosted the child-support payments required from most 
non-custodial parents, making it tougher for some to keep up with the monthly 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Frye, chief of the state's Office of Child Support, sees room for 
improvement within the current arrangement, but cautions against going too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are acutely aware of the need to make the system more responsive and 
accessible," Frye said. "But the nature of the issues we deal with -- love and 
hate, power and money -- means there will always be people unhappy with the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others also say the system must be vigorous in collecting 
child-support payments because they go a long way toward keeping single mothers 
and their children -- the fastest growing poverty group in the nation -- off of 
the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the cases handled by the family-support offices are parents on 
welfare. In addition, child-support officials grapple with a ballooning number 
of cases involving financially strapped mothers and unidentified fathers. There 
were more than 70,000 such cases in California last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, the agencies also must undertake collection duties requested by any 
parent who claims support isn't being paid. But many parents don't find it 
necessary to seek out such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state's Family Support Divisions handled more than 1.8 million 
problem cases last year, authorities said a roughly equal number involved 
parents who willingly paid child support under agreements negotiated with their 
spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 For many parents targeted by the county authorities, the tactics employed by 
the Family Support Divisions come as a shock. They lament the ignominy of 
attacking their wages, the sullied credit reports and the looming liens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep getting letters from people who are trying to refinance their houses 
to get more money to make their child-support payments, but they can't because 
of these liens," said Mikki Bako Sorensen, counsel to the Assembly Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are a lot of jerks out there not paying their support, but when 
someone is making an effort, you've got to give them a break and give them a 
chance to be economically viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Keith Thompson. Thompson lives in Lake Forest with his 
second family. Two of his children from a previous marriage live in Idaho with 
his ex-wife. When Thompson's support was raised 400% last March, his ex-wife 
took pity and agreed to accept a lesser payment. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities in Idaho and Orange County haven't been able to straighten it 
out. Thompson's paycheck is still getting docked by Orange County, even though 
his ex-wife hasn't received a support check from the county since August. The 
strapped former spouse, meanwhile, has now demanded that Thompson send money to 
keep her afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet, Thompson has been working 60 to 80 hours a week on his job 
at a power plant. "We're maxed out," said Thompson's wife, Dianna. "We're going 
under, under, under." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, there's the matter of interest payments. The federal government 
has ordered all counties to begin charging "retroactive interest" on overdue 
payments. In some cases, the interest was charged on delinquent accounts that 
were paid off years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some absent parents have been surprised by huge bills -- some 
exceeding $10,000 -- for interest they never fathomed they would owe. They 
complain that it is as if the rules were changed at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's rights groups have their own complaints. While agreeing with the 
fathers that Family Support Divisions are not performing well, they say the 
agencies need to do a better job of tapping support payments from deadbeat 
dads. Many women are forced to play detective and track down the assets of a 
spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Leora Gershenzon, an attorney with Legal Services of Northern California, says 
the child-support agencies are unfriendly fortresses too riddled with middle 
managers instead of caseworkers. She also suggests the independent agencies run 
by each county cost taxpayers more than would a unified statewide program. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Gershenzon has been pushing a bill introduced last year by state 
Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood) to incorporate the county child-support 
offices into a single state agency. The bill has been stalled in a legislative 
committee, but other legislation is also being discussed to make the system 
more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, boosters of the system say many of the county family support 
agencies are already trying to put a better face forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the raps you've heard, I'd say the district attorneys in 
California are doing at least a B-plus job," said Wayne D. Doss, chief of the 
Los Angeles County child-support division and president of the National Child 
Support Enforcement Organization. "We face a dichotomy of expectations: On the 
one hand we're expected to be efficient and cost-effective, and at the same 
time we're criticized because we're not as soft and warm and cuddly as people 
would like us to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts from around the state have been meeting to map out an 
agenda for changes to improve the system, ideas they hope will eventually be 
embraced by the Legislature. Meanwhile, a new automated statewide system will 
soon be handling mundane billing and paperwork chores, allowing caseworkers to 
focus more on the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, a study by the Price Waterhouse accounting firm is expected 
to yield several suggested changes when it's released early next year, 
including some designed to improve the office's relationship with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 While mistakes occur, they can often be traced directly back to the parents, 
whose idea of record-keeping may be "a few receipts in a shoe box," Doss said. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, the two parties in a child-support dispute will tote 
vastly different claims. It is, Orange County child-support chief Jan Sturla 
said, "kind of like trying to referee at the Alamo." 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about liens are unflinchingly common. Sturla, for one, suggests the 
issue has been overblown. He regularly gets calls from lending institutions 
checking on loan applicants, and those who don't owe back support are quickly 
given the green light, Sturla said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for parents who yelp about authorities running roughshod over their credit 
report, the child-support officials have little sympathy. Such matters, they 
reason, are no different than missing payment on a credit card -- if you owe, 
you owe. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the new computer system promises better billing in counties that 
currently don't issue monthly statements, keeping parents better abreast of 
their child-support obligation. "If Macy's didn't send me a bill each month," 
state chief Frye noted, "I'd be surprised to see how large it is at the end of 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
 While the program has room for improvement, it has done much -- warts and all 
-- to help children, Frye said. "I think we've always got to look to this 
fundamental issue of whether a child has an absolute right for support," Frye 
said. "I know having a large debt is a daunting thing, but I keep thinking: 
What about the children?" Support System 
</P>
<P>
 Child support is a growth industry in Orange County. From 1989 to 1993, a 
variety of indicators increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of cases has more than doubled, while the percentage of families 
receiving welfare payments jumped by about one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases (In thousands): 99,000 
</P>
<P>
 Percent on welfare: 54% 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of people working in the county district attorney's Family 
Support Division, including attorneys, increased by about 50%, as did the 
average number of cases handled by caseworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Support division staffing: 327 
</P>
<P>
 Average cases per caseworker: 1,319 
</P>
<P>
 * The amount of child support collected rose slightly more than 50%. In 
millions of dollars:

A LOOK AHEAD: OLD TROUBLES PERSIST, NEW OPPORTUNITIES AWAIT; BOLD FORECAST FOR 
'94? IT'LL BE 365 DAYS LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By this time next year in Orange County, this much will be clear: traffic will 
be worse; two new faces will be found on the county's Board of Supervisors; 
government still won't have the wherewithal to adequately handle the homeless 
and confront crime; and the debate will continue to rage over welfare and 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly bold predictions, but pretty safe to say. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, 1994 will look a lot like 1993, with some minor adjustments for 
better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy still has a long way to go, but few are willing to predict how 
much better or worse it may get. The focus on school choice is likely to 
intensify, following the defeat of Proposition 174 last year, but is unlikely 
to be resolved. And somewhere, among all that freeway construction, lies a 
blueprint for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, county Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder will 
say goodby after a collective 36 years in office. Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) wonders whether reelection or a radio talk show better fits 
into his future plans. And in November, there could be a three-way race for 
mayor in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weary world of transportation, dollar-juggling will keep the Interstate 
5 widening on schedule, probably at the expense of other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and builders will continue to clash over how much wetland 
and coastal sage scrub areas should be saved when development occurs. And 
development will definitely be occurring at three colleges -- UC Irvine, Cal 
State Fullerton and Orange Coast College -- as all will unveil some impressive 
new buildings this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown on what is happening this year in the areas of medicine, 
county and city governments, the environment, transportation, higher and lower 
education, social services and politics. The Environment 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, 1994 may shape up as the year of habitat preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development of Bolsa Chica -- a 1,700-acre area fronting Pacific 
Coast Highway in Huntington Beach -- is expected to take some major steps this 
year, but not without a concession to preserve the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move opposed by many environmentalists, the Koll Real Estate Group is 
planning a 4,884-home development at the site which, the company says, would 
include large portions of restored wetland. Environmentalists want the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands restored or at least left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A recommended compromise by the county includes more open space and less 
development. Whatever happens, any development is still at least a year away. 
</P>
<P>
 During the year, the county will be identifying specific "habitat areas" all 
over Orange County along with plans to manage them. While the plans were fueled 
by the federal requirement to save the endangered California gnatcatcher, they 
also will benefit such other rare species as the cactus wren, orange throated 
whiptail lizard and various plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiding in the effort is a sophisticated new computer system that, after three 
years of development, is expected to be fully implemented in 1994. Called the 
Wildlife Geographic Information System, the program will be able to map 
vegetation, slope, topography, water features and the actual location of major 
animal species in threatened open areas. Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher economic times and mergers are in the offing for Orange County 
hospitals in 1994, and all health care providers will be struggling to fit into 
whatever health care plan is adopted by Congress, local health care leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, like the rest of Southern California, already has taken a 
leadership position in the move toward medical cost containment with a major 
shift over the last decade to prepaid managed care insurance programs, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the county's huge Medi-Cal system will get ready to shift from a 
traditional fee-for-service program to prepaid managed care, which will begin 
in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors and administrator of the new Medi-Cal program, called 
OPTIMA, will have a year to develop a medical care delivery system. It will be 
their job to contract with physician groups, hospitals, community clinics and 
other providers who will treat Medi-Cal patients for a pre-agreed monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
 To make themselves attractive to OPTIMA and other contracting organizations, 
health care providers such as hospitals, doctors and home health care agencies, 
are expected to consolidate or form marketing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Health System, the parent organization for St. Joseph Hospital in 
Orange, recently said it is negotiating a possible acquisition of Mission 
Regional Hospital Medical Center in Mission Viejo, and still more hospital 
mergers are predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will see a continued consolidation of health care providers and a 
lot of bridges built between organizations that were competitors in the past," 
said Gordon Martin, president and chief executive officer of the Visiting 
Nurses Assn. of Orange County. Social Services 
</P>
<P>
 With the fastest-growing caseload in the state and proposed federal reforms on 
the horizon, welfare-related issues will be the key concern for social services 
agencies in Orange County. "In the area of welfare reform we anticipate next 
year to be a year of major proposals from the President to the governor," said 
Larry Leaman, director of the Orange County Social Services Agency. "A lot of 
times, neat-sounding ideas turn out to be nightmares when you try to implement 
them. " 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County welfare cases have increased 106% in the past five years. The 
increase has been attributed to a combination of aerospace layoffs, the long 
recession and an influx of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of the caseload is a result of immigration and the most dramatic 
increase is in the area of child welfare, usually in the form of payments made 
to undocumented immigrants with children born in the United States. There are 
9,000 such children in the county, social services workers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials will be seeking to expand the Greater Avenues for 
Independence (GAIN) program -- a work program for people who receive Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a state grant, officials expect to serve twice as many 
clients as last year. According to Leaman, the program placed 2,000 employees 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAIN program assesses the skills of welfare parents and helps them receive 
the training that they need to find jobs. Lower Education 
</P>
<P>
 Though Proposition 174, the school voucher initiative, was overwhelmingly 
defeated statewide and in Orange County in November, educators expect the 
fallout of that election to dominate the debate in local school districts in 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they voted against the initiative, Orange County residents voiced a 
desire for increased choice and more accountability in public schools. Now the 
challenge is to improve the schools and give parents more power over their 
children's education before another voucher plan is introduced, teachers and 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the agenda is the question of school safety, but educators 
believe the programs they have in place -- strict anti-gang dress codes, 
prevention programs and curricula and zero-tolerance policies for weapons 
possession -- are the best tools to fight the rising violence among youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 174 "showed faith in public schools, in public education, but we 
have to respond by continuing to improve," said John Dean, superintendent of 
the Orange County Department of Education. "We know that most people like their 
schools. Now we have to examine every aspect of our educational program to make 
sure we're meeting the needs of all kinds of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Several districts plan to focus on vocational training and individualized 
programs for students who are not the most advanced academically. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified, the sprawling South County district, will unveil a 
school-choice plan to allow parents to choose from a smorgasbord of educational 
options. At the elementary level, there will be a co-op school, a performing 
arts program, and magnet schools for math and science; each high school will 
have within it an "academy" in which students can learn about professions such 
as medicine or cooking. Higher Education 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recession, some major new buildings are scheduled to be completed 
during the new year at colleges and universities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine expects its Science Library to open in May. The six-story, 
131,000-square-foot library building cost $32 million and dominates a hill on 
the west side of UCI's campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, in May, UCI plans to open its Engineering II structure. The 
132,000-square-foot building, which cost $34 million, will have space for 
classes, research labs and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Cal State Fullerton will open two new major structures: the 
$26-million Science Laboratory Center and the $14.4-million University Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cal State Fullerton plans to break ground in February on a 
four-story addition to its existing library. Another major project scheduled to 
start sometime in 1994 is a $10-million upgrading of the university's 
telecommunications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast College, a community college in Costa Mesa, is scheduled to open 
its $8.5-million Vocational Technology Building in May. The two-story, 
78,000-square-foot building will be the largest on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago College's campus in Santa Ana is scheduled to start 
construction on April 1 on a $13-million, 46,000-square-foot Computer High-Tech 
Center. City Government 
</P>
<P>
 Bedeviled by dwindling finances and plagued with increasing gang problems, 
cities throughout the county are focusing on economic development and crime 
prevention as they enter 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities will be trying to broaden their revenue bases and climb out of a 
recession that has gripped local governments and forced significant cuts in 
personnel and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials, for example, hope to work with the Walt Disney Co. to bring 
a massive $3-billion Disneyland expansion project to the city that promises to 
inject not only Anaheim, but the entire county with thousands of jobs and other 
economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim also is using redevelopment projects to revitalize blighted areas. 
Among other challenges facing the county's second most populous city are: 
increasing the number of police officers, and working with the Los Angeles Rams 
to keep the team in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, officials say they will pay renewed attention to issues of 
overcrowding, crime and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 A new city jail and police headquarters are slated for the city next year, 
said Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters. Proposals for the jail -- which 
would likely require a utility tax hike of 1% or more to fund -- are scheduled 
to go before the City Council in February, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet M. Huston with the League of California Cities said the nonprofit group 
has identified goals for cities for the next year, including the restructuring 
of government and attracting new businesses. County Government 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County government faces a year of transition as two veteran supervisors 
prepare for retirement and a third fights to keep his gubernatorial 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Thomas F. Riley will leave office and 
Supervisor William G. Steiner, appointed to fill the term of former Supervisor 
Don R. Roth, is girding for a possible challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, the first woman to join the board, has been promoting the candidacy of 
Huntington Beach businesswoman Haydee Tillotson. Wieder appointed Tillotson to 
the Orange County Planning Commission, a position she resigned after only three 
months to devote more time to campaigning in the North and Central county.  
</P>
<P>
 While she has Wieder's blessing, Tillotson will have plenty of competition. 
Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva and Councilwoman Linda 
Moulton-Patterson also are in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, meanwhile, is strongly supporting state Sen. Marian Bergeson as 
successor to the sprawling South County district that he has represented since 
1974.  
</P>
<P>
 As yet, no other candidates have stepped forward in South County, but San Juan 
Capistrano City Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer has been considering a run, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Already ensnarled in controversy over future conversion of El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, the board is expected to spend much of this election year 
grappling with yet another budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Orange County officials have eliminated 1,800 
positions. The personnel and service cuts have been required to offset the 
transfer of local property tax revenue to fund the California public school 
system. Transportation 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, at some time, virtually every freeway in Orange County will 
experience traffic delays in 1994 due to construction. And that's the good 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that some projects -- not yet identified -- may be postponed 
slightly in order to preserve the construction schedule for the financially 
strapped widening of the Santa Ana Freeway, a massive $1.9-billion face lift to 
Orange County's true "Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
 With some portions already finished, the northernmost segments won't be 
completed at least until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 And construction continues with the ongoing reconstruction of the junction of 
the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways, the infamous El Toro "Y." When finished 
in mid-1996, the junction will become the world's largest interchange -- 26 
lanes wide at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction also will start mid-year on car-pool lanes on I-5 between San 
Juan Capistrano and the "Y" and on the Riverside Freeway, including car-pool 
lanes and the state's first privately operated toll lanes in the median. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials hope to resolve all remaining legal disputes that have 
barred construction on sections of the San Joaquin Hills toll road, while 
environmentalists are counting on a federal judge to reject the $1.1-billion 
project's environmental impact review as inadequate. A hearing is scheduled for 
this month. If ordered, redoing the environmental documentation could take a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vast majority of commuters still will rely on the automobile, 
1994 may mark a subtle shift toward mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 In late March, two to three new MetroLink commuter trains per day will be 
added to the schedule between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles, where one 
train now makes a single round trip daily. That's in addition to the nine 
Amtrak trains that already make round trips between San Diego and Los Angeles, 
with some stops in Orange County. Politics 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County politics has developed the same reputation as Southern 
California's weather: it's predictable. Each election year, the chances that 
Republican incumbents will hold onto their offices are at least as certain as 
those of blue skies over the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year is no different. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 17 state and federal districts that represent Orange County 
probably will see spirited contests for the June primary and November general 
election. But the incumbents seeking reelection go into the year once again as 
favorites to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception to the rule in Orange County is likely to be the central core 
surrounding Santa Ana and Garden Grove. It is a predominantly Democratic area 
that usually votes Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In this election, the area is even more volatile because Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Republican Rep. Dornan have both indicated they may 
not seek reelection (Umberg is exploring a statewide campaign to unseat 
Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and Dornan is considering a challenge to 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein or a 1996 bid for the White House). 
</P>
<P>
 A host of ambitious political climbers already have expressed interest in both 
seats, including some influential leaders who could portend a heated campaign 
if the seats are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Dan Young said he is considering both seats. County Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton has expressed interest in the congressional office, as has 
Dornan's former chief of staff, Brian Bennett. Democrat Mike Farber, a San 
Diego County businessman, already has opened a campaign headquarters to 
challenge Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the incumbents seek reelection, however, most observers believe they would 
be tough to beat. Both promised to announce their decisions early in the new 
year.

BODY OF MAN, APPARENT SUICIDE, FOUND IN NEWPORT BEACH STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police sealed off a neighborhood and searched the area Saturday morning after 
the body of a man with a gunshot wound to the head was found in the street by a 
passing motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspect was found, and by Saturday afternoon police said they were 
investigating the case as a probable suicide. They said, however, that foul 
play had not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the body of the unidentified man, described as being in his 40s, 
near the curb about 8:30 a.m., with a trail of blood leading to a house in the 
3200 block of Clay Street. The door to the house was open, so the responding 
officer called for help to search for a possible murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Police evacuated a one-block area and SWAT team members were called to enter 
the house. By noon, the area was declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Paul Henisey said search teams found a rifle inside the home that 
is believed to be the weapon that killed the man with a shot to the head. They 
also found "indications that this was an apparent suicide." Henisey did not 
elaborate on the evidence, but he said there was no suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
 "The indications are suicide and that's the line of investigation that they're 
following," Henisey said. "However, because the circumstances are unusual, they 
haven't completely ruled out that maybe there was somebody else involved in 
some way, shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
 Henisey said officers responded to a call of an attempted suicide at the same 
home on Tuesday. When they arrived, however, they found the resident watching 
television and claiming he was fine. Henisey said police are investigating 
whether the victim is the same man who talked to officers last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henisey said the evidence indicates that the man was wounded inside the home 
and that he subsequently walked about the house before he staggered outside and 
died in the street. Police said they believe the death occurred between 7 and 
8:30 a.m., when the body was found by a passing motorist.

AT 90, SANTA ANA WOMAN STILL TAKES TIME TO SEE ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just another day in the sun watching the passing parade for 
90-year-old Margarete Stillwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Tournament of Roses Parade marked the 30th year in a row that 
Stillwell, of Santa Ana, has made it to Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parade today was wonderful," Stillwell said afterward. "Of all the 
parades I've seen, I liked this one the best." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, then added: "But every year I say the same thing. Each year it 
seems to be bigger and better." 
</P>
<P>
 As has been the case for decades, Stillwell was accompanied by her daughter, 
Nancy Turecek, of Mission Beach in San Diego, and two of Turecek's former 
college roommates. The undeterred nonagenarian set out from her home about 4:30 
a.m. to rendezvous with her daughter's friends in Pasadena, where they walked 
four blocks to find seats along the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 The early hour and exercise didn't seem to bother Stillwell, whose first trip 
to the Rose Parade was in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person is as old as you feel," she said. "I don't feel 90." She allowed, 
however, that "sometimes I feel 50 or 60 -- I'll be honest with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell said she doesn't travel quite as often as she used to, but she still 
manages to visit the coastline in season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go down to the beach in the summertime," Stillwell said. "I go in the ocean 
and in the bay swimming." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not too many old people going swimming in the ocean or the bay 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell has found nothing to match Pasadena's annual parade of roses. "I 
like the bands," Stillwell said. "I'm up in years, and I like to see the young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun watching the people. Some are running, some are walking looking for 
a place" to view the parade. "Everybody has a very excited look on their face, 
because they will see something great." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell is helping pass on the tradition, having years ago introduced the 
parade to her granddaughter, Anna Turecek, 15, who was along for the event 
again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had ringside seats -- the premier seats," said Deanna Passchier, one of 
Stillwell's daughter's roommates at the University of Redlands in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 The group normally sits near the beginning of the parade, said Caroline 
Vassallo, the other former college chum at whose Pasadena home the women gather 
before walking to Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Vassallo even has a memento of the event in her back yard -- the metal frame 
of a tree once covered with flowers on a California Institute of Technology 
float. The 10-foot-tall metal tree now serves as a topiary frame for a winding 
vine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest mementos of all are the memories, according to Stillwell. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, she recalled, it rained all night. And when her group arrived at the 
parade route "all the people who had been here were wet and went home." 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a beautiful spot that year," Stillwell said.

SAFEGUARDING YOUR CHILD; RULES FOR LIVING IN A DANGEROUS WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are offering tips to help parents protect their children. In the 
wake of seven attempted kidnapings reported at Orange County shopping centers 
recently and the highly publicized abduction and murder of 12-year-old Polly 
Klaas in Petaluma, parents can reduce the chances of victimization by teaching 
children some safety rules. BROACHING THE SUBJECT 
</P>
<P>
 * Reassurance: Assure your children that they can be safe if they follow some 
simple rules and form good habits. The main thing for them to remember is never 
to go anywhere with anyone without your permission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Openness: Ask them to always confide in you, even if the subject feels 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strangers: Teach your children that there are good strangers and bad 
strangers. For example, police officers, salesclerks and teachers are people 
children should seek out if they are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secrets: There are good secrets and bad secrets. Bad secrets include an 
adult ordering a child not to tell that he offered candy to go in his car, or 
that he touched the child in a private place. PROFILE OF A MOLESTER 
</P>
<P>
 Among the several types of child molesters are non-family members who use 
force or violence against a child. They are almost always male. The recidivism 
of child molesters is among the highest of all crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * How a victim is chosen: 
</P>
<P>
 The typical child molester seeks vulnerable children; he tends to gravitate to 
places where he can observe many children. These include schools, playgrounds, 
movie theaters, arcades, public restrooms, libraries, parks and public swimming 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who is at risk: He may prefer a certain type of child but will not confine 
himself to that type if he has a better opportunity to attack others. SAFETY 
RULES 
</P>
<P>
 On the Street: 
</P>
<P>
 * Have your children walk or play with other children or trusted adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a call-back routine with your school to alert you if your children 
do not report for class. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not allow your young children to walk outside after dark without an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adopt a family code word. Instruct your children never to go with an adult 
who does not give the code word. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tell your children never to get into a car with a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teach children to walk against traffic if possible. This allows them to 
easily see a car stopping near them. Tell your children to run or yell if 
someone tries to force them to go somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never let a stranger photograph your children without your permission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Instruct children to tell you if they have been approached by a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 In the house: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your doors locked, even during the day. Some molesters simply walk in. 
Do not open doors for strangers and instruct your children not to tell anyone 
at the door that they are alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * When answering the phone, your children should not give any information to 
strangers. ESSENTIAL SKILLS 
</P>
<P>
 * Teach your children how and when to use 911 and how to use a public 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teach them what to do if you become separated, especially in a crowd. They 
should seek help from people such as an usher, police officer or salesclerk. 
They should stay in one place if they get lost. You may also want to give your 
children a whistle to signal for help. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage your children not to keep secrets from you. If someone has been 
bothering them but has not tried any overt acts, you need to know about it. 
IMPORTANCE OF PRACTICE 
</P>
<P>
 Play roles with your children to teach them how to respond. If properly 
prepared, they can automatically take the right action if in danger. It is 
important to keep up these practice sessions as children get older. For 
example, a 9-year-old may forget or ignore what he or she knew at age 7.

O.C. CLIMB FROM RECESSION IS CREAKY, SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 1994 dawns, Orange County is struggling out of its deepest and longest 
recession in 60 years. Experts say a recovery is underway, but so sluggishly it 
is barely noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the last big recession ended a decade ago, the county blasted into one of 
its strongest economic booms ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 Economists tell us that we're in so deep because of an unparalleled confluence 
of events: a global recession, major defense cuts, a regional real estate 
plunge, a sharp drop in tourism and, finally, the collapse of the savings and 
loan industry and resulting nationwide tightening of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 One or two of those events can trigger a recession; all of them happening in 
the same four-year period added up to an economic catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the worst recession since the 1930s," said Walter Hahn, an 
economist in the Newport Beach office of the accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal 
& Co. "But I think that Orange County has a good economic future." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the recession officially began in July, 1990, Orange County was in 
trouble from the decline of its real estate development industry. In 1988, 
commercial builders discovered that they had erected far more office towers 
than needed in the county, and by the end of 1989 residential builders learned 
that people no longer were willing to pay $350,000 and up for tract homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ripples from the real estate crunch soon upset the equilibrium of other 
industries like retailing and business services. With fewer homes being sold 
and few offices being leased, the market for home and office furniture, 
draperies, carpets, copy machines, landscape materials, even shoe repair and 
dry cleaning started shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The county probably could have weathered that, but when defense cutbacks 
started turning into layoffs at the Southland's myriad aerospace and weapons 
factories, the die was cast. The multiple whammy of major employment losses in 
development, retailing, services and defense was too much even for Orange 
County's vaunted economy to withstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the previous year, 1993 ended on a dismal note. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales declined for a second consecutive year, the first two-year drop 
since World War II. The increase in real estate foreclosures, though slower 
than in the previous year, still is expected to grow nearly 70% for an all-time 
high of 5,240 forced sales. And the 11,863 personal and business bankruptcies 
filed in the county through October barely changed from the number filed in the 
first 10 months of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, the county's once-mighty job machine ran out of steam. After 
adding an average of 38,000 jobs a year to their collective payrolls in the 
last half of the 1980s, employers in Orange County so far have spent the '90s 
slashing an average of 22,000 jobs a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the delicate instruments by which economists measure such things have 
plotted an upward trend for 1994 and beyond. The prediction, announced recently 
by economists at Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton, is that the 
economy will bounce along the bottom for the first half of the year with a 
generally lackadaisical business climate until early summer. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as a backdrop, The Times Orange County Edition invited a group of 
county business executives who daily grapple with corporate decisions to share 
their thoughts on the local economy and business scene. The Times' Round Table 
provides a frank airing of the concerns facing county businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they represent a variety of interests and backgrounds, the panel 
members had several common grounds: All have built businesses in Orange County, 
all say they want to stay here and each believes that the cost -- in time, 
money and aggravation -- of coping with proliferating government regulation of 
business is at least as onerous a burden as anything the economy has thrown at 
them in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from the two-hour Round Table discussion: 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: If you could make the rules, what is the most important thing you could 
do to put us back into a healthy recovery mode? 
</P>
<P>
 JUDEE SLACK, small-business owner: We need to get back to free enterprise. 
That's what our country was built on. Business needs to be able to do what it 
does best rather than being made to operate as an agent for the government a 
lot of the time. That's particularly hard on small businesses. A lot of these 
businesses have just two or three employees and the government expects them to 
be specialists in human relations and taxes and accounting and a dozen other 
things. We also need to do something to make financing more available to help 
some legitimate small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT MIRANDA, foreign trade specialist: To let business operate 
competitively and compete globally. And that will require cutting back on this 
over-regulation that makes us less competitive internationally and creates 
obstacles to the start-up and the success of businesses. There's a need to take 
a close look at a lot of this legislation and decide whether it's necessary. We 
have a lot of social problems that are hurting business development here, and 
the way to cut back on gang problems and crime is to provide jobs for the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 TED SMITH, high-technology industry executive: I have lived in Orange County 
since 1968, and particularly in recent years I've seen the environment for 
business deteriorate. The environment for everyone, all of us, has deteriorated 
significantly. The most dramatic thing recently has been the crime problem: the 
number of killings in the county, especially in Santa Ana; the gang problem, 
the graffiti encroachment that is a cosmetic indication of that. 
</P>
<P>
 And I think this is on all of our minds. In fact, a UC Irvine survey indicated 
that 40% to 50% of the people in Orange County are afraid to go out at night 
walking in their community. For the last five years in my business we have seen 
talented, brilliant people either thinking about leaving or leaving the county 
to go to Oregon, Washington, Texas and other places. They're not going because 
of economic problems, except maybe the cost of housing; they're leaving because 
of the social problems. And if we don't get a handle on this, then it is going 
to be working against us. 
</P>
<P>
 WALTER HAHN, economist: I'm going to join the parade on the government 
regulation issue. I have this belief that all the rules and regulations and 
requirements could be substantially simplified, and the cost of complying 
greatly reduced, without damaging the objectives that all of this stuff is 
trying to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are two other things I'd do if I were king here in Orange County, 
and one of them goes to the problem that Ted and Bob talked about. 
</P>
<P>
 I would improve our vocational training programs for the majority of our 
children who are not going to go on to college. We have a real need for people 
who can read and write and do basic math and have training in some type of a 
craft. Other countries, Germany and Japan in particular, have excellent 
vocational training programs, and we are sorely lacking. We need them so our 
kids don't all turn out to be hamburger flippers; so that they can do something 
much better and provide the kind of work force that most of our growing 
businesses, including high-tech businesses, need. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing that I would do is stoke up the economic development and 
promotion efforts in Orange County, both as a county as a whole and 
individually for the various cities. We need to go out and sell Orange County 
to the rest of the world. We need to be more competitive, and part of being 
more competitive is promoting ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: How will county business fare in international trade, especially under 
the new North American Free Trade Agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 MIRANDA: NAFTA is important for all businesses, but smaller and medium-sized 
businesses especially should look at it as an opening for new markets. Mexico 
has more than 85 million people and a growing, substantial middle class that 
really looks to U.S. products as quality products. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up along the Mexican border and I remember as a child that the majority 
of the people buying goods and services in my town were coming across the 
border from Mexico. There's always been a perception there that U.S. products 
have a higher quality. So Orange County businesses should take a very close 
look at the trade opportunities that NAFTA has opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond NAFTA, though, is a bigger mission in Latin America. Mexico is what we 
were hearing about in the news, but other countries in South America and 
Central America are really looking to NAFTA as a blueprint for a full North and 
South America trading zone. And that has tremendous potential for the long-term 
future of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 ALAN HOOPS, health care industry executive: A lot of companies can benefit 
from international trade. At PacifiCare, for instance, we've had inquiries from 
Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Greece and even one country 
in Southeast Asia. They want us to consult with them to move their nationalized 
health systems to a more private system because of problems they're having. So 
it just may be that health care could have international opportunities, even 
though you think of it as being much more of a local business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: Health care is at the top of most people's lists of concerns these 
days. What does all the change portend for business? 
</P>
<P>
 HOOPS: This is just my crystal ball on health reform, but the thing we need to 
remember is that the things being contemplated by the Clinton Administration 
plan and other legislative proposals already are well underway here in 
California. There will be some costs, and we may find that small businesses are 
going to be burdened by some of the requirements, but I believe that employers 
here are not going to be impacted much by what goes on in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the general economy goes, in many respects I see what's happening 
throughout California as being a microcosm of what's happening nationally and 
perhaps internationally. We have been through a rather unique period of 
prosperity where America was relatively self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere in the late '70s and '80s we lost that self-sufficiency and our 
whole country had to recognize that we were not going to be independent of the 
international economy. And now I see the same thing in California. For most of 
the '80s, California was an economic juggernaut, growing every year. We were 
importing a lot of people and a lot of business, especially small business 
start-ups, and that was really keeping the state going and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 SMITH: But now our economy is being dramatically affected by the removal of 
aerospace jobs, and that, together with the U.S. and global recession, has had 
a further impact on the real estate market that has brought growth to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, American industry has finally figured out that it has to be 
more efficient to get more competitive, so we have restructuring going on in 
major corporations. It's practically every other day we see 10,000 to 20,000 
jobs being removed from a major corporation. Personally I applaud that because 
I think it really bodes well for American industry to be effective at becoming 
lower-cost providers. But it has its costs. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think that Orange County is going to overcome the loss of aerospace 
jobs anytime soon. It's a long-term process to replace that many jobs with 
other activities. We need to recognize that while we're in a global recession, 
it is, after all, a temporary thing. We all know that we will come out of it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 TIMES: But when, and how? 
</P>
<P>
 MIRANDA: In my company we really see at a micro-level what this recession is 
doing. From our small-business clients, we see a tendency to be not very 
optimistic about the prospects for 1994. Companies are keeping themselves lean 
and mean, and there's a reluctance to add a lot of permanent staff to the 
payrolls. They tend to work people overtime instead. There's also a desire to 
to keep the business flexible so they are able to change rapidly in the event 
things don't turn out as hoped for. Inventories are being maintained at very 
minimal levels -- just enough to keep operations going -- and there is a big 
concern about the availability of and access to financing. 
</P>
<P>
 SLACK: Access to capital is a very big issue for small business. We recently 
did a survey of women business owners -- most of them are small businesses -- 
and that was a big concern. A lot of banks are saying that they make it easy to 
borrow. But when you go there and go through the red tape, they say 'Oh! You 
don't qualify.' Now, a lot of the reason isn't necessarily the bank's fault. A 
lot of small-business owners don't know how to manage money or write a business 
plan, and that's something the banks are looking for. There's also a lot of 
underground economy out there. Many small businesses keep books for tax 
purposes, so they don't want to show as much profit as they really make, and 
that hurts when they try to get a loan. It's a problem. Some of our members in 
the National Assn. of Women Business Owners would like to see some sort of 
alternative to bank financing. Even (Small Business Administration) loans don't 
always work because in a lot of service businesses there is very little in the 
way of collateral. If you don't own a home or have already borrowed against it, 
you can't get an SBA loan. 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: In light of data that shows that foreclosures in Orange County are at a 
record level, are we creating some sort of time-bomb? If owners of small 
businesses repeatedly refinance their homes to get business capital, how many 
now face losing their houses because of economic hard times? 
</P>
<P>
 MIRANDA: That could be a bubble that's beginning to burst. A lot of small 
businesses are being started by people who lost their jobs, and they have 
certainly looked to their homes as a source of business capital. 
</P>
<P>
 SLACK: I know I've seen several of my clients lose their homes to 
foreclosures. I've seen them refinance and refinance and turn manageable house 
payments into $2,000- and $3,000-a-month payments that their businesses just 
cannot support any more. 
</P>
<P>
 MIRANDA: That is a real difficulty with the economy in a spin. A lot of our 
clients have to access financing sources like the SBA, and those kinds of loans 
do require a lot of collateral. And with the value of houses going down 
significantly, it becomes a real tough challenge for a small-business person to 
go out and obtain financing. Because small businesses traditionally provide 
most of the new jobs in the county as they grow, if they can't get financing 
and grow, we're going to see job losses as a long-term process. 
</P>
<P>
 HAHN: Now it's time for some economist-speak, specifically on how deep the 
soup is and how we're going to get out of it. This definitely is the worst 
recession since the 1930s. In the previous worst recession we had, in 1981 and 
'82, the state lost about 1.5% of its jobs. By the time this one's over it 
probably will be close to four years long instead of a year, and we'll lose 
4.3% of our jobs. It's a pretty devastating recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And Orange County has fared a little bit worse than the state. Before we're 
finished here we'll lose about 65,000 jobs, or about 5.5% of the employment 
when the recession started. My outlook is that it won't be until the second 
half of next year that Orange County will get back to positive job growth. And 
that is when the recovery starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: That all sounds rather bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 HAHN: But I think that Orange County has a good economic future. First of all, 
the U.S. economy as a whole is growing at about 3% a year. When you consider 
that California has about 15% of the national economy and is in recession, that 
tells you that the rest of the country is doing pretty good. And we sell our 
goods and services throughout the United States, we don't export everything. So 
when the rest of the country is doing well, it definitely helps our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 International trade also is very important, particularly Pacific Rim trade, 
because we are the gateway to the Pacific Rim for the United States. What will 
help us get out of our recession is that our trading partners are going to 
recover and buy more of our things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: How will other sectors fare? 
</P>
<P>
 HAHN: Another industry that is going to help us pull out of this is 
entertainment and multimedia, which, in fact, never had a recession and has 
continued to grow rapidly. The information highway is coming on-line, and 
Southern California is the world's capital for a lot of the programming that 
makes it work. In the related telecommunications field, we have services 
businesses here that are going to be spending a lot of money on capital 
improvements like fiber optics, and we have companies in Orange County that 
produce the equipment and provide a lot of services to help operate the 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing that will help the economy is the housing industry, which I see 
recovering starting in the second half of 1994 and then going into a fairly 
substantial building mode for a couple of years as we catch up with the pent-up 
demand for housing that has gone unsatisfied during this recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And the last thing that's going to help us grow out of this and recover is 
tourism. California and particularly Southern California is one of the world's 
primary tourism destinations. When the national recession hit, that slowed our 
tourism down because most of our visitors come from the rest of the United 
States. Even if Disney doesn't go ahead with its expansion in Anaheim, I see 
solid growth happening in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIMES: A lot of people suggest that much of the job growth we can expect is 
going to be lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs. Are we losing one of our most 
attractive assets -- a highly skilled work force? 
</P>
<P>
 SMITH: Well, I've been actively involved with programs at UCI over the last 
few years, and it's been encouraging. About 90% of the graduates stay in Orange 
County, and that flow of intellect and skill and energy is a tremendous asset. 
</P>
<P>
 HOOPS: It's not really a matter of less-skilled jobs. With the reduced 
importance of the defense and aerospace businesses here, perhaps we're seeing 
the final cleansing of the one-company career track. It may be that people are 
all going to have multiple careers and will have to develop a number of skills. 
</P>
<P>
 HAHN: I absolutely do not see Orange County being hollowed out and losing all 
of its well-paid jobs. I think it's going to continue to be pretty balanced. In 
fact, in the past 10 or 15 years we've lost a lot of our lower-paid jobs. The 
companies that moved here in the 1950s and '60s because everything was so cheap 
have moved again, out of state or to the Inland Empire, because now Orange 
County is expensive and they can't afford to be here. While we certainly have 
added some lower-paid jobs in the '80s, we also added a lot of jobs in 
industries like Ted Smith's, in telecommunications and biomedical research, and 
we didn't lose them all in the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 HOOPS: I think that the recovery is going to be a steady one, but probably not 
a robust one. But the result will be a more resilient economy. Not being able 
to rely as much on real estate and aerospace means we will have to have a much 
more sound foundation of smaller employers who perhaps will be more able to 
deal quickly with economic trends and opportunities. We'll have a different 
economic profile, but there is reason for optimism. Round-Table Panel 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in The Times Orange County's Business Round Table were nominated 
by the business section's staff. They come from several key business and 
industry segments in the county. All have felt the impact of this recession and 
all have survived previous recessions; several said they are busily 
restructuring their companies to survive this one. Together, they represent 
nearly 100 years of business experience in Orange County. They are:

<P>
 Economist, Kenneth Leventhal & Co., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's specialties at the international accounting and business consulting 
firm's Orange County branch include commercial and residential real estate 
development and the tourism industry. His company counts many of Orange 
County's leading developers as clients. 
</P>

JAMES FLANAGAN: '93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; DON'T WORRY! IT'S JUST A 
NEW ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the year we recognize that we're experiencing the first economic 
recovery of the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, thanks to worries about jobs and lingering recession in some parts 
of the country, the recovery has seemed dubious and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year there will be national economic growth of 3%, following a burst 
forward at the end of 1993, and increasing confidence even in California that 
we are launched on a new pattern for U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a time of information making work more efficient, making work 
possible. And often we don't recognize it for what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not machines taking the place of employees, but rather machines 
enhancing human work, allowing greater output for the same amount of input -- 
or increases in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Information -- sophisticated computer networks and advanced telecommunications 
-- gives even small manufacturers like Taylor-Dunn of Anaheim the ability to 
hold only two days inventory as opposed to seven; gives Chrysler Corp. the 
ability to design and produce a new car in two years as opposed to four; gives 
Wal-Mart and its suppliers the ability to distribute goods at half of what it 
used to cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The result throughout the U.S. economy is not stagnation or inflation but 
productivity and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. business now recognizes the payoff from advanced computing and 
communications technology. That's why Commerce Department forecasts say 
spending on plant and equipment will rise more than $50 billion in 1994 and why 
computer network suppliers like cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications, 
Cabletron Systems and Novell software show up on lists of investment guru 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why foreign investment in the United States is picking up again. A 
study by the Arthur Andersen accounting firm late last year reported that 
foreign companies are increasing their U.S. investments, seeking access to the 
world's largest market or the world's most efficient production capabilities. 
Daimler Benz' decision to produce Mercedes in Alabama is a fresh example of 
that trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many analysts doubt such optimism, maintaining that the U.S. economy 
cannot grow without sharply higher interest rates and inflation. But they are 
forgetting the effect of productivity increases. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a decade of decline or slow growth, productivity has been 
growing 2.4% a year since 1991. That means the U.S. economy has achieved 
roughly $150 billion more in output with the same or less input of labor, 
energy, capital and natural resources. It's a powerful concept. 
</P>
<P>
 We have massive change in industry, but not mass unemployment. Joblessness in 
California is up near 10% because of defense industry downsizing, but it's at 
6.4% nationally. Industry is working at 83% of capacity and there are places 
where skilled trades are already in tight supply. 
</P>
<P>
 In specific numbers, economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley predicts 3% 
real growth for the U.S. economy in 1994 and says there will be no more 
inflation than we have now -- 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 That means there will be no sudden or dramatic rises in interest rates. "My 
nervous guess," says Albert M. Wojnilower, senior economist of First Boston 
Investment Management, is that short-term interest rates may rise from 3% to 
3.5%, but not for another six months. "Long-term bond yields will continue to 
fluctuate wildly," he says, "but on balance should rise one-quarter to one-half 
of one percent in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 California's economy will continue to lag. But toward the end of the year, it 
should pick up, says economist Larry Kimbell of UCLA. And house prices could 
get firmer this summer, says Richard Diehl, who retired last year as chairman 
of H.F. Ahmanson, because the burden of bank-reclaimed housing now depressing 
real estate markets will be absorbed by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 A still underestimated engine of California's economy is multimedia, the 
marriage of Silicon Valley and Hollywood. The world of 500 TV channels -- 
whatever that may mean -- won't arrive in 1994, but work is going forward 
furiously on services for business, from sales programs on CD-ROM to video 
conferencing to ever more elaborate global communications. Hundreds of 
California firms large and small, from Disney to Knowledge/Adventure, are in 
the thick of this developing megabusiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook in traditional industries is firmly bullish. U.S. car and light 
truck sales could rise more than 8%, say analysts. Home sales and new home 
building will continue to benefit from low mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the year of the great health care debate, with passage of 
legislation likely before the November congressional elections. Universal 
coverage and protection from loss of insurance due to catastrophic illness will 
be brought in, but otherwise there will be few surprises. Changes in medical 
care to favor efficiency and cost-consciousness are already proceeding 
throughout the U.S. system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many industries, from chemicals and construction equipment to computers and 
engineering and environmental services, depend heavily on foreign markets, 
which will be both exciting and uncertain in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The stagnant economies of Western Europe and the recession-hit economy of 
Japan are just beginning the process of restructuring that has brought U.S. 
industry into the information age. So for the next few years, we can expect to 
see their companies downsizing and reorganizing -- probably with the aid of 
U.S. computer equipment. Interest rates are already coming down sharply in 
Europe, causing European stock markets to rise. Japan is facing a profound 
restructuring to a more consumer-oriented society, and its stock market will 
remain in some turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's economy will grow strongly in 1994, thanks partially to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. And the other economies of Asia, including China 
and Hong Kong, will continue their rapid advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets are now bread and butter to the U.S. economy. If trade 
accounts are calculated correctly -- that is, if services such as banking, 
legal and investment counseling, entertainment, travel and tourism are included 
-- one out of every four dollars in the U.S. economy is connected to foreign 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, with congressional passage of NAFTA and support for the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the American public gave its assent to the new 
global economy. In the same way, Americans have given assent to the information 
age in their acceptance of industrial restructuring over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bold step -- but not a leap in the dark. History is on the side of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 This year will see direct employment in U.S. manufacturing -- already down to 
14% of the work force -- decline slightly again. But manufacturing output will 
continue to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jobs are related to information industries (as in trucking and 
transportation needed for more efficient inventory systems) and in financial 
and health services for an aging population saving for retirement, and in the 
multitude of tasks related to foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. economy is still in recovery. The boom is yet to come, says economist 
David Levy, who predicts a surge in high technology exports to such countries 
as China and Argentina and a major swelling of orders for U.S. aircraft and 
power plants later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Americans broadly -- even we in California -- should begin to feel 
more confident about our future.

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; RIDING THE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If only Wall Street could learn to follow a script, here's how the Oscar 
winner would read for 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 We're in an economic recovery, and people finally learn to enjoy it. Interest 
rates rise, though slowly. U.S. growth is moderate, but healthy enough to cause 
corporate profits to boom. Europe's economy revives. The dollar is strong, but 
not too strong. Third World stock markets are red-hot again.  
</P>
<P>
 A year from now, the typical stock investor walks away with a return in the 
low double-digits. The typical bond investor earns about 6% -- still better 
than 3% money market yields. Everyone goes to Spago to celebrate.  
</P>
<P>
 Too good to be true? Maybe. Yet many Wall Street optimists offer the above as 
the logical scenario for '94 -- continuing economic growth and markets that 
aren't bearish, but aren't wildly bullish, either. 
</P>
<P>
 If 1993 taught us anything, however, it was that logic's use in forecasting 
investment winners and losers can be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, for example, it was reasonable to assume that gold couldn't rise 
in a low-inflation economy -- yet it jumped 17% in 1993; that recession-bound 
European stock markets would lag the U.S. market -- yet just the opposite 
occurred; that President Clinton, a Democrat, would be bad for interest rates 
-- instead, long-term rates plunged to 20-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
 For traditional buy-and-hold investors who sat quietly, it turned out to be a 
decent year, as the economy improved at a steady pace without unleashing 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Major U.S. stock indexes posted total returns between 10% and 20%, and U.S. 
bonds offered returns of 6% to 12% -- the longer term the better, because such 
bonds appreciated in value as interest rates tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 But how long can sitting quietly work as an investment strategy? Even the 
optimists concede that with the U.S. stock bull market 38 months old and with 
interest rates near 20- to 30-year lows, the risk of a reversal this year in 
financial markets -- at least a temporary one -- is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Anderson, strategist at investment giant IDS Financial Corp. in 
Minneapolis, describes himself as modestly bullish on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the market up three years in a row and stock prices historically high 
relative to companies' underlying earnings per share, any number of possible 
disasters could quickly change the outlook, he allows: "A political crisis in 
China, a shooting war in Korea, the extremists take control in Russia . . . ." 
And that's not even counting any missteps by the White House, Congress or the 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because the wave of novice mutual fund investors who jumped into 
stocks and bonds in 1993 was unprecedented, the potential is huge for many of 
them to bail if trouble hits the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors large and small profess to be in the market for the long-term, notes 
David Shulman, strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York. But just how many 
trigger fingers are out there is not known, because they have yet to be tested 
by a major crisis. "I think everybody is complacent now about the markets -- 
too complacent," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he also agrees that such concern must be weighed against the increasingly 
bright outlook for the U.S. economy. Growth is good, hiring is picking up, 
inflation is still low -- and so are interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Wall Street's most respected investment strategists, Greg Smith of 
Prudential Securities, recently put it this way in a memo to clients: "We don't 
want to tempt fate, but neither do we want to become too carried away with the 
notion that some really bad things are about to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, Smith, suggests, Wall Street can learn to be happy with good times 
again. There is recent precedent, after all: Stocks and the economy advanced 
together for the five years between 1982 to 1987. So far, this recovery and 
bull market have lasted three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, many pros say the smart investor in 1994 will reject overt 
bearishness, but will also allow for the unexpected -- the surprises that logic 
wouldn't dictate. 
</P>
<P>
 How best to invest new money or rearrange your portfolio this year? Some 
experts advise letting two basic laws of nature guide you: 
</P>
<P>
 * Over time, everything returns to normal. In market parlance, this is known 
as "regression to the mean" -- simply, that an investment's performance cannot 
exceed or undershoot its historical average for too long before reversing, 
perhaps violently. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bogle, head of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, calls the mean "a 
powerful magnet that pulls financial market returns toward it." 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. blue chip stocks -- those represented in the Standard & Poor's 500 
index -- the average annual total return over the past eight decades has been 
about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because average stock returns in the 1980s were so much greater than that -- 
17.5% a year -- Wall Street pros believe that there is substantial likelihood 
of average returns under 10% in this decade, to keep the historical mean 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Regression was clearly underway in 1992, when the S&P's total return 
(appreciation plus dividends) was just 7.6%. In 1993, the S&P just slightly 
exceeded its long-term average, with a total return of about 10.1% -- a 7.1% 
price gain plus a 3% dividend yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the best possible economic backdrop this year, the pull of the mean 
is likely to be felt again in stocks, many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that "average" stock performance will probably grow increasingly 
unexciting. And that, in turn, will accelerate a profound shift in investors' 
thinking -- a shift, indeed, that already has begun, Wall Streeters say: 
</P>
<P>
 To beat a shrinking average return on U.S. stocks, you'll have to move some 
money into other, higher-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the search for higher returns drove investors into foreign stock 
markets, small-company U.S. stocks and gold. And, in fact, each of those 
higher-risk categories paid off with returns that topped the S&P last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on Wall Street decry investors' reach for higher returns as a speculative 
binge. What the critics are forgetting is that this process also encourages 
diversification. In the long run, having a well-diversified portfolio -- which 
any investor now can build with ease using mutual funds -- is likely to be a 
blessing rather than a curse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chaos begets opportunity. Many investors are terrified that a bear market is 
coming in stocks and bonds. And someday, maybe soon, the bear certainly will 
growl. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than be frozen into inaction by that prospect, however, it's worth 
remembering that only in bear markets is truly big money made -- by people 
prepared to buy at market lows instead of highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: A year ago, nobody wanted to own gold, which was as good a sign as 
any that the price was ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, foreign stock returns had lagged U.S. returns for four years prior 
to 1993. In retrospect, every investor knows what he or she should have been 
doing in those years -- systematically buying into foreign markets, betting on 
an eventual turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 The key in 1994 is not to be a total contrarian on the markets, buying only 
what is unloved. Instead, recognize that you should always search for the 
markets with the greatest potential. And those, by definition, usually are 
markets that recently have been out of favor or just begun to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, that could describe gold and other commodities, real estate, small 
energy stocks and Japanese stocks, among other sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Crabbe, money manager at the Crabbe Huson mutual funds in Portland, Ore., 
says "out-of-favor" also describes many individual U.S. stocks -- even though 
the market overall is at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the nature of Wall Street is to overreact to the slightest bit of bad 
news from individual companies, Crabbe says there is no shortage of overly 
punished stocks lying around for patient investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it this way, he says: There's a bigger crowd buying stocks today -- 
probably the biggest ever -- and therefore a bigger crowd that rushes for the 
exits when things temporarily go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just makes it all the better for someone who wants to go against the 
crowds," Crabbe says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Wall Street's chronic inability to follow a script, or to act 
logically, is the savvy investor's greatest advantage. 1993 Investment Score 
Card 
</P>
<P>
 Which investment categories performed best, overall, in 1993? Here's a look at 
average performance of indexes measuring popular stock, bond, "cash" and 
commodity investments. For example, "small company mutual funds" measures the 
average gain of stock funds specializing in small stocks. Also shown are 1992 
and 1991 returns for each category, to put 1993 numbers in perspective. 
Finally, the estimated inflation rate is included, to show which investments 
beat inflation. All returns are "total returns," which includes the 
investment's price change plus any dividends or interest earned. STOCKS (Total 
investment return) 04,33,08,08,08 1993 1992 1991 Gold oriented mutual funds

 Today's Business section is a special issue looking back at 1993 and ahead to 
1994, in both the economy and the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular Sunday features will return next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded financial tables in today's section are annual performance 
summaries for stocks and mutual funds. They take the place of the weekly 
tables. Markets columnist Tom Petruno has put together a user-friendly summary 
of the market year, D8. A special guide to understanding and using the mutual 
fund charts is on D11. 
</P>
<P>
 If you invest -- or plan to -- today's section can be a valuable resource. Use 
it to evaluate your holdings' performance in 1993 against market averages and 
to decide on the best opportunities for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's features on the economy's prospects, meanwhile, can help guide your 
personal and professional business decisions in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Business section will publish a special report on stock 
mutual funds, ranking he best- and worst-performing funds of 1993 and assessing 
the fund outlook for 1994.

strengthening U.S. economy were enough to overcome tax-hike worries and 
Russia's festering crisis. The Dow Jones industrials gained 13.7% for the 
year.But a slow upward creep in interest rates toward year's end revived 
worries about the aging bull market's 1994 prospects.

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; STATE MAY FINALLY SEE A RECOVERY; BUT L.A. 
AND ORANGE COUNTIES COULD STILL LAG, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's prolonged recession might actually end in 1994 -- not that most 
residents of the Golden State would notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists predict that economic output and employment levels will bottom 
out midyear, with barely perceptible growth occurring in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 So even if it comes, a recovery won't do much to get the beleaguered state 
back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 1994 will be the transition year," said Adrian Sanchez, regional 
economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But we're laying most 
of our eggs in '95's basket, where we will see the visible signs of recovery 
through most of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent quarterly prediction by the widely watched UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project argued that the state will never regain the bulk of the 
high-paying defense, manufacturing and other jobs lost since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 California is already 2 million jobs below previous trends, the UCLA 
forecasters said. And most new jobs will be added in the lower-paying service 
sector, especially retail trade. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA forecasts a 0.2% dip in non-farm employment in 1994, then 1.3% growth in 
1995. But it won't be until 1998 that the state regains real strength, with 3% 
annual job growth, the forecasters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the recovery will be the Inland Empire and central parts of the state, 
followed by the Bay Area and Northern California, with the rest of the 
Southland bringing up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Los Angeles County, home to most of the state's defense industry? 
Most economists don't expect a turnaround here until 1995 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists say it is construction that will lead the state out of its 
long malaise. Once housing prices stabilize and potential buyers regain their 
confidence in the economy, there should be a spurt in home buying, leading to 
more construction and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there are conflicting signs in the real estate market. New homes sales 
have been rising, but home prices continue to fall. And new housing starts 
declined on the West Coast in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing low interest rates and home prices will draw more buyers into the 
market, said Pat Neal, president of the California Assn. of Realtors. "The 
worst is behind us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong growth can be expected only in certain industries such as movies and 
television, business services, health care and tourism. None of those sectors 
is significant enough to fuel a robust recovery in California, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is you just don't know what is going to be the new source of 
jobs," said Ronald Schmidt, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco. "And you can't anticipate these things. We didn't anticipate the 
computer boom. Maybe you can look at biotech, or certainly, in California, at 
expanding trade opportunities. These are all things that might trigger a real 
surge of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Key to California's recovery will be the resurgence of the U.S. -- and then 
the European and Japanese -- economies, which buy the state's goods and 
services, said Stephen Levy, an economist and head of the Center for Continuing 
Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of recent international trade pacts -- the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the latest accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade -- argue that California stands to benefit greatly from the 
relaxation of tariffs and quotas the world round. But other analysts say the 
benefits of NAFTA will be modest and those from GATT will be long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should expect the California economy to lag the nation for one more year," 
Levy said. "Even if we do turn around our growth, we'll be less than the rest 
of the nation because of the drag of defense reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 David G. Hensley, vice president of real estate research at Salomon Bros. in 
New York and former head of UCLA's Business Forecasting Project, has an unusual 
take on the recent data -- one that gives him more hope for the state's 
immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. recently compared state employment counts with federal ones and 
found important discrepancies in the totals, suggesting that employment growth 
in the states may have been undercounted last year, Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California's case, 1993 employment growth may have been underestimated by 
as much as 120,000 jobs -- meaning the state's losses may already have started 
to level off. The official state estimate is that California lost about 170,000 
non-farm jobs in 1993, Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor suggesting that things are already starting to look up, in 
Hensley's view: Retail sales in key urban markets of Northern and Southern 
California showed strong year-to-year growth, on the order of 6% to 8% or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 And the biggest indicator to watch: Announcements of defense layoffs dropped 
off in the last six months or so, suggesting that 1994 could see a breather in 
the rate of defense job losses, though such losses are sure to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be enough in itself to allow a technical turn in the economy to 
modest rates of growth, rather than a decline," Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one big risk to watch for in 1994. If tax revenues continue to fall, 
state and local governments may lay off large numbers of workers -- layoffs 
that were largely avoided in 1993. Such layoffs could derail any nascent 
recovery.

 SAVINGS AND LOANS: Encroachment by mortgage bankers and mutual funds offers a 
challenge, as does the proposed merger of bank and S&L regulatory agencies. 
Federal income tax hikes could reduce the pool of home-loan seekers, but a 
rebound in hiring could release pent-up demand in California for housing -- and 
home loans. CHRIS KRAUL

sales should top 15 million. Chrysler and Ford profits will grow substantially. 
GM could earn money in North America with aggressive prices on old products. To 
stem market-share losses, more Japanese makers could join the leasing derby.

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; TELECOM, GOLD AMONG HEAT-RETAINING STOCKS; 
BEST-WORST: MANY CONCEPTS CAPTIVATED INVESTORS FOR A TIME. SOME, HOWEVER, 
MANAGED TO KEEP THEIR ALLURE UNTIL THE END.

 It probably is only fitting that the winningest stock of 1993 is . . . a 
gaming stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Crown Casino, a company whose ticker symbol is DICE, jumped from 44 cents a 
share a year ago to $5.88 a share by Friday on the Nasdaq market, a 1,236% gain 
that made it the best-performing stock on the three major U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Crown, which used to buy and sell cable TV systems, now hopes to 
launch a gambling riverboat off St. Charles, La., this spring. It is one of a 
host of new gaming companies that have sprung up nationwide over the past two 
years, though most -- like Crown -- exist so far more as pipe dreams than as 
going concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street in 1993, many concepts captivated hungry investors for a time. 
But by year's end, the market had begun to grind up some of the high-fliers, as 
investors turned more cautious about where they'd sink their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big themes whose stocks -- some of them, anyway -- still retained 
their cachet as '93 closed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommunications. Investors remain fascinated with companies that may ride 
the much-ballyhooed electronic information highway to success. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot telecom issues in '93 included SA Holdings, a tiny Plano, Tex., outfit 
selling international communications links (including to the Russians); Comdial 
Corp., which suddenly has at least a few investors excited about its 
specialized phone systems for businesses, and Mitel, a Canadian firm whose 
large-scale phone switching systems have been selling well enough in recent 
quarters to return the company to profitability -- after two years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 On a service road along the information highway, the home shopping craze drove 
shares of Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Valuevision International up 779% on the 
Nasdaq market to $15.38 a share by year's end. The 3-year-old company says its 
cable show now is available to 9.6 million homes, though the firm still is 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outsourcing. That's the business code word for finding a cheaper way to do 
something than with employees of your own. The trend helped Intelogic Trace's 
shares leap 673%, to $3.63 on the NYSE for the year. The company is one of the 
largest independent computer maintenance firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the firm has been a money loser for the past three years, Intelogic's 
investors are speculating that more companies will choose outside servicers for 
their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, First USA's shares scored a gain of 208% on the NYSE in '93, as 
more credit card issuers turned to the firm to process transactions. The 
company's earnings have been mushrooming since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy industry. Because the economic recovery appears to be for real this 
time, investors have been flocking to shares of metal makers, metal benders and 
other Rust Belt businesses. Such companies' products are elemental to new cars, 
new homes, new refrigerators and other consumer and business goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel maker Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1991, saw 
its shares rocket 198% in '93, to $17.13 on the NYSE, on the strength of rising 
demand for its flat-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Rust Belt winner: Allied Products, which produces a variety of basic 
machinery, including automated presses and dies for industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold mining. The metal was back in style -- as was silver -- and that helped 
Sunshine Mining surge 460% for the year to $2.63 on the NYSE. Republic 
Goldfields, on the American Stock Exchange, also jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Lori Corp. isn't in the gold business, its costume jewelry must look 
the part to enough buyers. A strong comeback in business after two lousy years 
pushed the company's stock up 543% on the Amex, to $5.63 a share at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the year's losers, they too seemed to be crowded around some big 
themes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fashion victims. Many apparel makers and retailers were crushed in 1993, as 
consumers' revived spending habits didn't seem to include clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry-Go-Round, which sells clothes to what it hopes are hip younger folk, saw 
sales tank -- and that landed the company in technical default with its 
lenders. The stock plunged 79.2% on the NYSE by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Other losers in the genre included Leslie Fay, now in bankruptcy; He-Ro Group, 
down 68% for the year; Bernard Chaus, and Gantos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical products and services. The health care reform promised by the 
federal government isn't here yet, but the shakeout is already well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The big losers in 1993 included U.S. Surgical, a once-high-flying maker of 
surgical devices that was supposedly without peer. The stock plummeted 67% as 
sales began to trail off. 
</P>
<P>
 Another loser was Clinicorp, which has been trying to build a chain of 
chiropractic clinics. (The stock's symbol: BAK.) Its shares lost 71.7% on the 
Amex. 
</P>
<P>
 Other medical victims in need of triage include T2 Medical, off 65.2% on the 
Amex, and Hospital Staffing, another Amex issue, which once enjoyed a booming 
business as a placement agency for health care professionals. Stock Winners and 
Losers in '93 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the stocks that rose the most -- and those that fell the most -- on 
each of the three major markets last year. Each table includes only common 
stocks (preferred stocks and warrants are excluded). Also, stocks that closed 
1993 below $1 aren't counted, so the losers' lists don't include many companies 
whose stocks plunged to close virtually worthless. All prices are adjusted for 
any stock splits. 10 NYSE STOCKS UP THE MOST 05,21,07,07,07,26 1992 1993 Pct.

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; 4 STRATEGIES FOR THE NEW YEAR; VETERAN 
MONEY MANAGERS SHARE INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How can you construct a winning investment portfolio for 1994, given the many 
cross-currents in the markets and the economy? Four veteran California money 
managers offer their outlooks -- and specific investment recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stay Long in Bonds: On Wall Street and on Main Street, the big question for 
1994 -- some would say the only question -- is whether the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates for the first time since February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy finally in a real recovery, most experts are convinced that 
the Fed is about to perform its usual thankless task of taking the punch bowl 
away just as the party gets going. 
</P>
<P>
 William Gross, who helps direct $50 billion in bond investments for Pacific 
Investment Management in Newport Beach, agrees there's a good chance the Fed 
will be obligated to act in 1994. But he says the implications aren't quite as 
dire as many investors may be assuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they raise rates, I have a hunch it isn't going to be dramatic," 
Gross says. "They don't need to raise rates much to achieve their effect," he 
says -- which is to signal the markets to tighten credit a bit, thereby keeping 
the economy from advancing too fast and kindling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At most, Gross thinks short-term interest rates will climb about one-half 
point in 1994. That would boost the yield on three-month Treasury bills from 
3.06% today to the 3.50% to 3.60% range a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 If longer-term bond yields follow short rates up by even a mere half-point, 
current bond owners' principal value could be significantly eroded for the 
first time since 1987. But Gross says the good news may be that long-term 
yields will be stable or fall further by the end of '94, even as short rates 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Why he's optimistic about long rates: While short-term rates respond to 
short-term economic forces, long-term yields are mostly a function of Wall 
Street's perception of future inflation trends, Gross notes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market believes that a Fed move to nudge up short rates will help keep 
inflation low (3% or less per year) in the long run, the current 6.35% yield on 
30-year Treasury bonds should look quite attractive to investors, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So long-term T-bonds and long-term bond funds are his favorite fixed-income 
investments for '94. If long rates just stay relatively stable for the year, 
Gross says, they will provide a much better return than yields on money funds 
and other "cash" investments -- even if those cash yields rise from the current 
2%-to-3% to about 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Betting heavily on cash in '94 "will be an expensive wait," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, Gross is negative on intermediate-term bonds, especially 
two- to five-year Treasury issues that have been favored by many conservative 
small investors. He believes yields on those issues will follow short rates 
higher, slicing into the principal value of current issues in that maturity 
range -- to their owners' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides long-term Treasury bonds, Gross advises yield-needy investors to 
consider mortgage-backed bonds (such as GNMAs) and tax-free municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on mortgage-backed issues were kept artificially high in 1993 (7% or 
more); investors avoided those bonds because of the threat of prepayments, as 
homeowners refinanced in record numbers. But refi activity should slow this 
year, Gross says, sparking new demand for mortgage bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the muni market, yields remain very attractive, he says. Long-term 
California bonds pay 5% to 5.5% tax-free, equivalent to Treasury yields between 
7.7% and 8.4% for a couple in the 34.7% federal/state combined marginal tax 
bracket (those with taxable income of $61,241 to $91,850). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks Still Look Good: Don't believe the bears who say the stock market is 
overvalued after three years of gains, says Jerry Dodson, manager of the 
Parnassus stock mutual fund in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not overvalued -- it's fairly valued" relative to the strength of 
corporate earnings, Dodson insists. That's high praise coming from a money 
manager who never likes to overpay. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson, whose $85-million fund is labeled "socially conscious" because he 
screens investments for "enlightened and progressive management," drove 
Parnassus to a 16% gain last year, after a 36.8% return in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he thinks he can achieve double-digit returns again, if he's right 
in assuming that rising corporate earnings will attract more people to stocks 
as the economy grows. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dodson concedes that interest rates probably aren't going lower in an 
improving economy, he believes it's too early for the stock market to lose its 
composure over a possible rise in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to have much inflation, because American industry 
is much more productive than it used to be, and that means costs are under 
control," Dodson argues. If inflation remains tame, he says, there's no reason 
to fear a surge in interest rates -- which means the stock market will be free 
to ponder the good news of the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Among industrial stocks that Dodson says should get a kick from the economy, 
he owns Acme Metals ($18 as of Friday), which makes steel bands used in 
packaging and shipping; Raymond Corp. ($16 3/4), a producer of factory and 
warehouse forklifts; and truck-engine maker Cummins Engine ($53 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
 He's high on technology as a way to play the economy's growth, as well. Though 
Apple Computer ($29 1/4) has been trounced in recent months, Dodson believes 
the company's new "Power PC" computer, to be introduced this spring, will be "a 
very significant product." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson also owns laser maker Electro Scientific Industries ($15 3/8) and a 
small company called Genus Inc. ($3), which produces equipment used to 
manufacture chips. 
</P>
<P>
 As for income-oriented investors, he suggests they take a second look at some 
utilities and financial-services companies whose dividends are high and whose 
share prices may be unduly depressed by worries about higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson includes California S&Ls Ahmanson ($19 5/8) and Great Western Financial 
($20) in that camp, as well as Brooklyn Union Gas ($27 3/8), and ONEOK ($18 
7/8), a Midwest natural gas distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks Should Beat Bonds: Robert Rodriguez is betting on a healthy year for 
the economy in '94. For the two mutual funds that he manages -- a stock fund 
and a bond fund -- the improving backdrop probably means more opportunities to 
make money in stocks than bonds, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But in both markets, he is warning shareholders, "I think it's going to be a 
relatively difficult year." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who manages the FPA New Income and FPA Capital funds in West Los 
Angeles, expects short-term interest rates to creep up in '94. But Rodriguez 
isn't willing to bet that long-term yields can avoid going along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures that major pension funds -- under pressure to earn higher returns 
-- are likely to shift more of their assets from bonds to stocks as the year 
progresses and the economy improves. That will put additional upward pressure 
on long-term yields, Rodriguez says. 
</P>
<P>
 If 10-year Treasury note yields rise just one full point from the current 
5.80%, he says, the decline in the price of current notes will almost 
completely negate the 5.80% interest earned for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid getting clobbered by a rise in long-term rates, Rodriguez is keeping 
the average maturity of FPA New Income's bonds at just under three years. A 
shorter-term portfolio will suffer proportionately less of a decline in 
principal than a longer-term portfolio, given the same rise in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest investments are mortgage-backed bonds on mobile homes. He reasoned 
in 1993 that mobile-home owners would be less likely to refinance their 
mortgages even as interest rates fell -- and that proved correct, Rodriguez 
says. He has earned high yields on those bonds -- more than 8% -- and avoided 
seeing them called away. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Rodriguez is sticking with mobile-home bonds, sprinkling in some 
high-yield corporates and moving gradually into two-year Treasury notes for 
safety. Overall, he expects his $115-million bond fund to produce a total 
return (yield plus price change) of just 4% to 7% in 1994 -- far less than the 
10% earned in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 He is much more excited about the stock market. His stock-picking produced an 
18% return for the $150-million FPA Capital fund in 1993, and he thinks he can 
do close to that in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 While many investors worry that a sharp market pullback is imminent, Rodriguez 
says they are missing the boat. "I see too many stocks that have already gone 
through corrections," he says. He has been able to find enough cheap stocks to 
cut his fund's cash reserve from 10% of the portfolio to 3% over the last five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 He, too, likes the prospects for many financial services firms. He has been 
buying mortgage financiers Countrywide Credit ($25 1/8) and Green Tree 
Financial ($48). 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Rodriguez believes that stocks of companies whose fortunes are 
dependent on the beleaguered California economy are near their bottoms, because 
he expects the state to begin recovering in the next two years. He likes names 
such as clothing retailer Ross Stores ($13) and Northern California savings and 
loan Bay View Capital ($21 1/8). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he is betting on technology, but via stocks that others might regard 
as "mostly mundane" companies, including electronics distributors Marshall 
Industries ($50) and Anthem Electronics ($28 7/8). If mundane can be used to 
describe a stock that goes from $38 to $50 in one year -- as Marshall did in 
'93 -- he'll take that every time, Rodriguez says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Buy Overseas -- On Pullbacks: Investors may have to keep reminding themselves 
in 1994 what economic growth ultimately means: higher corporate earnings 
worldwide, says Lynn Danielson, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Bank 
of California in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the bull camp on earnings," she says, and that translates into an 
optimistic outlook on the stock market for '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielson expects operating earnings for the average U.S. blue-chip company to 
rise at a double-digit rate in '94. If that is on the mark, she believes stock 
prices overall could advance another 10% -- though not necessarily in a 
straight line -- as investors respond to rising earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 So she's advising clients to keep half their stock portfolios in large U.S. 
companies that should benefit from faster growth and the other half split 
between international stocks and smaller U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major U.S. firms tied to the economy's prospects, Danielson likes 
General Electric ($104 7/8), steel maker Nucor ($53) and specialty chemical 
firm Morton International ($93 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks on her list include computer parts maker Solectron ($28 3/8); 
carpet firm Shaw Industries ($25 1/2), a play on the strong housing market; and 
W. W. Grainger ($57 1/2), an industrial parts distributor that Danielson calls 
the "7-Eleven for industrial America." 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally, she says she will add to clients' holdings in Mexican and 
Japanese stocks this year. Smaller emerging markets -- such as Thailand, Turkey 
and Indonesia -- remain attractive for the long term, Danielson says, as their 
economies continue to boom. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the spectacular stock price gains in many emerging markets in '93, 
"some of those markets may not be the place to be in '94," Danielson warns. 
"We're telling people to be careful. You want to buy on pullbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 For conservative California investors who need the income or relative safety 
that bonds provide, she says tax-free municipal issues still are the smartest 
bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Muni yields remain historically high compared with taxable yields (such as 
Treasury yields). That means muni investors are amply rewarded for accepting 
the risk that rising market interest rates could erode some of their principal, 
Danielson says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, she expects 1993's high pace of new muni issuance by state and 
local government in California to trail off in 1994. As supply is dropping, 
demand for the bonds should increase, she says, because more high-income 
Californians will realize that their federal tax rates have gone up -- and that 
tax-free bonds are among the few tax shelters left.

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN; NO. 1 
CONCERN OF VOTERS: DEFICIT? -- NO, IT'S JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressures for deficit reduction have virtually quashed Bill Clinton's 
flirtation with a more activist economic policy. Since the demise of the 
middle-class tax cut, the President's economic program has lurched steadily to 
the right, nudged along by a Congress seemingly obsessed with budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 That may or may not be good economics, but it's risky politics for a Democrat. 
Elected with a populist jobs-and-growth message, Clinton reneged on part of 
that platform immediately and is shelving more of it as time goes on. White 
House economists now pin most of their hopes for sustaining the recovery on the 
low interest rates that deficit reduction should buttress -- provided the 
Federal Reserve Board continues to goes along. 
</P>
<P>
 The political question for 1994 and beyond: Will the middle- and working-class 
voters who put Clinton in office be on board? 
</P>
<P>
 Deficit reduction is a doubtful political bet. Since the early '80s, Congress 
has wrestled with any number of budget-cutting plans. The public has given lip 
service to the effort -- then made economic judgments on other factors. If the 
deficit really mattered to Americans, Michael Dukakis would be President today, 
having succeeded Walter Mondale in office. Both candidates railed against 
Reagan-era budget shortfalls, reaping little for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sluggish economic growth -- not the deficit -- beat George Bush and elected 
Clinton in 1992. The small number of deficit-driven voters backed Ross Perot, 
not the Democrat. But even Perot supporters were more concerned with the 
overall economy and jobs than with getting red ink off the federal ledger, 
according to Times exit polls taken Election Day, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans claim to care about the deficit: 67% told Gallup last August that it 
was a "very important" issue. Just before Clinton took office, more than seven 
in 10 in the Times Poll agreed that people like themselves would have to make 
economic sacrifices in order to cut the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But when push comes to shove, minds seem to wander. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little apparent connection between the size of the federal debt and 
all-important levels of consumer confidence, for example. As for taking strong 
medicine, 1993 polls showed Americans unwilling to stomach specific new 
deficit-reducing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts differ over how much the deficit hurts the economy. So it shouldn't be 
surprising that the public is confused. Americans can feel job loss, taxes, 
tight credit and inflation. But the deficit never laid someone off, turned down 
a loan or repossessed the den furniture, at least not directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a dull toothache, the deficit instead annoys Americans -- but not enough 
to call the dentist. The public agrees that it harms the economy, but even here 
shows ambivalence. Poll after poll finds job creation uppermost in the public's 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why do so many in Congress demand a root canal? Strong -- rather than 
mass -- opinion plays on Capitol Hill. Deficit hawks are an ornery, affluent 
bunch, and there are enough of them to raise Cain in those town hall meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the deficit is a sign of disarray, and it fuels the public's broad 
mistrust of government in general. With confidence in Congress so low, many 
think the public wants a house in order before trying any fancy new economic 
schemes. That's partially right. Only 45% of Americans agree that "government 
should get involved in trying to help business create jobs and compete 
productively," Times polling has found. Half think government should keep its 
hands off. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Americans seem more receptive to new programs than many might think. In 
Times polls last year, three-quarters said they favored Clinton's national 
service plan; 54% backed his proposal to boost food stamps and tax credits for 
the working poor. Eight in 10 -- including most Republicans -- liked his 
economic stimulus package, killed off in April by a GOP filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is even sympathetic to spending the savings from entitlement cuts 
on new programs. When the Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll asked Americans if 
Medicare-Medicaid cuts should go for deficit reduction or directly into 
national health care, 70% opted for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that consumer optimism and the public's view of Clinton have 
improved over the last few months, but that's hardly because of deficit 
reduction. Between June and December, Clinton's economic approval score rose 14 
points. At the same time, the share that felt he could bring about real deficit 
cuts actually fell from 38% to 31%, despite the passage of his budget plan. The 
share that called the deficit the nation's top problem also declined to 5% last 
month, from 15% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent statistics point to a better economy, but it's far too early to 
describe things as healthy. Despite improved spirits, Americans remain doubtful 
that jobs are being created -- and California, of course, still is mired in a 
gloom all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton was elected because voters expected economic growth, not just 
deficit reduction. Wall Street may consider those congruent, but the Democratic 
voter base begs to disagree: As the President's ratings rise, they seem to be 
lagging with working-class Americans. Maybe it's time to rehang that famous 
campaign sign, with just a little editing so it reads, "It's jobs, stupid."

'93/'94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; A TOP-10 GUIDE THROUGH THE FLOOD OF 
BUSINESS BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARET LANGSTAFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Langstaff is a contributing editor 
to Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Publishers continued to flood the bookstores in 1993 with books aimed at 
business people. Out of this free-market free-for-all, 10 titles line up as 
worthy selections for the thoughtful reader.  
</P>
<P>
 At the top of this year's list has to be the latest work by our Plato of 
business management, Peter F. Drucker. His "Post-Capitalist Society" 
(HarperCollins, $25) recommends itself both for its insights and what is bound 
to be its ongoing influence on business theory and practice. Drucker says we 
are in the middle of a radical social change -- from a capitalist nation-state 
kind of world to a supranational, knowledge-based, society of organizations. If 
you want to understand why everything seems so different lately, dig into this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 A moving companion volume is "Workers: An Archeology of the Industrial Age" 
(Aperture, $100) by acclaimed photographer Sebastiao Salgado. In 350 searing 
photographs, Salgado reminds us of the back-breaking work underlying modern 
civilization. He treats his manual laborer subjects with a dignity and respect 
that is a tribute to the soul of work.  
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the wage scale, but of equal interest as a timely 
retrospective, is "The Whiz Kids: The Founding Fathers of American Business -- 
And the Legacy They Left Us," by John A. Byrne, a senior writer at Business 
Week (Doubleday, $27.50). This is the truly amazing story of how 10 young 
upstarts, led by Col. Tex Thorton, rode into Detroit in 1945, fresh from their 
sweeping wartime reorganization of the Army Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 They charmed the then-floundering Henry Ford into hiring them as a group and 
subsequently transformed American business into a number-crunching efficiency 
game. The postwar party lasted for 30 years, but then something went amiss. 
Time proved that financial controls were neither the answer to every problem 
nor the key to unlimited growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. McNamara went on to the Pentagon; ambushed by the Vietnam War, he 
turned his analytical skills to ultimately futile body counts. Thornton created 
one of the first U.S. conglomerates, Litton Industries, and lived long enough 
to see it languish under his steady diet of statistical analysis. The other 
guys had similar reversals of fortune. If the past is prologue, "The Whiz Kids" 
is a cautionary tale for today's bottom-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 For plot, character and action suffused with a sense that what you do for a 
living has an awful lot to do with who you are, dip into Michael Dorris' 
haunting new collection of stories, "Working Men" (Holt, $19.95). This is 
fiction, but the emotional issues relative to work and life are timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder why your company's incentive program seems to work like a 
two-edged sword, driving some forward while cutting others off at the knees? 
Put those old pay-for-performance assumptions to the test by reading Alfie 
Kohn's "Punished by Rewards: The Trouble With Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, 
Praise and Other Bribes" (Houghton Mifflin, $22.95). Kohn says that although 
three-quarters of American corporations rely on some sort of incentive program, 
most of the programs don't work. Worse, they're not even motivationally 
neutral, but instead do bad things to people. Concentrate instead, he says, on 
employee participation in decisions, teamwork and making the job itself worth 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another title with an insidious bearing on the bottom line is "The President's 
Health Security Plan," by the White House Domestic Policy Council with a 
foreword by Hillary Rodham Clinton (Times Books, $8). It's a beastly boring, 
complicated subject, but it's too important to ignore. The debate will rage ad 
nauseam during much of 1994, and the stakes are high.  
</P>
<P>
 A pair of books dealing with recent villainy and vainglory in the financial 
markets prove unusually entertaining reading. Though self-serving and selective 
in remembrance, L. William Seidman's Washington memoir, "Full Faith and Credit: 
The Great S&L Debacle and Other Washington Sagas" (Times Books, $25), is worth 
several chuckles. A broader perspective on the banking, financial and real 
estate industries will be found in "Minding Mister Market: Ten Years on Wall 
Street with 'Grant's Interest Rate Observer,' " by James Grant (Farrar Straus 
Giroux, $27.50), a compendium of witty, well-written selections from the 
biweekly journal. Grant's contrarian, common-sensical observations are wickedly 
acerbic, and his deadly eye has repeatedly drawn a beam on instances of 
misplaced optimism.  
</P>
<P>
 In a more melancholy vein is Ron Chernow's "The Warburgs: The 
Twentieth-Century Odyssey of a Remarkable Jewish Family" (Random House, $30). 
The Wall Street Journal reporter has written a masterly saga of this legendary 
German banking dynasty and its travails before and during World War II. One of 
the best books of the year, regardless of category. 
</P>
<P>
 To close on a more pedestrian note, some people love reference books, and 
there's a delectable one out from Reference Press to add to the business book 
shelf. "Hoover's Handbook of American Business, 1994" ($27.95) is the latest 
edition of what has become an annual effort by a group of obsessive list 
makers. Featuring profiles of more than 500 American businesses in its nearly 
1,300 pages, the book's information is sorted every which way (by sales, 
employees, products, region, profits, market value, growth, decline) and is a 
handy resource for just about anyone.

SLUGGISH 1994, THEN MODEST GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year probably won't be much of an improvement over 1993, but several key 
Orange County economic indicators are expected to turn upward again in 1995. 
Don't look for the double-digit increases of the booming 1980s, however.Here's 
how the local economy has fared since the lastrecession in 1981-82 and where 
the pundits expect it to go in the next five years. Resale Housing 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of declines, the median price of an existing home should 
begin to rise again in 1995. Taxable Sales 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending on taxable items from clothing and candy to new cars and 
television sets should mark its largest increase this year since 1989. Job 
Creation 
</P>
<P>
 Local payrolls should begin to grow again this year after three years of big 
losses. Building Permit Values 
</P>
<P>
 After years of decline, the estimated value of all new residential, commercial 
and industrial construction should slowly begin to increase this year.

OB TECH IS SOLD TO UTAH-BASED MAKER OF MEDICAL DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OB Tech Inc., which is developing a unique disposable system called Cordguard 
for sampling blood from umbilical cords, has been sold to a Utah medical device 
manufacturer for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach company's deal with Utah Medical Products, announced in 
August, was completed after Utah Medical studied the effectiveness and profit 
potential of Cordguard.The device allows doctors to stop the flow of blood from 
newly cut umbilical cords and take sterile samples for laboratory analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordguard, not yet on the market, is expected to carry a retail price of $15 
to $20. Utah Medical hopes to corner the entire market, which would cover 3 
million babies born each year in the United States, and bring in up to $60 
million in annual revenue.

HARMAN DEFENDS HER TIES TO DEFENSE; POLITICS: SHE SAYS IMPENDING DEPARTURE OF 
DEFENSE SECRETARY LES ASPIN, A FRIEND TO HER AND SOUTH BAY INTERESTS, WON'T 
UNDERMINE HER WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Pentagon's budget continued to shrink in 1993, Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey) made sure the South Bay's defense industry topped her 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned positions on the House Armed Services Committee and the House 
Committee on Science, Space and Technology. She and other lawmakers have been 
credited with helping keep the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, the 
cornerstone of the region's aerospace industry, off the Pentagon's base closure 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 What helped Harman, whose coastal district stretches from Marina del Rey to 
San Pedro, was her friendship with Defense Secretary Les Aspin, political 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Aspin has resigned, and Harman does not have the same close relationship 
with Clinton's nominee for the post, Bobby Ray Inman, a former Navy admiral and 
high-level intelligence officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Harman said last week by telephone from Hilton Head, S.C., where 
she and her family were vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin "was enormously helpful to me and the South Bay," Harman said, "but you 
have to reflect on how government policy gets made. Virtually none gets made by 
one person, including Bill Clinton. California and the South Bay will still 
have many friends in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's friends in high places, she said, include Deputy Defense Secretary 
William Perry and Defense Undersecretary John Deutch, both of whom she has 
known since her days working for the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The access is still as great and the logic is still the same," said Kevin 
Peterson, president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce. "We still 
have access to people who will continue to hear our story." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her chief political opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks, who is seeking the Republican nomination for Harman's seat, said 
Aspin's departure exposes the congresswoman's weak spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane has lost her sympathetic ear to her pork-barreling strategy," Brooks 
said, "and the 36th District will take its place alongside every other 
congressional district in suffering from the . . . defense meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks charged Harman with "massaging" a few defense-related contracts to 
South Bay companies but then voting for Clinton's defense budget, which Brooks 
predicted would harm the military overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's throwing out crumbs while she votes to slash the budget elsewhere," 
Brooks said, referring to Harman's support of the C-17 cargo jet and F/A-18 
fighter plane projects, which provide thousands of South Bay jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's supporters laud her efforts to secure the contracts and maintain 
a high profile for the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of a congressional representative is to help your own district, 
not another person's district," said Bob Mulholland, the state Democratic 
Party's political director. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, political analysts pointed out, Harman helped get Vice President Al 
Gore to hold a town meeting at TRW in Redondo Beach, one of only a handful he 
held during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's waded right in," said Malcolm Currie, retired chairman of Hughes 
Aircraft. "She's gotten those positions on defense committees. And she's been 
very energetic and quick to grasp new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay aerospace firms, he said, have also been awarded a half-dozen 
federal grants to develop defense conversion projects, which apply military 
technology to civilian uses. Inman is a big supporter of such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly think that Jane Harman will get along great with Inman," Currie 
said. "And Southern California still has an extremely strong story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman would face a big challenge in 1995 when the Defense Department conducts 
its final round of base closures under the federal law enacted four years ago 
to reduce costs. Military officials have hinted at closing the Los Angeles Air 
Force Base in El Segundo and the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arguments to keep them open are as good now as they were last year," 
Harman said. "We just have to make sure we keep making them. 'Ever vigilant,' 
that is my motto going forward."

KEEPING AN EYE ON NEWTS; NATURAL SCIENCES PROFESSOR STUDIES HOW AMPHIBIANS 
FARED IN MALIBU'S FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "Where the newts beckon, their follower must go, and if this exposes him to 
the harshness of the California springtime . . . well, this is the price he 
must pay with all the fortitude he can muster." -- Victor Twitty, "Of 
Scientists and Salamanders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Kats is wearing shorts and sandals, standing in the middle of an 
ankle-deep, 49-degree stream on a brisk December afternoon. He is chatting 
about the life of the California newt, a kind of salamander, and claims he 
isn't chilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get so into it I don't even think about the fact that my feet are cold," 
says Kats, 31, a Pepperdine University natural sciences professor who has been 
studying amphibians at Cold Creek Canyon Preserve near Malibu for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats is exploring the impact on amphibians of the Nov. 2 fire that roared 
through Cold Creek, destroying even the aquatic vegetation lining the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "What made Cold Creek unique before has really made it unique now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially attracted to Cold Creek because its amphibian life is largely 
intact, thanks to the purity of its water and the absence of non-native fish 
species. In many other streams, such fish are wreaking havoc on indigenous 
animals, particularly the amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perennial stream," Kats said, "and it's one of the most pristine 
streams in the Santa Monica Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Kats mainly focuses on California newts in his work at the preserve, which is 
owned and managed by the Mountains Restoration Trust and which has been closed 
to the public since the fire. He thinks the newts serve as "primary indicators 
of the health of the Santa Monica Mountains, where they spend significant 
amounts of time in both perennial water and away from the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be monitoring this population long-term. These animals are very 
fragile, because they can't easily move from one watershed to the next. You can 
see the extinction of local populations very easily." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When newt larvae hatch from eggs laid in water, they have gills. As they 
mature, they develop lungs and legs. Adult newts look like pudgy, amber-colored 
lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow-moving adults, whose orange skin contains a toxin that attacks the 
nervous systems of predators, live mostly on land. They return to the water for 
a few months each year to mate and lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults usually begin returning to the water in early January. Kats' 
research indicates they appear at the same pools each year, but those pools 
have filled up with debris washed down from the denuded hills. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Kats wonders, "When the animals come back, assuming they made it 
through the fire, where are they going to lay their eggs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last winter I stood here in the pouring rain and watched the newts pour out 
of the hills," he said. "But that was through rich leaf litter. Who knows what 
it's going to be like this year? They might be surfing on a mudslide." 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about newts. They have not been greatly studied since Victor 
Twitty, a Stanford biologist, focused on them in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats thinks newts live underground when they're away from water. He doesn't 
know if they can make it through a fire as hot as the one at Cold Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any number of hypotheses come to mind," Kats said. "The fire might have 
driven them even deeper underground." 
</P>
<P>
 Kats also wonders if the still-strong char smell will reduce the animals' 
ability to migrate back to the stream. Newts depend greatly on their sense of 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small world of amphibian research, Kats' work is respected by his 
peers. Peter Morin, a Rutgers University biology professor who is studying the 
Pine Barrens tree frog, calls Kats' work on newt larvae behavior "cutting-edge" 
and "fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 Kats demonstrated that the larvae are apparently able to smell and avoid adult 
newts, which sometimes prey on their own young. The findings, Morin said, "made 
people rethink how sophisticated these animals are." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire may very well have an effect on the amount of cannibalism" this 
year, Kats said. If there are fewer newts and therefore fewer eggs and young, 
cannibalism might decrease. But "if there are fewer aquatic insects, it might 
mean we'll see more cannibalism," he added, because the newts need to find more 
food sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Two summers ago, Kats implanted tiny microchips in Cold Creek newts. Now he 
can identify individual animals with a hand-held scanner, collecting data year 
after year. (Newts typically live 10 to 15 years.) The chips don't allow him to 
track the newts, however. For that he would need radio telemetry implants, 
which are currently too big to use on such small animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats, who grew up in rural Indiana and earned his bachelor's degree in biology 
at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., and his Ph.D. at the University of 
Kentucky, has been studying amphibians since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people I studied amphibians before amphibians were cool. They only 
really started getting attention the last three or four years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives on the Pepperdine campus and is known for his ability to mimic tree 
frogs so well that tiny male tree frogs sometimes mistake him for a rival and 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, Kats was amazed to see coal-black tree frogs at Cold Creek. 
The frogs can change color to match their background, which is usually gray or 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just shocked," Kats said. "This indicates these things have an 
evolutionary history with fire. It hadn't burned here in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the newts that really fascinate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come January and February, I'm usually out here during the rains, and this 
year I plan to pack a sleeping bag," Kats said, explaining that mudslides might 
trap him there overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 In February and March, when the newts are laying eggs, he visits his research 
sites four or five times a week. In the summer, he added, he always has help 
from students. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding the creatures of the California landscape is important, Kats 
said, and he intends to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many university people have begun to focus on the tropics, and their back 
yards have been ignored," Kats said. "It's kind of amazing there's not more 
research going on in the area."

 The Centinela Adobe will hold its annual open house today with more than 200 
candles lighting the historic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 La Casa del Rancho Ajuaje de la Centinela, as it was once known, is a good 
place for a history lesson.Built in 1834 by Ygnacio Machado, a former Mexican 
soldier, the house was the center of a 25,000-acre working ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Using sun-dried clay bricks, Machado built a typical adobe structure with 
16-inch-thick walls, three rooms in a row and an open-air kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroiled in a series of claim disputes, the ranch changed hands several times 
and was whittled down to a little more than 2,200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1873, Daniel Freeman, a Canadian immigrant in search of a warm climate for 
his ill wife, bought the ranch. He amassed a fortune from farming, shipping and 
land deals. Later, he turned to philanthropy and became a founder of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman willed the house to his daughters, who lived there for a while early 
in this century. Over the years, portions of the ranch were converted to 
housing tracts, and another section became part of Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, the Historical Society of the Centinela Valley acquired the house to 
save it from demolition.  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the open house at 7634 Midfield Ave., Westchester, can tour the 
adobe, Freeman's old land office and the Heritage Center, which features 
thousands of old photographs, vintage clothing and other memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred luminarias -- candles in open, sand-filled paper bags -- will 
light the circular driveway leading to the adobe. Hot cider, homemade cookies 
and the singing of New Sounds of Hawthorne await visitors to the event from 6 
to 8 p.m. There is no charge for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 The adobe's regular hours are Wednesday and Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m.

 YULE ECOLOGY: In the old days, many families marked the close of the holidays 
by packing away the ornaments, tossing out the strings of stale popcorn and 
toting the parched Christmas tree to the city dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the environmentally correct '90s, South Bay residents have another 
option: recycling their trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities and refuse companies will accept trees as long as the ornaments, 
decorations and stands are removed. Most companies also do not take flocked 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be a clean, green tree," said a spokesman for Western Waste 
Industries Inc., which handles trash pickup for much of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In most areas, trees can be left for the normal garbage pickup this week. Some 
cities have drop-off sites. Trees taller than six feet may have to be sawed 
into pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents should check with their City Hall for tree disposal instructions 
beyond these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carson: Regular garbage pickup through Friday. Trees can also be dropped off 
at Western Waste, 401 E. Francisco St. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Segundo: Regular garbage pickup through Jan. 14, or trees can be left at 
the city yard, 150 Illinois St. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gardena: Recycling program ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hawthorne: Curbside pickup through Friday. Information: (310) 675-3331. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hermosa Beach: Trees should be left at the curb by 6 a.m. Saturday. 
Residents may also place trees in a dumpster behind City Hall, 1315 Valley 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inglewood: Regular pickup through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lawndale: Second trash pickup day of the week. Trees can be taken to the 
city yard at 4722 W. Manhattan Beach Blvd. between 6 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. through 
Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lomita: Normal trash pickup. Trees must be cut and bundled less than 4 feet 
long and 15 inches in diameter. Drop-off is available at City Hall through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manhattan Beach: Regular pickup through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palos Verdes Estates: Pickup at 6 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Palos Verdes: Trees will be accepted at City Hall, 30940 Hawthorne 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 * Redondo Beach: Regular pickup through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rolling Hills: Regular pickup Jan. 10 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rolling Hills Estates: Curbside pickup at 6 a.m. Saturday. The Palos Verdes 
Recycling Center, 26301 Crenshaw Blvd., is accepting trees between 8 a.m. and 4 
p.m. through Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * Torrance: Regular pickup through Friday.

 FOREVER WILD: South Bay nature lovers got a late Christmas gift this year -- 
news that 28.5 acres on the Palos Verdes Peninsula will be preserved as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, part of a former cattle ranch, had been held by the Chandler Trust. 
It was transferred Thursday to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy and 
the city of Rolling Hills Estates. The transaction's purpose is to keep the 
land undeveloped in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big natural area, and that's the way it's going to be, forever," said 
conservancy President William Ailor. 
</P>
<P>
 The land consists of some low hills and a canyon near the former Dapplegray 
Intermediate School near the end of Empty Saddle, Strawberry, Buckskin and 
Clubview lanes. Most of the land falls within the borders of Rolling Hills 
Estates, although a two-acre piece is in Torrance. It is one of the largest 
pieces of open land remaining in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chandler Trust donated 20 acres to the land conservancy and sold another 
eight acres to the city for $1.4 million, which came from Proposition A funds.

 D.C. SHUFFLE: Once again, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who represents 
a large part of the coastal South Bay, will be sifting through resumes to find 
a new chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After only four months in the post, Harman's chief of staff, Kyle Zimmer, 
stepped down Friday to take a job with her old employer, Advocates for Highway 
and Auto Safety, a Washington auto safety lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer's predecessor, Bill Black, left to work for Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) 
after just eight months with Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, in Hilton Head, S.C., for the New Year's weekend, said Zimmer left 
because she was offered a higher-level job by her former employer. Harman 
downplayed the two-departures-a-year turnover in the chief-of-staff post. 
Overall, Harman said, "We have had little turnover on the staff."

IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME: HOME, SUITE HOME; LIFESTYLE: WORK-FROM-HOME GURUS 
LEAD A GROUNDSWELL OF 30 MILLION WHO COMMUTE FROM BEDROOM TO OFFICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Twenty years ago, Sarah Edwards saw her future. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively satisfied holder of a government job, Edwards had a meeting 
with a consultant who did something unusual. He worked out of his house. 
Edwards, the mother of a young son, loved the idea. "I could make my life work 
this way," she thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Edwards and her husband Paul, 53, are known as the gurus of the home 
office. Working out of their Santa Monica townhouse, the couple have written 
five books on the subject, including the bible of home-based business, "Working 
From Home." More than 35,000 subscribers participate in their 10-year-old 
Working from Home Forum on CompuServe information network. And on the radio and 
in a popular column for the magazine Home Office Computing, they offer tips on 
how to succeed in business without taking off your fuzzy slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, working at home is an idea whose time has come. More than 30 million 
Americans do it. But as the couple recall, it was relatively uncharted 
territory in 1974 when they quit their office jobs to try to make it on their 
own, Sarah as a home-based psychotherapist and Paul as a political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sensors told us this was something more and more people were going to be 
doing," Paul said. But the public was unconvinced. "The neighbors thought Paul 
was unemployed," Sarah said, laughing. There were few places to turn for advice 
when they became home business pioneers. Indeed, by quitting their day jobs 
before getting their home businesses established, they broke what has become 
one of their cardinal rules. But, for the most part, they say, their two 
decades of working where they live have been a pleasure, although there were 
years, Sarah said, when they spent more money than they earned. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three main reasons home businesses have taken off, according to 
Sarah. First, the high-powered, affordable home computer, the fax and other new 
technology, she says, "make it possible to have a first-rate office in your 
home." Second, a changing economy is fueling the trend. Large companies shed 4 
million employees during the 1980s, and layoffs continue despite an upturn in 
the economy as a whole. This year, Sarah said, there were one-third more 
corporate layoffs than in 1992. Finally, she believes, working from home (the 
term they prefer to "working at home") has taken off because Americans don't 
like working for other people. "Deep in their hearts," she said, "7 out of 10 
Americans say they want to be their own boss." 
</P>
<P>
 If any single development underpins the homework phenomenon, it's the 
computer, they say. Sarah recalled that they wrote the first draft of "Working 
From Home" on an IBM Selectric. The final draft was done on their first 
computer.  
</P>
<P>
 Today publishers routinely accept manuscripts on computer disc, but in that 
electronic Dark Age -- only a decade ago -- the publisher wanted only hard 
copy, and not copy produced on a dot-matrix printer, thank you. Sarah recalled 
that they had to fight to get a chapter on computers included in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 60% of all home businesses are computerized, Paul said. Able to 
interact with larger businesses as equals, these computerized small businesses 
are an increasingly vital segment of the economy. "Every minute a new home 
business is born," said Paul, who cites Apple and Day Runner as examples of 
innovative home-based businesses that made it big. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a boom in home-based businesses, the Edwardses published "Working 
From Home" in 1985. They have been in the business of advising home businesses 
and telecommuters full time ever since. Their books, filled with flow charts 
and checklists, deal with everything from determining whether you have the 
temperament to work at home (they strongly advise against working in bed) to 
the nuts and bolts of setting up a billing system. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits an enterprise based in Southern California, there is a New Age aura 
to some of their advice. In a list of instant energizers for the home-based 
worker who is beginning to wilt, they suggest giving yourself a 60-second round 
of applause (don't forget to stand up and take a bow). But the pointers can be 
utterly pragmatic as well. What to do about clients who never pay on time? The 
couple suggest giving them a discount if they pay within 30 days. If all else 
fails, the gurus advise charging the chronically tardy more than other clients 
because you are giving them financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edwardses promise to tell you "Everything You Need to Know About Living 
and Working Under the Same Roof" (the subtitle of their first book). This 
includes home office hygiene. Among the tips you least expect to find in a 
business book: using dark grout in tiled areas of your home office. This, they 
assure, "saves hours of bleaching and scrubbing." 
</P>
<P>
 On the more global question of whether you should let clients know that you 
work at home, they advise: not necessarily. They quote a home-based consultant 
who does not reveal that home is where her office is. "I work with Fortune 500 
companies," she said. "They're used to working with consultants who have 
Madison Avenue addresses. I don't actually know what they would think if they 
knew I was talking with them in my bathrobe, but I'd just as soon not find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple predict that by 2000 1 in 3 Americans will work at home at least 
part time. Young people who can't find conventional jobs and older workers who 
are losing theirs will make up a major part of this home-based work force. The 
couple note that the people who are most successful working from home are those 
who want to be there.  
</P>
<P>
 Ever the psychotherapist, Sarah urges anyone who finds himself or herself 
working at home because they have no choice, to shift their energy from the 
negative to the positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Take all that anger, frustration and disillusionment, she advises, "and 
channel it into creating the things that are in your heart."

GRADING OF HISTORIC PARKLAND IN SANTA SUSANAS IS INVESTIGATED; ARCHEOLOGY: 
FIVE-ACRE SITE LINKED TO A CHUMASH VILLAGE AND A STAGECOACH ROUTE IS BULLDOZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are investigating the apparently illegal grading of state parkland 
considered to have key historical and archeological significance as the site of 
a stagecoach route and a Native American settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials said Friday they haven't determined who bulldozed up to 
five acres on the rocky slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains -- in the process 
plowing across the Old Stage Coach Trail, which is on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 But park officials said the culprits could face criminal trespass and other 
charges, along with a civil suit for damages to rehabilitate the area below the 
Santa Susana Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal grading on parkland is not unheard of, but "I would say this is a 
major incident," said Rich Rozzelle, land agent for the Angeles district of the 
California Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage occurred on a 666-acre swath of state parkland south of the Simi 
Valley Freeway and west of the city of Los Angeles' Chatsworth Park South. 
State park officials hope eventually to turn the property into a state park or 
historic site. It is popular with hikers because of its striking rock 
formations and the old stage trail, portions of which are still visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozzelle, who inspected the damage by helicopter Friday, said he believes the 
grading took place Dec. 23 or 24, because hikers reported the damage was not 
there Dec. 22 but was evident Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Several utilities and government agencies have easements over the property and 
keys to a locked gate on Larwin Avenue -- apparently the access point for the 
bulldozer operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading widened an existing dirt track, transforming portions into an 
earthen boulevard 40 feet to 60 feet in width. Other grading took place near 
power poles and transmission towers that cross the property -- as if to create 
parking and turnaround areas for maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Barter, associate state archeologist with the parks department in 
Sacramento, said she had not inspected the site and could not comment on the 
extent of the damage. But she described the property as "a very significant 
site," touched by successive waves of human settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barter said the site has remnants of a Chumash village. Then beginning in the 
1860s, it bore the stage from Los Angeles to Gilroy on a trail blasted from 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the century, a rock quarry on the site provided sandstone for 
construction of important Los Angeles buildings and the breakwater in Los 
Angeles Harbor. Archeologists believe a crumbling foundation near the quarry 
was a commissary for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have there is a layer of history -- the Native American occupation, 
the early California period from 1860 or so, and the era when Los Angeles was 
expanding," Barter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt McAuley, a conservationist and author of hiking books, said the grading 
was so extensive it appeared to be "more than just a one-man operation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's highly irresponsible of anyone to disturb any soil without 
knowing what they are doing," he said. "Obviously they had no concept of what 
damage was being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to vegetation appeared limited, because the area already had been 
scorched by wildfire in October. But Suzanne Goode, associate resource 
ecologist with the state parks department, said the grading will slow the 
land's recovery from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the number of incidents such as this that I have seen in the parks 
in the past few years, it makes me wonder whether we will have any undisturbed 
patch of ground left 100 years from now," Goode said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think that once land becomes parkland that it is safe and 
protected, but this is far from the truth."

SPILLOVER; THE FUTURE; MCGRATH LEAK REVEALS HOLES IN RESPONSE EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after state and federal teams responded with textbook efficiency to 
Ventura County's worst oil spill in decades, officials at three government 
levels are deciding how to patch holes the leak exposed in local emergency 
procedures and in oil-field regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 While cleanup crews skimmed the remains of 84,000 gallons of crude oil from a 
lake at McGrath State Beach in Oxnard, state and federal lawmakers joined 
county officials in vowing that the lessons of last week are not quickly 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems -- and it's been a problem for years in the beach area -- 
is confusion about jurisdictional responsibility," said Oxnard-area county 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. "We need to make sure the (county) fire chief knows 
that an emergency is an emergency and -- regardless of where it is -- we have 
to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 A top county Fire Department official admitted last week that oil continued to 
leak from a Bush Oil Co. pipeline an extra day because fire dispatchers botched 
their response to a beachcomber's spill report Christmas Eve morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least six other local agencies also failed to dispatch investigators, 
including the city of Oxnard, in whose jurisdiction most of the spilled oil was 
discovered. Oxnard officials said Friday that they had not completed their 
review to determine responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said he plans to call a meeting of 
city and county officials within three weeks to review local response to oil 
spills. An elaborate countywide plan for responding to toxic hazards was 
apparently ignored after the Christmas Eve sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state level, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) 
said he will sponsor legislation needed to strengthen oil field regulations and 
to clarify which state agencies are responsible for the safety of tens of 
thousands of miles of oil pipeline in California -- on and off oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an aging infrastructure (of) pipeline transportation," O'Connell 
said. "And the concern here is that with the aging network, more spills could 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Assembly Natural Resources committee has agreed to hold 
fact-finding hearings in Ventura County if local officials want them, O'Connell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimate that Ventura County, which produces 4% of the state's 
oil, has hundreds of miles of large transportation pipelines. The county's 37 
oil fields contain thousands of miles more of low-pressure lines, including the 
ruptured Bush Oil pipeline. The locations of many of those pipelines are 
unmapped, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the threat posed by old pipelines, the state oil and gas agency is 
drafting rules to force pressure tests and anti-corrosion devices on many 
buried oil field pipelines.  
</P>
<P>
 Such lines, including the ruptured Oxnard line, are supposed to be operated at 
low pressures and now are virtually unregulated. The new regulations should be 
in place within a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the division of oil and gas in the state Department of 
Conservation have also requested an attorney general's opinion about whether 
the broken Oxnard line qualifies as a low-pressure oil field gathering line or 
should be considered a transportation line and more stringently regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Oxnard oil spill, government officials said numerous 
changes should result. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assistant County Fire Chief David Festerling said his agency, which runs the 
principal hazardous materials unit in the county, will change its procedures to 
guarantee that every reported spill is responded to, regardless of 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county Fire Department will begin reporting all oil spill sightings 
promptly to the state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento by calling a 
24-hour hot line, Festerling said. All local agencies are required by law to 
make such calls, but none did on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt, whose police and fire dispatchers thought 
another agency was responding to the early oil sighting at McGrath Lake, said 
he will resolve any confusion over Oxnard's jurisdiction and make sure the 
state hot line is called. His dispatchers said last week that they did not have 
the hot line number. They also said that McGrath Lake was outside their 
jurisdiction -- an assertion other agencies disputed. 
</P>
<P>
 * A top state parks official, in response to a McGrath State Park ranger's 
failure to check out another early spill tip, said his agency will now require 
rangers to telephone emergency agencies with such tips. Rangers will also be 
required to notify any nearby oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several state officials, including the state's top oil-spill response 
officer, have pledged to press Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature for new 
regulations to make sure pipeline-testing responsibilities are clear and that 
oil-field operators are forced to more carefully account for oil transferred 
through pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 A key question in the week-old oil-spill investigation is why Bush Oil Co. 
failed to detect a leak of about 600 barrels of crude oil per day for at least 
three days. Company officials have said they measured the amount of oil pumped 
through the ruptured line from one storage tank to another each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Bontadelli, administrator of state Fish and Game's oil spill prevention 
and response unit, said he will push to make such daily accounting a state 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond lessons learned and solutions proposed, the Oxnard spill showed how 
effectively state and federal governments can respond to a major coastal oil 
spill -- especially when luck is on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me to be a textbook response," said O'Connell who walked along 
the spill site two days after the spill's official discovery on Christmas Day. 
"And it couldn't have happened on a worse day." 
</P>
<P>
 Following procedures established in 1991 in response to a new federal law on 
marine oil spills, state Fish and Game's special oil spill unit was the lead 
agency in Oxnard. It joined the U.S. Coast Guard, the federal government's 
principal representative, to map strategies for response and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies are conducting investigations into the cause of the spill and 
responsibility for it. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been joined by more than a dozen other state, federal and local 
agencies with responsibilities in areas of emergency services, public health, 
fish and wildlife, tideland leases, wetlands restoration, ground water, ocean 
mammals and oil field supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Bush Oil parent company Berry Petroleum, whose insurance is 
responsible for the estimated $10-million cleanup, the Coast Guard and state 
Fish and Game have contracted with private companies to clean the ocean, shovel 
tar from seven miles of beach, skim oil from McGrath Lake and chop soiled reeds 
and willows in the brushy marshland. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush officials said Saturday that 138 birds had died in the spill, and an 
additional 48 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, state and federal response and cleanup have gone well. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpinteria-based contractor Clean Seas was mobilized within an hour after a 
U.S. Minerals Management Service helicopter spotted an oil slick of McGrath 
State Beach at 7:30 Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Minerals Management employees contacted both the state Office of Emergency 
Services and Fish and Game's oil spill unit by 9:20 and the Coast Guard by 
9:40. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean Seas began corralling oil slicks off McGrath beach by 10 a.m. and Bush 
Oil employees -- notified at 9:30 a.m. -- closed down the broken line by 10:15, 
shut off a lake-leveling pump that was funneling oil to the ocean by 10:45 and 
began cleanup by 11 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 p.m., eight boats and 80 workers were on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean cleanup lasted two days, and the beach cleanup is nearing completion. 
About 63,000 of the 84,000 gallons that spilled had been recovered by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard Cmdr. Jim Rutkovsky, chief of port operations in a five-county Los 
Angeles region, said fate had a hand in how well the cleanup has gone. Nearly 
all of the leaked oil flowed down a farmland drainage channel to McGrath Lake, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't dealt with a spill before that had a containment lake waiting for 
it," Rutkovsky said. "It is good luck. (Otherwise) we would probably have 40 or 
50 miles of beach to deal with rather than seven or eight." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutkovsky said there have been minor glitches in cleanup, but he wouldn't cite 
any. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact we have had to respond in almost every environment -- some 
ocean skimming, beach cleanup, the lake contamination, a marsh and a creek and 
some hydrological impacts, I'm very happy," he said. "It's gone very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutkovsky said he still expects estimates of the amount of oil leaked to rise 
somewhat. "My gut keeps telling me there's got to be a higher number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard's work at the spill site will be done in a week or two, 
Rutkovsky said. But first his investigators must be sure that oil is no longer 
a threat to navigable waters, that all surface oil is removed from the water 
and that the source of the spill has been positively identified and any further 
threat eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, white-suited workers cleared brush along the west side of Harbor 
Boulevard, just north of Gonzales Road, in preparation for excavation of the 
ruptured pipeline, scheduled to begin today. State officials have said 
corrosion is the most likely cause of the break in the pipeline, which is 30 to 
40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game officials will stay on much longer, continuing to clean 
and test marshland and McGrath Lake and plotting a strategy for long-term 
restoration of wetlands once rich in birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom of McGrath Lake may have to be mechanically scraped if 
contamination is severe. The lake was home to egrets, sandpipers and the 
endangered California brown pelican and snowy plover. It is also a wintering 
spot to as many as 30 species of ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game lawyers also must decide whether to ask the district attorney's 
office to file criminal negligence charges against Bush Oil or its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fish and Game lawyers could seek civil penalties of up to 
$250,000 through the state attorney general. The company might also be charged 
an administrative penalty of $10 for each gallon of oil spilled and not 
recovered. State water quality control officials said they may also seek stiff 
fines under different laws. 
</P>
<P>
 As state and federal officials continued to investigate the spill, local 
officials said they plan to shore up their end of the statewide emergency 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County spent years charting plans and procedures for responding to 
hazardous material spills, even establishing a four-person office of emergency 
services as a liaison in the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Haddock, the office's assistant director, said the plans would have 
worked had they been followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like everybody and their mother was notified," Haddock said, "so 
it's just a question of, 'Are you going to send somebody out?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At least seven local public safety agencies were contacted about a 
beachcomber's report of an oil spill a day before the formal alarm was sounded 
Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 None sent an investigator to check out the report, allowing hundreds more 
barrels of oil to escape. The U.S. Coast Guard, which was also in the loop, 
dispatched a ship, but seamen saw no oil on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials, the local response was botched because each agency 
assumed -- or was told -- that another agency would follow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura electrician Bruce Fincher, whose dog walked into oily McGrath Lake 
just north of the Edison power plant, said he called the Channel Islands Harbor 
Patrol about 10 a.m. Christmas Eve day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fincher said he was referred to a sheriff's dispatcher, who subsequently 
notified an Oxnard police and fire dispatcher and the California Highway 
Patrol. The CHP serves as state Fish and Game's dispatcher on holidays. 
However, Christmas Eve was not a Fish and Game holiday, so the call could have 
gone directly to Fish and Game, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard dispatcher said she was told that the sheriff's dispatcher was 
calling as a courtesy because the spill was near Oxnard but that Fish and Game 
would respond to it. As it turned out, the oil spill was in both Oxnard and 
county jurisdictions, and apparently no one ever reached a Fish and Game 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP dispatcher, meanwhile, notified the county Fire Department, as is 
routine when that agency discovers toxic spills. The county Fire Department 
dispatcher notified the Coast Guard and dispatchers in Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Fire Chief Festerling said his dispatchers assumed Oxnard 
would cover the call, because McGrath Lake is their jurisdiction. Still, 
Festerling said his agency should have made sure Oxnard was responding. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police routinely respond to calls from the McGrath State Beach 
campground, and an officer patrols the beach itself, which is only about 100 
yards from McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials said Friday that they were not certain about jurisdiction. 
But both an Oxnard dispatcher and a police watch commander said Friday that 
they are still convinced McGrath Lake is not their jurisdiction. However, maps 
show that nearly all of the soiled lake is within the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is make it very clear who is responsible for what and to 
make sure it gets done," Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said late Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever we can to prevent this sort of thing from ever occurring 
again," Lopez said.

CANDIDATES ALREADY ARE GEARING UP FOR PRIMARY; POLITICS: LEADERS OF BOTH 
PARTIES AGREE THAT OUTCOME OF JUNE RACES MAY HINGE ON VOTER SATISFACTION WITH 
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND GOV. PETE WILSON.

<P>
 Although primary elections are six months away, candidates are already lining 
up on both sides of the political field to run for various legislative and 
congressional seats representing Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective candidates are also jockeying for a host of city and countywide 
offices, which this year will include everything from two east county 
supervisorial positions to sheriff and district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two longtime Ventura County politicians are making bids for 
statewide office. State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) will compete for the 
GOP nomination for lieutenant governor, while former Republican Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock of Thousand Oaks will run for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic and Republican leaders agree that the county's legislative and 
congressional races could hinge on Ventura County voters' satisfaction with the 
performance of Democratic President Clinton and Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two questions in 1994 will be: Does Clinton perform strongly? And, does 
the economy pick up in California?" said Bob Larkin, chairman of Ventura 
County's Republican Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, a strong supporter of Clinton's economic 
program, has already attracted four Republicans who are considering bids to 
oppose the veteran congressman. Beilenson, a Woodland Hills resident, 
represents a district that includes most of Thousand Oaks, Malibu and portions 
of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those eyeing the Beilenson seat are Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park 
banking consultant and the only officially announced Republican candidate; 
Richard Sybert, a former senior aide to Gov. Wilson; Bill Spillane, a Thousand 
Oaks pilot, and Mark B. Benhard of Agoura, a former assistant to former Rep. 
William K. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
 "My candidacy is not meant as any disrespect for Tony," Hammer said. "But 
California is continuing to languish. And somebody's been in charge around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has stepped forward yet to challenge Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) in the 23rd Congressional District that covers nearly all of Ventura 
County except for most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly predicted President Clinton's defense cuts, which threaten to further 
damage an already battered California economy, would only boost Republican 
candidates chances in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans are going to do better this year," said Gallegly, whose 
district's voter registration is 45% Republican and 43% Democratic. "It's an 
off-election year and Clinton has done a great deal to help the Republican 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hank Starr, chairman of Ventura County's Democratic Central Committee, 
dismissed Gallegly's predictions as nothing more than partisan bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the end of the Cold War, everybody agrees that much has to be cut in 
defense," he said. "Of course California's ox is going to be gored. California 
for years has had the highest expenditures in defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr predicted that Gov. Wilson, who he said will be fighting for his 
political life in November, will be a liability to Republican candidates 
seeking other political office. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Bush years, Wilson took a position on the extreme right," Starr 
said. "Since then, he's tried to move further to the center. In the process, he 
hasn't made any friends on the Democratic side, and has only angered the 
far-right wing of his own party. All told, Wilson has never looked worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the key legislative, county and city elections 
coming up this year. State Senate District 18 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to replace his political mentor in the state Senate, Democratic 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) is already running hard for the seat 
being vacated by retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). Hart's 18th 
District includes Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and other portions of northern 
Ventura County and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, who has already amassed $300,000 in campaign contributions, said 
his biggest challenge will be getting his name known to voters in San Luis 
Obispo County. But he said he began walking precincts in that northern end of 
the district in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats hold no significant advantage over registered Republicans 
in the district -- 43% to 41% -- O'Connell said the numbers are not that 
different from those in his 35th Assembly District, where he has won six 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a lot of bipartisan support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's only announced challenger is Republican Steve Mac Elvaine, a 
cattle rancher and former San Luis Obispo County supervisor. Other possible 
Republican candidates include Santa Barbara County Supervisor Mike Stoker, 
California Energy Commissioner Charles R. Imbrecht and Assemblywoman Andrea 
Seastrand. Assembly District 35 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's decision to run for the state Senate leaves his 35th Assembly 
District seat up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Santa Barbara winery owner Brooks Firestone is the only Republican to 
announce his candidacy in the district, which encompasses Ventura, Santa Paula, 
Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Councilman Greg Carson, who hinted early on that he might run, 
said instead he plans to support Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Bob Ream, an aide to state Sen. Hart, and Mindy 
Lorenz, a former Green Party candidate who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last 
year, have said they will run. Solvang City Councilwoman Carol Anders is also 
expected to compete for the Democratic nomination. Assembly Districts 37-38 
</P>
<P>
 No one has yet stepped forward to challenge the reelection bid of 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), whose 38th District includes 
Fillmore and Simi Valley, or Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), whose 37th 
District encompasses most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs and crime were the No. 1 issues when I went to Sacramento three years 
ago, and they're still the No. 1 issues," said Boland, who has helped push 
through a handful of crime-fighting laws. Local Elections 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Ventura County, voters will go to the polls in June to decide who 
will replace county Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who recently announced she 
will not seek reelection. Supervisor Vicky Howard, who was elected at the same 
time as VanderKolk, said she will seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, anti-tax activist H. Jere Robings is the only one to announce his 
candidacy for VanderKolk's seat, representing a district stretching from the 
Conejo Valley to Port Hueneme. Other potential candidates include Thousand Oaks 
Councilman Frank Schillo and former Supervisor Madge Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbara Williamson said she is considering 
challenging Howard for the supervisor's seat, which represents Simi Valley, 
Moorpark and the Santa Clara Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been approached (to run) by a number of people," Williamson said. 
"Certainly the support is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other county offices up for election this year include sheriff, district 
attorney, auditor-controller, assessor, county clerk-recorder, treasurer, 
county superintendent of schools and four Superior Court and two Municipal 
Court judgeships. Most incumbents, including Sheriff Larry Carpenter and Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, are expected to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, voters in every city except Ventura will fill at least two city 
council seats in November, while voters in Simi Valley, Moorpark and Oxnard 
will also elect mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton has already said he is considering a 
run for county auditor-controller against incumbent Thomas O. Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton says he believes that the auditor's office should be taking a more 
aggressive stance in managing the county's $836-million budget. Mahon, a 
no-nonsense administrator who was appointed to the auditor-controller's 
position a year ago, says his office has never performed better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on top of things," said Mahon, who previously served as assistant 
auditor-controller for 19 years. "This is an office that requires an individual 
with an extensive financing, accounting and auditing background. And with all 
my years in office, I'm confident I have that." 
</P>
<P>
 The new year will also include elections for seats on the Ventura County Board 
of Education and the Community College District as well as 17 of the county's 
20 school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District, where sex education has been a major 
topic of debate, and the predominantly Latino Oxnard School District, which has 
been torn by racial tensions among its school board members, promise to have 
some of the most lively campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists said they are hoping this will be the year that Latinos 
finally win a majority on the five-member Oxnard school board. Two board 
members will stand for reelection, a third has decided to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Barreto, who is up for reelection, and Susan Alvarez are the only two 
Latinos on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Jim Suter, who is also up for reelection, said he believes 
tensions on the board have been blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need a majority of this or that," he said. "It's just a 
personality thing. I think we can work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto said problems on the board run much deeper than personality squabbles. 
She said she wants to see other minorities represented on the board. "We don't 
want to take over the board," she said. "We just want balanced representation." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Jack Fowler said he will not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen water, sanitation, health care and park districts -- stretching from 
Thousand Oaks to Ojai -- will also hold elections in 1994. The districts' 
boards are responsible for approving service fee hikes, bond issues and 
assessments.

SPILLOVER; THE PAST; DEVELOPMENT, DISASTERS TAKE WETLANDS TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disastrous oil spill at McGrath State Beach that damaged several acres of 
valuable marshland was only the latest blow to Ventura County's fragile and 
dwindling wetlands -- ecosystems so complex that they take decades to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the losses in recent years, however, have been to development rather 
than accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of wetlands, which support wildlife and act as a natural filtering 
system to purify ground water, have been gobbled up by a new jail, a widened 
freeway, a new freeway connector, farming along the Santa Clara River and sand 
and gravel mining. 
</P>
<P>
 And many, many more acres are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Developments are either planned or proposed that would surround, destroy or 
otherwise affect wetlands in the canyons of Whiteface Mountain north of Simi 
Valley, on 500 acres in Moorpark, at Ahmanson Ranch east of Thousand Oaks and 
along the white sands of Ormond Beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are heavy rains in the coming months, the wetlands at Point Mugu, the 
county's largest coastal marsh, could be threatened by runoff of silt from the 
nearby mountains denuded in the Green Meadow wildfire. There has been no major 
damage yet, but the county has not yet experienced its full rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wetlands are so scarce in California anymore that any we have left are 
valuable," said Heidi Togstad, environmental specialist with the California 
Department of Fish and Game's oil spill prevention and response team. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Berry Petroleum acknowledged that before Christmas, about 84,000 
gallons of heavy crude oil spilled into a drainage ditch that feeds McGrath 
Lake. A pump was switched on at the lake that sent some of the oil through an 
underground line, operated by Berry Petroleum subsidiary Bush Oil, that emptied 
into an ocean outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Togstad, who is in charge of the natural resources damage assessment at 
McGrath State Beach, said it may take months or years to assess the damage to 
the wetlands there that surround tiny McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 To restore the wetlands may take decades, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on the extent of damage, and we don't know that yet," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy, thick, sticky oil that workers removed from the lake with 
pitchforks and shovels, carries both positive and negative implications for 
long-term cleanup of the site, Togstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, the oil's consistency prevented it from deeply penetrating 
lakeside brush, sparing the native tules and other reeds that surround the east 
side of the lake and provide refuge for ducks and other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heavy crude oil clings to the salt grass and any dry parts of plants 
it touches, and suffocates many of the animals that come in contact with oily 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil spread from bank to bank, but at least it didn't get as far back into 
the tules as it could have," Togstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Togstad and her team continue to assess damage to the area, others will 
begin working on a plan to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration plan will be written, implemented and monitored under the 
supervision of Fish and Game, said Pete Bontadelli, administrator of the office 
of spill prevention and response, which shares responsibility with the U.S. 
Coast Guard as lead agencies in the investigation and cleanup of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berry Petroleum will ultimately be responsible for paying for it and it will 
always be monitored by state and federal agencies," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said damage to the nearby beach will probably be short term because the 
thick oil was easily picked up from the sand in clumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the oil that washed up on the beach has already been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetlands are a matter of greater concern because they are more complex, more 
difficult to clean up. Workers were attempting to draw the oil into the center 
of McGrath Lake with large booms spread on the water, trying to keep the oil 
away from the lake's edge and the surrounding wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the oil clung to the reeds. And as more of the oil was pumped out 
of the lake and the water level lowered, more of the lakeside vegetation was 
exposed and fouled with oil, said Jim Hardwick, a biologist with Fish and Game 
who was working on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to minimize the fluctuation of the lake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas of the county, the destruction of wetlands is less dramatic, 
but just as damaging, said Cathy Brown, biologist with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been recent cases in which at least two growers extended their 
citrus orchards farther into the flood plain of the Santa Clara River than 
legally allowed, Brown said, destroying wetlands habitat along the river's 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are proposals from sand and gravel miners to excavate some 
seven miles along the Santa Clara, about 50 miles of which runs through Ventura 
County on its way to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the largest cumulative impact I can think of," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Whiteface Mountain development is neither near the ocean nor 
along a major river. But the canyons collect water and form seasonal streams 
that create marshy areas, which in turn support wildlife, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Removing a small wetlands which is a relatively small part of an open space 
can have a disproportionately large effect on wildlife," she said. "All 
wildlife need water." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Lightfoot, advance planning manager for the city of Simi Valley, said 
the wetlands areas in the project will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is to preserve the riparian character of the wetlands to the 
greatest extent possible," Lightfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's developer has agreed to spend $3 million to create wildlife 
corridors so that mule deer, coyotes, gray foxes, bobcats and other creatures 
of the chaparral can still reach the marshy areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Carlsberg Development in Moorpark, developers want to put 552 homes on 
500 acres, which would essentially wipe out a vernal pool, a pond that fills in 
the spring and nurtures a unique set of plants and animals, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They attract a number of wading birds and amphibians," Brown said. In 
addition, the vernal pool also supports a type of grass that is being 
considered for listing as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the new Ventura County Jail, under construction along the Santa 
Clara River near Santa Paula, does not include habitat of particularly high 
value for endangered species, as some opponents of the project have said, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people who don't want a development will rally around the wetlands 
when they didn't care about them before," she said. She said claims that there 
were bald eagles nesting on the jail site came from "overzealous 
anti-development types." 
</P>
<P>
 But the site and more land nearby does have a small amount of valuable 
wetlands habitat, and the small losses add up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Ranch proposal calls for businesses and 3,050 homes on 2,800 
acres in the rolling Simi Hills and would wipe out 338 acres of rare needle 
grass and eliminate wildlife habitat along Las Virgenes Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson, Whiteface and Carlsberg proposals include homes as well as golf 
courses. Brown said there is a trend in development to replace wetlands with 
golf courses as a type of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nothing native or biologically significant can live its life on a golf 
course," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A development proposed at Ormond Beach in Oxnard has potential to cause 
another major loss of wetlands if it is ever built, Brown said. The developer 
there at one time proposed marinas, hotels, homes and shopping complexes, but 
has not presented a final plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ormond Beach is one of the county's most important wetlands," she said. If 
the area were developed, "That would be a loss of statewide significance." 
</P>
<P>
 The widening of California 126 has destroyed a few acres of habitat along the 
Santa Clara River as bridges were widened. And the connector that linked 
California highways 118 and 23 in Moorpark disrupted a wetlands along the 
Arroyo Simi, a stream fed by treated waste water from a nearby treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But in that case, the California Department of Transportation committed to a 
costly project to create a wetlands near the destroyed site. And that project 
has been largely successful, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that with a lot of planning and a lot of money, you can restore or 
create a wetlands," she said. "But the project cost runs from $10,000 to 
$100,000 per acre." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the spill at McGrath Lake could end up affecting the wildlife and 
significant wetlands habitats at the Santa Clara River estuary, less than a 
mile north of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The endangered least tern, which is wintering farther south and has not yet 
been affected by the spill, nests at the estuary and probably at the lake, 
Brown said. The area also supports pelicans, herons, egrets and snowy plovers, 
among other birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the spill could have been more damaging to wetlands and wildlife if 
it had happened in the spring, when terns are foraging to feed their young and 
coots are teaching their chicks to swim. But she said the effects of the spill 
are likely to linger into spring, possibly forcing wildlife from McGrath Lake 
into the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps that will cause more competition for food or nesting and roosting 
places" at the mouth of the river, Brown said.

GALLEGLY IS KEY FOE OF FDA'S VITAMIN RULES; SIMI VALLEY: THE GOP CONGRESSMAN 
HAS EMERGED AS LEADER OF EFFORT TO MINIMIZE NEW LABELING REQUIREMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly, who says his total dietary supplement intake is Vitamin C 
when he feels a cold coming on, has become a champion of the $4-billion 
industry in its high-profile battle to minimize new labeling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Republican has staked out a position that is even more 
aggressive than that of the supplement industry's two leading congressional 
advocates, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). 
Gallegly has done so by sponsoring a bill that Hatch had introduced in the last 
Congress but has since moderated. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such legislation, Gallegly said in an Oct. 6 letter to Richardson, 
"Millions of consumers will soon be unable to obtain the vitamins, minerals, 
herbs, fish oils and other supplements that they have been relying on and 
require for their nutritional needs and their personal health." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of dire warning has been criticized by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), a leader in the House of Representatives on health issues, and the 
Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the dietary supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Gallegly is echoing industry "scare tactics" that falsely accuse the 
FDA of seeking to limit access to vitamins, minerals and herbs. Rather, they 
insist that the agency is merely trying to protect consumers from fraudulent 
and even harmful health claims by some companies that their products can do 
everything from cure cancer to reverse the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some ingredients marketed as dietary supplements have demonstrated serious or 
even life-threatening hazards," the FDA said in a July report that the industry 
maintains overstated the problem. "As a result, millions of Americans are 
spending billions of dollars every year on dietary supplement products, many of 
which have shown little or no evidence of either safety or effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the FDA issued new rules that would require dietary supplement 
makers to provide hard evidence -- under the same truth-in-labeling standards 
that apply to most foods -- for any health claims they make for their products. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David Kessler said that, in contrast to industry warnings, 
the rules do not take any supplements off the shelves or require a prescription 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers should have access to dietary supplements that are truthfully 
labeled and marketed," Kessler said. "These rules enable the public to make 
informed choices. They will not restrict access." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, however, has indicated that he shares the view of many in the 
industry that the FDA is not to be trusted with too much regulatory authority. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Richardson, he said, "This is an agency that has a dismal 
record of approving any health claims for new dietary supplement products and 
is biased, in the view of many in the industry, against dietary supplements or 
any other products for which a prescription is not required." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently spurred by the concerns of constituents and smaller supplement 
manufacturers, Gallegly has become a player in a complex issue that has aroused 
widespread alarm among the millions of Americans who regularly take dietary 
supplements. Nothing else has sparked so much mail to lawmakers in recent 
months -- much of it encouraged by vitamin makers and health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent critic of what he regards as excessive regulation of business, 
Gallegly calls this is a case of "the government thinking it's smarter than the 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gallegly is better known for his legislation to crack down on illegal 
immigration, he has quietly become the House's leading Republican proponent of 
the dietary supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He discussed the issue briefly in an interview in early December. But in 
recent weeks, he has not returned phone calls seeking further elaboration of 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the battle concerns implementation of the 1990 food-labeling law 
authored by Waxman that treats supplements as foods. The standard set by the 
law is that health claims be supported by "significant scientific agreement" 
among qualified experts. 
</P>
<P>
 This requires manufacturers to obtain the FDA's approval that each product 
meets this test before using the claim to market it. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry pressure, however, led to a moratorium while Congress attempted to 
devise regulations. Negotiations have thus far been inconclusive and the 
moratorium ended on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new regulations proposed by the FDA will not take effect until July 1. 
Pushed by pro-industry lawmakers, Congress is expected to refocus on the issue 
when it returns from its winter break later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has harnessed an unusual coalition of right-wing libertarians 
and left-leaning New Age activists who share an interest in alternative 
medicine," said Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, a national consumer advocacy group that strongly supports 
the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "There has been a longstanding tradition in American society of 
resistance to traditional medicine. It's often been called the 'health freedom 
movement' and Congressman Gallegly would seem to represent that part of the 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Silverglade added: "The freedom to choose alternative medicine doesn't 
mean much if it's influenced by misleading marketing hype on dietary supplement 
labels." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet without a legislative remedy, Gallegly has warned, "those small businesses 
and entrepreneurs who produce dietary supplements are going to be saddled with 
costly and cumbersome new rules" that could prove financially insurmountable. 
He says he wants to see the burden of proof for fraudulent claims and product 
safety, or the lack thereof, placed on the FDA -- not the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FDA does not prevent people from eating conventional food products that 
are high in calories, cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium and caffeine, so it 
should not attempt to impose unreasonable and unnecessary regulations on 
dietary supplements that many consumers want and many health professionals 
recommend," Gallegly said in a Jan. 12, 1993, letter to his House colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced legislation in the last Congress, written by Hatch, that would 
give the industry far greater leeway to make health claims. Gallegly 
reintroduced the bill last January. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Health Freedom Act" permits a manufacturer to make a claim if it is 
"truthful and not misleading and there is scientific evidence, whether 
published or unpublished, that provides a reasonable basis for such claim." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill prohibits any requirement that the manufacturer obtain 
approval prior to making the claim. Gallegly has subsequently become a 
co-sponsor of a similar bill by Rep. Richardson that gives the FDA 30 days 
notice before a product is marketed with a specific claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA opposes Richardson's proposal, which has more than 200 sponsors. 
Gallegly has more than 60 sponsors; all but one are Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will weaken FDA's ability to make sure that dietary supplements 
are safe and properly labeled," said Mitch Zeller, FDA special assistant for 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of the FDA deciding whether there's enough science to support the 
claim, the companies would do so and that really turns the last 50 years of 
food and drug law on its head. It's not practicable, it's not feasible and it's 
just not good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Zeller said under the weaker scientific standard, a company 
"could conceivably make a health claim relying on a preliminary study of a 
couple of dozen people as long as it was truthfully described even though it is 
inconceivable that one study could establish the scientific validity of a 
relationship between a nutrient and a disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 years as a consumer advocate, congressional investigator and FDA 
employee, Zeller said that he hasn't seen "any evidence of bias" by the agency 
against the supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the FDA remains the enemy to many of those whose cause Gallegly 
has espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is representing what the majority of his constituents want," said Elliott 
Balbert, chairman of Natrol Inc., a medium-sized Chatsworth vitamin company, 
who has met with Gallegly several times on the issue. Gallegly represented 
Chatsworth prior to the 1992 electoral reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Balbert said Gallegly's 23rd District "includes a very, very active consumer 
base that utilizes dietary supplements. . . . I'm sure that's what aroused his 
constituency to contact him." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Ray Miller, a Virginia-based lobbyist for the National Council for 
Improved Health, which represents smaller supplement manufacturers and 
physicians who use herbal and other alternative therapies, has also worked with 
Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the lawmaker "has a sense of what's the proper exercise of authority 
in the Food and Drug Administration." He called Gallegly's bill "perfect" 
because it would accomplish the legislative goals of those in the nutritional 
therapy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Less enthusiastic is Ventura County's other congressman, who comes down on the 
other side of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), whose 24th District includes 
most of Thousand Oaks, said he supports the right of consumers to retain access 
to vitamins and other supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he also backs the powers that Congress gave the FDA to regulate 
the supplement industry under the 1990 food labeling act. Richardson's bill, he 
said, "puts a huge burden of proof on the regulators to disprove claims these 
people are making, rather than the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a torrent of calls and letters from anxious constituents who rely 
on supplements, Beilenson added: "The easiest thing for a member to do is to 
sign onto" the pro-industry proposals. "You please 8,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he has talked to supplement manufacturers in his district about 
the FDA's authority under the 1990 measure and "they're not able to show me a 
single item of theirs that has been, or will be, banned."

HOW WELL DO YOU REMEMBER 1??3

<P>
 Last year is dwindling in the rear-view mirror, tumbling down the memory hole, 
shuffling off to the Valhalla of Used Eras to await the whimsical verdict of 
the nostalgia gods. 
</P>
<P>
 A serious year in many respects, a time when San Fernando Valley residents 
were left dazed by streaks of crime, felt the heat of a catastrophic fire, and 
elected their guy mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also the year when "bring on the clowns" meant clapping Bozo in 
jail, a year when men's swimsuit fashion broke strange new ground. It was a 
year of momentous court actions, when Elvis turned up in a tabloid murder 
trial, when another trial debated actor Michael J. Fox's taste in date-trap 
decor, a year when the irresistible force of political correctness encountered 
the immovable object of a fireman reading Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, you haven't forgotten already? After all the work we did bringing 
those stories to you? You're sure? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, just to reassure us, let's see how well you do on this little pop quiz 
on some of the high points of Valley Life in this past year that some of us 
will never forget -- no matter how hard we try. 
</P>
<P>
 So, put yourself to the test: What did you learn from 1993? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1 - Kevin McCandless was left breathless and sore-handed in November because 
he:  
</P>

prostitution and the shortage of parking places. 
</P>
<P>
 * b) Played 180 holes of golf in 12 hours in a publicity stunt to raise money 
for Midwest flood victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * c) Found that his scheme to power a light commuter aircraft with wild geese, 
Velcroed to the fuselage, had certain design flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2 - Even Elvis Presley figured in the Menendez brothers' murder trial when 
jurors were treated to a tape of Beverly Hills psychologist L. Jerome Oziel 
crooning one of The King's melodies for his then-lover, Judalon Smith. The song

</P>
<P>
 * a) "Heartbreak Hotel" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<P>
 * b) A homeowner group's covenant prohibits photo-taking or descriptions of 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 * c) During filming of "The Ten Commandments," actor Charlton Heston, playing 
Moses, parted the "Red Sea" waters there, and the studio is preserving it for 
the sequel.

<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6 - Who was Tiburcio Vasquez and why were people talking about him last year?  
</P>
<P>
 * a) A locally active Old West bandit; officials in Acton-Agua Dulce

poor role model in an era when children are all too prone to gunslinging,

issue in Senate hearings on the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas.

while planting begonias. 
</P>

 * 
</P>
<P>
 7 - In December, an Antelope Valley firefighter filed a lawsuit, alleging that 
his First Amendment rights were violated because county supervisors banned all 
sexually explicit material from the firehouse, including Playboy, a monthly he 
reads religiously. His rationale was that:  
</P>
<P>
 * a) He subscribes for the in-depth articles and amusing cartoons, and there 
just happen to be these pictures of nude women among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * b) To assist the department's affirmative action program, he is searching 
for pictures of women who appear rugged enough to pass its tough admission 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 * c) The centerfolds are pinned up inside his locker, where they cannot be 
seen by anyone who might be offended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 10 - An appeals court last June overturned the disturbing the peace conviction 
of a Santa Clarita Valley man who had pinned an angry note on the van of a 
sheriff's deputy who had issued him a traffic ticket. The court concluded that 
the note's message did not amount to "fighting words." The note said:  
</P>
<P>
 * a) "Deputy J. Banks can suck my duck." 
</P>
<P>
 * b) "L.A. Sheriffs -- They treat you like a King."

LANCASTER MAY GET TOUGH WITH VENDORS WHO CONVERGE NEAR CAMPUSES; REGULATIONS: 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS' COMPLAINTS SPUR THE CITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW POLICIES GOVERNING 
THOSE SELLING FROM SIDEWALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by complaints from school officials, the city of Lancaster is 
investigating whether to toughen policies governing street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the City Council directed its legal office to review ordinances 
dealing with street peddlers, particularly with regard to the vendors' 
proximity to public schools. The council's request came after Lancaster School 
District officials, labeling the presence of campus-close vendors a "nuisance," 
asked the city to strengthen present regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support the vendors' right to operate a business," Supt. David Alvarez 
said in a letter to the city dated Dec. 8. "However, some restrictions are 
needed to ensure safe and orderly operation of our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said the sidewalk sales of ice cream, candy and other products have 
caused students to cut class to buy an item and have also put would-be 
purchasers at risk of being hurt in the heavy traffic surrounding the campus 
immediately before and after school. Requests that they park their vehicles 
farther away have gone unheeded by vendors, the schools chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of them there right after school, so it can be a distraction 
for the kids as well as an issue of traffic safety," trustee Greg Tepe said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Alvarez recommended that those who hawk their goods on city 
streets be kept 1,000 feet from campus throughout the school day and for half 
an hour on either end. Such a change in city policy would affect the Lancaster 
School District's 14 elementary and junior high campuses as well as eight 
schools in the Eastside and Antelope Valley Union High school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 City spokeswoman Nancy Walker said street vending is regulated by city and 
zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 All vendors must have a business license but cannot park and sell in 
residential or commercial neighborhoods. They are restricted to public-access 
property or privately held areas with consent of the owner. Any business owner 
can ask a vendor to move if he or she is stationed directly outside the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 No other regulations exist specifically for street vendors beyond that, except 
for a general prohibition on door-to-door solicitation between 6 p.m. and 9 
a.m., Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting last Monday, the council asked the city attorney's office to 
draft recommendations for strengthening rules directly related to street 
vending, with special attention paid to the needs of schools. The 
recommendations will probably be presented at the council's Jan. 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Any change in municipal ordinance will also require a public hearing. But at 
this point, Walker said, "as far as I know, we haven't heard from any vendors 
on this subject." 
</P>
<P>
 The city boasts 36 licensed street vendors, who mostly sell ice cream or drive 
catering trucks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves to toughen restrictions on sidewalk peddling come at a time when the 
practice is undergoing scrutiny -- both negative and positive -- in other Los 
Angeles County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Burbank officials outlawed street vending from pushcarts 
and also ordered a plan drafted to allow authorities to seize the equipment of 
those who violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Los Angeles, the City Council recently capped a long-running debate by 
approving a pilot program to license and regulate street vendors in certain 
commercial zones.

RESEDA BLAZE DAMAGES 2 BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters battled an attic fire Saturday night that damaged two commercial 
buildings in Reseda, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven engines were called to the fire in the 17600 block of Sherman Way, near 
White Oak Avenue, department spokesman Bob Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began outside one of the buildings shortly after 8:30 p.m., then 
spread to an attic over Vick's Custom Cycle shop and My Gym, Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other details, including the cause of the fire or damage estimates, were 
unavailable Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported.

MAN CHARGED IN FREEWAY DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Burbank man was killed early Saturday when he was struck by 
another motorist as he changed a flat tire on the side of the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the wayward car, identified by the California Highway Patrol as 
Chance Petersen, 25, of North Hollywood, was charged with felony drunk driving 
and vehicular manslaughter, said CHP Officer Bill Granados. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen was being held in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center, where 
he was taken with injuries suffered in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the victim, who was declared dead at the scene, was withheld 
pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 3:48 a.m. when Petersen's Oldsmobile Cutlass drifted 
onto the shoulder of the southbound side of the freeway, just south of Plummer 
Street, and struck the victim's Toyota Celica, Granados said.

 After 23 hours of labor, Ventura resident Laura Patton gave birth early Sunday 
to Ventura County's first baby of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing 7 3/4 pounds, pink-faced George Eugene Patton was born a week late, 
at 12:30 a.m. at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready for it," his 36-year-old mother said. "We've been ready for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a green-trimmed white knit cap, George snuggled in his mother's arms, 
hiccuping quietly as Laura and her husband, Troy, 48, discussed the baby's 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where those ears came from," said Laura, who works as a bank 
teller. "They look sort of like one of our cousin's." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, a state parks maintenance worker, said the couple named their first 
child after a great uncle, who coincidentally has the same name as the World 
War II general. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a gruff old, rough old, ornery kind of person," Troy said of the uncle. 
"But underneath he's got a good heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy said he was delighted with his son but had hoped he would be born in 
1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice if he had come in December for tax purposes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura said she's glad her baby is a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fun," she said. "They like to go fishing and run and do grubby 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura said she was looking forward to resting after the long, difficult 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nap sounds pretty good right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin, Steve Lyle, said he remained at the hospital with the Pattons during 
the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time I saw a lady in labor," he said. "I now have no doubt 
that the female sex is the stronger one." SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; PILOT WHO CRASHED DROWNED, CORONER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
 The pilot of a small plane that lost power just after takeoff from Santa Paula 
Airport Friday drowned when the aircraft crashed into the shallow water of the 
Santa Clara River, a deputy coroner said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Michael Dirkers, 26, of North Carolina, was a member of a helicopter 
squadron based at Point Mugu Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirkers' brother -- 24-year-old Peter Dirkers -- was a passenger in the 
two-seat airplane. He was flown to Ventura County Medical Center and was 
reported in good condition Saturday with head injuries and a compound hip 
fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers lived aboard a boat in Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane went down about 3:30 p.m. Friday about 600 yards south of Steckel 
Drive after apparently losing power and trying to turn back toward the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula police officers Friday located the burning single-engine aircraft 
upside down in about four feet of water. Peter Dirkers managed to free himself 
from the wreckage by the time rescue personnel arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration investigators on Saturday were looking into 
the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dirkers was a member of the Helicopter Combat Support Special Squadron 
Five at Point Mugu. The unit, which is trained to search for and rescue downed 
pilots, was deployed during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the fourth fatal accident in the last three years at or near 
Santa Paula Airport. FRED ALVAREZ

 A 25-year-old Simi Valley man was arrested early Saturday morning on suspicion 
of raping a woman who was walking home from a New Year's Eve party, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was sexually assaulted shortly before 2 a.m. in a Simi Valley orange 
grove, police said.About 20 minutes later, Simi Valley police officers saw 
Jorge De La Cruz riding a bicycle a few miles from where the incident took 
place. He was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of rape and sexual 
battery. He was being held Saturday on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman could not say Saturday exactly where the rape occurred, nor 
did he know the age of the victim or what city she was from. FRED ALVAREZ

VALLEY BRIEFING: COYOTE CONFLICT; ADAPTABLE PREDATOR AND MAN CONTINUE TO CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coyote is a wilderness symbol of the American West, but usually an 
unwelcome guest in the urban foothill neighborhoods of San Fernando and 
neighboring valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 These wolf-like canines have roamed Southern California hills since the 
Pleistocene era and now have made their way into city streets and yards near 
the Santa Monica Mountains, controlling rodents but also scavenging garbage 
cans and at times attacking small pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased sightings of coyotes, especially in the West Valley, are attributed 
to a number of factors, including the ban of coyote trapping, in effect since 
June. The recent fires may also be forcing coyotes to forage for food in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict over the trapping ban has been heated between residents concerned 
with protecting pets and children and animal rights groups. The clash has 
intensified since Dec. 17, when an animal regulation officer shot and killed a 
coyote that appeared to be stalking a small dog in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Animal Regulation Commission will meet Monday to reconsider the ban 
on coyote trapping. The 10 a.m. meeting will be held at 419 S. Spring St. in 
downtown Los Angeles. The Trapping Controversy 
</P>
<P>
 Until the ban in June, the city had trapped coyotes for about 25 years. Humane 
box-type traps had been used since October, 1992, when a moratorium was placed 
on the use of leg-hold traps. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the traps: 
</P>
<P>
 Leg trap: The steel-jawed leg-hold trap was banned in 1970 and replaced with 
the offset padded leg-hold trap. Leg-hold traps were considered cruel to 
coyotes and jeopardized the safety of other animals. Coyotes trapped this way 
often chewed off their legs to free themselves. Private trappers are still 
allowed to used padded leg traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Box trap: Also used to trap injured or wild dogs, this wire cage is left open 
with food bait placed toward the back. As the animal approaches the food, it 
steps on a steel plate, slamming the door behind it. Animal regulation officers 
remove the coyote and later shoot or euthanize it. Coyote Profile 
</P>
<P>
 (Canis latrans) 
</P>
<P>
 Body size: 4 to 4 1/2 feet long, including the tail/ 
</P>
<P>
 Weight: 30 to 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Color: Varies from light tan or gray to brown. Bushy tail is tipped in black 
or brown and is held between legs when running. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice: Distinctive howl, mixed with yaps, usually at dusk or before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Longevity: In captivity, for more than 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat: Prefers oak woodlands, grasslands and chaparral, but often roams 
hillside neighborhoods and yards in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Habits: Mostly nocturnal. They are opportunistic feeders, eating whatever is 
available, including rodents, fruit, insects, pet food and garbage. Can run up 
to 35 m.p.h. and cover 10 to 15 miles a night. Normally dens in ground, but 
often uses other shelter no more than six miles from water. Some live full time 
in urban areas such as vacant lots. Has been known to mate with domestic dogs. 
Young are born in April and May. Keeping Coyotes Away 
</P>
<P>
 Tips from the Department of Animal Regulation: 
</P>
<P>
 Never feed coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Never leave pets or their food outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove ripened fruit from trees and ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Fence yards on bushy slopes; Coyotes can dig under fences and scale fences 
more than 6 feet high. Bury the bottom of a fence at least 6 to 12 inches. A 
fence at least 8 feet high and tilted 45 degrees outward, away from yard, has 
deterred coyotes. Who to Call 
</P>
<P>
 There is currently no government agency that will trap coyotes in the city of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies involved and their recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Animal Regulation: Provides a brochure on coexisting with 
coyotes, with tips and animal shelter phone numbers. Call (213) 893-8400 for 
more information or the department's West Valley shelter at (818) 882-8800 or 
East Valley shelter at (818) 764-7061. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game: Provides education to the public but will not act 
on any request for coyote removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission: Will not trap coyotes in the city, 
but will do so for a fee on a very limited basis in unincorporated areas.

GRADING OF PARKLAND IN SANTA SUSANAS IS INVESTIGATED; ARCHEOLOGY: FIVE-ACRE 
SITE LINKED TO A CHUMASH VILLAGE AND A HISTORIC STAGECOACH ROUTE IS BULLDOZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are investigating the apparently illegal grading of state parkland 
considered to have key historical and archeological significance as the site of 
a stagecoach route and a Native American settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials said Friday they haven't determined who bulldozed up to 
five acres on the rocky slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains -- in the process 
plowing across the Old Stage Coach Trail, which is on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 But park officials said the culprits could face criminal trespass and other 
charges, along with a civil suit for damages to rehabilitate the area below the 
Santa Susana Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal grading on parkland is not unheard of, but "I would say this is a 
major incident," said Rich Rozzelle, land agent for the Angeles district of the 
California Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage occurred on a 666-acre swath of state parkland south of the Simi 
Valley Freeway and west of the city of Los Angeles' Chatsworth Park South. 
State park officials hope eventually to turn the property into a state park or 
historic site. It is popular with hikers because of its striking rock 
formations and the old stage trail, portions of which are still visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozzelle, who inspected the damage by helicopter Friday, said he believes the 
grading took place Dec. 23 or 24, because hikers reported the damage was not 
there Dec. 22 but was evident Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Several utilities and government agencies have easements over the property and 
keys to a locked gate on Larwin Avenue -- apparently the access point for the 
bulldozer operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading widened an existing dirt track, transforming portions into an 
earthen boulevard 40 feet to 60 feet in width. Other grading took place near 
power poles and transmission towers that cross the property -- as if to create 
parking and turnaround areas for maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Barter, associate state archeologist with the parks department in 
Sacramento, said she had not inspected the site and could not comment on the 
extent of the damage. But she described the property as "a very significant 
site," touched by successive waves of human settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barter said the site has remnants of a Chumash village. Then from the 1860s, 
it bore the stage from Los Angeles to Gilroy on a trail blasted from rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the century, a rock quarry on the site provided sandstone for 
construction of important Los Angeles buildings and the breakwater in Los 
Angeles Harbor. Archeologists believe a crumbling foundation near the quarry 
was a commissary for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have there is a layer of history -- the Native American occupation, 
the early California period from 1860 or so, and the era when Los Angeles was 
expanding," Barter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt McAuley, a conservationist and author of hiking books, said the grading 
was so extensive it appeared to be "more than just a one-man operation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's highly irresponsible of anyone to disturb any soil without 
knowing what they are doing," he said. "Obviously they had no concept of what 
damage was being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to vegetation appeared limited, because the area already had been 
scorched by wildfire in October. But Suzanne Goode, associate resource 
ecologist with the state parks department, said the grading will slow the 
land's recovery from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the number of incidents such as this that I have seen in the parks 
in the past few years, it makes me wonder whether we will have any undisturbed 
patch of ground left 100 years from now," Goode said.

CHAPEL IN USE NONSTOP AT CHURCH OF PERPETUAL PRAYER; RITES: THE TRADITION HAS 
BEEN KEPT ALIVE BY THE PICO RIVERA CONGREGATION FOR 35 YEARS. THE PARISHIONERS 
TAKE TURNS PRAYING FOR OTHERS AND FOR WORLD PEACE.

<P>
 On a recent Sunday at the stroke of midnight, a solitary worshiper knelt in a 
small prayer chapel at St. Hilary Catholic Church in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was nothing unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 A congregant also was praying at 10:30 p.m. on Feb. 4, 1975, and at 3:45 a.m. 
on Oct. 17, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 For 35 years, the chapel has been in use nearly nonstop thanks to the local 
Perpetual Adoration Society, which asks members to enter and pray one hour a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get much publicity about the blessings in life, but that hour has 
been a boost to our family," said John J. McWeeney, 77. He did the shift from 
10 to 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 1975, as he has done for the last 35 years. 
He and his wife, Hannah, whom he still calls "my bride," regard the hour of 
prayer as more a reward than a duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go away from that hour feeling like a newborn child almost," he said. "We 
thank God we had that hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of around-the-clock prayer goes back to the first days of the 
Christian church when the Apostle Paul wrote of "prayer without ceasing," said 
Father Gregory Coiro of the archdiocese of Los Angeles. "It's hard for an 
individual to do it, but as a community, we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials know of no church in the archdiocese that has been doing it 
longer than St. Hilary. A handful of parishioners have been involved since the 
beginning on Nov. 7, 1958. The practice has become rare in modern times, partly 
because of a decline in interest and partly for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to lock up (many) churches at night," Coiro said. "In a lot of places 
the church is locked up during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Hilary, men or couples take the night shifts. People find their own 
substitutes or call a shift leader for help. A different volunteer manages the 
a.m. and p.m. shifts of each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Society members are asked to pray for world peace and the healing of the sick. 
They also pray that some young members of the congregation will enter the 
priesthood or another church occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the forum is open for any kind of prayer. Congregants also are 
welcome to meditate and read from the Bible or other religious books that are 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 From 3 to 4 a.m., on Tuesday, Oct. 17, 1961, Charles Fleming was giving thanks 
for the birth of his seventh and youngest child, who was born four days before. 
"The good Lord always saw to it that I got a raise or promotion to care for my 
children," Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to another morning shift, Fleming smoked the last cigarette in a 
pack.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told my Lord I would quit smoking because it was bad for me and, besides, 
cigarettes went up 50 cents a pack," said Fleming, a 67-year-old engineering 
consultant. "The next morning I woke up and I didn't want a cigarette. I never 
smoked a cigarette again. I could not have done that without the Lord's help." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer cannot answer all questions, solve all difficulties, but can give 
people the strength to deal with problems, said Father Christian Van Liefde, 
the church's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Van Liefde does not deny the possibility of miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 His own shift is the first hour of the week, on Sunday from midnight to 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is open and unlocked all the time, and has not suffered from 
vandalism, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-by-30-foot chapel is a simple room of chairs, kneeling stations and 
bookshelves. A fountain of holy water sits by the door. Bone fragments of 
saints and other holy relics rest in alcoves of red, blue, green, pink or 
yellow stained glass. Panes of sliding glass separate the room from the 
church's main altar, where candles cast soft light. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance, the "adorers" sign an attendance book. On the opposite wall, 
a board lists parishioners in need of blessing, including those who are ill, 
those who had recent surgery and those who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 The name board alerted hundreds of congregants to pray for the granddaughter 
of 62-year-old Mary Eva Gomez. The 7-year-old has survived seven surgeries to 
correct a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The adoration society was the brainchild of the late Percy J. Bell, the 
founding pastor of the St. Hilary parish.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell became excited when he heard about a Texas church with around-the-clock 
prayer, but had doubts about getting started until he remembered something his 
older brother had told him: "The American people will never be attracted to a 
small challenge. Give them a big one or skip it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, "if Texas could do it, so could California," Bell wrote in 1968.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Congregants remembered Bell as a diminutive, determined man with a soft but 
resonant voice. He piloted planes, sailed boats and rode a motorcycle. Behind 
his back, some parishioners affectionately dubbed him Little Caesar because he 
never seemed to take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really believed that at the core of our life of faith has to be that 
relationship with the Lord in prayer, that the strength and energy to live a 
good life comes out of our prayer," Father Van Liefde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell easily filled the 168 hours of the week with more than 400 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the adoration chapel from a room formerly reserved during services for 
parishioners with crying children.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell retired in 1970. His successor, Father John F. Killeen, helped keep the 
group strong for another 20 years. He liked to quote the poet Alfred Lord 
Tennyson: "More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of." 
</P>

 The adoration society was more than 30 years old when Bell died Aug. 15, 1990.

<P>
 Other churches with shorter-lived adoration societies include Nativity 
Catholic Church in Torrance, St. Dorothy Catholic Church in Glendora and St. 
Therese Catholic Church in Alhambra. Nuns at the Monastery of the Angels in 
Hollywood conduct a perpetual prayer ritual, but the lay public takes part only 
on special occasions.

 In Pico Rivera, the hour for Alice Camarillo is 10 to 11 a.m. on Saturday, 
just as it has been since November, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, the current president of the adoration society, finds herself often 
saying thank you in her prayers. "Ten healthy children, 19 grandchildren, a 
wonderful husband," said Camarillo, checking off blessings. "I will be married 
50 years in May." 
</P>
<P>
 She spends some of her time recruiting younger people to take over. A recent 
call for volunteers gathered more than 40 new names.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly wait to add them to the list," she said.

HOW DO I: FIND A LOST PET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation receives tens of thousands of 
runaway and abandoned animals at its six shelters each year. The centers handle 
mostly dogs and cats but an occasional coyote and mountain lion also have made 
their way to a city shelter. This guide was compiled by Mary Helen Berg with 
information from the city Department of Animal Regulation and Humane Society 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who can I call for help if my pet is missing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The department recommends that you visit Los Angeles city shelters to 
search for your pet. Call (213) 893-8400 to find out which city center is 
nearest you. Shelters are open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything else I can do to help find my pet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Stake notices in your neighborhood that describe your pet and give your 
phone number. Talk to children, neighbors, the mail carrier, anyone who may 
recognize your animal. Fill out a "lost form" at the shelter so officials can 
call if an animal arrives that fits your pet's description. Place a newspaper 
ad. Some local publications run free ads for pets that are lost or found. Watch 
the city's cable television channel for information on the animals that are 
impounded each day. Check with the Humane Society and county shelters.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the city call me if my pet arrives at a shelter? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If your animal has an identification tag, the city will try to contact you. 
Animal control officers will visit your address if the tag has no phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What measures can I take so I don't lose my pet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: An identification tag is the most important way to protect your animal. 
Most animals that arrive at shelters have no license, vaccination tags or other 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long will the city hold my pet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: City shelters will hold a puppy or kitten younger than 4 months for three 
days while waiting for the owner to claim it. Older animals are held for seven 
days. After that, the animals are put up for adoption. If an animal is not 
adopted after several days, it will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many animals come to city shelters each year? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Last year, about 92,000 animals were impounded at city shelters. Of these, 
more than 63,000, or nearly 69%, were destroyed. Thousands more animals were 
brought to shelters run by the Humane Society and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the city sell any of its shelter animals for medical research? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. City ordinance prohibits any sale of animals to labs for medical, 
commercial or consumer research.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the city offer free or low-cost neutering services? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Last summer, budget constraints forced the city to close clinics that had 
offered low-cost animal population control services. However, the city does 
offer vouchers of up to $28 to help owners cover the cost of neutering by a 
private veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the Department of Animal Regulation's budget? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The department, which includes 141 shelter employees and 45 animal control 
officers, has a budget of nearly $6.5 million.

GIFT HELPS CLINIC TAKE NEW PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinica Para las Americas, the largest nonprofit primary health care clinic 
serving Pico-Union and Westlake, has received a $50,000 shot in the arm thanks 
to a private donation disbursed through RLA, formerly known as Rebuild LA. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation will be used to hire a part-time physician, fund medications and 
laboratory tests and expand its services to an estimated 3,000 additional 
patients.The clinic had been forced to refuse new patients because of its 
overwhelming case load. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, founded in 1989, had about 11,000 patients this year and thousands 
more received HIV tests, health and parenting education and counseling through 
the clinic's community outreach program, said Leslie Gallagher, the clinic's 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is at 318 S. Alvarado St.

ROLL CALL / HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: '92 TRAVEL AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE CUT BY 
MORE THAN ONE-THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD G. THOMAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gridlocked House of Representatives was more landlocked than usual in 
1992, as members sharply cut back their foreign travel in an election year 
teeming with voter unrest over Capitol Hill and Capital Beltway lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll Call Report Syndicate's annual survey of official travel overseas by 
House members found that the number of trips declined by more than one-third 
compared with levels of preceding years. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel consists mainly of fact-finding committee trips or special jaunts 
authorized by Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). It is funded by taxpayers 
through an array of legislative and executive branch accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of public records identified 134 House members traveling overseas 
during the year, a decline of 34% from the 204 members who took official trips 
abroad in 1991. They took 216 individual trips (down 39% from 1991) over 1,386 
days (down 40%) to 460 destinations, including duplications (down 53%). 
</P>
<P>
 Travel in 1992 took an even sharper drop when compared with levels as far back 
as 1989, when Roll Call Report Syndicate began its survey. Travel figures for 
1993 are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that members have gotten gun-shy about travel in general because the 
public doesn't like it," said Joan Claybrook, president of the Ralph Nader 
group Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of negative press," said Armed Services Committee staffer 
Peter Steffes, "and I would say that maybe 10% of everything that's been 
reported is probably worthy of being reported. No matter how well-intentioned 
the travel is or how much is done for their constituents or the Congress, that 
never seems to come out. Members are saying it's just not worth it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 However, 1992 produced several frequent fliers, most notably Democrat Jim 
McDermott of Washington. The three-term legislator from Seattle took five trips 
over 63 days to 20 countries, to become the reigning king of House travel. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott, a doctor, undertook all of his travel as head of a task force 
monitoring the international spread of AIDS, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 1991 traveler, California Democrat Mervyn Dymally, tried hard to keep 
his crown. Dymally registered the same number of trips (five) and countries 
(20) as McDermott in 1992, but was away from the United States 44 days compared 
to McDermott's 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking third was Democrat Edward Feighan of Ohio, with five trips over 29 
days to six countries. Both Dymally, of Compton, and Feighan, of Cleveland, 
voluntarily left Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top 1992 travelers -- those with at least four jaunts -- were Republican 
John Hammerschmidt of Arkansas (four trips, 38 days, 12 countries), Republican 
John Miller of Washington (four trips, 29 days, seven countries) and Democrat 
Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey (four trips, 20 days, nine countries). 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary globe-trotter Stephen Solarz, a New York Democrat, took only one 
trip over 13 days to nine countries in 1992, after taking 16 trips over 166 
days to 73 countries between 1989 an 1991. Solarz lost a tough reelection 
campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California representatives who were listed in the travel survey were 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), one trip of four days to one country; 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), three trips totaling 12 days to three 
countries; and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), one trip of eight days to two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those with zeros in the travel column were Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City), 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), Julian 
C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), David Dreier (R-San Dimas), Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles), Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), Edward 
R. Roybal, Maxine Waters and Henry A. Waxman (all D-Los Angeles). Anderson, 
Dannemeyer, Levine and Roybal are no longer in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), 
Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), Ed Royce 
(R-Fullerton) and Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) were not in office in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate travel, which is reported to the public only in sparse detail, was not 
covered by the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of congressional travel appears to be still reeling from a 1990 
expose by ABC's "Prime Time Live" that gave a nationwide television audience 
its first detailed look at members of Congress at play on foreign soil. Hidden 
ABC cameras at a Barbados resort recorded several lawmakers consorting with and 
accepting freebies from Washington lobbyists. The lawmakers were on the final 
leg of a Ways and Means Committee trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such high jinks, congressional travel overseas is seen by many as 
necessary to give lawmakers the firsthand knowledge and world perspective they 
need to do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Foreign Affairs Committee member that does not travel abroad is incapable 
of fulfilling their oversight responsibilities and should not be a member of 
the panel," said Torricelli, who chairs the panel's Western Hemisphere 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is every reason in the world why the United States government should 
have some travel to Japan," said Jeff Biggs, the spokesman for Foley. "That 
sort of face-to-face contact gives you something you don't get out of a 
textbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Claybrook said Public Citizen believes "that government-sponsored travel is 
not necessarily inappropriate. It depends on what it is for. And if it is fully 
reported, and not using military aircraft when that is not necessary . . . and 
the trip has a functional purpose, and there is a report prepared by the member 
on what they do, then I think that that's extremely appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Her group reserves its wrath for the far more numerous corporate-sponsored 
trips by which House members and senators flock to vacation spots to spend time 
with lobbyists who pick up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of House members' travel is difficult to measure because the 
departments of State and Defense, which pay most of the tab, do not provide a 
line-item public disclosure of their funding. There is no evidence that either 
department isolates and tallies what is spent on congressional travel.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; SCHOOL OF ASIAN MEDICINE MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Samra University of Oriental Medicine, the oldest and largest such school 
in the United States, has moved from Beverly Boulevard to a larger building at 
600 St. Paul Ave., just west of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will enable the university to accommodate its growing student 
enrollment and the growth of its community clinic, said Timothy Timmons, the 
university's academic dean. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded 25 years ago by Homer Cheng, a Chinese doctor trained in Western 
medicine, the institution was originally called the Sino American Medical 
Rehabilitation Assn. and was devoted to teaching Western doctors and 
missionaries how acupuncture could help stroke victims recover. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, when relations between the United States and China were 
reopened, many Americans in the health care field developed an interest in 
acupuncture, which involves the insertion of needles at specific points in the 
body as a means to relieve pain and treat certain diseases. Acupuncture has 
been used in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Samra University, which took its name from the initials of Dr. 
Cheng's rehabilitation association, became the first school of Asian medicine 
to be fully approved by the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the university has about 300 students from more than 25 countries 
studying for a master's degree in Asian medicine. Classes are taught separately 
in English, Korean and Chinese. After completing their studies, students must 
pass a state licensing exam to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Asian medicine is gaining acceptance, many Americans are still 
unfamiliar with it, Timmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do more than just stick needles in people," he said, adding that the 
curriculum also includes extensive instruction in the properties and use of 
herbs, nutrition, exercise therapy, massage, anatomy and physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing with President Clinton's health care plan is a shift away 
from a reliance on high-tech machines and treatments toward a greater emphasis 
on primary care and low-cost modalities," Timmons said. "There's a boom in 
alternative health care and alternative therapies, and we're a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a January, 1993, study published in the New England Journal of 
Medicine, about one-third of Americans turned to some form of alternative 
medical treatment in 1990 and spent $13.7 billion on those treatments or 
therapies, which include herbal medicine, massage and acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 By calming the nerves, reducing the craving for drugs and easing the 
discomfort of withdrawal, acupuncture can prepare a patient for additional 
counseling and help in kicking an addiction, according to some studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Samra University also operates an herbal pharmacy that stocks more than 400 
Chinese herbs and a community clinic, open seven days a week, where students 
treat patients under the faculty's supervision and make referrals for patients 
who need additional treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., sees an average of 500 
patients a month. After being shut down while the university moved, it will 
resume seeing patients Monday. 
</P>

 A lot of people who looked at the 600 block of Bonnie Brae Street a few years 
ago wrote it off as another drug-infested, crime-ridden block in a rough part 
of town. But not Ron Wishon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishon, an apartment manager on the block, saw the same problems as everyone 
else. He just didn't agree that the answer was to give up. Because whatever the 
problems on that block, it was, and is, his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took 3 1/2 years to get this block cleaned up, but we did it," Wishon 
said. "To a lot of people, it may not seem like a big accomplishment, but our 
kids can now come out and play on the street. The people who live here know 
what it took." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Wishon has lived on the block, which was littered with broken 
glass and debris and was a hot spot for drug dealing, gang activity, 
prostitution and encampments erected by homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 But an incident he witnessed over three years ago changed his tolerant 
attitude, Wishon said. "When I saw a dealer sell to an 11-year-old girl, 
something inside of me snapped."  
</P>
<P>
 Wishon organized his neighbors and other apartment managers to launch their 
own war on drugs with documentation as their most effective ammunition. They 
wrote down the license plate numbers of cars involved in suspicious activity, 
surreptitiously took photos of drug deals and compiled descriptions of known 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 With that information, the police began making more arrests. And because 
residents were flooding the Rampart Division with calls instead of ignoring the 
criminal activity outside their doors, the Los Angeles Police Department 
increased patrols in the area, Wishon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few months, Wishon and his employer, Cappucci Management Co., worked 
with guards from a private security firm to discourage people from loitering on 
the street. Regular cleanups along the block also have made a big difference in 
its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some troublemakers didn't go easily. Wishon was shot at and threatened in 
1992; a bullet passed through the window of his apartment. But the persistence 
of the block's residents persuaded the dealers and the gangs to move along. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people know you're not going to tolerate it, they'll find someplace else 
to go," Wishon said. Usually, the problems move only a block away, which means 
that the entire neighborhood has to get involved, he said. "One person can't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems still spill over onto the block. Last spring, a rash of car 
burglaries resulted in stolen radios, tires, batteries and other personal 
items. "That tells me we've got a lot of hurting people around here," Wishon 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he knows that many of his tenants and prospective tenants have a rough 
time making ends meet with jobs at minimum wage or less. That's one reason why 
every year before Christmas, he and his wife, Maria, and children, Anthony and 
Emilia, host a free lunch for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a bunch of concerned citizens getting together to make other 
people's Christmas better because it makes ours better," he said as he served 
up turkey, mashed potatoes, salad and fruit salad from tables on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishon said 10 people showed up at the first lunch five years ago. But the 
event has grown since then, and this year about 100 people came for lunch Dec. 
23. Most of the donated food was gone in an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can get some more donations of food next year so we could serve 
more people," Wishon said. "A lot of these people are just down on their luck 
and need a little boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to help the community 365 days a year. It makes me feel good, and it's 
a way to teach my children to do the right thing," he said. "If you're 
determined to get out and do things, you can make things happen." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; REPORT DUE SOON ON COUNTY-USC PROJECT

<P>
 County-USC Medical Center's expansion plans are slightly behind schedule, but 
officials hope to present an environmental impact report to the county Board of 
Supervisors at the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 The $1-billion project calls for displacing 200 families east of the hospital 
compound and replacing the 1930s-era General Hospital. The new center is 
expected to be completed in 2002, generate 6,000 jobs and consolidate the four 
hospitals on the site into one large building, said project director Fernando 
Vizcarra. 
</P>
<P>
 Many longtime residents fear they will not receive a fair settlement for their 
houses and have criticized plans that will turn their neighborhood, 
essentially, into a garage. The first phase calls for demolition of the homes 
this year and construction in 1995 of a 3,000-space garage on Marengo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Vizcarra said the county cannot appraise the properties until the supervisors 
approve the environmental report. Residents will have the opportunity to hire 
their own appraiser if they disagree with the county's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials had meetings on the environmental impact report last 
summer. They have spent the last few months answering some of the concerns 
raised in those meetings and incorporating them into the final report to be 
submitted to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, residents asked that construction-related traffic be kept to a 
minimum or regulated so that it does not clog streets. They also asked that 
during construction the hospital refer patients to hospitals where staffers 
speak Spanish and other languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also asked that local residents be hired for a majority of the 
estimated 6,000 jobs created by the project. And they requested that 50% of the 
contractors hired for the work be minority- and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Vizcarra said the hospital's staff is trying to figure out how to satisfy that 
concern. "Legally we can't set quotas; we have to go for the low bid," he said. 
"We're trying to reconcile what the community wants and what we can do legally 
to help minority- and women-owned firms as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 An office on the second floor of a building on Marengo Street to answer 
residents' questions was moved across the street after residents complained 
that some senior citizens could not get to it easily. The office is now in a 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also offering crisis counseling for people who feel traumatized 
by the pending moves, Vizcarra said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; LEGAL AID TO OPEN 2 MORE OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles plans to open a community-based office 
by April 1 to serve the Northeast Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The office, which will have a staff of 15, including five attorneys, is one of 
two new offices for the organization, which aids the poor in legal matters such 
as eviction, receiving government benefits and consumer fraud. It will also 
open a new office at Crenshaw and Olympic boulevards in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the plan is to keep staff members communicating with neighborhood 
residents so they can identify problems easier and work on solutions faster, 
said director Tomas Olmos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are located in community-based offices are more in contact with 
people in the community, whereas people who have been working in specialization 
units tend to get isolated and not in tune with the community," Olmos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The northeast office will likely be in Lincoln Heights, although officials 
have not found a space yet. 
</P>
<P>
 It will serve the communities of Huntington Park, Glassell Park, Cypress Park, 
El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, Chinatown, Elysian Valley and Boyle Heights. With 
the East Los Angeles office at Whittier and Atlantic boulevards, clients will 
have the choice of going to the office closest to them, said attorney Sharon 
Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation will also establish a fast-track office that handles government 
benefits and eviction defense, and each community-based office will develop 
plans specific to its client base, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a change in the way Legal Aid has operated in the last 10 to 15 years," 
Lowe said. "The client is the one who has been disenfranchised for so many 
generations and the question is how do we get to these issues that have to do 
with the quality of life. We can do government benefits but never help our 
clients have a better quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northeast area, private developers have increasingly proposed plans 
that could dramatically alter neighborhoods. Lowe recently helped a group of El 
Sereno and Lincoln Heights residents monitor a proposed development at Mission 
Road and Broadway, which was dramatically scaled back as a result of their 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the neighborhoods could receive help keeping track of the 
Eastside Neighborhoods Revitalization Study that focused on parts of Boyle 
Heights and El Sereno, said attorney Roberto Aldape, who will manage the new 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 Legal Aid will also hold regular meetings in communities where residents still 
have difficulty visiting the offices, Olmos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to make legal services more accessible so the residents improve 
their knowledge of legal rights and become more adept at making their political 
representatives listen to them, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role is to assist the community so they understand how powerful they 
really are to hold their politicians accountable, and the entities coming into 
their neighborhoods accountable and be an equal partner at the table," she 
said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; SCHOOL GIVES CLASSES IN PARENTING, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that teen-age mothers at Garfield Community Adult School were not 
spending enough time with their children, Principal Dolores Diaz-Carrey started 
a family literacy program in March for parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 It began as a morning program Mondays through Fridays in which parents who are 
working toward their high school diplomas or learning business skills spend 
time with the children, playing and developing social skills. With grants from 
United Way, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Toyota Families for Learning, the 
program has been extended to 6 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the school is planning to open the Eastside Family Literacy Child 
Development Center, housed in two bungalows on a lot next to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was made possible with $150,000 from a community block grant 
through Supervisor Gloria Molina's office and a $145,000 grant from the Muriel 
Gluck Foundation. Waste Management of North America donated the bungalows. A 
dedication ceremony will take place Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reach young parents so they will pass on learning skills to the 
next generation and help alleviate some of the problems the parents are facing, 
Diaz-Carrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited studies showing that far fewer children on the Eastside than in the 
city as a whole attend preschool, putting them up to two years behind other 
children when they start kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really believe this will have a positive impact on our community," 
Diaz-Carrey said. "Our belief is that we have so many people who are not 
getting jobs because they don't have the education. We don't want them to be 
satisfied with minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the goal of reaching parent and child, Diaz-Carrey said, she has 
turned away $350,000 in grant money that would have made the center simply 
another child-care center without requiring parenting classes.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, which serves 65 children, charges $5 a week and is available only 
during the hours the parent is taking classes. Parents take their literacy 
classes in the morning, then have lunch with their children and work on an art 
project with them or sing together. 
</P>
<P>
 While the children nap, their parents take classes three times a week in 
methods of discipline and other parenting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents "have growing needs; they have boyfriend problems and other 
things, because they're still developing themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz-Carrey hopes eventually to offer the program until 9 p.m. Mondays through 
Fridays and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., to match the hours that the 
adult school is open. About 3,800 students are enrolled at 12 sites.  
</P>
<P>
 The school continues to seek grants for the learning program, and to raise 
money it is selling bricks with benefactors' names for the center's walkway. 
The school, which is on holiday break until Jan. 10, is at 831 N. Bonnie Beach 
Place.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; CHURCH LEAGUE SEEKS BASKETBALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Organization of West Adams Christian Athletics is seeking participants for 
its basketball league, which begins Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The league was started in 1963 as a church-based alternative for youths ages 
14 to 18 who do not play on school teams but want the opportunity to play 
competitively.Though based in West Adams, the organization invites churches 
from throughout south and central Los Angeles to recruit players from their 
congregations for the league, which is staffed by about 25 volunteers from 
various churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating churches pay a $375 annual fee, which covers the cost of 
athletic equipment, referees and office supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization teaches youngsters sportsmanship and the joy of playing, 
rather than winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the league enrolled about 150 teen-agers from First AME, Messiah 
Baptist, Holman United Methodist, Mariah Baptist, Trinity Baptist, Calvary 
Baptist of Los Angeles and Mt. Mariah Baptist. League players must belong to a 
participating church.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LADERA HEIGHTS; LUXURY HOME SALES BETTER THAN 
EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladera Heights Estates, one of the central city's few luxury housing tracts, 
is weathering tough economic times and selling homes at a brisker pace than 
developers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty of the 67 houses built thus far in the 37-acre tract have sold after 
being on the market since last fall, said Randall Lewis, Lewis Homes' executive 
vice president of marketing.The hillside homes, priced between $400,000 and 
$658,000, are north of Slauson Avenue, off Shenandoah Avenue in Upper Ladera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to build homes that were affordable but had enough pizazz to make 
them unique," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights Estates is an "in-fill," Lewis said, a development in an older 
part of city rather than an outlying suburb. Although Lewis Homes, one of 
California's top four home builders, has built in Hawthorne, Carson and other 
cities over the last 10 years, this tract is the company's first in central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said Ladera was chosen as a site for several reasons: good schools, a 
strong sense of community, aesthetically pleasing neighborhoods and proximity 
to Downtown, Los Angeles International Airport and the beaches. Lewis built 
four- and five-bedroom Colonial- and Mediterranean-style homes that fit in with 
the sprawling ranch-style houses found in Ladera Heights. The remaining 43 
homes in the 110-home tract are to be completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Sasser, who lives close to the development on Garth Avenue, said that 
despite construction annoyances, he is pleased with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had some concerns about the increased congestion and traffic around 
here," said Sasser, 41, a youth agency director in South Los Angeles. "But it's 
good for everyone's property values. What's here now is a lot better than the 
empty fields and oil derricks that were there before." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; THEY TREAT THE BODY AND LIFT THE SPIRITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ada Sellers went to her doctor in September for a pregnancy test, she 
figured that the most shocking news she could get was that she was expecting a 
child, at the age of 46. 
</P>
<P>
 She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' doctor sat her down and broke the news that not only was she 
pregnant, she was HIV-positive. Sellers said that because she was in a 
longtime, monogamous relationship, she was at a loss to explain how she 
contracted the virus, and she said her doctors have yet to determine the 
source. But after the initial disbelief came something worse: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried and walked the floor a long time that night," recalled Sellers, a 
mother of five. "I couldn't sleep. I didn't know who to talk to. I didn't know 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers finally picked up the phone and called an HIV hot line, and through it 
discovered the T.H.E. Clinic for Women, a community-based facility at 3860 W. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. that specializes in treating women with AIDS and 
HIV infections. Today, Sellers says she is feeling much more hopeful, thanks to 
the clinic's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are there for you in so many ways," she said. "I can call whenever I 
have a problem. They take care of all my medical needs. If it wasn't for them, 
I don't know where I'd be." 
</P>
<P>
 The T.H.E. Clinic -- the acronym stands for To Help Everyone -- has been 
hailed as a pioneer in health care tailored for women. Since opening in 1974, 
it has offered comprehensive medical and psychological services for minority 
and low-income women, and today offers the largest program for HIV and 
AIDS-infected women in the county, said director Sylvia Drew Ivie.  
</P>
<P>
 Serving women is not the only reason the clinic is special. Similar medical 
facilities may offer services in Spanish, but T.H.E. Clinic has 62 physicians 
and other staffers who speak 10 languages, including Spanish, Japanese, Thai, 
Tongan and Vietnamese. It serves nearly 20,000 patients annually, including 115 
currently in the HIV program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women, particularly women of color, need different kinds of intervention than 
men," said Ivie, a former civil rights lawyer who has headed the clinic for 
five years. "Also, information needs to be discussed with a Japanese woman very 
differently than it's discussed with an African American or Latino. We operate 
from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic offers a wide array of services that have increased in scope as 
health problems have grown more complex. It not only provides gynecological and 
general primary health care, but prenatal care, pediatric services, 
psychosocial counseling, parenting classes and a teen health program that added 
a peer counseling component in November. The clinic is adding separate 
facilities, including a lounge and counseling rooms, for teen-agers. "We're 
treating teens like a community with another language," said Ivie, who employs 
18 students from local high schools as part-time workers. "We train them to 
give each other information, to cut through problems like peer pressure and 
self-esteem. An adult telling them, 'This is birth control' is much less 
effective than one of their peers saying, 'Can you deal with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its innovations and the rave reviews it regularly gets from the 
health care community and elected officials, Ivie says she wonders where her 
clinic, which is 80% government-funded, will fit in with the plans for national 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Though T.H.E. charges fees based on each patient's ability to pay, half of its 
patients are on Medi-Cal, and many more are immigrants who don't have 
insurance. "The need for our services will exist, but I don't know if we will 
be cost-efficient enough," Ivie said. "It's a little worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
 For HIV patient Beverly Mosley, 46, no price can be put on the support the 
clinic gives her, particularly during personally trying times. "They make you 
feel like you're family," she said. "At other places, you're a dollar. Here, I 
do volunteer work when I'm not a patient. That's how much I owe them." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; CENTER ASSAILS FOOD ALLOTMENT CUTBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dispute between a community group and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank 
reflects what service providers say is a growing problem: how to balance 
shrinking food supplies with a rising number of hungry people. 
</P>
<P>
 A vocal volunteer for the Chinese Community Service Center, which distributes 
food to about 400 needy senior citizens a month, contends that the Food Bank 
has unfairly cut the center's supply of free food. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Chang contends that the center, at 1348 Kellam Ave., received only about 
one-tenth of the federal surplus food rations in December that it has 
traditionally received during its 10-year history as a food provider. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the nonprofit Food Bank, which distributes food to 725 charities 
throughout the county, said deliveries to the Chinese Community Service Center 
were cut back because the center was stockpiling food. According to Executive 
Director Doris Bloch, Food Bank staffers found excessive amounts of food at the 
center during annual inspections in August. The inspectors also found signs of 
rat and insect infestation in some storage areas. The Food Bank suspended 
deliveries to the center for 30 days and ordered it to fumigate, Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the center provided proof that the infestation had been taken care of, 
the hold was lifted. But the Food Bank reduced the center's food allotment, 
partly because of the stockpiling and also because of a drop in its own supply. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of the food distributed by the Food Bank comes from the 
federal Emergency Food Assistance Program, in which the federal government buys 
surplus food from farmers and other suppliers at low cost and donates it to the 
states for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Bank, under contract from the state and county, distributes the 
federal surplus food, which usually consists of a limited inventory of goods 
such as butter, peanut butter and fruit juice, at no cost to charities. The 
Food Bank also buys surplus food at a discount from suppliers to sell for 11 
cents per pound to charities. Some food is also donated by the suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Food Bank had an inventory of nearly 500,000 pounds of federal 
surplus food. By November, reserves were down to about 122,000 pounds, Bloch 
said. "June through August, it was fat city, but now, we have neither the 
quantity (nor) the variety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang argues that she must warehouse food specifically because of occasional 
drops in supply. She said she accumulates the food over weeks to have enough 
for the hundreds of people who show up at end-of-the-month distributions and 
for individuals or families who come to the center at other times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve seniors from Echo Park, Downtown, Elysian Park, Lincoln Heights, 
Chinatown, and some even come from more far away," said Chang, who helped found 
the nonprofit Chinese Community Service Center in 1970. "They depend upon 
this."  
</P>
<P>
 But Food Bank and state food distribution officials countered that stockpiling 
creates inequities and fosters tensions among agencies, particularly when 
coupled with a general decrease in the supply of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have some storing at one site, while at another site, people are 
leaving with nothing . . . it's important to keep an eye on this," said Ken 
Grayson, director of the food assistance program for the state Department of 
Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Grayson and Bloch said that they are sympathetic to Chang's concerns and that 
they understand her desire to store food. But "on the other side, you've got to 
make sure everybody gets some," Grayson said. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; ONE-ROOM HOUSING GLUT CURBS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency board recently withdrew its support for a 
low-rent hotel on Skid Row and decided to provide only the minimum funding for 
two other projects in an effort to stem a glut of single-room occupancy 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came after an agency-commissioned study found a 14% vacancy rate in 
existing publicly funded SRO hotels. The study, conducted by the consulting 
firm Housing Management Systems, concluded that vacancies would continue to 
rise because of the large number of units made available in recent years and 
the latest cutbacks in welfare payments, which prevent the poor from being able 
to afford even low-rent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, presented in October, reviewed low-rent housing projects owned or 
run by nonprofit groups in an area bordered by 3rd, Alameda, 7th and Spring 
streets. Over the last decade, about 1,500 single-room occupancy units were 
built or renovated. About 600 of the units were made available between March, 
1992 and April, 1993, according to the study. An additional 1,252 new and 
rehabilitated units in pending projects are expected to come on the market in 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with these figures and its own budget concerns, the CRA board agreed 
last month to delay any new low-rent housing projects, including the proposed 
acquisition of the Southern Hotel at 412 5th St., and only fund rehabilitation 
of the Palmer Hotel, at 538 S. Wall St., and the Eugene Hotel, at 560 S. 
Stanford Ave., if they can obtain federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will provide the minimum funding of $3,000 per unit for the Palmer 
and Eugene hotels, which nonprofit developer SRO Housing Corp. hoped to have 
rehabilitated and ready for occupancy by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum funding will not be enough to rehabilitate the hotels to federal 
housing standards, said Andy Raubeson, executive director of the SRO Housing 
Corp. The developer is seeking grants and loans from other sources, Raubeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are struggling to try to make it work under those constraints," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the CRA's decision to pull out of the Southern Hotel project 
forced the SRO Housing Corp. to withdraw from escrow for the building, Raubeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA board also set a late January deadline for determining whether the 
Boyd Hotel project, proposed by the Skid Row Housing Trust, can find operating 
funds elsewhere in order to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also agreed to aggressively urge county officials to counter welfare 
cuts with measures such as allowing welfare recipients to double up in SRO 
units. The board promised to review the situation again in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Average monthly rent for single-room occupancy units, with shared bathroom, 
kitchen and lounge areas, is $222, according to the Housing Management Systems 
study. Meanwhile, the county in recent months cut monthly general relief 
payments to $212, leaving recipients who live in SROs little for food and other 
needs. The seven nonprofit single-room occupancy providers in the Downtown area 
cannot afford to lower rents any more, the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 CRA board members agreed the problem is more the inability of low-income 
tenants to afford the rents than a surplus of housing. But they supported the 
idea of putting future units on hold until existing vacancies are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Raubeson argued earlier that his group was being unfairly punished for the 
study's high average vacancy rate, noting that vacancies at his 15 hotels are 
less than 5%. But he softened his stance slightly last week and said he 
understood the CRA board was faced with limited resources. 
</P>

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen service agencies that assist Asian Americans will split $20,000 in 
donations collected by the Asian Pacific Community Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old organization raises money for Asian American programs through 
employee contributions.Among the workplaces that contributed in 1993 were the 
county of Los Angeles, the city of Monterey Park, Lippo Bank, Southern 
California Gas Co. and Southern California Edison Co. Edison also provided a 
special grant of $10,000 to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies that will split the donations are: the Asian American Drug Abuse 
Program; Asian Health Project/T.H.E. Clinic for Women; Asian Pacific American 
Legal Center; Asian Pacific Family Center/Pacific Clinics; Asian Rehabilitation 
Service Inc.; Asian Youth Center; Chinatown Service Center; Economic and 
Employment Development Center for Southeast Asians; Korean Youth and Community 
Center; Little Tokyo Service Center; Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment; 
Search to Involve Pilipino Americans and Western Region Asian Pacific Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's grants are double the amount collected in 1992, the organization's 
first year of employee contributions, and were presented last month at a 
holiday reception at the New Otani Hotel. The Asian Pacific Women's Network 
also organized a holiday toy drive at the event, asking attendees to bring toys 
for needy children.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; CENTER PROVIDES BUSINESS COUNSELING

 When South-Central resident Carl Morgan decided to open a bakery this year, he 
sought advice from the Los Angeles Business Assistance Center. Two months into 
operation, his shop is selling so many peach cobblers and pecan pies that 
Morgan plans to open another bakery next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 25, credits his success not only to the rich taste of his fresh-baked 
desserts, but also to the Los Angeles Business Assistance Center, a 
city-funded, nonprofit business counseling service run by USC's business 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The main objectives of the assistance center, which was formed after the 
riots, are to help local businesses become more profitable and to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to teach people how to fish. We don't sell fish," said Jonathan 
Goldsmith, the center's management consultant. "For a one-time $25 fee, we look 
at the company's needs and figure out how to make them more profitable. For 
people starting up, we help them find the best way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith said more than 150 businesses, ranging from small grocers to 
furniture manufacturers, have sought advice from the center at 3375 S. Hoover 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's staff of 13 includes USC students, professors and industry 
specialists who bring an array of expertise to their mission. The first meeting 
is by appointment. Consultants analyze the business, then discuss ideas and 
options to improve its performance. The business owner and the center work 
together over a period of time, charting progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you open a business, it's like learning a whole different language," 
said Morgan, whose store, The Southern Bakery, is near Los Angeles 
International Airport. When he started the business, he said, he was unfamiliar 
with business terminology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), bank ratios and gross 
profit ratios were foreign to me. They helped me understand terms and get a 
handle on financial statements." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "What people need when they're starting a business is a little 
guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance center also serves as a clearinghouse for other information. It 
works closely with other agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, 
and can often help clients with wider issues than how to run a company.

 Looking back on his days as a crack addict, Solomon Rivera now knows the only 
way he stopped was through strong personal conviction. Now that he has 
recovered, Rivera, 30, is passionate about showing high school students how to 
develop their own convictions to keep drugs and alcohol out of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot tell someone not to do something. It must come from their own 
willingness," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a coordinator of a state-funded, anti-substance-abuse effort at Jefferson 
High School, Rivera organizes an array of programs to serve as seeds of hope, 
possibility and self-esteem. That is the best way, he said, to deter negative 
influences such as chemical dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds come in the form of anti-drug classes at elementary schools, drives 
to remove graffiti from campus walls, cleanups of neighborhood streets and a 
day-care center to keep about 28 young mothers in school. About 180 other 
youths on the 2,150-student campus have been regularly involved in the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, students in the Community Programs Revitalization project planted 
flowers in the school's quad area, adding yellows, blues and reds to the drab, 
off-white walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old revitalization project is headed by Norma Mtume, a Jefferson 
High School graduate. The $500,000-a-year budget is funded by the state 
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Rivera and Mtume try to prevent drug and alcohol use while enriching 
the lives of people in the entire community. They offer parenting classes for 
adults, a community movie screening on Saturday nights and other services for 
the Jefferson High area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the infant center," Mtume said, "so that the mothers won't lose out 
on an education, get depressed and one day turn to drugs or alcohol. Although 
it just looks like day care, it's also a form of prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Evangelista, 16, holds her 8-month-old daughter, Esmeralda, next to a 
set of lockers in the hallway of the school. "If it weren't for the day care, 
I'd be at home all day," she said. "I want to keep studying because I want to 
be an example for my daughter and have a good career."  
</P>
<P>
 The project is scheduled to end in June, and although many programs, like the 
infant center, are likely to continue, others won't. But that was the way the 
project was set up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never the intention to become entrenched here. We only wanted to plant 
some seeds and then see what grows," Rivera said. E. J. GONG JR.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; HARRIS STILL WANTS OLD POST AT HOSPITAL

 Sweet Alice Harris has been named to the city's Rent Adjustment Commission. 
And no sooner had the City Council confirmed her selection than the founder and 
director of Parents of Watts was talking about returning to her first love -- 
the board of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 58, served a dozen years on the hospital board but was asked to move 
to another commission when Richard Riordan became mayor in July. Moving to 
reappoint the city's commissions, Riordan plucked Harris from the hospital 
panel and moved her to the rent control board. 
</P>
<P>
 But all along, Harris made it clear that the Rent Adjustment Commission is not 
her first preference. Harris disclosed that she recently ran into Riordan and 
Deputy Mayor Rae James and asked to be returned to the hospital board. While 
Riordan's final decision apparently has not been made, Harris insists her 
return to the hospital board is a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Martin Luther King all the way," she said. "That's my community. I love 
it." GREG KRIKORIAN

 Bell, Huntington Park and South Gate high schools would be merged as the 
largest cluster of schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District when it 
breaks up this year under a preliminary recommendation of the Cluster 
Transition Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The three high schools and their feeder campuses have about 55,000 students, 
14,000 more than the next-largest recommended cluster, which pairs Garfield and 
Roosevelt high schools on the Eastside. The recommended clusters range from 
13,693 to 54,850 students. Preliminary recommendations drafted by a task force 
subcommittee were sent to principals recently. School administrators, teachers, 
classified workers, parents and community representatives are being asked to 
sign off on the recommendations or suggest alternatives by Jan. 13. The 
subcommittee hopes to send final recommendations to Supt. Sid Thompson by early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The clusters are being formed under a plan to restructure the district, 
decentralize decision-making and improve accountability. Clusters are based on 
criteria that include community preferences, student enrollment, educational 
and social needs, proximity and number of schools in a complex, said Marianne 
Hudz, subcommittee chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders had hoped that the Bell, Huntington Park and South Gate high 
school complexes would be considered independent clusters. It is unclear how 
district resources will be distributed, and a cluster of 55,000 students could 
be understaffed if it receives the same funding as smaller clusters, said 
Willene Cooper of the Southeast Legislative Coalition on School Overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one more time when we have to take what we get and make it work, 
good, bad or indifferent," said Cooper, who believes the Southeast area has 
always been a low priority in the district. "I would at some point in my life 
like to progress past a holding pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Peyton, director of the district office of school utilization, said that 
the Southeast high school complexes "are so large, the (subcommittee) doesn't 
know what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfectly appropriate that schools that have been working together 
should continue to be grouped together," Peyton said. However, she added, 
"depending on what the resources are going to be, (a large cluster) could be 
out of balance with a cluster that has far fewer students and far fewer 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee will discuss the issue further during meetings at 4 p.m. Jan. 
10, 18, 24 and Feb. 2 at Downtown Business Magnet, 1081 W. Temple St. MARY

CASTLE KEEP; THE GRAND STIMSON HOUSE HAS CHANGED HANDS NUMEROUS TIMES, WITH A 
BEER BARON AND USC FRAT BOYS COUNTED AMONG ITS PAST RESIDENTS. NOW, EXTENSIVE 
RENOVATIONS AND NEW TENANTS -- THE SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH OF CARONDELET -- HAVE 
GIVEN IT NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an abiding faith as firm as a mighty redwood, the Sisters of St. Joseph 
of Carondelet have once again settled into the house that wood built. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion at 2421 S. Figueroa St., built 100 years ago for lumber tycoon 
Thomas Douglas Stimson when he moved to Los Angeles from Chicago, has changed 
hands numerous times during its history.  
</P>
<P>
 Once before, from 1949 to 1969, the house served as a convent for about 30 
Carondelet Sisters, an order devoted to teaching, nursing and social work. 
Between Stimson and the five Carondelet Sisters who moved in this fall, the 
30-room mansion also has been home to a civil engineer, a beer baron, a USC 
fraternity and students from neighboring Mount St. Mary's College who 
affectionately called it "The Castle." 
</P>
<P>
 Now with $1 million in renovations and repairs well under way, the house, 
which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is 
Historic-Cultural Monument No. 212 in Los Angeles, stands ready to accommodate 
its new occupants, who are already doing good works throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to the Sisters' reverence for their new their home and their 
commitment to the community, local preservationists rejoice that instead of 
becoming an anachronistic relic, the stately house will once again be a vital 
part of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a grand old mansion and we're still a little in awe of it," said 
Sister Mary Allen, who oversees the renovation of the house as provincial 
treasurer for the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, who have integrated into 
the surrounding area by doing community work and plan to open the mansion for 
small musical productions, selected community events and rent it out to film 
crews seeking historical backdrops. (Carondelet is the name of the St. Louis 
suburb where the first Sisters of St. Joseph built a log cabin in 1836. By 
1889, the Carondelet Sisters were active in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 From the front, the 3 1/2-story house resembles a medieval castle, with brick 
chimneys standing guard like sentries along the roof and an ornate four-story 
crenelated tower on the northeast corner, a noble rook from a massive chess 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-floor balcony sits beneath a gabled arch and another stepped gable 
contains a Palladian window. A porch with carved stone columns encircles the 
first floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the tower, the house totals 12,800 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've admired the house from the minute I first walked in," said Sister Jill, 
one of the supervisors for the archdiocese's elementary schools. "The wood, the 
details on the door hinges, the different shapes of the glass in the windows, 
the stained glass windows above the stairway that have their own light. I find 
it fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 The grandeur of the house has attracted Hollywood over the years. It has been 
a setting for, among other things, chamber music performances, television 
commercials, the movies "House II" and "After Midnight," two miniseries, 
"Testimony of Two Men" and "Captains and Kings," and an episode of "The Bionic 
Woman" in which Lindsay Wagner's double jumped off a second-floor porch. That 
same episode, titled "Black Magic," also featured the late Vincent Price, who 
liked the spookiness of the house's acoustics so much he returned later to 
record some productions of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he amassed a fortune in the lumber business, Stimson built his home out 
of Arizona red sandstone. He wanted the exterior to resemble the 
brick-and-stone mansions of Chicago's Gold Coast, and handed the task to a 
young Los Angeles architect, Carroll H. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's architectural design for the Stimson House has been described 
variously as Richardsonian Romanesque, Victorian Gothic, Romantic Revival and, 
according to a Times reporter in 1948, a style that reflects "the Mission 
influence, a bit of Byzantine, something Latin and a little Fort Ticonderoga." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times music critic reviewing a chamber music performance at the house in 
1989 called its architecture "Midwestern Ivanhoe" and said the edifice "proved 
a good deal more interesting than the music." 
</P>
<P>
 If Stimson's choice of stone for his home's exterior seems ironic, the 
interior reflects his true passion. The inside is a shrine to lumber, a museum 
of wood, a smorgasbord of timber -- ash, sycamore, birch, mahogany, walnut, 
gumwood and oak, all shipped from lumber yards in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Richly paneled walls rise up to high coffered, or delicately plastered, 
ceilings. Each of the rooms on the first floor is finished in a different wood 
and thick doors made of two kinds of wood, one on each side, match the wood in 
the room.  
</P>
<P>
 Other details include inlaid woodwork in the oak floors, stained glass windows 
along the main stairway, marble fireplaces, engraved door hinges, unique corner 
china cabinets and a hidden safe in the original family room. "That's where the 
sisters used to keep their cleaning supplies," Sister Mary Allen revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Material prepared for the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission's review of 
the Stimson house in 1977 called it "architecturally unique in Los Angeles," 
"the best example of this period of American architecture in Los Angeles" and 
"one of the most significant structures in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Rudolph De Chellis of O'Leary Terasawa Partners, who supervised the 
renovations, said it was "an honor to work on that building." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to respect the craftsmanship and detailing," he said. "You can't 
find that today. You couldn't duplicate it." 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost of $130,000, the house, completed in 1893, was the most expensive in 
Los Angeles up to that time. The price tag if it were built today? 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or $4 million easy," De Chellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Childs, who lives a few blocks from the house and is active on historic 
preservation matters, is glad to see the nuns breathe new life into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visually, certainly it's one of the most important examples of period 
architecture in Los Angeles," said Childs, who is chairman of a citizens 
advisory committee that works with the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its location (near a major intersection -- Figueroa Street and Adams 
Boulevard) gives it a high profile and most people can relate to its historical 
significance because of its size and caliber," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What people concerned about historic preservation worry about, Childs said, is 
that such magnificent structures can overshadow smaller ones that also deserve 
to be protected and renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Childs urges people to learn about the history of their 
neighborhoods. "Without the historical context, (the Stimson House) is seen as 
an oddity and a freak rather than part of the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, around the turn of the century, the Stimson House was the anchor of 
the most prestigious neighborhood in Los Angeles, a description reserved for 
Bunker Hill and neighborhoods just south of downtown during the 1870s and 
1880s, according to architectural historians. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of a horse-car line along 23rd Street helped attract many 
upper-class families to the area and they built mansions around St. James Park 
and Chester Place, near the Adams Boulevard-Figueroa Street intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the 1920s, the rich were moving to Hancock Park and Beverly Hills, and 
by the 1930s several large homes in the area had been replaced by commercial 
establishments and, in one case, the sprawling Automobile Club of Southern 
California offices just south of the Stimson House. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, "a flurry of subdividing activity indicated that investment 
considerations were now overshadowing quality of life pursuits . . . 
Consequently, mansions were broken up into apartments and estates were 
subdivided for new apartment complexes," according to a 1991 report on 
historical architecture prepared for the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimson was one of the city's leading citizens and developers until his death 
in 1898. His family sold the house in 1907 to Alfred Solano, a civil engineer. 
In 1918, Edward R. Maier, president of Maier Brewing Co., bought the property. 
He was said to have stored his wines and liqueurs in the basement, a labyrinth 
of rooms and arched doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity of USC bought the house for $20,000. 
The house survived the frat's eight-year tenure, though at least one floor 
board was broken by a student jumping on a pogo stick, according to an 
unofficial history of the house put together by the Carondelet Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the fraternity men hid a banner snatched from the UCLA campus in 
the mansion's elevator shaft and on another occasion they imprisoned a UCLA 
student in the basement for two days after he was caught engaging in some 
mischief at USC, according to the nuns' scrapbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent McDonough, a fraternity member who lived in "the Red Castle" in 
1947 and 1948 and a son of Gordon L. McDonough, former Los Angeles County 
supervisor and U. S. congressman, said the high jinks were kept to a minimum. 
"Despite rumors to the contrary, we were a very studious house," Vincent 
McDonough said. "All of us were ex-WW II guys darned intent on graduating." 
McDonough, now 70, graduated in 1948 with a degree in international relations 
and went on to a long career with General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gorgeous, magnificent place," recalled McDonough, a native Angeleno 
now living in Las Vegas. "It had an austere grandeur all its own." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 or so fraternity members living in the house while he was there took 
good care of it, McDonough said, and often invited professors over for lunch. 
The students rode to campus and back in an old red fire engine the fraternity 
owned, often accompanied by their Airedale mascot, George Tirebiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Pi Kappa Alphas did take an occasional break from their 
studies. "I remember a few Hawaiian luau parties in the basement," McDonough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other memories of his days at the house include regular bridge games and a 
visit from singer Frankie Lane, who was promoting one of his records, McDonough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, McDonough also met Dorothy Patricia, the woman who would 
become his wife. They courted at Pi Kappa Alpha parties and were married at St. 
Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church, next to the house, where they first met 
at a Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one of the neighbors apparently thought the frat was a bit too 
boisterous. In 1948, Carrie Estelle Doheny, widow of the oil magnate Edward 
Doheny and a philanthropist in her own right, bought the house for $70,000. The 
frat moved to 28th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not happy with the noise from the fraternity," Sister Mary Allen 
said. "So she bought it and gave it to us (the Carondelet Sisters)."  
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the nuns proved to be quiet neighbors. Coincidentally, one 
of the residents was Sister Alice Marie, the oldest sister of Dorothy Patricia 
McDonough, whose family lived in nearby St. James Park. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 1970 until 1989, the nuns let Mount St. Mary's College use the 
house as a residence for some of its students.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had 27 or 28 students there at one time," said Sister Patricia Zins, 
former director of residential housing for the Doheny campus of Mount St. 
Mary's College. "They loved being there. The house had a warm kind of aura 
about it. The students were really able to create a nice family-type spirit 
while they lived there. Whenever anyone walked into the house they would marvel 
at how gorgeous it was. The wood is just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 With the college now housing all its residential students on campus, the 
Carondelet Sisters decided to once again use the house as a residence since 
some of its convents have closed. Renovations and repairs to the plumbing, the 
kitchen and the first two floors have been funded by a grant from the Daniel 
Murphy Foundation and private donations.

 The sisters hope to raise more money for seismic repairs and work on the third 
floor including painting, refinishing floors, filling cracks, redoing ceilings 
and general mending, by renting to film crews interested in using the exterior 
and parts of the inside for location shots, Sister Mary Allen said. Most of the 
income from filming, however, will be used for the sisters' retirement fund.

 At least seven more nuns are expected to join the five living there now. 
Meanwhile, the current residents are thoroughly enjoying their old house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Lana, principal of St. Jerome's elementary school, said: "We've each 
picked responsibility for different rooms. We're always discovering new nooks 
and crannies." 
</P>
<P>
 The other residents are Sister Genevieve Marie, a semi-retired nurse, Sister 
Maria Angela, a campus minister and instructor at Mount St. Mary's College, and 
Sister Josefa Therese, a cosmetologist who works with retired sisters at the 
Carondelet Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all involved in different ministries, so when we come home at the end 
of the day we all have something different to bring to the dinner table," said 
Sister Lana. "And Sister Genevieve entertains us with tales about the latest 
projects of the plumbers, the exterminators or the electricians." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Allen, who doesn't live in the house but as the daughter of a 
lumber man clearly enjoys every chance to look around, said the sisters have 
had little time to add their personal touches to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been doing what has to be done to live here," she said. "After a 
while we'll begin looking at what can be done to bring it back to life. It is 
our home but it's so beautiful we do want to share it." On the Cover

 The Stimson House, built a century ago by lumber tycoon Thomas Douglas 
Stimson, is one of the few remaining South-Central mansions that have passed 
the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-room mansion, which is listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places, has served as a convent, a frat house, a dorm and a popular site for 
film crews. It is now home to five Carondolet Sisters, an order devoted to 
teaching, nursing and social work.

SLAMMING THE DOOR ON UNLIMITED GARAGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garage sales are not just a job for Jim Cloar. They are a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Saturday before Christmas, Cloar, 74, sat in his garage, on W. 139th 
Street near Hawthorne, amid rusted tools and other odds and ends taken on 
consignment from neighbors. Red signs announcing his sale hung from the opened 
garage door, flapping in the biting morning breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloar rested an arm on the handle of his mechanical wheelchair and waited for 
customers, just as he has every morning for 13 years, excepting the days "me 
and the wife go fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm handicapped, see," he said, pulling up his pant legs to rap his knuckles 
on two wooden limbs. "If I didn't do nothing and just sat around and watched 
TV, well. . . . In other words, I do this to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the money, he said. A good weekend brings in about $40, and he keeps 
only 10%. "I get to visit with people. They tell me their troubles, and I 
listen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloar, however, may see such visits sharply curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan scheduled to be put to public hearings early this year, residents 
of unincorporated Los Angeles County would be prohibited from holding more than 
two garage sales a year. And those holding garage sales would be prohibited 
from selling anyone else's property and would be allowed to post only one sign 
to advertise the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous," Cloar said when he learned of the proposal. He said he 
would have to rent a place to sell his merchandise. "Who can afford that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some who hold garage sales, however, believe that limits should be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten way out of hand," said Eddie Alamillo, who on Saturday was 
selling items on his sister's front lawn, several blocks up from Cloar's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some places like Culver City, where you've got small companies 
coming in unloading semi-trucks. Garage sales are supposed to be where you sell 
this kind of stuff," he said, motioning to a heap of used clothes and a stack 
of records, "not some place where they take MasterCard and Visa." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors approved the garage sale restrictions last month, but they 
later referred the ordinance to the Regional Planning Commission after board 
staffers pointed out that the changes might undermine county zoning 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dates for the hearings have not been set, but Deputy County Counsel Chuck 
Moore said he expects them to convene in February. After the hearings, the 
Regional Planning Commission will make recommendations to the Board of 
Supervisors, which will then make a final decision on the garage sale 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's intent, Moore said, is simply to prevent garage sales from 
disrupting communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we want to have garage sale cops, but there are some things 
going on that are messing up some neighborhoods," Moore said. "We're trying to 
put something on the books to help some really bad situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from East Los Angeles and Azusa spurred Supervisor Gloria Molina to 
create the ordinance, said John Calas, county planner in charge of zoning 
violations.  
</P>
<P>
 Garage sale restrictions are nothing new for the Los Angeles area, Moore said. 
"There are city ordinances all over the map on this issue, (in) Glendale, 
Pasadena, Santa Monica, Inglewood," he said. "I will admit that maybe they're 
not enforced, but there are some very strict ordinances."

<P>
 East West Players, the nation's foremost Asian Pacific American theater, 
explores the symbiotic relationship between two antagonistic siblings who come 
to terms with their differences in "Arthur and Leila," a complex psychological 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles premiere of Cherylene Lee's new play, a bittersweet comedy set 
amid the backdrop of family strife, is the East West Players' second production 
during a 28th season that has been dedicated to plays written by or about 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Kwan and Dana Lee star as the aging sister and brother of the title in 
search of their family heritage. As Leila Chin-Abernathy, Kwan is a community 
pillar whose success, wealth and prestige thrust her in direct conflict with 
her wayward brother. As Arthur, Lee is a gambler and drunk who supports himself 
by selling family heirlooms to his sister. But with each precious item that is 
sold, the two siblings exchange memories of family life, ultimately bridging 
the vast divide that separates them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arthur and Leila" won this year's Fund for New American Plays award. Past 
recipients include Pulitzer Prize winners Tony Kushner for "Angels in America," 
Robert Schenkkan for "The Kentucky Cycle" and Wendy Wasserstein for "The Heidi 
Chronicles."

CITY TIMES VOICES; THE CITY'S HIGH AND LOW POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although they represent different areas, the 15 members of the Los Angeles 
City Council share a bond because they all work, and presumably sometimes play, 
Downtown. Times staff writer Greg Krikorian recently asked the leaders what 
most delights and distresses them about the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hernandez 
</P>
<P>
 1st District 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to look at the Downtown central core as a sponge in terms of city 
resources. It tends to benefit a lot of people who don't actually live in the 
city. I don't see them paying their fair share of taxes for police protection . 
. . and it really affects . . . the surrounding corridors of business areas -- 
for example, Highland Park, Figueroa Street, Lincoln Heights, North Broadway -- 
areas where we should have theaters, restaurants. . . . Right now we treat 
those areas as transportation corridors. We want the traffic to move out as 
soon as possible. So what is happening is that people go to the theaters and 
restaurants (elsewhere) and Downtown isn't thriving at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Wachs 
</P>
<P>
 2nd District 
</P>
<P>
 I think all cities have to have a heart . . . there has to be a central point 
in the city. And I like a lot of what has developed recently. . . . I love the 
Central Library. I love the Music Center. I love MoCA. . . . So I think there 
is a lot more Downtown than people think. There are an enormous number of 
historic buildings that are pretty fantastic. . . . For example, the theaters 
on Broadway are extraordinary buildings that we have to make an effort to 
preserve. If there is anything that disturbs me it is to walk down 5th Street 
or 4th and Boyd . . . and see this almost hideous concentration that has 
developed of people having to live on the street.  
</P>
<P>
 Laura Chick 
</P>
<P>
 3rd District 
</P>
<P>
 What I like the most really focuses on the areas that have received the most 
attention. We have some phenomenal sections that are beautiful and fun and 
exciting to work in, to walk around, to go to restaurants, etc. Then we have 
sections further east and south that are terribly blighted. That are dangerous. 
That are filled with the blight and the heartbreak of our city. What I want to 
see is for all of the Downtown core to be like the parts that I love. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ferraro 
</P>
<P>
 4th District 
</P>
<P>
 I think Downtown has come a long way. It's beautiful. So I would encourage 
people to come and see Downtown. . . . And what distresses me is that 
perception of Downtown (as) dangerous, the working community leaves at night 
and people are afraid to come Downtown. And it's sad because Los Angeles does 
have new areas that are exciting . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky 
</P>
<P>
 5th District 
</P>
<P>
 What I like is the increasing feel of the place. I also like the eastern part 
of Downtown. I jog here from time to time on my lunch hour. And I will go into 
the Alameda area, Central City East, where the lofts have been and the 
warehouses. There are some restaurants that have developed there and some 
shops. . . . What distresses me most about it is the homelessness, the social 
problems. Downtown seems to be the repository, especially the Civic Center area 
. . . for every social problem we have. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Galanter 
</P>
<P>
 6th District 
</P>
<P>
 What distresses me the most is that we still have so many homeless people that 
we are apparently unable to provide for. And what I like the best is the DASH 
bus. The DASH bus is wonderful. You don't have to move your car. You get to go 
all over Downtown for a quarter. It's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alarcon 
</P>
<P>
 7th District 
</P>
<P>
 I think the central area reflects the message we send out to the rest of the 
world. . . . So I think that it's very important we put our best foot forward 
to exhibit the best of the city. . . . I am concerned particularly about the 
homeless problem which, I think, probably causes the most discomfort when 
people are in the Downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ridley-Thomas 
</P>
<P>
 8th District 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly what I see about Downtown is City Hall, quite frankly. I see 
homelessness in various parts of the city. . . . What I appreciate most is that 
people have not given up on the revitalization of what in many ways is viewed 
as the historic core of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Walters 
</P>
<P>
 9th District 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we can point to some of the structures that are both brand-new and, 
like the (Central) library, have been restored. . . . What I like least would 
be those buildings that . . . are not distinctive. . . . I don't think we took 
as much pride in the opportunity to have architecturally distinctive buildings 
as we took in just building out the space. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Holden 
</P>
<P>
 10th District 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown is Broadway -- dirty. Not just Broadway, but some of the other 
streets too. Not well-maintained. It seems to me that the merchants don't even 
care. Certainly the people don't. . . . They are bringing people back with 
condominiums and trying to give a good face lift to Downtown and trying to 
revitalize some of the business in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Braude 
</P>
<P>
 11th District 
</P>
<P>
 I come Downtown to see the great museums, the great theaters and the great 
concert halls and the great structures. Downtown is becoming an exciting 
pedestrian oriented place to walk. . . . Every downtown area -- in New York, 
Chicago, London -- there are always deteriorated areas, the older sections, and 
it tends to attract homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Bernson 
</P>
<P>
 12th District 
</P>
<P>
 The most evident thing is the large number of homeless people. . . . The 
federal government, the state and the county have abandoned them. And we as a 
city are left to deal with them. . . . The most gratifying thing is to see the 
way that Downtown has survived. While it has moved west, we do have a good 
central core area. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Goldberg 
</P>
<P>
 13th District 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid, I spent a lot of time Downtown shopping, and I still shop here. . . 
. I don't think the area is well-lit enough. And I think we have not done 
enough to support Broadway. I think the kind of move to the west on Figueroa 
and Flower and stuff is nice, but I don't think you ever make an area better by 
improving one area at the expense of another. . . . I'd love to see more 
entertainment venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alatorre 
</P>
<P>
 14th District 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the most distressing part of it is the concentration of homeless 
people in a geographic area known as Downtown. . . . It is no longer just on 
Main Street, but I think it covers many, many more areas. What I love the most 
are the skyscrapers and the character and the feeling of a city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Svorinich Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 15th District 
</P>
<P>
 The thing I find invigorating about the Downtown Los Angeles corridor is the 
willingness of the people to actually want to turn the Downtown corridor 
around. The thing that distresses me the most is the proliferation of 
panhandlers in the Downtown corridor. I think it really portrays an adverse 
image of the Downtown corridor, especially for people visiting this city.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; TOP-RANKED CRENSHAW LOSES TWO; JOHNSON BENCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Willie West benched City Player of the Year Kris Johnson and 
the Cougars were beaten by Richland Northeast, 74-65, Thursday afternoon in the 
third-place game of the Beach Ball Classic I. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today, lost for the second 
consecutive day. No. 10 Simon Gratz of Philadelphia beat Crenshaw, 70-65, 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who signed early with UCLA, was in uniform but did not play despite 
being the team's leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a coach's decision," West said. "There's (nothing) wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 64-49 in the fourth quarter, the Cougars nearly avoided the upset, 
outscoring No. 11 Richland Northeast, 14-0. Antonio Simpson and Tremaine 
Fowlkes reignited Crenshaw to pull within 66-65 with 1:40 to go. During that 
stretch, the Cavaliers were plagued by poor free-throw shooting, missing eight 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 After Northeast's Corey Todd missed a free throw, Nicky Davis made a followup 
basket with 1:06 left for a 68-65 Cavalier lead. Davis then rejected a Cougar 
shot. Simon Gratz (Phila.) 70, Crenshaw 65 -- Crenshaw had three players foul 
out, and the Cougars' 28-game winning streak ended Wednesday in the 
championship semifinals of the Beach Ball Classic I. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Johnson scored 21 points, and Reggie McFerren 14 points to lead the 
Cougars, who were ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. McFerren, Antonio 
Simpson and Tommie Davis, who had only four assists, fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk up the place," Crenshaw Coach Willie West said. "We didn't play very 
effectively in the first half. The officiating was bad, but that was another 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Gratz, which was ranked 10th in the nation, was led by Lynard Stewart, 
who scored 27 points. Simon Gratz made 20 of 29 free throws, and the Cougars 
made six of 12. Crenshaw 64, White Hall (Pa.) 47 -- White Hall tried to slow 
the pace, using a four-corner stall, but Crenshaw point guard Tommie Davis 
played a pivotal role, scoring 15 points Monday in the first round of the Beach 
Ball Classic I. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauldin (S.C.) 71, Loyola 63 (5 OT) -- Junior Kevin Garnett scored 40 points 
as Mauldin beat Loyola in five overtimes in the seventh-place game Wednesday at 
the Beach Ball Classic II in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Toby Bailey had 19 points for 
Loyola before fouling out. Hart 67, Manual Arts 55 -- Hart senior point guard 
Eric Spindt made nine consecutive free throws in the fourth quarter as the 
Indians won the 22nd Hart Holiday Classic before an estimated crowd of 900 
Thursday night at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Spindt scored 18 points and had a team-high five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers were led by senior forward David Rickenbacker, who scored 25 
points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Forward John Thompson had 11 points and eight 
rebounds for Manual Arts, which appeared to be frustrated by the Indians' often 
methodical play on offense. Antelope Valley 73, Garfield 64 -- Senior guard 
Freddie Gonzales scored 16 points to lead four Antelope Valley players in 
double figures in the 15th-place game of the Hart Holiday Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Jesus Fernandez scored a game-high 23 points for the Bulldogs, 
and junior guard Ceaser Gonzales had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts 67, Canyon 63 -- The Toilers outmuscled the Cowboys in the 
semifinals of the 22nd Hart Holiday Classic on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rickenbacker (11 points, 10 rebounds) and John Thompson (19 points) 
provided the Toilers with enough big plays to offset the outside shooting of 
Canyon guards James Manning (23 points) and Greg Minor (20). Charles Woodard 
added 12 points for Canyon (10-4). Jordan 61, Taft 57 -- Clem Breedlove scored 
15 points and Julio Medrano added 12 points as Jordan won the fifth-place game 
Thursday in the Eagle Rock tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei 75, Artesia 72 -- Andre Miller scored 19 points and Jamal Cobbs 
added 16 points in the fifth-place game of the Artesia Tournament.

<P>
 Verbum Dei forward Andre Smith chipped-in 12 points.

but the Romans lost in the seventh-place game of the Artesia Tournament.

Andre Smith added 13 in a consolation game of the Artesia Tournament on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>

 Serra 64, Los Angeles 62 -- Seneca Hester's last-second jump shot caromed off 
the side of the rim and the Romans lost a quarterfinal game of the Artesia 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Brandon Thomas, who scored 16 points, led a trio of Romans in double 
figures. Serra's Ricky Price, who scored a game-high 26 points on eight of 19 
shooting from the field, hit a three-pointer that gave the Cavaliers the lead 
for good, 60-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood 90, Verbum Dei 83 -- Despite 37 points from guard Andre Miller, the 
Eagles fell to the Sentinels in a quarterfinal game of the Artesia Tournament 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who made 16 of 18 free-throw attempts, scored 14 of the Eagles' 22 
second-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood forward Paul Pierce had nine of his 31 points in the fourth quarter, 
including a three-point play that put the Sentinels ahead, 88-81, with less 
than one minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 85, Morningside 54 -- Forward Joe Richard scored a game-high 18 
points in a first-round game of the Artesia Tournament. Guard Freddy Mvuemba 
added 10 points for the Romans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson 87, Taft 83 -- Guard Anthony Martin scored a game-high 33 points in 
a quarterfinal game of the Eagle Rock Tournament. Guard Robert Robinson added

rebounds, four assists and two steals in a first-round game of the Reebok Above 
the Rim Classic. Fremont's Calvin Patterson scored 13 points. Girls' Basketball

 Crossroads 59, Crenshaw 32 -- Sherrise Smith (20 points) and Yasmine Benjamin 
(14 points) were all the Roadrunners needed to defeat Crenshaw in the 
third-place game of the L.A. Invitational Tournament.

<P>
 Kristi Lattin had 12 points for Crenshaw, which had replaced Roosevelt in the 
semifinals after the Roughriders withdrew from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were limited to nine points or fewer in three quarters and 
outscored 29-9 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 59, Dorsey 48 -- Roosevelt recorded its second victory in three 
meetings against Dorsey and avenged a loss to the Dons in the 1992 City 4-A 
playoffs, coasting to victory in a Los Angeles Invitational quarterfinal game 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders opened the second half with a 16-4 run to open a 46-30 lead 
midway through the third quarter.

 "But down these mean streets a man must go . . ." -- Raymond Chandler In the 
glare of high noon, a powerfully built man dressed in black steps out onto the 
boulevard to make his rounds. He nods at passersby, exchanges a few words here 
and there, but keeps moving, ever alert to the rhythms of the street. After two 
blocks, he turns and surveys the scene. All is quiet, as it should be.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of troublemakers, when they see me, it's whoof! " said the man. "Like 
roaches when you turn on the light." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Mike Craig. Age: 29. Vital statistics: 5-feet-9, 245 pounds. Profession: 
security coordinator. Beat: Larchmont Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the streets in this neighborhood aren't exactly mean. With its 
outdoor restaurants, neighborhood shops and unhurried pedestrians, Larchmont 
Village is Los Angeles' version of Main Street U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothered by aggressive panhandlers, the local merchants contracted a private 
security force -- in this case, Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Now) we have far less panhandling, even to the point where it doesn't 
exist," said Tom Kneafsey, a real estate investor who has offices and property 
on Larchmont Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie McCreight, who relocated her interior design business to the village in 
April, agreed: "I can't remember the last time I saw one." 
</P>
<P>
 For Larchmont Village, crime is mostly something that happens somewhere else 
-- albeit nearby at times. Police said the corridor along 3rd Street between 
Western and Normandie avenues has one of the city's highest rates of street 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last summer, the village's major problem was its homeless, a band of 10 
to 15 who would not have drawn a glance in other parts of Los Angeles but who 
were very visible along the boulevard. There, police said, they collected as 
much as $125 a day from shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to hire a security guard to shoo them away was proposed by resident 
Patty DeDominic, president of the private security and investigations firm that 
employs Craig. DeDominic, whose husband is president of the Larchmont Boulevard 
Assn., said: "It seemed a tragedy for the neighborhood that people were not 
feeling confident or secure here." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Craig and exit most of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig is adamant about keeping the village pristine from the uglier realities 
of urban life: "There's no gangs, no graffiti around, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But if he were to leave, Craig said, the panhandlers and troublemakers would 
be back within days: "This is a beautiful place, but it could go to hell real 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's services do not come cheap. The tab for his patrol is about $2,000 a 
month and is picked up by about 30 businesses that contribute $50 to $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributors get access to Craig's pager. Although all the businesses 
along Larchmont Boulevard between 1st Street and Melrose Avenue benefit from 
Craig's presence, only those that help fund his beat can phone him in times of 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there have been few such calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to recount some of the more perilous encounters during his seven months 
on the job, Craig mentions the appearance one day of three suspicious-looking 
men who appeared to be planning to rob one of the village's banks. The men 
left, Craig said, after they found they were being watched by him and bank 
security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that and a traffic accident that culminated with the two drivers 
fighting in the front seat of a moving pickup, Larchmont Boulevard might even 
be called dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Security, Craig said, is not about physical confrontations, but about being 
prepared to handle a range of situations. Craig said he considers his job akin 
to that of a neighborhood cop walking the beat: equal parts good will, knowing 
everybody's business, and just being visible. 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, is what keeps Larchmont Village safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I get five to 10 calls," Craig said, pointing to his pager. "Some 
days, I don't get any." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he joked: "There's nothing going on. I cleaned it up."

 A photograph featured in "Will Palestinians Give Peace a Chance?" (by Kim 
Murphy, Dec. 5) that was identified as a demonstration by anti-Arafat militants 
was actually of a protest by right-wing Israeli settlers against Israel's peace 
agreement with the PLO.
