 Charles Nagy shut out California for 8 2/3 innings Monday night to lead the 
Cleveland Indians to their 10th straight home win, a 10-2 victory over the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians collected 15 hits in posting their 10th straight win at Jacobs 
Field, their best home winning streak since they won 13 in a row at Cleveland 
Stadium in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 California has lost three straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagy (4-3) carried a four-hit shutout into the ninth before Jorge Fabregas and 
Gary DiScarina hit two-out RBI singles. Nagy struck out nine and walked five, 
winning for only the second time in five May starts. Nagy, who missed much of 
last season with shoulder problems, received only four runs from the Indians in 
his three losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Baerga hit a two-run home run, and Wayne Kirby had three hits, drove in 
three runs and scored twice for Cleveland. Alvaro Espinoza also had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray and Kirby each hit a two-run double during the Indians' six-run 
fifth inning, their biggest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Indian John Farrell (1-2) yielded seven runs and eight hits in 
four-plus innings. He left after the Indians started the fifth with four 
straight hits, including Kirby's double.

LOSS ISN'T THEIR ONLY SETBACK; ANGELS: THE INDIANS DOMINATE A 10-2 GAME. 
LACHEMANN INJURES HUDLER IN FREAK ACCIDENT. 
</P>

 They have a fancy new ballpark in this town and fans are filling the seats for 
the first time since 1948, but despite the aesthetics, the Angels were cruelly 
reminded Monday that they still are in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about this place," Angel left fielder Bo Jackson said, 
"that depresses you. It seems like nothing ever goes right in Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 How lousy of a day was it for the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
 They were routed, 10-2, by the Cleveland Indians in front of 33,878 fans at 
Jacobs Field, and the game might have been the least of their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day that began with Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann trying to explain 
how he injured his hottest hitter, second baseman Rex Hudler. Hudler was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list with a sore right shoulder and replaced with 
infielder Rod Correia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, third baseman Damion Easley was sent to the hospital for 
X-rays on his right shoulder, where tendinitis will sideline him until at least 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The night was spent watching John Farrell pitching perhaps his last game in an 
Angel uniform. Roster moves might soon be taking place, beginning with the 
possible Friday arrival of first baseman J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (23-29), losing three consecutive games by a combined score of 
24-6, dropped out first place in the American League West with their latest 
debacle. It was so ugly that Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove began pulling his 
regulars out of the game in the sixth inning, with his team ahead, 9-0. The 
only suspense was whether Cleveland starter Charles Nagy (4-3) would pitch a 
shutout, which was ruined by Jorge Fabregas' two-out, run-scoring single in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a moral victory to score two runs in the ninth inning," Lachemann 
said. "Moral victories are losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, meanwhile, couldn't survive the fifth inning. Lachemann conceded 
after the game that Farrell's future with the Angels might be in jeopardy 
because Brian Anderson is scheduled to rejoin the rotation this week. Farrell 
allowed eight hits and seven runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm well aware of my situation," said Farrell, 1-2 with a 9.00 earned-run 
average. "I have no control over the decisions. But let's face it, you've got 
guys on multi-year contacts who are going to continue to get the ball. I don't 
have one." 
</P>
<P>
 While Lachemann was being secretive with possible roster moves, he rounded up 
reporters Monday morning to his hotel room to confess the cause of Hudler's 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened at the end of batting practice Saturday in Toronto, Lachemann 
said. He and Hudler were gathering balls in the outfield when they saw one lone 
ball in between them. They looked at one another, and took off running for it. 
Hudler was there first, and when he reached to pick the ball up, Lachemann 
jokingly lunged at it with his fungo bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The bat bounced off the turf and hit Hudler's right ankle. Hudler then dove to 
avoid the bat, tumbled onto the turf, and landed on his right shoulder. He felt 
an instant wave of pain shooting through his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked because I didn't expect it," Hudler said. "Nobody uses their 
bat like that. I mean, he's the manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "But as soon as I landed, I felt something snap right away. I tried to play it 
off, but I walked over to Spike (Owen), and said, 'Spike, the man got me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Lachemman) thought anything of it until I didn't take infield. 
He walked into the trainer's room, and saw the ice pack on my shoulder, and 
wondered what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, "Hey, nothing that a few weeks won't heal.' I could see the steam 
coming out of his ears. It was like I just insulted his wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann decided to wait before making any announcements, hoping that 
Hudler's clavicle was improved. Instead, Hudler told him that he likely would 
be out at least a week, although doctors privately told him it may be three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was kind of strange," Hudler said, laughing, "a manager taking out his 
hottest hitter and putting him on the disabled list. I could see it if I was 
hitting a buck-50, (.150), and not stealing bases, but I was their hottest 
hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, who platooned at second base with Harold Reynolds and was batting 
leadoff, was batting .406 this season. In the last eight games he played, 
Hudler was batting .533 with three homers and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible about it, obviously," Lachemann said. "It's just one of those 
things that happened, and I regret it."

CARDINALS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME; DODGERS: AFTER BEING SWEPT AT SAN DIEGO, ST. 
LOUIS BOUNCES BACK TO BEAT HERSHISER, 6-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dodger Stadium is only about 100 miles from San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium. 
But for the St. Louis Cardinals, it's much closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 After being swept in a three-game series by the Padres, the worst team in the 
West, the Cardinals outlasted the division-leading Dodgers, 6-5, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting seemed ripe for the Dodgers to extend their lead to four games 
over the struggling San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The top Cardinal hitters were slumping, the pitching was ineffective and, in 
Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers had one of the most consistent pitchers in the 
National League going for them. In his 10 previous outings, the veteran 
right-hander had gone at least six innings in each and had not given up more 
than three earned runs in any of them. Moreover, the Cardinal starter, Vicente 
Palacios, had not won a major league game in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a night when Hershiser had nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three Cardinals hit safely and he was fortunate to escape after 
giving up only one run. Even the Cardinal outs were often hit hard. He finally 
departed after 5 1/3 innings, trailing, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't any good," Hershiser (3-2) said. "There was nothing wrong with 
me. I felt fine. But I never felt I was on my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios (1-2), formerly a reliever with the Pittsburgh Pirates when they were 
dominating the league, pitched in the Mexican League last season. The Cardinals 
signed the 30-year-old right-hander to a Louisville contract last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Joe Torre was so short of pitching, he put Palacios on the Cardinal 
roster, hoping to use him for long relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to use him as a starter," Torre said, "and though this is his first 
win, he's pitched well enough to stay in the rotation." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios breezed through four innings, gave up a run in the fifth and an 
unearned run in the sixth. But when Garey Ingram opened the Dodger seventh with 
one of his three hits, Torre went to his bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot-hitting Mitch Webster greeted rookie Bryan Eversgerd with a two-run pinch 
home run. Two outs later, Mike Piazza, celebrating his return to the lineup, 
hit his 10th home run. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cardinal bullpen as shaky as the Dodgers', only a bad break kept the 
Dodgers from tying the score in the eighth. With Eric Karros on first and two 
out, Ingram drilled a double down the left field line against Rene Arocha, but 
the ball bounced off the railing right into the hands of left fielder Bernard 
Gilkey and Karros didn't even have a chance to try to score. For one of the few 
times this season, a Dodger pinch-hitter failed to deliver. Dave Hansen flied 
to right to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had another shot in the ninth. Torre brought in Mike Perez, his 
closer. Until he suffered a pulled muscle in his chest and went on the disabled 
list April 25, he had been superb, posting an earned-run average of 1.29 and 
getting nine saves. But he returned May 11 and has not been sharp, losing a 
game and being hammered each outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, in a five-for-25 slump, hit a ball into the hole at short for an 
infield hit. Perez fumbled Jose Offerman's bunt and the Dodgers had two on with 
none out. But Piazza popped up to the mound, Perez got the next two outs and 
the Dodgers were still only three games in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Torre simply shook his head when asked why the Cardinals, who have lost nine 
in a row at San Diego, play so poorly there and so well here. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the weekend in San Diego, we weren't looking forward to coming here," 
Torre said. "But what made it nice is we did our hitting against a really good 
pitcher. So, we feel pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Whiten, who had a home run and a run-scoring double against Hershiser, 
also couldn't explain the problems in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided to forget it and come here and try to have fun," he said.

THE OLD REGGIE MILLER SHOWS UP AND IT'S 2-2; NBA PLAYOFFS: HE SCORES 13 OF 
PACERS' FINAL 16 POINTS AND TALKS THEM INTO 83-77 VICTORY OVER KNICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His call to bring on the New York Knicks as the Eastern Conference finals were 
about to begin was not so much throwing down the gauntlet as a statement that 
he wanted to play the best the NBA had to offer on this side of the country. 
But it brought on a problem nonetheless: Getting them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three games, the Knicks neutralized Reggie Miller, holding him to 
an average of 17 points, 42.9% shooting from the field and 25% on 
three-pointers. He appeared to be loitering in the Indiana Pacers' offense. 
Then, without warning, came the flip side: The Knicks got Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 New York got an earful as he stopped playing the good citizen and returned to 
running his mouth, and got an eyeful as he scored 13 of the Pacers' final 16 
points Monday during an 83-77 victory at Market Square Arena that tied the 
series at two games each. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers head back to Madison Square Garden for Game 5 Wednesday, before 
returning home for Game 6 Friday, knowing they have found a new weapon. It's 
the old one, their leading scorer from the regular season who finished third in 
the league in three-point shooting, who averaged 22 points in the first two 
rounds against Orlando and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been no shortage of those quick to point out the differences, mostly 
family and friends. He wasn't being as aggressive was the main thing, a notion 
that had to with attitude as much as play. 
</P>
<P>
 So he cranked up the knob on both, becoming his old taunting self and looking 
more for his shots, and scored 31 points to leave the Knicks and their former 
2-0 series lead in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The added bit of motivation came from Coach Larry Brown, who after the Pacers 
had blown a 13-point third-quarter lead and trailed in the fourth, urged Miller 
to grab the spotlight. "This is what you relish," Brown told Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller curled around a pick and scored from the right side to tie the score at 
70 with 5:20 left. After Rik Smits gave the Pacers the lead, Miller made a 
jumper over Greg Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Miller made six free throws as he worked over Derek Harper, who could 
only foul him three possessions in a row. Miller punctuated the run by taunting 
him up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Miller milked the moment. He kept going to the Pacer bench at 
the other end, before stepping to the line, to dust his hands with powder. 
Between some of the free throws, he would walk to the jump-ball circle at 
midcourt, then return to make another. It was his stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm quiet and just going through the motions, I'm just not the same," he 
said. "When I involve my teammates and the fans and the opponents and the 
opponents' fans, I'm a little freer." 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the free throws put the Pacers ahead, 80-72, with 2:20 remaining, 
but they were not in the clear yet even as the Knick offense again played dead. 
A three-pointer by John Starks made it a five-point game, and Indiana followed 
that with a miss by Miller and a 24-second violation. 
</P>
<P>
 New York was in position to steal a victory and play for the clincher at home. 
</P>
<P>
 That opportunity vanished in a pile of 26 turnovers, far too many for any team 
in the playoffs but especially one that is en route to shooting 37.7%. The 
Knicks got the ball to Patrick Ewing, who had redeemed himself from his 
one-point, zero-for-10 showing Saturday by getting 25 points and 13 rebounds, 
but Ewing's pass to Harper from the post sailed into the backcourt for a 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 They got another chance when Byron Scott's entry pass for the Pacers went 
through the hands of Derrick McKey, a turnover that became even bigger when 
Starks drove in for a layup and an 80-77 score with 30.1 seconds left. McKey's 
chance for the same redemption that had come to Ewing and Miller disappeared 
when he missed two free throws as the Knicks fouled quickly to stop the clock 
with 28.4 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Knicks couldn't believe their luck, no one could believe what happened 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 New York called a timeout, tried to get a pass inside to Ewing, only to find 
every angle sealed off by the Pacers. Ewing got the ball near the three-point 
line beyond the top of the key and passed it to Hubert Davis, who glanced away 
as he stood along the sideline in front of a Pacer bench that was riding him 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all you need to make a mistake," Indiana guard Haywoode Workman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big mistake -- the ball went off Davis' hands and out of bounds with 
6.8 seconds left. The Pacers closed the game with free throws and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller had arrived, after all.

 "It's all totally wrong. He's a terrific coach, one of the best I've ever had. 
He is a great motivator who wants you to have input on what happens.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; MESSIER'S INFLUENCE FELT BY RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Messier guaranteed the Rangers would win the sixth game of their 
semifinal series against the New Jersey Devils, and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorable performance, Messier seized control of the game and scored 
three times in the third period to rally the Rangers to a series-tying 4-2 
victory. He didn't guarantee anything before the deciding seventh game, but his 
locker-room speech before overtime helped the Rangers overcome the 
disappointment of being tied with 7.7 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the most dominant power center the league has ever seen," said Canuck 
center Trevor Linden, who likely often will be matched against Messier during 
the Stanley Cup finals, which open tonight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of forward who plays his best when the most is on the line. 
I've played quite a bit against him. He's so strong and powerful. He's not a 
guy you stop, he's a guy you just try to control." 
</P>
<P>
 Messier, 33, became a man of few words as he prepared for his seventh Stanley 
Cup finals. With Edmonton, he won five rings and lost once, in 1984.

<P>
 "There isn't much to say, besides, 'Let's go,' " Messier said. "I think 
everybody realizes what's at stake. We're not satisfied just being here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attention that's going to be on the teams from here on out is going to be 
a lot greater than in the past, and we have to remember that being here is not 
what we set out to do. That's not our goal. Our goal is to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Messier, teammate Brian Leetch and Vancouver right wing Pavel Bure share 
second place in playoff scoring with 23 points each. Messier's 252 career 
playoff points rank second only to Wayne Gretzky, who has 346. With 193 games' 
playoff experience, Messier is third on the NHL games-played list, behind Larry 
Robinson (227) and Bryan Trottier (221). IN THE FINALS, BY GEORGE 
</P>
<P>
 George McPhee, Vancouver's assistant general manager, admits he didn't expect 
the Canucks to get past the Flames in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, we didn't think we could beat them, and to come back like we 
did (from a 3-1 series deficit) was a turning point for the franchise," McPhee 
said. "It was unbelievable. We're 11-2 since then." DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger associate coach Colin Campbell, who played for the Canucks in their 
last trip to the finals in 1982, sees some parallels between then and now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We struggled all year long and then played well at the end. We just happened 
to click at the right time, and that's kind of what's happened to them," he 
said. "We weren't supposed to go far, but when L.A. beat Edmonton (in "the 
Miracle on Manchester") that opened things up for us. We didn't have a finesse 
team by any means." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell is hoping he fares better as a coach than he did as a player, when 
his Canucks lost four straight to the Islanders. "I thought we played well 
against them, but 4-0 doesn't look good," he said. RUSSIAN CONNECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger defensemen Sergei Zubov and Alexei Kovalev, who grew up in Moscow with 
Bure, aren't surprised at his consecutive 60-goal seasons in the NHL. "I know 
how to stop him, but it is not legal," Zubov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure reportedly has agreed to a new contract that, including retroactive 
salary for this season, will pay him $25 million for five years. NO MAN IS AN 
ISLANDER 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime this week, Al Arbour will leave the Islanders' bench for the second 
time, probably for a job with a long title and short list of duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbour spent 18 seasons behind the Islanders' bench, starting in 1973 and 
including their four consecutive Cups from 1980-83. He left in 1986 but 
returned in 1989, when Terry Simpson flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 At 61, Arbour was the NHL's oldest coach, but he might have been its youngest 
at heart. He prodded the Islanders into the playoffs but was so disappointed at 
being swept by the Rangers that he skipped the annual breakup meeting. Arbour 
tired of scolding Pierre Turgeon, who didn't play as big as his salary, and was 
frustrated by his defensemen's repeated mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Lorne Henning is the logical successor, but he's not a lock. GM Don 
Maloney, hoping to draw attention away from the Rangers, wants a coach who has 
more charisma than the soft-spoken Henning. Nice idea, but the Rangers will 
always dominate New York. BONNE CHANCE, PIERRE 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Lacroix, named the Nordiques' general manager last week, joins NHL 
Senior Vice President Brian Burke and Toronto assistant GM Bill Watters as 
agents who have switched sides of the bargaining table. He's in a situation 
that will test his negotiating skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques, who missed the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons, 
are campaigning for a new arena but don't want to pay for it. In one of the 
NHL's smallest markets, they don't have the same revenue to spend on salaries 
as teams in large cities. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Former King Jimmy Carson played in Vancouver's first two playoff games -- both 
losses -- and hasn't played since. He went through the same thing last spring, 
seeing little action late in the Kings' run to the finals. "There's not much 
you can do except stay ready," he said. "I've learned a lot from this and 
hopefully it will help me in the future.". . . . Rogie Vachon's return to grace 
is a pleasant offshoot of the Kings' front-office shuffle. His connections and 
knowledge of the game will be valuable to NHL rookie GM Sam McMaster. . . . 
Tampa Bay GM Phil Esposito was interested in the Kings' GM job and is nosing 
around for openings with the Islanders. He has an offer from ESPN but wants 
more money. . . . Washington GM David Poile has agreed in principle to a new 
contract. He was rumored to be replacing Mike Milbury in Boston. Devil Coach 
Jacques Lemaire wants to re-sign free-agent defenseman Scott Stevens but is 
less sure about center Bernie Nicholls. New Jersey has the right to match 
offers made to Stevens.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year, the hockey playoffs are better than the basketball playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Even David Stern could tell you that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen Stanley Cup playoff games have been decided in sudden death overtime 
-- the most exciting way ever devised to end a sporting event. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Five games have been decided in double overtime, including the concluding 
games of both conference championship series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Conference series won by the New York Rangers over the New Jersey 
Devils in the third double overtime game was among the greatest ever in hockey. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists will argue that the quality of play is nowhere near what it 
was when there were six teams in the NHL instead of 26. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, the dilution of talent because of expansion has been offset to a 
great extent by the influx of European stars. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that only players near the end of their careers in the Soviet 
bloc countries would be allowed to sign with NHL teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But now there are more good young Russians playing in the NHL than for the 
national team in the Olympic Games and world championships. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of them, 23-year-old right wing Pavel Bure, is the key to the underdog 
Vancouver Canucks' chances against the Rangers in the Stanley Cup finals that 
begin today at 4:30 p.m. on ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, who leads playoff goal scorers with 13, is similar in style to the old 
Montreal Canadiens roadrunner, Yvan Cournoyer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, in pursuit of their first Cup since 1940, shocked the league on 
trade deadline day when they made five deals even though they had the best 
record in the league. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trades looked pretty good late Friday night when Stephane Matteau, 
who was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks, scored the goal at the 84:24 mark 
that gave the Rangers a 2-1 victory over New Jersey and put them in the finals. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, late in the fourth quarter of the Knicks' pedestrian victory 
over Indiana, the Madison Square Garden crowd chanted, "Let's Go, Rangers.".... 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken, who began his major league career in 1981, has never been on the 
disabled list. Brother Billy, whose career began in 1987, has been on the list 
nine times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What team was the deepest ever at shortstop? The Norfolk, Va., Naval Training 
Station team during World War II. Phil Rizzuto was the starter and Pee Wee 
Reese the reserve. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vin Scully on the unshaven look sported by several Dodgers and Pittsburgh 
Pirates Saturday night: "Some of these guys look like they arrived on a raft." 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Beach balls ought to be banned from ballparks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In that epic home run battle, the Montreal Expos lead Ken Griffey, 26-22. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 If the playoffs began today, the wild-card entries would be Montreal in the 
National League and Boston in the American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are one of the few major league teams that haven't made any 
uniform changes in recent years, but I wish they would change the script on 
their road grays from "Dodgers" to "Los Angeles." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It took the Detroit Tigers 46 games this season to hold an opponent to fewer 
than two runs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The team that was ranked No. 1 in the national polls, Clemson, didn't qualify 
for the College World Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings will be well-stocked with Heisman Trophy-winning backup 
quarterbacks at training camp -- Andre Ware and Gino Torretta. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 NFL teams looking for new coaches in 1995 probably will be able to choose from 
Jimmy Johnson, Joe Gibbs and Mike Ditka, among others. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Another Bure, younger brother Valeri, is a left wing in the Montreal farm 
system. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If George Foreman signs to challenge heavyweight champion Michael Moorer, a 
weight incentive might be included in Foreman's contract. Anything under, say, 
240 pounds would be rewarded. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas is a good place to watch a fight, but every 
crowd thus far has been disappointing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi would have been the first repeat winner at Indy since Al 
Unser Sr., father of you-know-who, in 1971. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I still can't get used to the sight of Byron Scott in an Indiana Pacers' 
uniform. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years ago today, the Lakers were swept by Philadelphia in the NBA 
finals. I'm sure Jerry Buss would have settled for that this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Roy Jones bomb Thomas Tate in the second round Friday night, 
Sugar Ray Leonard said: "Right now, I want to challenge Jones. . . . on the 
golf course."

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; STAR GULLIT QUITS DUTCH WORLD CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruud Gullit, the dreadlocked Dutch star who is one of international soccer's 
most recognizable and charismatic figures, has allowed his ego to ruin his 
reputation and, possibly, the World Cup hopes of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, three weeks before Holland's first World Cup match, Gullit quit the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, albeit unspoken, was Gullit's continuing feud with Dick Advocaat, 
the Dutch coach. 
</P>
<P>
 That squabble appeared to have been patched up last week when Gullit ended a 
13-month self-imposed exile from the Dutch team and agreed to play against 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands won, 3-1, but Gullit, 31, was taken off at halftime and later 
criticized the team's style of play and its tactics, something he had done 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a year ago, after being substituted for in a World Cup 
qualifying game against England, Gullit quit the Dutch team in a huff, saying 
he would never again play for Advocaat. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the World Cup around the corner, Gullit, the European and world 
player of the year in 1987, relented and Holland's already good chance of 
winning the tournament improved considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Advocaat take Gullit off at halftime against Scotland? Did he do so 
intentionally to test Gullit's willingness to bow to his discipline? The answer 
might never be known. The effect, though, was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has hurt us by leaving this way," said Ronald Koeman, the Dutch captain. 
"It's a slap in the face. The players were amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland might still win the World Cup, but the absence of Gullit will make for 
a less exciting team and a less interesting tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Dutch fail, it will be Gullit, not Advocaat, who will be blamed. 
</P>

<P>
 Germany's surprise loss to Ireland on Sunday in Hanover has not been met with 
wild hysteria in either country. The defending world champions are not about to 
panic and the Irish are, well, the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to leave Germany on a positive note, but the Irish showed how you 
can be successful with basic tactics," said German Coach Berti Vogts, taking a 
not-so-subtle dig at Ireland's unsophisticated kick-and-run style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a good match. I expected the midfield to be better and to create 
more chances. But I'm happy that the defeat came today rather than on June 17 
(when Germany opens the World Cup against Bolivia at Soldier Field in 
Chicago)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's coach, Jack Charlton, was equally calm about his team's 2-0 victory, 
one that followed similar successes against the Netherlands and Bolivia: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've enjoyed the win, but we won't make too much of it. It was a friendly 
and the game is 10 yards quicker when you get down to the real business." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least six other coaches will have taken note of the result. Germany's 
first-round opponents, Bolivia, South Korea and Spain, will have taken heart 
that the Germans can, indeed, be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Italy, Mexico and Norway, Ireland's opponents in the opening stage 
of the tournament, will be thinking twice about taking the Irish for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That pathetic squabble about fences at three of the World Cup stadiums has 
taken a ludicrous turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, FIFA President Joao Havelange and General Secretary Joseph (Sepp) 
Blatter, along with Alan Rothenberg, the chairman and chief executive officer 
of World Cup USA 1994, will make a courtesy visit to the White House for a 
meeting with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports, they will ask Clinton to intervene in the dispute that 
has pitted World Cup organizers against police and security officials in 
Washington, Dallas and Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 All three cities insist on erecting fences -- around the fields at RFK 
Stadium, the Cotton Bowl and Stanford Stadium -- as a means of keeping fans 
from "invading the field." Police in the three cities apparently regard all 
soccer fans as potential hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, on the other hand, wants this World Cup to be an example to the rest of 
the world that soccer can be played in peace if fans are well treated and not, 
to quote Blatter, "put in cages." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that this matter, like so many others, should have been 
dealt with and resolved by U.S. World Cup organizers before the cities were 
awarded the games. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup organizers dropped the ball. Or couldn't find it. Or lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the multitude of other mistakes they have made over the past few years, 
this is hardly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plethora of soccer magazines in the world, the one that stands out 
head and shoulders above the rest is Italy's Guerin Sportivo. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring more than 120 pages each week and covering the sport on a global 
basis, the magazine is one of the most widely read and respected in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerin Sportivo's articles and polls, therefore, are taken more seriously than 
most as an accurate indicator of trends in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest poll will be particularly well received in Rio de Janeiro. 
According to the magazine, Brazil is the overwhelming favorite to win the World 
Cup. No fewer than 52 of 100 sportswriters surveyed chose the Brazilians as 
winners, 27 chose Italy and 11 selected Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the votes were split among several countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After losses against France and Germany, Italy managed to get back on a 
winning track when it defeated Finland, 2-0, in Rome on goals by Giuseppe 
Signori and his Lazio teammate Pierluigi Casiraghi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians were never likely to be troubled by the Finns, who have not 
beaten them in 82 years. Look for Signori to have an impact in the World Cup. 
He has been the top goal scorer in the Italian League each of the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gullit isn't coming to America, but Roger Milla is. 
</P>
<P>
 Milla, the star of Cameroon's surprisingly successful 1990 team in Italy, was 
included Monday on Cameroon's World Cup '94 squad. 
</P>
<P>
 At 42, he will easily be the oldest player in the tournament. He scored four 
goals in Italia '90 to lead the Indomitable Lions into the quarterfinals. 
</P>

 FIFA will add 14 national federations to its ranks at its congress in Chicago 
in June. The additions will bring FIFA's membership to 191 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 newcomers include seven former Soviet republics -- Azerbaijan, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- as 
well as Djibouti, Dominica, the Cook Islands, Tonga and the former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic and Slovakia, formerly a single member as Czechoslovakia, 
will be granted separate affiliations to FIFA.

 Colombia's World Cup defense will need to be better than its World Cup 
security.

 The team lost $30,000 worth of its World Cup uniforms while in transit through 
Cali. Some of the equipment allegedly already has begun showing up on the 
shelves in local stores.

recent edition of this column, it was reported that Rangers had never won a 
European trophy. In fact, the club won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972.

FRENCH OPEN / WOMEN; NAVRATILOVA DOUBLES LOSS UPSTAGED BY 12-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Martina Navratilova made it to Center Court at Roland Garros Stadium perhaps 
for the last time Monday, but the most intriguing match was played far from the 
showcase venue at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, 36, fast fading from the scene, lost with partner Manon Bollegraf 
of the Netherlands to Julie Halard and Nathalie Tauziat of France, 2-6, 7-6 
(7-3), 6-3, in the third round of women's doubles. Navratilova also lost in the 
first round of singles play last week, so her only chance to make her final 
French Open successful is in mixed doubles with Mark Woodforde of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the game's legends is concluding an illustrious career, fans already 
are talking about another Martina -- Martina Hingis, a Czech living in 
Switzerland. Hingis, the defending French Open junior champion, will become a 
pro in September when she turns 14. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hingis might have some competition. At least, that's the way it appeared 
Monday when 12-year-old Anna Kournikova of Moscow made her Grand Slam 
tournament debut in junior competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on a court that rarely generates much attention, Kournikova, all arms 
and legs, gave Nino Louarsabishvily, 17, a tough match in front of fans craning 
their necks to watch. Although Kournivkova was shorter than some of the 
ballgirls, she went three sets against the No. 7-ranked Georgian. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another product of the Nick Bolletieri Tennis Academy, Kournikova has had 
an agent since she was 10. Although her play is not as refined as Jennifer 
Capriati's was at 12, Kournikova displayed moxie in the 6-2, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Capriati's recent personal problems, some were already wondering 
what the future holds for Kournikova, who has spent the last 18 months far from 
home in an American tennis camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the natural pressures is Kournikova's wont to grunt after each 
volley, a la Monica Seles. Fleet Street was out en masse, not only to watch, 
but to listen. If she reaches stardom, the grunt meter will no doubt reappear 
during the fortnight of Wimbledon. 
</P>

 Tennis Notes

 The women's quarterfinals today will feature top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany 
against Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain 
against Julie Halard of France, No. 3 Conchita Martinez of Spain against No. 16 
Sabine Hack of Germany, and No. 12 Mary Pierce of France against 103th-ranked

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; JOHNSON THROWS TWO-HITTER; MARINERS WIN, 12-0

 Randy Johnson insisted he had a hard day, even though it might not have looked 
that tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson pitched a two-hitter for his second consecutive shutout, leading the 
Seattle Mariners over the Minnesota Twins, 12-0, Monday at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (6-3) struck out 10 and walked two in winning his fourth consecutive 
start. He extended his scoreless streak to 21 innings, including a four-hit, 
1-0 victory Wednesday at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a lot of work today," he said. "The Twins are a good-hitting team. 
They've got little guys who get on base, then the heart of their order is as 
tough as anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Mitchell hit his first two home runs of the season, doubled and drove in 
five runs. Seattle finished with 17 hits, 10 for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Pulido (2-5) entered the game with a 4.93 ERA, lowest on the Twins' 
staff. He lasted only 3 1/3 innings, allowing four runs and five hits. Dave 
Stevens relieved and gave up six runs and seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, Kansas City 5 -- Andy Tomberlin's pinch-hit home run in the eighth 
at Boston tied the game and Damon Berryhill's one-out double off the left field 
wall in the 10th won it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomberlin's homer, his first in the American League, barely cleared the Green 
Monster in left field and just stayed fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomberlin's homer came one out after Mike Greenwell's solo homer over the 
Kansas City bullpen in right field pulled the Red Sox within a run. Tomberlin, 
hitting .167 at the time, was the first batter Jeff Montgomery faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he hit the ball I thought it was foul, but the wind must have blown it 
back over the fence," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomberlin's only previous major league homer came last year for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Cooper and Tomberlin, who stayed in the game as a designated hitter, 
singled in the 10th before Berryhill's game-winning double off Hipolito 
Pichardo (0-2). Ken Ryan (1-0) pitched two innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Joyner's three-run homer helped the Royals take a 5-3 lead into the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, New York 2 -- Scott Sanderson limited the Yankees to four hits in 
seven innings and Darrin Jackson hit a three-run homer to carry the White Sox 
at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanderson (4-0) gave up a seventh-inning solo homer to Daryl Boston, struck 
out one and walked none before being relieved by Dane Johnson, who made his 
major league debut in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's homer off Jim Abbott (6-3) came with one out in the fourth after the 
pitcher walked Bob Zupcic before being struck by a line drive by Frank Thomas 
that became an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-minute delay, Abbott, who was struck in the left thigh, remained 
in the game and retired Julio Franco on a fly to right before Jackson hit his 
seventh homer. Abbott had won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Baltimore 3 -- Travis Fryman doubled in Chris Gomez with the 
go-ahead run in the 11th inning at Baltimore as the Tigers, held scoreless for 
eight innings, rallied to beat the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Phillips and Mickey Tettleton homered for the Tigers, who sent the game 
into extra innings by scoring twice in the ninth against Baltimore closer Lee 
Smith. Smith had saved 20 of 21 games, including eight straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Toronto 2 -- The Athletics scored five runs in the ninth inning at 
Oakland to end a four-game losing streak. Brent Gates' RBI double made the 
score 2-1 and Mike Huff's pinch-hit homer, his first, in the ninth off Vince 
Horsman made it 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Mark Acre (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth for his first major league 
victory.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS' BANKS STYMIES THE PHILLIES FOR 7 1/3 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After pitching the first complete game and first shutout of his major league 
career against the Dodgers in his last outing, Willie Banks had a no-hitter for 
7 1/3 innings in leading the Cubs over the Philadelphia Phillies, 3-0, at 
Chicago on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks won his career-best fourth consecutive start. Trying to pitch the Cubs' 
first no-hitter since Milt Pappas in 1972, Banks gave up a single to Kim 
Batiste with one out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to hit my spots, get my breaking ball over and mixing it up to 
keep the guys off balance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks (6-4) gave up one hit, struck out six and walked three in eight innings. 
He was hit on the back of the hip by a pitch from reliever Bob Wells in the 
sixth, and left the game after the eighth because of tightness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Myers completed the combined one-hitter, pitching the ninth for his 12th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, Banks pitched a four-hitter against the Dodgers. The third pick 
overall in the 1987 draft, Banks pitched a no-hitter in the minors in 1989 for 
Visalia of the California League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs won their seventh consecutive home game after starting the season 
0-12 at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, San Francisco 3 -- Jarvis Brown hit his first major league home run 
in the 11th inning to give the Braves a victory at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had been hitless in seven at-bats since being called up from triple-A 
Richmond on May 4. Known for his speed and defense, he got into the game in the 
ninth as a pinch-runner for outfielder David Justice, and won it when he drove 
a one-out, one-and-two pitch from Rod Beck (1-3) into the left field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's homer, in his 193rd at-bat in the majors, made a winner of Greg 
McMichael (2-2). McMichael retired Steve Scarsone with the bases loaded to end 
the 10th and pitched the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Kelly, in his first game for Atlanta since being traded by the Reds on 
Sunday for Deion Sanders, went one for four with a walk. He scored two runs and 
stole a base. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Montreal 3 -- Jose Rijo struggled once again but finally got his 
100th career victory with a lot of help at Cincinnati from his teammates, 
particularly Kevin Mitchell, who homered twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo (3-3) escaped threat after threat to get No. 100 on his fourth attempt. 
He gave up six hits, walked four and hit a batter in six innings. The Expos 
stranded nine runners -- six in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders, acquired from Atlanta for Roberto Kelly on Sunday, went one for 
four in his debut with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who hit a two-run homer in the fourth and a solo shot in the 
seventh, has three homers in his last five at-bats. He's playing with a sore 
wrist and hip that sidelined him most of the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 10, Pittsburgh 2 -- Tony Gwynn homered and drove in a career-high 
five runs and Andy Ashby (1-5) pitched a four-hitter for the first complete 
game of his career as the Padres won at home. Craig Shipley hit a pinch grand 
slam to cap a seven-run seventh inning for the Padres, who snapped an 
eight-game home losing streak against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, Florida 3 -- Craig Biggio, who was tagged out in a rundown in the 
eighth when he tried to stretch a single into a double, drove in two runs with 
a two-out single in the ninth at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 12, New York 2 -- The Rockies' Andres Galarraga hit a grand slam, the 
fifth of his career and second of the season, as the Rockies pounded four Met 
pitchers at New York.

NCAA BASEBALL; TITANS WIN TWICE TO GAIN COLLEGE WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton is back in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton edged top-seeded Oklahoma State, a powerful host team, 6-5, in the 
10th inning on Monday in the NCAA Midwest I regional final. Relief pitcher Rob 
Gaiko, facing his first batter, hit pinch hitter Robert Matos with the bases 
loaded, forcing in Jeff Ferguson with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave the Titans their second World Series trip in three years. It was 
Fullerton's eighth regional championships in 16 years. The Titans had to battle 
back with a victory earlier in the day over Memphis St., 12-5, after losing to 
Oklahoma State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked a lot about the fact that we were going to have a lot of 
championship-level performances today, and I think all that happened," Coach 
Augie Garrido said. "We overcame a lot of things in this game. . . . The kids 
put everything into it they had." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th inning rally began with one out when Ferguson walked, stole second 
and advanced to third when Oklahoma State reserve catcher Carl Grinstead 
overthrew second. Bret Hemphill and Tony Miranda were intentionally walked, 
bringing Matos to the plate as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (45-14) almost won the game in the bottom of the ninth. They went 
into the inning trailing, 5-4, but quickly got two runners on base when Sal 
Mancuso was safe on an error and Adam Millan singled. Two pinch runners, 
Miranda and Tony Fetchel, advanced on Jeremy Giambi's sacrifice bunt. Jim 
Betzsold was called out on strikes before D.C. Olsen was walked intentionally. 
That brought Brian King to the plate and he delivered a hit into center, 
scoring Miranda. Fetchel, however, was thrown out trying to score on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really relaxed because when I went to the plate the umpire asked me if 
I was ready to hit, and I thought that was sort of funny," King said. "I think 
it helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans advanced to the championship game by defeating Memphis. Dante 
Powell went six for six with three runs scored, two runs batted in and three 
stolen bases. Powell's effort included his ninth home run of the season. LON

 In the Midwest II Regional at Wichita, Kan., Washington (46-17) defeated 
Georgia Tech (46-16) in 14 innings, 12-9, and the teams played again Monday 
night to decide the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Antone Williamson singled home the winning run in the 10th inning after 
Arizona State got two home runs from tournament MVP Todd Cady in a 5-4 victory 
over Tennessee in the Mideast Regional title at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory earned the Sun Devils (43-16) a berth in the College World Series, 
which starts Friday at Omaha. Tennessee (52-14) forced extra innings when Todd 
Helton hit a grand slam with two out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>

victory over Texas at Austin, Tex., giving the Sooners the Central Regional 
championship. 
</P>
<P>

earned its ninth trip to the Series. The third-seeded Longhorns finished the 
season 43-21, marking their most losses in 27 seasons under Coach Cliff 
Gustafson. Earlier this season, Gustafson became college baseball's all-time 
winningest coach. 
</P>
<P>

the game, and went on to defeat Florida, 10-6, at Miami. 
</P>

Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic II Regional title gave the Seminoles (52-20) a berth in the 
Series for the sixth time in nine years. BYU finished 37-20.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS' BANKS STYMIES THE PHILLIES FOR 7 1/3 INNINGS 
</P>

<P>
 Willie Banks has discovered a winning combination that's making his life on 
the mound easier and much more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 After pitching the first complete game and first shutout of his major league 
career against the Dodgers in his last outing, Banks had a no-hitter for 7 1/3 
innings in leading the Cubs over the Philadelphia Phillies, 3-0, at Chicago on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks won his career-best fourth consecutive start. Banks, trying to pitch the 
Cubs' first no-hitter since Milt Pappas in 1972, gave up a single to Kim 
Batiste with one out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to hit my spots, get my breaking ball over and mixing it up to 
keep the guys off balance," Banks said. "I'm being successful doing that. The 
games are a lot quicker and the games are a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks (6-4) gave up one hit, struck out six and walked three in eight innings. 
He was hit in the back of the hip by a pitch from reliever Bob Wells in the 
sixth, and left the game after the eighth because of tightness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Myers completed the combined one-hitter, pitching the ninth for his 12th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, Banks pitched a four-hitter against the Dodgers. Banks, the 
third pick overall in the 1987 draft, pitched a no-hitter in the minors in 1989 
for Visalia of the California League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs won their seventh consecutive home game after starting the season 
0-12 at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, San Francisco 3 -- Jarvis Brown hit his first major league home run 
in the 11th inning to give the Braves a victory at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had been hitless in seven at-bats since being called up from triple-A 
Richmond on May 4. Known for his speed and defense, he got into the game in the 
ninth as a pinch-runner for outfielder David Justice, and won it when he drove 
a one-out, 1-and-2 pitch from Rod Beck (1-3) into the left field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's homer, in his 193rd at-bat in the majors, made a winner of Greg 
McMichael (2-2). McMichael retired Steve Scarsone with the bases loaded to end 
the 10th and pitched the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Kelly, in his first game for Atlanta since being traded by the Reds on 
Sunday for Deion Sanders, went one for four with a walk. He scored two runs and 
stole a base. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Olson, who had been on the disabled list because of elbow problems, got 
two outs in the 10th before McMichael relieved. John Smoltz, trying to end a 
five-game losing streak, got a no-decision after giving up three runs and six 
hits, walking three and striking out eight in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, Florida 3 -- After his base-running blunder cost the Astros a 
chance to take the lead in the eighth inning at Houston, Craig Biggio redeemed 
himself in the ninth. Biggio drove in two runs, including the game-winner with 
a two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggio was tagged out in a rundown in the eighth while trying to stretch a 
single into a double. Jeff Bagwell followed with a double. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 12, New York 2 -- The Rockies' Andres Galarraga is proving that 1993, 
when he won the National League batting title with a .370 average, was no 
fluke. The 32-year-old first baseman hit a grand slam, the fifth of his career 
and second of the season, as the Rockies pounded four Met pitchers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga is batting .332 with 18 home runs. He now has 19 RBIs for the month, 
after getting an NL-record 30 in April.

NCAA BASEBALL; POWELL'S HITTING KEEPS CAL STATE FULLERTON ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Dante Powell gave the fans at the NCAA Midwest I 
Regional baseball playoffs at Stillwater, Okla., something to remember him by 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was six for six, scored three runs, drove in two more and stole three 
bases in the Titans' 12-5 victory over Memphis State that gave his team its 
second chance at top-ranked Oklahoma State Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Powell is an absolutely fantastic player," Memphis Coach Jeff Hopkins said. 
"We threw everything at him, including the kitchen sink, and we still couldn't 
get him out. Fullerton puts a lot of pressure on you with their running game 
and Powell is a big part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Augie Garrido said Powell, who hit his ninth home run in the sixth 
inning, "was brilliant -- he really made things go." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, stretched thin for rested pitchers, decided to start Tony Fetchel, a 
senior right-hander who had pitched only nine innings previously this season 
and had given up seven runs. He yielded four runs before being replaced by Dan 
Ricabal in the fifth. Ricabal gave up only four hits and one run in the last 
five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Manship started for Memphis (52-11) and took the loss, giving up 12 hits 
in 6 2/3 innings. The Titans (44-14) totaled 18 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fetchel set us up with four innings that were important to us," Garrido said. 
"It was (pitching coach) George Horton's decision to start him, and I think it 
was a good call." The move enabled Fullerton to conserve pitching strength for 
the title game later. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Powell's big day, catcher Bret Hemphill had three hits, drove 
in three runs and scored two, and Adam Millan was two for five with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team responded well at the point in the game when we had only a one-run 
lead," Garrido said. "We put either one run or two on the board in every inning 
after that." LON EUBANKS

 Relief pitcher Mitch Williams, who recently predicted he would soon be 
released, will be put on waivers today by the Houston Astros, team sources told 
the Associated Press. 
</P>

a 7.65 ERA.

 Ken Griffey Jr. is tired of losing with the Seattle Mariners and says it might 
be time to win with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see staying," The News Tribune of Tacoma (Wash.) quoted Griffey in 
Monday editions. "I hate to lose. I love Seattle. I'm building a home there, 
and I love the people. But losing is killing me. It's killing me." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey made his comments after the Mariners were swept in a three-game series 
in Milwaukee. The Brewers had lost a team-record 14 in a row before the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes heart to win and we don't have enough here," Griffey said. "There's 
not enough heart here to win the division. It's easier to roll over and quit. 
People say we've never won here and never will, and for some players it's 
easier to let it keep happening than try and change it."

wear earrings" -- he went before the cameras with her to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to play ball and win games," Sanders said. "Mrs. Schott runs her 
team in a professional manner, in a very businesslike manner. I'm pleased with 
that." 
</P>

 Sanders talked about winning and helping the franchise; Schott praised the 
fact that Sanders is married and has two kids, "a good family man."

 The New York Mets' Dwight Gooden worked three hitless innings in his first 
scheduled rehabilitation start with Norfolk of the International League. 
Gooden, on the disabled list retroactive to April 22 because of ligament damage 
in his big right toe, struck out four of 10 Columbus Clippers he faced while 
walking one. He threw 39 pitches, 22 for strikes, and left the game with a 3-0 
lead.

 The Dodgers' dramatic improvement hasn't shown up in the attendance. By this 
time a year ago, the Dodgers were nearly out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodgers passed the 1 million mark in attendance Sunday, it was in 
their 25th home game -- the same number of games it took to reach the figure in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With six saves in the first 28 victories, Darren Dreifort has twice as many as 
the rest of the staff. However, everything is not perfect for the rookie out of 
Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 0-3, has an earned-run average of 4.38, and has given up 36 hits and 
walked 12 in 26 2/3 innings. The fans only remember his weekend against the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 50 games, Dodgers coming off the bench were batting .287, had 
nine doubles, eight home runs and 35 runs batted in. . . . Although it barely 
sprinkled at Dodger Stadium, the tarp was out and there was no batting 
practice. . . . Rick Sutcliffe, who beat the Dodgers in St. Louis, then went on 
the disabled list two weeks later, will face the Dodgers tonight. It will be 
his second start since suffering a hamstring injury more than a month ago. DAN

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SHOULDER TENDINITIS SIDELINES EASLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Angels didn't have enough woes already, they now are expected to be 
without starting third baseman Damion Easley until at least Friday, and perhaps 
as long as a week. Easley, who was taken for X-rays before Monday's game 
against the Cleveland Indians, was diagnosed with shoulder tendinitis.He is 
taking anti-inflammatory medication, and the Angels hope he won't have to be 
placed on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after my first throw (Sunday), it started to feel stiff," Easley said. 
"I put heat it on after the game, but it ached all day. If was still stiff last 
night and all this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have talked about moving Easley back to second base, but Manager 
Marcel Lachemann said any possible move likely will wait until the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Chili Davis, who missed Sunday's game with a jammed left 
wrist, felt fine in batting practice Monday and was back in the starting 
lineup. Yet, he struck out in each of his three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Greg Myers, who has missed the last four games on his injury 
rehabilitation assignment, will have his left knee examined today by Dr. Lewis 
Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Scott Lewis, who was eligible to come off the disabled list today, 
returned to Los Angeles because of continuing pain in his right shoulder. He 
also is scheduled to be examined by Yocum. BOB NIGHTENGALE

HOLLYWOOD PARK; GRAND FLOTILLA SINKS FAVORITES IN WINNING THE TURF HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap turned out to be a showcase for one 
horse, but it wasn't Bien Bien or Arcangues. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, a horse nearly risked in an $80,000 claimer for his first 
American start, saved ground throughout under Gary Stevens, then had the right 
response when a hole developed along the rail in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, third and then second in his first three U.S. races, the 7-year-old 
roan drew off to win by 1 3/4 lengths Monday in 1:59 1/5 for the 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the 14-1 shot gave trainer Jenine Sahadi, 31, the biggest 
victory of her year-old career and was the richest for a female trainer since 
Dianne Carpenter won the 1988 Jim Beam Stakes with Kingpost. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased by bloodstock agent Hubert Guy for owner Mike Sloan, Grand Flotilla 
almost didn't run in the Turf Handicap. Sahadi was considering the Golden Gate 
Handicap on June 18, but because the horse is a reluctant shipper, she decided 
to stay at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me almost an hour to get him on the van last time (shipping from 
Santa Anita to Hollywood Park last month), so we decided against going north," 
she said. "I can't believe it. I'm in shock. I keep thinking someone is going 
to tell me it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was running for second or third money. I'm sure heads are rolling 
in France (where Grand Flotilla raced in 1993) because this horse was not on 
the same level as Arcangues over there. Ever since he came here, he's really 
thrived. He's gained weight and he's so level-headed. He's shown tremendous 
improvement every race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although beaten by only three-quarters of a length by Bien Bien in the San 
Juan Capistrano at Santa Anita on April 24, the margin was deceptive because 
Bien Bien was in hand at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until Friday that they decided to go in this race, which was great 
with me," Stevens said. "I'd never sat on this horse before, but I had watched 
him run. I thought it was basically a three-horse race with Arcangues, Bien 
Bien and myself, and possibly Misil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a perfect trip. We got to save ground all the way. Then, the rail 
opened up for us in the lane, and he fired big." 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien, the 4-5 favorite and co-highweight at 124 pounds, finished 1 3/4 
lengths ahead of Blues Traveller. Kept in the clear by Chris McCarron, he 
joined the leaders around the turn, got the lead briefly, then couldn't stay 
with Grand Flotilla in the run to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did everything right," McCarron said of the 1993 Turf Handicap winner. "He 
just got outrun from the eighth pole to the wire. (Grand Flotilla) got lucky to 
get through, but that's what it takes sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Losing for the first time in three U.S. races, Arcangues finished fifth as the 
5-2 second choice, but ran contrary to his style. On the lead after the first 
quarter of a mile, he was second to Blues Traveller for the next six furlongs, 
then tired in the final furlong. The 6-year-old Sagace horse is better from off 
the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't have it today," Eddie Delahoussaye said. "He kind of bobbled 
on both turns, the track is kind of soft, but that didn't make him stop the way 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveller finished nearly three lengths ahead of Misil, the 5-1 third 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The $30.60 payoff on Grand Flotilla was the largest in the Turf Handicap since 
Barclay Joy paid $71.20 in 1975. . . . The on-track attendance of 37,219, 
largely due to a concert after the races by Gloria Trevi, was the largest at 
Hollywood Park since June 16, 1991, when 41,251 attended on Father's Day. . . . 
Lakeway, scheduled to be shipped to New York on Wednesday to run in the Mother 
Goose on June 12, worked six furlongs in 1:11 2/5 Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 With favorites winning five of the races, the inaugural National Best Seven 
paid $190.75 (based on a 50-cent wager) locally for tickets with seven winners 
and $7.75 for six winners. The pool at Hollywood Park was $47,047, the national 
pool $371,075.50. . . . Gary Stevens will begin a five-day suspension Friday 
for his disqualification from first to sixth on Silent Lord in Sunday's seventh 
race.

<P>
 Nick Price of Zimbabwe beat Scott Simpson in a playoff to win the rain-delayed 
Southwestern Bell Colonial golf tournament Monday at Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's eight-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole at the Colonial Country 
club capped a comeback from a seven-shot deficit in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Price had five holes to play and Simpson seven when thunderstorms forced 
suspension of play Sunday. Price, after birdies on the last three holes he 
played before the suspension, was two strokes back of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning Monday, Simpson parred in, finishing off a no-birdie round of 71 for 
a 266 total. Price birdied the first two holes he played Monday on his way to a 
final-round 64. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal made up a three-stroke deficit in the 
final round with five birdies on the last eight holes to win the European PGA 
Championship at Virginia Water, England. The Spaniard shot a seven-under 65 on 
Wentworth's West Course to finish at 271, 17 under. 
</P>
<P>
 Seve Ballesteros, who had a final round 68 to finish six strokes back of 
Olazabal, said he had changed his mind and would not try to pre-qualify for the 
June 16-19 U.S. Open. "I feel I deserve an invitation after so many years," he 
said. Horse Racing

 Holy Bull, the badly beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby, showed up his 
elders in the Metropolitan Handicap at New York's Belmont Park. The gray colt, 
ridden by Mike Smith, dazzled a Memorial Day crowd of 26,721 by leading every 
step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner-trainer Jimmy Croll said he is undecided if Holy Bull will run in the 
Belmont Stakes June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race before the Metropolitan, Sea Hero, the 1993 Kentucky Derby winner, 
finished second to Fourstars Allstar in the D-Day Remembrance Purse on the 
grass. Sea Hero won an allowance race on dirt in his previous start. . . Soviet 
Problem won the $150,000 Oakland Handicap at Golden Gate Fields. The 4-year-old 
filly covered the six furlongs on a fast track in 1:08 3/5. Gundaghia was 
second and Arches of Gold third. Miscellany

HAL KING, FORMER TRAINER, DIES AT 75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal King, 75, a trainer in California for 37 years until his retirement in 
1990, died early Sunday morning at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla after a lengthy 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 A bloodstock agent and consultant to Sid and Jenny Craig, the owners of 
Paseana, Exchange, Tossofthecoin and Fumo Di Londa, among other thoroughbreds, 
since his retirement, King entered racing as an owner in 1947 before turning to 
training in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he had an enemy," said trainer Ron McAnally, one of King's 
longtime friends. "He was a very kind and loyal man. He gave (the late) Laz 
Barrera his first horse to train when he came to this country." 
</P>
<P>
 The co-leading trainer at the 1987 Oak Tree meeting with nine winners from 20 
starts, King won two stakes with Kicapu Kid, a horse he bought for $2,900. 
</P>
<P>
 He also trained Pro Or Con, who won the CTBA Stakes and the Linda Vista 
Handicap in 1980, and Johnlee N'Harold, who won the 1980 California Breeders' 
Champion Stakes and the 1981 San Rafael Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for King will be Thursday at 11 a.m. at Temple Beth David in Temple 
City. His ashes will then be scattered at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include sons Don, 33, and Jon, 34, and two grandchildren. BOB

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: MUIR THE FAVORITE TO WIN TITLE IN STATE TRACK MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many coaches at Pasadena Muir High, Clyde Turner is faced with the task 
of integrating gifted athletes into a team that performs up to the high 
expectations of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure has meant short careers for many of his colleagues: Jack Allen is 
the school's seventh football coach in the past eight years, for example. But 
Turner is proud that he is in his 13th season as the boys' track and field 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a rich tradition of high-quality athletes here," said Turner, who 
has won one State title and five Southern Section championships. "The community 
knows this and just expects every team to win titles every year. They don't 
understand all the factors involved, but that doesn't change anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mustangs are overwhelming favorites to win the team title in the 
State meet Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College, Turner cautions his 
supporters not to count on a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems are routine for Turner, such as the one involving freshman sprinter 
Obea Moore last week. Moore, who had qualified for last Friday's Southern 
Section Masters' meet in the 400 and 800 meters, clashed with his coach over 
which race he would run, because a double was too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner wanted Moore to run the 400 because he had the event's fastest 
qualifying time, but the talented freshman said he was going to run the 800 at 
the urging of his parents and youth coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a team, you cannot let individuals put themselves first, so this created a 
problem," Turner said. "I explained the situation to our captain (hurdler Ken 
Haslip) and team, and they decided to let Obea make his own decision although 
they were not happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore ran the 800 and finished third. He partially made up for this 
disappointment by running strong legs on Muir's victorious 400 and 1,600 relay 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in northwest Pasadena near the Rose Bowl, Muir attracts some of the 
Southland's top athletes. That is not always a blessing to coaches, who must 
also learn to cope with personal agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell all of my kids there are no letter I 's in the word team ," Turner 
said. "This school has graduated some terrific athletes, so one or two is not 
going to make or break it. I try to remember that philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Woodland Hills Taft, who two weeks ago said he planned to 
skip the State meet, has changed his mind and is one of the favorites to win 
the 400 meters this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-bound senior, who has overcome several injuries this season, 
cut back his schedule to concentrate on preparing for football this fall. But 
after winning the 400 in 47.77 seconds at the City finals last Thursday, 
DeSaussure decided to run another week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see if I could cruise a 47," he said. "I felt great. I really 
hope I can win (the State title)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Track fans might remember that the final day of the State meet was canceled 
hours before it was to start last year because of the preceding night of heavy 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather quickly cleared, however, and by the time the finals were to 
start, the sun was out and the track was dry. The CIF, heavily criticized for 
its call, vows not to make the same mistake this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The final day of the 1993 State meet was eventually rescheduled two weeks 
later, but this year, if a delay or postponement is necessary, the track and 
field advisory committee has the option of continuing the meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley police detectives said last Friday that they will ask the Ventura 
County District Attorney to consider filing charges against Mike Scyphers, Simi 
Valley's baseball coach. Scyphers has been on paid administrative leave from 
his job since May 3 while police investigated claims that he allegedly 
mishandled his team's money and discipline. Scyphers was out of uniform but 
present Friday as Simi Valley was eliminated from the Southern Section playoffs 
after losing to Fountain Valley, 12-1, in a Division I quarterfinal. . . . 
All-State wide receiver Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park is expected to stand 
trial for allegedly firing a gun into the back of his girlfriend's home last 
month. At a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior Court last Friday, 
Van Buren's arraignment was set for June 9. The senior player accepted a 
football scholarship to Colorado in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaret Wright of Anaheim Katella, expected to be selected in the first or 
second round of this week's amateur baseball draft, ended his high school 
career on a down note. The right-handed pitcher, who throws in the 
mid-90-m.p.h. range, gave up six hits and nine runs in 1 2/3 innings of relief 
as Katella lost to Lakewood, 12-1, in the Southern Section Division I 
quarterfinals last Tuesday. . . . Alhambra Keppel won its fifth consecutive 
Southern Section badminton title last week, defeating Garden Grove, 15-4. The 
Aztecs are 96-0 in that span. . . . Led by Pene Gbegnon, University won the 
City girls' gymnastics title with 150.5 points. Venice was second with 147.6.

 ESPRIT DE CORE: Teachers reach for an old student trick today to win over 
voters. Educators and other school boosters are rolling a giant apple into 
Thousand Oaks to grab some attention for Proposition 1B. The June 7 ballot 
measure would offer $1 billion in bonds to pay for new school construction. 
Standing 10 feet tall and 12 feet wide, the red apple arrives by flatbed truck. 
. . . It'll be the centerpiece of an afternoon rally at Thousand Oaks High 
before heading north on its statewide tour. 
</P>
<P>
 TRAPPING TOURISTS: While Ventura casts for tourists with its newly refurbished 
pier, Oxnard trumpets its July jazz and blues festival to attract visitors. . . 
. As summer fast approaches, hotels, restaurants and other tourist-dependent 
businesses are gearing up for their busiest season in years (Valley Business, 
Page 11). . . . Ventura hotels did unusually well in January and February, 
normally the slow period. And the city's tourism office predicts more than 1 
1/2 million people will visit county beach communities before Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 TIME TO HOWL: He's on the road, again. But this time, poet Allen Ginsberg hits 
the highway without his beatnik buddies. . . . Today, the 67-year-old makes a 
pit stop at the Ventura Bookstore from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to sign copies of 
his latest book of poems: "Cosmopolitan Greetings, 1986-1992." Judging from the 
picture on the jacket, the balding, bespectacled bard looks more like an 
English professor these days than a Beat Generation visionary or bearded, 
love-beaded '60s guru. 
</P>
<P>
 TECH HIGH: In a room that once housed wood-shop classes, saws have been 
replaced by software. . . . The Technology Lab at Sequoia Middle School in 
Thousand Oaks (B4) is outfitted with four kinds of computers and a dozen 
workstations, offering the latest link to high-tech careers. "The new tools are 
not the hammer and the bench vise. It's a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor, a 
robotic arm," said Richard Nicholson, president of a statewide trade 
association. "The tools have changed, so we just need to change with the 
times."

DANIEL FLOOD; FLAMBOYANT EX-LAWMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel (Dapper Dan) Flood, the flamboyant politician with the handlebar 
mustache who was a king to some but a crook to others, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood, 90, died of pneumonia at Mercy Hospital near the scene of his greatest 
political triumphs and his resounding, humiliating defeat in the swirl of a 
national bribery scandal 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for wearing debonair clothes to which he sometimes added a cape, Flood 
left Congress in disgrace in 1980 after 32 years. He pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on 13 counts of bribery, 
perjury and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that the Democrat used his powerful position as chairman 
of the House Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health, education and 
welfare to line his pockets with thousands of dollars from contractors and 
lobbyists and to divert payroll money into his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a second trial could begin, Flood pleaded guilty to a single count of 
conspiracy. He was fined and placed on one-year probation. The original charges 
carried a maximum sentence of 155 years and $220,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailing Flood -- who was suffering from a bone condition -- told reporters 
at the time of the compromise: "I don't think I have the physical or 
intellectual resources to defend myself adequately." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned home to Wilkes-Barre, where his constituents would remember him 
more for his efforts on behalf of coal miners and victims of a 1972 flood than 
for his trespasses. 
</P>
<P>
 He greeted visitors while seated in a chair, with a sign that read "King" at 
its head and an American flag at his back. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he would speak quietly of how he helped change laws so the victims of 
the Susquehanna River flood that almost wiped out Wilkes-Barre in 1972 could be 
helped back into their homes; how he steered a bill through the Congress 
providing loans to the 80,000 flood victims at 1% interest, and providing 
$5,000 forgiveness for losses on income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, he said in a 1982 interview, "the greatest (work) in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 At his peak, he enjoyed the privileges of power as few had before him. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke glowingly before his trial of that career: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has more clout than Dan Flood," he said. "Defense and HEW (Health, 
Education and Welfare) goes through my hands. Chum, that's a big role. . . . 
Luckily, I'm a nice fellow. I can help out a lot of nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 Flood's chief accuser was Stephen B. Elko, his former administrative 
assistant. Elko served a three-year term for taking $25,000 in bribes to 
influence Flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Flood maintained a low profile, venturing out only occasionally for 
a political dinner, veterans gathering, union meeting or a party celebrating 
his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after his forced retirement, Flood spoke with sadness about his new 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lost," he said. "I was so active in Washington from early in the 
morning until midnight or later every night. Going to so many places, and doing 
so many things, and then mixing with the Senate and their problems and the 
conference committees. Learning and hearing about the whole spectrum of 
legislation which is before a Congress at any given time. . . . I especially 
miss the members coming to see me and asking me for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Flood was born in nearby Hazleton. He received his bachelor's and master's 
degrees from Syracuse University and his law degree from Dickinson Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Clark, his aide from 1968 to 1980, said history will put Flood's 
actions in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those Flood years will probably surface in glowing contrast to what is going 
on today in Washington," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood is survived by his wife, Catherine.

PAUL HOUSTON; WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Green Houston, a longtime Washington correspondent for the Los Angeles 
Times and author of its popular weekly "Washington Insight" column, died late 
Sunday after a two-year battle with colon cancer. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston joined the Los Angeles Times in 1965 as a staff writer in Los Angeles 
and was assigned to its Washington bureau in 1972. He first covered the 
California congressional delegation before his beat was expanded to include all 
of Congress. He served a term as chairman of the Standing Committee of 
Correspondents, the organization of news reporters assigned to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston played a prominent role in The Times' coverage of the Watergate 
affair, including the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, 
and later in coverage of the Iran-Contra scandal. Several years ago, drawing on 
his experience and contacts, he took over the newspaper's "Washington Insight" 
column, which features behind-the-scenes glimpses of the capital's processes of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the best sources of anyone on the Hill," said Times Washington Bureau 
Chief Jack Nelson. "I covered impeachment with him, and he had better sources 
than I did. He was extremely well-liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Said House Speaker Thomas J. Foley (D-Wash.), "Congress had a good many 
journalists covering the Hill in recent years, but Paul Houston was in the 
handful of the best. Few had covered it longer or better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), dean of the California delegation, said Houston 
always "treated the delegation with scrupulous fairness. He was always welcome 
in any office in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, who was named after the Pulitzer-prize winning playwright and family 
friend Paul Green, was born into a writing family in Chapel Hill, N.C. His 
father, Noel Houston, was a prize-winning journalist and novelist who authored 
the best-selling 1946 novel "The Great Promise." His mother, Kay Replogle 
Houston, was a noted gardener and cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston demonstrated an interest in journalism in his high school years and 
then as an English major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
where he wrote for the Daily Tar Heel and was assistant sports publicity 
director for the university. He was graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, he moved to Houston where he worked as a reporter for the 
Houston Chronicle for a year, and then joined the San Francisco Examiner, where 
he worked for another year. In 1968, at age 25, he became the youngest 
recipient of a Nieman Fellowship for journalists at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an avid sportsman who enthusiastically pursued tennis, golf and body 
surfing, and, in fact, scored 81 in a golf match four days before entering the 
hospital for the last time this month. He was also a devoted cook, reader, 
trombonist and punster. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Virginia; two daughters, Katherine and Susanna; 
and a sister, Diana Houston, all of the Washington area.

RESCUERS SEEK TO SAVE WHALE STUCK IN CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rescuers spent most of Monday wetting down a whale that got stuck in a shallow 
creek for a third time in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately the whale is stuck.If he can't wrangle out of the mud, we'll 
have to wait the low tide out," said Denize Springer, a spokeswoman for the 
Marine Mammal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-foot immature gray whale has been wandering through South San Francisco 
Bay channels since it took a detour into the Guadalupe Slough near Alviso on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers thought it was headed back to the bay Saturday night, but it turned 
around and swam upstream, where it got stuck in about one foot of water in San 
Tomas Aquino Creek near the Santa Clara Golf & Tennis Club, Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tide came in Sunday afternoon, the whale briefly broke free and 
headed toward the bay. But after less than a mile, it turned around and got 
stuck once more as the tide receded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers used a harness Monday and began gently guiding the animal through 
three miles of winding channels, but the whale got stuck again when low tide 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep the whale's skin from burning, rescuers covered it with 
wet sheets and sprayed it with water. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians had no idea why the whale kept turning the wrong way. Blood 
tests suggested it was healthy and it was breathing normally Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers considered hoisting the five-ton cetacean onto a flatbed truck and 
driving it back to the bay, but feared it may not be able to endure the trauma 
of being removed from the water, Springer said.

ADOPTED CHILD SYNDROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Alan Dershowitz's column condemning the "abuse excuse" 
defense (Commentary, May 15): 
</P>
<P>
 I wholeheartedly agree that promoting the so-called adopted child syndrome 
victimizes thousands of normal, well-adjusted, and productive people who happen 
to have been loved and parented by adoption rather than by biology. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dershowitz fails to point out that adopted people are frequently 
victimized and stigmatized in our culture.The widely viewed film "Problem Child 
II," where the star is a first-rate brat who happens to have been adopted, 
clearly maligns adopted children. The press often differentiates between 
adopted and non-adopted people, even when this difference is irrelevant to the 
story's content (e.g., the custody battle over Loni Anderson and Burt Reynolds' 
young son.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the most egregious victimization is that performed by mental health 
professionals and educators. Many psychiatrists, psychologists and teachers 
think of adopted children as ipso facto troubled and disturbed. Modern 
scientifically conducted research, however, finds that adopted people in 
general are as well-adjusted as non-adopted people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many professionals (as well as non-professionals) do not know what most 
adopted people and their parents know: 1) that one can easily love someone who 
does not come from one's own gene pool and 2) that most birth mothers agonize 
to make the best adoption plan possible for their babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz is quite right to assert that "the vast majority of adopted 
childrendo not kill" or commit other serious crimes. But don't blame Martin 
Efman, accused mass murderer Joel Rifkin's defense attorney, for utilizing the 
distorted perceptions of adoptedness that already exist in our society. After 
all, the attorney's job is to defend his client by any means necessary.

ANGELIDES' ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing this letter regarding George Skelton's column about my television 
ads ("Ugly Ads Find Their Way Into Primary Races," May 19). Here are the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys), throughout his legislative career, has 
opposed a woman's right to choose an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 On not one, not two, but three occasions within the last year, he refused to 
support AJR 26, a resolution which specifically referred to the death of Dr. 
David Gunn and clinic violence and which called on the federal government to 
make it a crime to block clinics. This, after hundreds of women and hundreds of 
clinics had been assaulted by terrorists. What appalls me is that a political 
leader either can't see or won't stand up to that violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has rightly earned his standing as an anti-abortion leader. In 1986, 
he led the fight to cut off family planning funds, likening Planned Parenthood 
to the Ku Klux Klan in a shocking floor speech. He has consistently voted 
against Medi-Cal funding and, in 1981, demanded that the treasurer (the office 
he now seeks) hold up court-ordered funding. According to the California 
Abortion Rights and Reproductive Action League, he cast not a single pro-choice 
vote from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 My ads are truthful and his votes are in black and white.

PERSPECTIVE ON KOREAN AMERICANS; AN EMERGING MINORITY SEEKS ROLE IN A CHANGING

 In the aftermath of the Los Angeles civil unrest of 1992, Korean Americans 
have emerged as one of the most misunderstood ethnic groups in America. The 
image of Korean American merchants defending their stores with guns sent shock 
waves throughout the country. As a result, Korean Americans are often perceived 
as "gun-toting vigilantes." Before the civil disturbances, Korean Americans 
were often stereotyped as being rude, disrespectful and greedy. During the 
1980s, Korean American merchants in several cities were accused of exploiting 
and oppressing the African American communities in which their stores were 
located, and African American leaders often led boycotts of the stores. 
Distorted images and stereotypes were constantly projected and reinforced by 
the media. Merchant-customer disputes were made into race wars in the media. 
Thousands of Korean immigrants and Korean-owned shops became targets of racism, 
looting and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Once regarded as indistinguishable from Chinese or Japanese Americans, Korean 
Americans are now having to refute negative and stereotypical images that have 
been attached to them. Until recently, no one ever bothered to ask about the 
history of this emerging community -- 67.6% of whom are American citizens by 
birth or naturalization. No one seemed to consider that Korean Americans have a 
unique history, a deep culture and an abiding faith in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Americans are often called the "new urban immigrants" because the 
majority of the community arrived in America after 1965. However, Korean 
migration to the United States began at the turn of the century. Nearly 10,000 
Koreans entered before the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act. That 
legislation virtually halted all Asian immigration to the United States. From 
1950s to 1965, about 20,000 Korean orphans, war brides, students and diplomats 
came to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A history of racial oppression, economic exploitation and political 
subjugation characterized the early Korean immigrant population. Many worked as 
contract-laborers earning low wages, facing harsh working and enduring 
difficult living conditions without the possibility of upward mobility. Like 
other Asian immigrants, Korean immigrants were designated as "aliens ineligible 
to become naturalized American citizens." What is more important, the early 
Korean immigrants were vulnerable to the same racial and economic exploitation 
experienced by other non-European newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The early immigrants were mostly young, single, uneducated males from rural 
backgrounds. The passage of the 1965 Immigration Act not only dramatically 
increased the number of Korean Americans but also changed the characteristics 
of the community. The Korean American population exploded from 357,000 in 1980 
to 798,849 in 1990. In the post-1965 wave of immigrants, the population tended 
to be highly educated, family-oriented, middle-class or urban professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Language and cultural barriers, overt and covert racial discrimination in the 
labor market and a lack of transferable skills force many highly educated 
Korean immigrants to be self-employed. A 1989 survey conducted by Eui-Young Yu, 
a professor of sociology at Cal State Los Angeles, revealed that 69% of Korean 
male heads of households are college graduates and 40% of adult Korean males 
are self-employed. The survey found that only 10% of Korean American-owned 
businesses primarily service African American clientele. The majority of these 
businesses are located in white (48%) and Latino (17%) neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no preference to enter into these businesses and Korean Americans do 
not receive special loans from the U.S. government. Immigrants utilize ethclass 
(a term encompassing ethnic solidarity and a shared middle-class background) 
resources to establish businesses in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Korea is in some ways a homogeneous society whose unity is deeply rooted in a 
common language, culture, tradition, custom and history. Yet, Korea is divided 
into two separate and hostile parts: a communist state in the North and a 
capitalist state in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans feel that they share a "history of suffering," having endured one of 
the most oppressive measures to wipe out their race and culture during Japanese 
colonial rule (1910-1945). To understand Koreans and Korean Americans, one must 
grasp the concepts of Han and Jung. These are two parts of the Korean ethos 
that distinguish Koreans from other Asian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Han has no established English translation. The deep meaning of Han can only 
begin to be understood in feelings of resentment, bitterness, grievance or 
regret. Elaine Kim, a professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, translated 
Han as the sorrow and anger that grow from the accumulated experiences of 
oppression. Koreans and Korean Americans often express that "they lived life 
full of Han" and developed Hwabyong, a disease of frustration and rage 
following misfortune. To release Han, Korean Americans work hard to make the 
American dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 K.W. Lee, a prominent Korean American journalist, attributes the phenomenal 
growth and success of Korean immigrants to their shared experiences of Korean 
War and Japanese colonial rule. "For Koreans and Korean Americans in their late 
30s and older, they always look back Korean War as demarcation point. The 
Korean War and suffering of Koreans became a point of reference and a source of 
energy." Unaware of the shameful history of racial oppression of nonwhite 
immigrants and other people of color in the United States, Korean immigrants 
want to believe in the ideas of American democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jung is also a difficult concept to translate. It refers to a combination of 
love, compassion, sympathy and sentiment. Because of Jung, many Korean 
immigrants succeed or fail in business, social relations and even family 
relationships. Jung between people can be positive or negative, strong or weak, 
without reference to the amount of time shared between them. Jung is probably 
responsible for the dramatic increase of Korean immigrants to the United States 
during the past two decades. It compels Korean immigrants to bring uncles, 
aunts and distant relatives to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Korean American community, churches are the most important social, 
cultural, and economic institution. More than 70% of Korean immigrants are 
believed to be regular church-goers. Church is the place where newcomers meet 
fellow immigrants. Through church activities, Korean immigrants attempt to cope 
with the overwhelming sense of alienation, frustration, anger and helplessness 
they feel in their newly adopted home. Korean American churches tend to be 
conservative and evangelical. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, these are only a few of the pieces of the puzzle that non-Koreans 
can begin to gather to learn more about one of America's most visible yet 
misunderstood ethnic communities -- an emerging presence in an emerging new 
America. Understanding each other's culture, history and people is the first 
step toward a truly multicultural and multiracial society. Multicultural 
education is a form of resistance to oppression for it can serve as a basis for 
forging coalitions between racial and ethnic groups. We are being awakened to 
the realization that we have a tremendous stake in the outcome of things being 
planned for Los Angeles and other large urban centers across the nation. The 
Korean American community can play a pivotal role in the social change taking 
place.

NEW APPROACH IN WAR ON A TENACIOUS PLAGUE; RETURN TO BASIC SCIENCE IS URGED IN 
SEEKING AN AIDS CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cruel in its manifestation, fiendishly enigmatic in its pathogenesis, AIDS 
marches on relentlessly. Already 360,000 cases have been diagnosed in this 
country alone; 220,000 people have died. Worse is sure to come soon. It is 
about 10 years since the disease was first identified. With its stealthy 
years-long latency, that means thousands infected by the HIV virus in the 
mid-1980s, before they learned how to protect themselves, will soon start to 
develop symptoms and die. Despite massive research, the tiny virus has 
outwitted the best scientific minds. Little progress has been made in finding a 
cure or vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for new thinking, new approaches. A lucid and logical 
framework for the future comes now from Bernard N. Fields of the Harvard 
Medical School. In a paper in the British journal Nature, he argues that AIDS 
is far more complex than anyone imagined and calls for a broadening of research 
and a return to basic science. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, valuable time has been lost in following narrow hunches for an 
easy cure, some magic bullet. "The real challenge," he writes, "is to put aside 
politics and the illusion of easy answers so that we can concentrate on studies 
that offer a real possibility of working." He adds: "In our zeal to control 
AIDS, we have invested enormous resources in the search for drugs and vaccines. 
This may have been reasonable 10 years ago, but is no longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Wise words, but politically difficult. A huge medical, corporate, bureaucratic 
and political infrastructure is committed to testing new remedies and vaccines. 
Even as Dr. Fields' words were published, the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases appeared, reluctantly, to be ready to spend tens of 
millions of dollars on human tests of two vaccines even though laboratory tests 
showed they had no effect on HIV viruses isolated from infected people. 
</P>
<P>
 In their legitimate outrage over the federal government's shameful slowness to 
act on AIDS during the last decade, activists forced quick approval of unproven 
drugs. As a result, the drug AZT was widely prescribed to delay the onset of 
disease in infected people who had not yet developed symptoms. Only later did 
further studies show it was useful only in people with advanced disease. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS has dashed hopes that it could be controlled as polio was. That 
devastating epidemic too was caused by a virus. Once it was identified, a 
vaccine could be developed. Alas, as Fields notes, the HIV virus is far more 
complex, unpredictable and nefarious. Fields calls for expanded research in 
related areas (such as on other infectious agents), on basic study of the early 
events of HIV infection and on the so-called opportunistic infections that 
often fell AIDS patients. "AIDS is a novel disease requiring new paradigms and 
a new conceptual framework," he argues. "We must give serendipity (and reasoned 
scientific redirection) a chance to join the war on AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 His notions are embraced by many AIDS experts, including Dr. Mervyn F. 
Silverman, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, and Dr. 
William Paul, new director of the Office of AIDS Research at the National 
Institutes of Health. Some activist groups, such as the New York ACT UP 
organization, continue to focus on a speedy cure and support a bill in Congress 
that would set up a focused research program outside of the NIH. But other AIDS 
groups, though divided, have begun to see that such narrow approaches have so 
far proved counterproductive. We need a new beginning on AIDS.

RECOGNIZING A FACT OF MODERN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Californians, predominantly senior citizens, live 
together but don't marry. These are not casual relationships, quickly forged 
and just as quickly abandoned; rather, they are marriages in all but name. The 
story is a familiar one: A husband or wife died some years ago and the 
surviving spouse finds companionship and solace, even love, with a widow or 
widower. Yet legal marriage could jeopardize the Social Security benefits to 
which each is entitled separately. Familiar, too, are stories of gay couples 
who are not legally permitted to marry but forge relationships as stable and as 
close as that of any heterosexual couple. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as important as these relationships are to the individuals involved, 
they are meaningless to the State of California. So when, for example, one 
partner becomes gravely ill, a hospital is under no legal obligation to extend 
visitation rights to the other, and most don't. Unmarried partners, no matter 
how long their relationship, do not have the same priority in the law as do 
spouses to act as conservators for one another in the event one is 
incapacitated and cannot make his or her own decisions as to medical treatment 
or finances. Nor can a domestic partner, upon death, easily leave a residence 
to the surviving partner. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2810, sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), thoughtfully 
addresses these very real concerns by proposing much-needed changes in state 
probate, health and safety and family law.  
</P>
<P>
 Katz's bill would create a Domestic Partners Registry, extending certain 
rights in times of crisis to unmarried individuals who share a common residence 
and agree to be jointly responsible for each other's basic living expenses. The 
rights include visitation, conservatorship capability and ease in willing 
property to one another. The registry idea is not new, but Katz's bill would 
make California the first to extend the concept statewide. AB 2810 is scheduled 
for a vote on the Assembly floor this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The procedures for the creation and dissolution of partnerships would ensure 
that such relationships were struck only after much thought. Moreover, the bill 
is fiscally prudent; the total cost of maintaining the registry would be 
covered by the fees charged to applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition comes from groups such as the Traditional Values Coalition that 
fear the bill condones homosexuality and devalues traditional families. But, as 
Katz notes, 93% of unmarried couples in California are heterosexual couples. 
That's why the American Assn. of Retired Persons, along with other major 
seniors groups and labor organizations, strongly supports it. At its core, this 
bill condones the most traditional of values -- compassion, mutual support and 
responsibility.

FEAR OF CRIME AND GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Fear of Gun Crime: Deeper Than Any Set of Statistics" (May 22) 
hits very wide of the bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Though criminal usage of firearms is up, so is successful civilian usage in 
justified self-defense, to over 2 million per annum. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment, you're only half right. The 
constitutional framers were rightly afraid of a dictatorial central government; 
however, the Second Amendment does in fact confirm an individual right to own 
arms. "Militia" is quite clearly defined by extant federal law as all men 
between the ages of 16 and 45 who are not convicted criminals. It has nothing 
to do with an organized militia or the National Guard, as the Founding Fathers 
were afraid of standing armies -- something that the National Guard clearly is. 
</P>
<P>
 In every other article of the Bill of Rights the phrase "the people" has been 
construed to confirm individual rights (as interpreted by the Supreme Court). 
There is no reason the Second Amendment should be an exception, particularly as 
it is the only amendment assuring all the other rights by force of arms. In 
fact, James Madison wanted it to be the first, not second, as force of arms was 
more important than freedom to criticize. 
</P>
<P>
 You have revealed your politically correct bias by indicating your preference 
for "an America that is intolerant of guns." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * I wanted to thank you for your editorial on gun control. It is time we begin 
to take back control of our cities and our country. The day of the National 
Rifle Assn. setting the agenda for all Americans is over. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade we have witnessed two major actions that were once 
thought impossible: Strong action on drunk driving -- saving lives; and strong 
action to control smoking -- again saving lives. It is now time to remove 
handguns from the general population and begin to get some control on this 
issue. Too many young people are dying. Also, not getting control of the guns 
is standing by and doing nothing while the large part of a generation of black 
youth are wiped out. Maybe we cannot do much to help other countries with 
internal problems, but I sure hope we can do something to save all these 
valuable young lives. I was born and raised in the area and the last couple of 
years I have begun to fear for my safety as I am on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 I fully realize it is not the only area necessary to solve in crime, but it is 
a very important area and we must begin. Thank you for bringing the issue up 
for public debate. 
</P>

 * You first state that "crime is a complex problem -- with roots in the social 
and economic system." Then you refer to the "gun-driven crime problem" which is 
swamping police. Which is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in your editorial remarks about "roots in the social and economic 
system" you have inadvertently alluded to the real causes of crime. Perhaps 
some of The Times' editorial energy would be put to better use focusing on real 
problems rather than scapegoating inanimate objects.

<P>
 * If guns were stopping crimes and protecting our safety, we should be the 
safest country in the whole world. 
</P>
<P>
 How come then, that in spite all the guns we possess, we are the most 
crime-ridden country in the world? 
</P>

<P>
 * I propose the following measures for gun control: 
</P>
<P>
 * All guns in homes or places of business be exempt from controls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guns must be registered to be outside of a home or place of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Convicted felons and other categories of persons be ineligible for 
registering guns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police permitted to search, with or without cause, persons and vehicles 
outside of homes and places of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unregistered guns found outside of homes or places of business be 
confiscated and destroyed. No other penalty for possession, per se. No other 
evidence other than a gun found in the course of the search admissible as 
evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The searches pose a constitutional problem, but we already search at airports, 
schools and other public places. Other checkpoints could be established with 
citizen cooperation.

<P>
 * The headline of your editorial, "Fear of Gun Crime: Deeper Than Any Set of 
Statistics" really says it all. The Times' endless stream of anti-gun 
editorials both contain and pander to ignorant emotionalism with little or no 
regard for the actual, readily available facts. 
</P>
<P>
 This editorial, however, sank to a new low by saying the pro-gun letters you 
receive are the result of "the organized letter campaign that inevitably stalks 
any gun-control proposal" and only the anti-gun letters are from "the 
unorganized voices of ordinary, concerned readers."

HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Donella Meadows' suggestions on health care (Commentary, May 13): 
</P>
<P>
 Her words make up the clearest and most logical statement expressed to date. 
She is correct in asserting that it makes no difference whether health-care 
costs are paid to the government and called taxes, or to insurance companies 
and called premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 By reducing "bureaucracy, advertising, lobbying, litigating, stockholders, 
lush corporate offices and exorbitant executive salaries," health care no 
longer is a profit-making enterprise dominated by insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do I have more faith in the medical decisions of insurance companies 
rather than those of a broad citizens' committee made up of non-professional 
and professional citizens. Their aim only need be giving the best and the most 
to the most people. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple workable single-payer system can evolve ultimately. Let us begin to 
work it out now and thank you, Donella Meadows.

A BURGEONING PARTNERSHIP; RUSSIA'S ENROLLING IN NEW GROUP COULD OPEN DOOR TO 
GAINS IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia has told NATO that it's now ready to join the 18 other countries, 
including former republics of the Soviet Union, that have accepted the West's 
invitation to enroll in a new Partnership for Peace. Moreover, Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev told his counterparts from 16 NATO nations the other day, Russia 
is ready to sign on -- maybe as early as next month -- without the conditions 
it earlier indicated it would demand. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has politely welcomed Moscow's decision. Better, after all, to be on a 
friendly consultative footing with the country whose territorial expansionism 
NATO was originally formed to resist than to continue treating that country 
like a mistrusted outsider. It's clear nonetheless that within NATO strong 
doubts about Russia's aims remain, and that a healthy caution is likely to 
guide the West's approach to developing closer military ties with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace (PfP) is an idea hastily thrown together in 
Washington earlier this year to fend off those former members of the Warsaw 
Pact -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, most prominently -- that were 
rapping on NATO's door in quest of membership. Their reason was the honorable 
one of self-preservation. All had sound historical reasons to fear Russia and, 
if less so now, Germany, and membership in NATO would provide a larger measure 
of collective security than any had ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at a time when ultranationalists had just scored big in Russia's 
parliamentary elections, the consensus in Western capitals was that this wasn't 
the most opportune time to begin extending NATO's flank eastward, to the very 
borders of the former Soviet Union. Instead there would be the PfP, which would 
forge military links between old antagonists by means of joint military 
exercises, defense planning and maybe peacekeeping missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's readiness to join the PfP unconditionally does, however, carry an 
asterisk. Grachev made clear that Russia remains the superpower in Europe and 
expects to be treated with the respect that status implies, and not simply as 
just one state among many. He also made clear that Russia regards the PfP as 
only a way station to a new "collective security system in Europe" in which 
NATO would play a subordinate role. 
</P>
<P>
 Most NATO countries are in any case plainly unenthusiastic about admitting to 
NATO membership a Russia whose long-term interests -- focused on the former 
states of the Soviet Union -- don't coincide with that organization's. But in 
joining up with the PfP, Russia at least will open the way to greater 
consultation and cooperation in the security field than has so far been 
possible. A small step forward, perhaps, but not an insignificant one.

TODAY'S SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL SEMIFINAL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 DIVISION I 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (21-5-1) vs. Marina (24-2), Golden West College 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the county's hottest pitchers square off as Pacifica freshman Toni 
Mascarenas (15-3, 0.09 earned-run average) meets junior Marcy Crouch (20-2, 
0.26). The Mariners spent the season doing just enough to get by, but have 
scored more runs (16) in their three shutout victories than any team left in 
the playoffs; they've won 11 in a row. Marina, led by the hitting of first 
baseman Lynette Velazquez, has a 14-game winning streak and easily represents 
the best-hitting team Pacifica has faced in the playoffs. The key for Marina is 
to avoid defensive mistakes; if the Vikings can't, it could be trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc (22-5) vs. Foothill (24-6), Canyon HS 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team was supposed to be here, but Lompoc upset defending champion and 
third-seeded Simi Valley (and pitcher Sara Griffin) in the second round, and 
followed with a 2-1 come-from-behind victory at Fountain Valley. Foothill upset 
No. 2 Los Alamitos, 7-4, with an unexpected power display; coupled with earlier 
victories over Huntington Beach and Kennedy, the Knights have had the most 
impressive run among the semifinalists. Lompoc has pitcher Kim Wuest (19-1) and 
an offense led by Chastity Johnson (.488), but Foothill can counter with 
Michelle Churnock (.548). DIVISION II 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus (27-2-1) vs. Fullerton (17-13), Fullerton College 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has excelled in these playoffs because it has played solid defense 
and focused on the game at hand; Saugus would be wise to not look past the 
Indians. Although the teams don't match up on paper -- Saugus has Jamie Gillies 
(22-2, 0.49), Kim O'Leary (.470), Chris Gill (.427) -- Fullerton didn't match 
up against two of its three previous playoff victims, including fourth-seeded 
Lakewood. No one expects the Indians to win this game, but no one expected them 
to get this far, either -- and they've got the home-town advantage. MARTIN

 Today's schedule: Sunny Hills (21-1) vs. Palm Desert (22-1-1), Shadow Mountain 
Resort & Racquet Club, Palm Springs, 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defending champion: Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The 100-degree heat is about the only thing that might slow down 
No. 1-seeded Sunny Hills in its quest for a third section title in four years. 
The Lancers have cruised through the first four rounds of the playoffs, never 
allowing more than 3 1/3 points in any match. Meanwhile, third-seeded Palm 
Desert is lucky to be in the finals. It survived three 11-10 matches, including 
one in the first round against a wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Desert's only qualifier for the section individual tournament's main draw 
was singles player Dann Battistone, who lost to Sunny Hills' Joseph Gilbert in 
the round of 16, 6-3, 6-4. With Gilbert, Kevin Kim (the top-ranked boys' 16 
player in the nation), and John Han playing singles, expect Palm Desert to 
stack its doubles by moving Battistone from singles. Sunny Hills Coach Steve 
White might choose to move Kim or Gilbert into doubles, but with the strength 
of his doubles teams, he could probably still win easily by leaving his lineup 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way Palm Desert has a chance to pull the monumental upset is if Sunny 
Hills' van breaks down in the desert and never reaches the courts. DAVE

BOOK REVIEW; PHOTOGRAPHER FINDS FREEDOM IN SEARCH FOR POLAR BEARS; THE CAGE BY 
AUDREY SCHULMAN ; ALGONQUIN BOOKS; $17.95, 228 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 Rivaling love and war in durability, the theme of man against nature continues 
to tempt novelists. Recently, significant numbers of women have begun to turn 
up in the wilderness, encroaching upon a literary province once exclusively 
male.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the heroine of Audrey Schulman's compelling adventure story seems an 
unlikely contender -- a petite, shy photographer who has built a modest 
reputation with animal shots, mostly taken in the Boston Zoo. Beryl Findham is 
an eco-worrier; concerned about the population explosion, pollution, the ozone 
layer and endangered species, as well as an assortment of more subtle threats 
to the future of the planet. Wary of entanglements, she's unattached and 
uncommitted, outwardly content with her quiet, intensely private life. 
</P>
<P>
 We meet her in the closet of her apartment, where she's sitting in the dark 
holding an ice cube in her hand, attempting to project herself into the 
Canadian tundra where the temperature hovers around 40 below zero. The closet 
is meant to simulate the metal cage in which she'll be confined while she takes 
close-ups of polar bears. Beryl has just been hired as the still photographer 
for Natural Photography, a prestigious magazine that prides itself upon 
avoiding tricks of the trade, such as zoom lenses and darkroom manipulations. 
</P>
<P>
 A fine photographer, Beryl knows she's gotten the assignment primarily because 
-- at 5 feet, 1 inch -- she's the only applicant who can fit in the cage, which 
turned out to be somewhat smaller than planned. She will be the only woman on 
the expedition, and she's looking forward to a fantastic adventure, a welcome 
change from her humdrum urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 Boarding the plane from Winnipeg to Churchill, Manitoba, Beryl meets Dave 
Golding, the video cameraman who looks "like an elf who shopped in SoHo." Dave 
is clever, witty and garrulous, in striking contrast to the other expedition 
member, a taciturn man who introduces himself merely as Butler, the naturalist 
who will write the accompanying story. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of their preliminary explorations to the local dump, where the famished 
bears gather before setting off for their seal hunting grounds on Hudson Bay, 
the group sees 13 foraging bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bears seemed to be willing to give anything a try as food, eating the 
foam rubber out of couches, tugging the seats off snowmobiles, chewing on vinyl 
car roofs. Standing up in the van, Beryl saw one bear sniffing a closed can of 
paint, putting his teeth to each edge, curling his lips back, then turning the 
can over to try again. Each time the bears found something they considered 
edible, they looked content, chewing hard, strings of drool rolling from their 
mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Beryl's expedition will follow the bears to their destination at Cape 
Churchill. Impatient and eager to learn more about what's in store for her, she 
fills the down time before they leave by joining Deputy Maggie Johnson on her 
nightly rounds. Maggie is an emigre from Atlanta who not only patrols the 
streets alerting residents to the presence of bears, but puts some additional 
feminist spin on the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the party has arrived at its destination 40 miles from town, the pace and 
tension dramatically accelerate. In comparison to the frozen tundra, Churchill 
is Paris. The vehicle proves no match for the bears, who munch through the 
space-age materials of the undercarriage and leave the party stranded without 
heat, fuel or power.  
</P>
<P>
 From this point on, the story becomes almost unbearably suspenseful and 
horrific, calculated to freeze your blood even as you read it on a sunny 
California beach. You'll never hear "bear" and think of Winnie-the-Pooh again. 
</P>
<P>
 In hallowed person-against-nature tradition, the tale is weighted with 
symbolism; the cage a metaphor for the limitations of Beryl's prior life and 
the characters representing various attitudes toward the powers of nature.  
</P>
<P>
 The author's style, at once terse and lyrical, refreshes and enhances the 
proven formula. Her appealing heroine is a true original, transformed 
emotionally and physically by experiences marvelously imagined and 
unforgettably described.

A 'ROSENKAVALIER' REFRESHED; THE MUSIC CENTER OPERA GIVES STRAUSS' MASTERPIECE 
A NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One approached the Dorothy Chandler with a certain degree of trepidation 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera was venturing its first encounter with Richard Strauss' 
ever-poignant, ever-daunting "Der Rosenkavalier." That, of course, was cause 
for rejoicing. But the road to the premiere hadn't exactly been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no secret that the staging scheme imported for the occasion would defy 
tradition. Some of the advance reports, moreover, were discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 If all had gone as first planned, this would have been a "Rosenkavalier" with 
a Berlin accent -- a production directed by Gotz Friedrich with his wife, Karan 
Armstrong, in the key role of the Marschallin. When financial problems 
reportedly intervened, however, an unhappy Friedrich headed for the exit, 
taking the prima donna with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently unfazed, Peter Hemmings, impresario in residence, turned to the 
English National Opera, which was preparing a new "Rosenkavalier" of its own in 
a modernist staging by Jonathan Miller. Enlisting the New York City Opera and 
the Houston Opera as co-producers, Los Angeles blithely bought into the British 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, Los Angeles bought the spacious sets of Peter J. Davison and the 
handsome period costumes of Sue Blane as devised for Miller. Their 
"Rosenkavalier," it should be stressed, did not take place in the 18th-Century 
Vienna of the Empress Maria Theresa, which Strauss and his inspired librettist, 
Hugo von Hofmannsthal, had so carefully delineated. Miller had chosen to move 
the plot to 1910, the period in which the opera was written. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, he turned his back on a lot of formal Baroque ritual and he 
trampled some specific historical references. Still, he wasn't the first 
"Rosenkavalier" director to toy with the fast-forward button (both Ruth 
Berghaus and Friedrich had exercised similar revisionist options), and Miller's 
concept did suggest some interesting sociopolitical connotations. 
</P>
<P>
 The director had told an interviewer that he saw the work as the requiem for a 
decaying Hapsburg empire "just before the shot in Sarajevo brings it all to an 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Responses to the British "Rosenkavalier" were decidedly mixed at the premiere 
last February. Max Loppert, one of England's most astute and most respected 
critics, found the staging "pallidly thin-blooded," the concept "flimsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, something seems to have been won with transplantation. Most of the 
time, Miller's "Rosenkavalier" struck at least one veteran of too many 
Straussian wars as a stimulating delight. 
</P>
<P>
 But was it really Miller's "Rosenkavalier"? At the London Coliseum, the opera 
was sung in English. At the Music Center, it was sung -- by a completely 
different cast -- in the original German, or in reasonable facsimiles thereof, 
with supertitles flashing vague translations atop the proscenium arch. 
</P>
<P>
 Most crucially, perhaps, Miller did not come here to work with the Los Angeles 
team. The job of imparting, interpreting and modifying his ideas fell to his 
erstwhile assistant, David Ritch. 
</P>
<P>
 The results couldn't always make perfect sense. Rustic barons didn't wander 
around Vienna in 1910 carrying swords. Courtly manners changed rather 
drastically over the centuries. The conceit of a woman playing a boy who 
impersonates a girl who is courted by a lecher takes on unexpected sexual 
connotations in the sleazy dawn of the Freudian era. It is hard to find the 
shadow of the first world war either in Strauss' sunny score or in 
Hofmannsthal's elegant poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Los Angeles version of this "Rosenkavalier" exerted considerable 
compulsion. It was good to see the opera stripped of empty cliche. Although one 
missed the ghost of Mozart that normally haunts the opera, it was reassuring 
for once to see all traces of buffo caricature banished from the stage, along 
with most traces of cloying sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller -- and/or Ritch -- focused the characters with uncommon sensitivity and 
clarity. The mellow Marschallin, now portrayed by the willowy Ashley Putnam, is 
more a woman here, less a princess, but her renunciation of love retains its 
pathos. Octavian becomes a young officer, and his spiffy military uniform 
supports the inherent gender charades nicely. The lusty Baron Ochs -- still 
more baron than ox -- looks a bit like a misplaced Mandryka, but Strauss 
probably wouldn't have minded that. 
</P>
<P>
 The director, whoever that may be, allows a few dubious steps in the direction 
of vulgarity. Ochs' henchmen take the liberty of plopping themselves on the 
Marschallin's bed. Annina allows herself a rather rude, if undeniably amusing, 
gesture of Italianate contempt behind Ochs' back. Mohammed, the Marschallin's 
little page, is not brought back to cap the evening with the hanky-waving exit 
so picturesquely described in the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. This "Rosenkavalier" tells its convoluted tale with clean lines, 
uncluttered vistas and ample wit. The poetry is timeless, and it is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Davison's stark, faintly stylized designs, evocatively lighted by Jean Kalman, 
avoid Jugendstil fussiness. The Marschallin's boudoir is all airy grandeur. The 
nouveau-riche excesses of Faninal's palace are defined by a high bad-taste 
painting leaning against one wall, and bronze statues of nude pseudo-Greek 
warriors lined up outside the windows. Only the last act -- a suddenly 
Brechtian set within the set -- is cause for puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the cool but always vivid stage pictures were complemented in the 
pit by Jiri Kout, who conducted with brisk bravado, considerable flexibility 
and a knowing sense of intimacy. He accompanied the voices -- some fragile -- 
sympathetically, and he coaxed remarkably elegant responses from the enlarged 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. The maestro even got the instrumentalists to 
sing a swooping upward glissando along with the agitated Annina in the last 
act, as if Grand Avenue were really Ringstrasse. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam's lovely, subtly inflected Marschallin has come a long way since its 
Santa Fe tryout in 1989. The characterization still may bear a trace of 
Barbie-doll plastic here, a bit of fashion-model chic there. Her initial change 
of mood at the levee may suggest little more than distress at having a bad-hair 
day. But the soprano now conveys innate dignity and authority from the start, 
physically as well as vocally, and she still manages to sustain a crucial aura 
of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 She rises gracefully to the great moments: the Marschallin's half-smiling, 
half-crying resignation at the end of the first act -- accompanied here by a 
wistful puff on a cigarette; her nose-to-nose confrontation with the stubborn 
Ochs at the inn, and, finally, her noble acceptance of the inevitable as she 
leaves Octavian with Sophie. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavian was Frederica von Stade, wonderfully lithe and impetuous, warm and 
lyrical, honest and ardent as always. Sumi Jo, liberated from the angry 
stratosphere of the Queen of the Night and singing Sophie for the first time, 
seemed properly pert but sounded a bit strident. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Berger-Tuna, a stalwart from the Stuttgart Opera, made his U.S. debut 
as an Ochs who looked for all the world like a smug hedgehog (that's a 
compliment) and sang with splendidly pungent wit. His basso may not be the 
biggest or blackest in the world, but he really savors the parlando style, 
fears no range extremes, and plays deftly with the Viennese dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong and vast supporting cast included Michael Gallup as an endearingly 
pompous, open-throated Faninal, Jonathan Welch as an Italian Tenor of genuine 
vocal passion, Suzanna Guzman as an irresistibly wily Annina, Jonathan Mack as 
a suitably oily Valzacchi and Angelique Burzynski as a sweetly giddy 
Leitmetzerin. 
</P>
<P>
 With John Atkins as the put-upon notary, Louis Lebherz as the crusty police 
officer, Beau Palmer as an innkeeper equipped with a smashing B-flat, and 
Steven M. Porter as Ochs' lovably idiotic Leopold, even the tiniest roles were 
in exceptionally good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The program magazine contained the usual self-congratulation, lots of 
biographical data and two background essays, but nary a word on the vast 
changes imposed by the director. Strange priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Der Rosenkavalier," final entry of the Music Center Opera season at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, will be repeated Wednesday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 1 
p.m., with additional performances June 7 and 10 at 7 p.m. and June 12 at 1. 
Tickets $20-$105 at the box office, (213) 365-3500.

TV REVIEWS; KIDS IN PERIL: FROM UPLIFTING TO APPALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of tonight's two CBS specials about children in jeopardy, one is an 
unexpectedly uplifting 30-minute, commercial-free public service, the other a 
two-hour, voyeuristic wallow. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is Arnold Shapiro Productions' "Break the Silence: Kids Against Child 
Abuse," hosted by Jane Seymour. In it, young children talk about their 
experiences with physical abuse, sexual molestation and extreme neglect, then 
they tell how their lives got better. This is not a horror show; the goal is to 
let other children know that they "have the right to say no and to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Created specifically for children in grades 3 to 8, with animated spots to 
help tell the real-life stories, the film uses language that is simple and 
non-threatening. Most reassuring of all, these four gallant young people, two 
boys and two girls, don't come off as sad-eyed, pitiful poster children. 
They're just kids whose lives got better after they brought a bad experience 
into the open. They want other children to know that they can do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The next effort, "Before Your Eyes: Kristin Is Missing," is a not-so-uplifting 
CBS News special. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, folks, no longer do you have to wait for real-life misery to become the 
TV movie of the week. Now you can watch family tragedy and dysfunction as it 
happens , thanks to alert news crews who can get wind of an actual tragedy, 
rush out to film its progress, then set it to mood music, add flashback 
montages and let the real people become actors in their own drama, with a 
close-up of every tear, every revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as the show repeatedly and portentously announces: "No actors, no 
re-creations. You're watching the actual story unfold before your eyes. " 
</P>
<P>
 The real story is two stories, one about the Coalters, a Michigan family 
searching for their naive, 14-year-old daughter who ran away with a 49-year-old 
trucker, and one revolving around the same trucker's arrest for molesting his 
own young daughter. This "actual" story, however, directed by CBS News' 
Jonathan Klein, shamelessly manipulates viewers until it feels more like sad 
fiction than fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy-handed music -- country singers crooning about love and broken 
hearts -- shapes perception and bizarrely validates the confused adolescent 
runaway and the unsavory aging trucker as star-crossed lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants-turned-actors even read the commercial break teasers: "But 
nothing could have prepared us for the surprise that was waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the sorry mess wraps up, with its voyeuristic taint, it's 
difficult not to wonder what happens to reality when those involved are the 
willing stars of their own disaster movie and anguish is knowingly filtered 
through the lens of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse," tonight at 8; "Before Your 
Eyes: Kristin Is Missing," on CBS Channel 2, tonight at 9, on CBS (Channels 2 
and 8).

PROPERTY VALUES: PROTECTING YOUR PROPERTY FROM SURPRISE LEGAL CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your home may currently face all sorts of legal claims unknown and unfamiliar 
to you. In fact, it is relatively simple for many types of creditors to record 
a lien against your property -- and often you may not even learn about the lien 
until you try to sell or refinance. 
</P>
<P>
 To use the legal jargon, a lien is an encumbrance -- or a charge against 
property -- in the form of a notice attached to certain property. A lien that 
is recorded with the county recorder basically warns everyone else of a 
creditor's claim on your property. Because liens cloud the "clear title" needed 
to sell a piece of real property, creditors utilize liens as a way to guarantee 
that they will eventually be paid what they are owed. And under some 
circumstances, a lien could stop a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 While most creditors need a court judgment before they can place a lien on a 
debtor's property, there are also certain types of liens that don't require 
creditors to wait for a court judgment. The most common type of lien is when 
you get a car loan, or a mortgage or a home equity loan on real estate. These, 
of course, are voluntary liens because you are getting money while the lender 
gets a claim against your property. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all other liens are involuntary, and they can cause big headaches. 
Indeed, there are also a host of involuntary liens, including liens for unpaid 
property taxes by the city, federal and state income taxes, child support, 
excess Medi-Cal payments, homeowner association fees, design professionals and 
so-called mechanics' liens which protect contractors who work on your property. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "All these types of liens are different. With some you receive notice from the 
creditor or the county recorder, with others you may receive no notice at all," 
said Alan Kheel, partner at Sherman Oaks law firm Reznik & Reznik. Kheel said 
his clients are often surprised to learn just how easily someone has recorded a 
lien against their property. With judgment liens, there is a court hearing 
before any lien is recorded, Kheel observed. But with non-judgment liens, he 
said, "a creditor just puts down what they think they are owed. Often the 
amount isn't correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere in the state have been 
surprised recently to find liens placed on their properties by Medi-Cal 
officials seeking to recover medical bills run up by spouses or parents. A 
class-action lawsuit has been filed challenging the state's practice, but 
meanwhile, some of these liens have stymied pending sales or refinancing of 
homes. These and other liens can be challenged by homeowners in court, Kheel 
said, but "it's frightening that the liens don't require a court hearing in 
advance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common that people don't even know about liens against their 
property," said Robin Leonard, a Berkeley attorney who wrote "Money Troubles: 
Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts" and "How to File for Bankruptcy," 
published by Nolo Press. In the case of property taxes, "sometimes you think 
you are paying your taxes on time through an impound account with your lender, 
and then when you try and sell the property, you find out there's a lien for 
unpaid taxes," she said. "It's a surprise to many homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
 As if the lien wasn't bad enough by itself, Leonard said, it can also do 
damage to your credit. When the IRS records a lien against your property, she 
said, many other creditors take it as a sign that you are having trouble paying 
your taxes. But, we all know that the IRS can make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanics' liens lead to some of the most frequent lien-related disputes. 
Under California's mechanics' lien law, any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, 
supplier or other person who helps improve your property, but is not paid for 
his or her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim against your 
property in the form of a lien. After a court hearing, the creditor may become 
a judgment creditor -- which means they have a piece of paper from the court 
saying you owe money and must pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a judgment creditor may "execute" on the lien by having an officer of 
the court seize your property, arrange for a public sale and use the proceeds 
of the sale to satisfy the money owed. This doesn't happen very often, however, 
because the process is time-consuming and expensive. Also, the judgment 
creditor only gets paid after other earlier creditors -- like your mortgage 
holder -- get paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you pay your contractor in full, subcontractors, laborers or suppliers 
who remain unpaid may record a lien. Such claimants are required to provide the 
property owner with a preliminary notice of their claim. While this preliminary 
notice is not a lien, it can lead to one if the subs and suppliers continue to 
not get paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys and reputable contractors suggest that homeowners get an 
unconditional lien waiver and release signed by the contractor and each and 
every material supplier, subcontractor and laborer. This cuts off the ability 
of any of these parties to record a lien on your residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Other liens that are recorded against your property should be satisfied with a 
payment or challenged as soon as they become known to you, advised Kheel of law 
firm Reznik & Reznik. He also advises homeowners to check once every year or 
two for any documents recorded with the county recorder that may not belong in 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
 While liens are a powerful way for creditors to reach the equity in your home, 
California homeowners still protect some of their equity from certain lien 
holders by taking advantage of the state's homestead exemption. A homestead 
declaration protects part of the equity in your primary residence from being 
tapped by an unsecured creditor who either wants to force the sale of your home 
or who wants to collect the profits made on the sale of your home. 
</P>
<P>
 A homestead declaration will not protect against claims for child support, 
alimony, taxes, mechanics' liens or the bank's mortgage on a home. A judgment 
lien on real estate, however, will usually not attach to a declared homestead 
if the homestead was recorded before the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some homestead protection is automatic under a state law passed in 
1983, many lawyers still advise that it's best to file a "Declaration of 
Homestead" with a county recorder's office. For a nominal recording fee of $5, 
the declared homestead may protect your home from forced sale to pay a 
judgment.

 PRE-ASSAULT: Bob Hope's TV special about D-day next Monday night on NBC will 
be special to Richard T. Headrick, 77, of Irvine. When Hope learned that 
Headrick had been an adviser to Dwight D. Eisenhower on bombing strategies at 
Normandy, he asked him to his home in Toluca Lake to be interviewed for the 
show. . . . "Unfortunately, I ended up on the cutting room floor," Headrick 
says with a chuckle. "But my visit with Bob was delightful."

 HISTORIC MEAL? Residents at the Palm Terrace Retirement Home in Laguna Hills 
are recalling life on the home front during the D-day era with a World War II 
recipe book. It's selling throughout South County for $3, and includes 
wholesome meals like Marge Mackessy's pork chop and potato casserole. Says 
Mackessy: "When my three sons came home from the war, I made each of them what 
they wanted -- but they all liked this!"

 RED, WHITE & BARE: From traditional patriotic ceremonies to topless dancers on 
parade, the Valley celebrated Memorial Day with a range of activities that 
reflected the wildly varied lifestyles and cultures of our area (B1). . . . In 
Burbank, a small crowd listened intently to the stories of an 80-year-old 
Belgian native who as a young woman was a Resistance fighter in World War II, 
while in much more bohemian Topanga, the festivities included water fights and 
various states of undress.

 INSURANCE WOES: More then four months after the earthquake, numerous Valley 
residents are still battling to get what they believe is their due from 
insurance companies.A new organization, Community Assisting Recovery, is 
attempting to bring together those who have unresolved issues with specific 
companies (B1). . . . In the meantime, here are answers to some of the most 
often asked questions about settlements, including, "Why is my neighbor getting 
a much larger insurance settlement than I am when we had the same amount of 
damage?"

 FIRE STABILIZERS: At Rocketdyne International in Canoga Park, where this 
machinist works on the main engine for a space shuttle, company officials hope 
the work force has finally stabilized after a painful series of layoffs (Valley 
Business, Page 4). But the fate of Rocketdyne and several other Valley 
aerospace firms is dependent on economic and political forces that are still 
volatile.

 WOMEN POWER: The times are definitely a-changin'. It wasn't too long ago that 
women were excluded from many professions, especially the world of superheroes. 
No more. . . . Two of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers -- Trini and Kimberly -- 
are women, and boys love them, which is great news for Saban Entertainment in 
Burbank, which produces the TV show about the action figures.

CROSS-ASSIGNING OF COUNTY JUDGES GETS APPROVAL; LAW: STATE APPEALS COURT 
REJECTS A CHALLENGE BY THREE DEFENDANTS. AUTHORITIES SAY MORE MUNICIPAL JURISTS 
WILL HEAR FELONY CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald Lopez of Oxnard was charged with lying on his workers' compensation 
forms. Daniel Raymond Goff of Ventura allegedly tried to rob a woman leaving an 
automated-teller machine. And Mitchell McKenzie was accused of stealing a $600 
mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Different crimes, different circumstances, different defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three accused criminals had one thing in common: They didn't like the 
judge assigned to hear their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Each was assigned a judge from the Ventura County Municipal Court instead of 
from the Superior Court, which normally handles felony matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a consolidation plan that went into effect April 4, two municipal judges 
-- Bruce A. Clark and Herbert Curtis III -- were elevated to the Superior Court 
to help ease a growing caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez, Goff and McKenzie didn't want to have municipal judges deciding 
their fate. Preferring a Superior Court judge because they have more experience 
with felony cases, each defendant challenged the new system in the state 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the challenges and local judicial 
authorities now say municipal judges will be routinely cross-assigned to the 
Superior Court when they are needed to keep the operation running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Presiding Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson said the 
consolidation plan allows the court to stay on top of a burgeoning caseload 
without adding new judicial posts. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's caseload is larger because of the new three-strikes law and a 
trend toward hiring more prosecutors -- who file more cases for judges to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 In a declaration to the appeals court, Johnson expressed concern about the 
need for consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the busy courthouse "a madhouse environment all week long" and said 
that "without cross-assigning Municipal Court judges, we would never take care 
of the Superior Court's current court load." 
</P>
<P>
 To public defenders, Johnson's statement shows a blatant disregard for the 
state Constitution, which provides for separate Municipal and Superior courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Judicial Council of California has authorized officials in counties 
statewide to cross-assign judges on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 What is temporary, however, is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Christina L. Briles said it means that 
cross-assignments are appropriate only in emergency situations "when the need 
arises." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying is that the authority was intended to be a temporary 
problem-solver," said Briles, who filed the challenge with the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the cross-assignments in Ventura County are indeed temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 But both municipal judges who now try felonies have moved their courtrooms and 
offices to the third and fourth floors of the Hall of Justice. Those floors 
were previously reserved for Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average guy in the street is going to say, 'I don't care what kind of 
judge (a defendant) has unless I have to appear in front of the judge,' " 
Briles said. " 'And if I appear in front of him, he'd better know what in the 
hell he's doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Ronald Lopez pleaded guilty to workers' compensation fraud 
when prosecutors agreed to reduce the two felony charges against him to 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's case resulted from an injury he suffered to his right knee in January, 
1992, while loading supplies onto a truck at Oxnard Welding Supplies in Port 
Hueneme. He collected benefits by filing false claims after the injury had 
healed, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who refused Lopez's request to allow a Superior Court judge to handle 
the case, sentenced Lopez to three years probation, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark will sentence Mitchell McKenzie on June 6. McKenzie also objected to the 
municipal judge hearing his residential-burglary case. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie was arrested Feb. 13, after a resident of Foster Avenue in Ventura 
said he saw him riding off with a $600 bicycle from a neighbor's garage. The 
witness, Antonio Rojas, testified at a preliminary hearing before Judge Clark. 
Rojas told the judge that he confronted McKenzie as he was pedaling away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I confronted him, he was walking the bike," Rojas testified. "I asked 
him why he took the bike. He said because he was tired of walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark accepted McKenzie's guilty plea and sentencing is set for June 8. 
McKenzie, who had a .25 blood-alcohol level when he committed the crime, faces 
11 years for stealing the bicycle, said his attorney, Deputy Public Defender 
Douglas W. Daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Curtis refused to remove himself from the case involving Daniel Goff, 
43, charged with robbing an Oxnard sandwich-shop owner of $9 on Nov. 28, 1993. 
That same day, Goff allegedly tried to snatch the purse of a woman who was 
leaving an ATM at a South Ventura Road shopping center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In a non-jury trial, Curtis convicted Goff of one count of robbery and one 
count of attempted robbery. The judge is scheduled to sentence the defendant 
June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we took as many cases as we did is we anticipated it would 
be a long process and that there would be litigants not willing to deal with 
the stress of litigation," Briles said when asked about the guilty pleas 
entered by Lopez and McKenzie. "We plan to continue to litigate these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some other counties, defendants affected by cross-assigning have faced 
charges more serious than fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In a San Bernardino case, a murder defendant was convicted by a jury before a 
municipal judge. It is being appealed because of the cross-assignment, said San 
Diego attorney Carmela Frances, who represents the defendant in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidation proponents believe the Constitution is outdated and are trying 
to put an amendment to it on the ballot that would unify Superior, Municipal 
and rural Justice courts across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Several proponents -- including state Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), according to a spokesman -- believe Ventura County's experiment 
with cross-assignment will play a key role in whether the constitutional 
amendment makes it to the ballot and succeeds statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 But court officials say the cross-assigning will help the courts operate more 
efficiently. "We really are doing a service to the taxpayer," said Johnson, 
presiding judge of Superior Court.

WAR DEAD HONORED WITH TAPS, TEARS; MEMORIAL DAY: CEREMONIES ARE HELD ACROSS THE 
COUNTY. REPRESENTATIVES OF 44 VETERANS' AND AUXILIARY GROUPS DECORATE PODIUM IN 
VENTURA.

<P>
 As he has every Memorial Day for the past 25 years, Al Giambastiani spent 
Monday morning at the Simi Valley Public Cemetery, playing taps and wiping 
tears from the corners of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, hundreds of American flags -- each marked with the name of a dead 
soldier -- lined the driveway of Ivy Lawn Cemetery as representatives of 44 
veterans' and auxiliary groups placed wreaths and bouquets before a memorial 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
 And all across Ventura County, the patriotic and the bereaved gathered Monday 
at the grave sites of veterans and war dead to honor those who risked and gave 
their lives in service to the United States. Mourners covered soldiers' 
headstones with flowers and flags, which fluttered in the unseasonably cool 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she has done for 13 years, Margaret Merck, 78, laid a flower-covered 
blue cross at Ivy Lawn's memorial podium and remembered her eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 Now confined to a wheelchair, Merck recalled the day in 1951, during the 
Korean War, when she learned her son was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 She had just returned from an out-of-state trip and heard the phone ringing in 
her Chicago apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flew up the stairs and picked up the phone," Merck said. "A Chicago Tribune 
reporter asked: 'When did you find out your son was killed?' and I passed out." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Merck said she later moved to California because "everyplace I went reminded 
me of my son." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, the loss of Ronald Samuel Carroll Jr. -- only 19 when he died 
-- is seldom far from her mind. "My thoughts are with him all the time," Merck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Simi Valley's services, Police Detective Gene Hostitler urged the crowd of 
about 100 to honor not just the dead, but the living veterans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember the ones who died in the conflicts, but also remember the ones who 
are here today," Hostitler said. "Take the time to say, 'Thank you for what you 
did.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most attending the service didn't need to be reminded. State Sen. Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) has missed only one year since she started coming to the 
ceremony in 1972. Robert Pegg, 68, who clambered onto the beach at Normandy 50 
years ago in the dead of night, is well into his third decade of laying wreaths 
and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on the last Monday in May. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kathy Ervin, 65, has been easing her broken heart at the cemetery's annual 
service for a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our son died 27 years ago yesterday," said Ervin, her voice catching on the 
memory of her son, Greg, who perished in Vietnam when he was 18 years old. 
"This day is important to us. It's a memory of our son and all the other 
veterans that died." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like an old movie whose melancholy ending reduces viewers to tears time and 
again, so Monday's services concluded with heart-wringing renditions of taps. 
Giambastiani said he has shed tears at each Simi Valley service since he began 
sounding taps there in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Cook, 32, who observed the Ventura service from a grassy area behind the 
crowd, said he has a similar reaction whenever he hears the dirge. 
</P>
<P>
 "That song gets me every time," Cook murmured. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook and his father, Don, 59, brought a handful of orange gladioli to Ivy Lawn 
to place on the grave of Michael Wayne Melvin, a family friend killed in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wounded once in the war and sent home, Melvin volunteered for a second tour as 
a paratrooper. He was shot during an ambush, dying two months after his 21st 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a lot of the guys," Don Cook said. "He went over because he felt 
it was his duty." 
</P>
<P>
 Kneeling beside a Ventura grave marked by 30 miniature flags and red, white 
and blue crepe paper, Lote Sanchez, 41, said Memorial Day has taken on new 
meaning since her husband died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-year Navy veteran who served in the Vietnam War, Francois Henri Sanchez, 
56, collapsed at a friend's birthday party two years ago. Sanchez placed the 
streamers, flags and five bouquets of flowers around her husband's grave to 
mark his military service and keep his memory alive for their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day to remember," she said. "My little boy, he talks to him like he's 
alive. He brings his school papers and shows them to him."

MAN SLAIN AS FAMILY QUARREL TURNS VIOLENT; SANTA PAULA: MOISES GALAVIZ IS HELD 
IN SHOOTING OF ONE BROTHER, WOUNDING OF ANOTHER. SIBLINGS WERE ARGUING OVER WHO 
IS 'TOP BANANA' ON CITRUS RANCH, OFFICIAL SAYS.

<P>
 A Santa Paula man was arrested early Monday on suspicion of fatally shooting 
his brother and wounding another brother in the arm during a family gathering 
at their rural ranch house. 
</P>
<P>
 Moises Galaviz, 41, was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of murder 
and held on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is suspected of killing his 35-year-old brother, Jose Luis Galaviz, and 
wounding Aurelio Galaviz, another brother of undisclosed age. Jose Galaviz was 
pronounced dead at the scene. Aurelio Galaviz was treated for a gunshot wound 
to the arm at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Paul Anderson said gunfire erupted about 1:30 a.m. Monday during 
a quarrel over who was the supervisor at the sprawling citrus ranch where the 
three brothers apparently worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a family argument over who was the top banana," Anderson said. 
"They were arguing about who's the boss and the guy decided to accent his 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, sheriff's officials said Moises Galaviz ran into a nearby 
orchard toward the Santa Clara River. Sheriff's officials launched an intensive 
manhunt, with several police dogs, a sheriff's helicopter and the department's 
Special Weapons and Tactics team. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 a.m., Galaviz was found in woods near the ranch and arrested without 
incident. He was in possession of the handgun believed to be the murder weapon, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galaviz had been drinking, Anderson said, but it was unclear how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday afternoon, members of the Galaviz family sat red-eyed and sullen 
inside their wood-sided ranch house surrounded by orange groves on South 
Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A priest from a local church was present, making funeral arrangements for Jose 
Galaviz. The men's mother, Andrea Ornaes, visiting from Zacatecas, Mexico, was 
at the family gathering when the shooting took place, a coroner's spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything to say," one family member said. "We don't want any of 
that publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 The house is among a handful of residences that line South Mountain Road as it 
winds past the citrus ranches south of Santa Paula. It is ordinarily a quiet 
place to live, said Bob Smith, who lives across the street from the where the 
shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect this kind of thing in town," Smith said. "That's one of the 
reasons I live out here. Out here you don't expect this kind of thing to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't know the family well, Smith said he was at the Galaviz 
residence on Sunday afternoon to ask permission to dump some brush on their 
property. The party was just getting started, and Smith said he and his wife, 
Suzanne, were invited to stay. They declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, Smith said he heard five or six shots, followed by a 
piercing scream. The police activity kept him up until about 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like real nice people," Smith said. "I guess things just got out 
of hand."

THE CLASSICAL CURRICULUM ; ORCHESTRAS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK AT LOCAL SCHOOLS. 
BUT AFTER GRADUATION, THERE ARE FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every morning at Anacapa Middle School, a group of students gathers in the 
school band room to play melodies by Beethoven, Haydn and Schubert on the 
violin, cello and string bass. 
</P>
<P>
 They are playing some of Western culture's oldest instruments to give life to 
music from some of the most popular classical composers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are making sounds rarely heard these days on Ventura County campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to 25 years ago, when many Ventura County schools had 
thriving string-music programs, Anacapa Middle School is one of only a few 
schools in the county that still has an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a long period of school orchestras falling silent, string-music 
instruction at local public schools is beginning to rise toward a small 
crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, the Anacapa orchestra has grown by more than a third since 1990. 
Balboa Middle School has restarted an orchestra class that it canceled in the 
1980s. And Buena High School will try to revive its orchestra next spring with 
a small group that will meet after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county in Simi Valley, the Sequoia Junior High School orchestra has 
stabilized at about 25 players, after having only one member 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Simi Valley High School orchestra, the only high school orchestra in 
the county, continues to win superior ratings at band festivals even though it 
has only a dozen members. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Conejo Valley Unified School District began to offer 
string-music instruction at a handful of elementary schools. When this first 
crop of young string players reaches high school in a few years, music teachers 
hope to launch the district's first high school orchestra at Thousand Oaks 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth of interest in school orchestras mirrors a trend across Southern 
California, music educators said, that may signal a renewed appreciation of the 
value of teaching the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certainly a rebound," said John Vorwald, president of the Southern 
California School Band and Orchestra Assn. "I think most districts realize that 
the arts are very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Francis, a private music teacher who is working with the Ventura County 
Symphony Orchestra to revive school music programs, has also noticed a change 
in attitude toward teaching music in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents and the community are finally realizing that it was a tremendous 
mistake to cut these programs out because the arts are important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the cuts began in the early 1970s, when school districts 
from Camarillo to Simi Valley began eliminating music programs at their 
elementary schools. And the cuts intensified during the school budget crisis 
that followed the 1978 Proposition 13 tax revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks at the elementary level were eventually felt at many local high 
schools, which were drawing too few string players to maintain orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1980s, for example, the orchestras at all five high schools in 
the Oxnard Union High School District had folded. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time districts took their budget axes to their orchestral 
programs, they usually spared their high school marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Marching bands appear at school football games and community parades, making 
them much more visible to parents, students and to the school officials who 
make budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marching band has become a huge part of most high school programs," 
Sequoia Junior High School music teacher Corey Nordal said. "It's a public 
relations tool for any school." 
</P>
<P>
 But students lose a great deal by not having a school orchestra, music 
educators said, even if the pupils don't know what they're missing. 
</P>
<P>
 For student musicians, string orchestras are often their only opportunity to 
perform the original works of the great classical composers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orchestral music is really the foundation of all serious music," Vorwald 
said. "The wealth of classical music, music that has stood the test of time, is 
basically from that medium." 
</P>
<P>
 And for students who don't play string instruments, school orchestras offer a 
chance to learn to appreciate classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by exposing young people to such music, Vorwald said, can society reverse 
the trend of shrinking audiences for professional orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't expose the school population to orchestras," he said, "how are 
they going to know what orchestras sound like?" 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past 10 to 20 years, most students in Ventura County have not 
been getting such exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks and Camarillo schools have both started offering 
limited classes in strings over the past two years, the only orchestras besides 
Simi Valley High School are at Sequoia Junior High School in Simi Valley and 
Anacapa and Balboa middle schools in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these programs are, however, thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Anacapa's orchestra has grown from about 36 students four years ago to nearly 
50. Balboa will have more than 40 students playing strings next year. And the 
size of the Sequoia orchestra is stable at around 25 students, after 
fluctuating for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has stabilized to the point that I'm over my fear every year of losing my 
orchestra because there's not enough kids," Nordal said. 
</P>
<P>
 But once student string players graduate from middle and junior high schools, 
they have few opportunities to continue playing.  
</P>
<P>
 Only students at Sequoia are lucky enough to be able to move on to a high 
school orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of the county, young string players are able to join the 
Ventura County Youth Symphony and the Conejo Youth Symphony. But both of these 
groups practice far less than the daily classes held at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to work every day in school," said 13-year-old Carlos Renteria, 
who plays violin in the Anacapa orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlos graduates from Anacapa, he will attend Buena High, which plans to 
launch its pilot orchestral program next year. But the outcome of that project 
and of the plan to eventually launch an orchestra at Thousand Oaks High School 
will depend on whether the orchestra classes draw enough students. 
</P>
<P>
 And that may be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many high schools have boosted the number of required courses and cut 
the number of periods free for electives, students who want to squeeze in 
extra, college-prep classes often have little time available for music classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Simi Valley High, the orchestra has not grown beyond about a dozen students 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Scarrott, a 17-year-old cellist at Simi Valley who has won a full 
music scholarship to Baylor University in Texas for the fall, said she had to 
forgo taking college-prep courses to continue with orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some students who don't plan to major in music in college have to make 
other choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Liu, a 17-year-old violinist at Simi Valley High School, had to skip one 
semester of orchestra this year and will probably have to give up music again 
in the fall so she can fit in Advanced Placement courses. To take orchestra 
this year, she said, "I had to juggle my classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their awareness of the so-far limited opportunities to play in high 
school, some middle school orchestra members said they have no regrets about 
choosing to learn string instruments instead of the traditionally more popular 
band instruments such as trumpet, saxophone and drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Band instruments are so loud," said 14-year-old Amber Reeves, an Anacapa 
eighth-grader who plays string bass. "They're kind of obnoxious."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GRANT PROPOSED TO HELP HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County would receive more than $1 million from a federal 
homeless-assistance package unveiled in Washington earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.3-million grant, part of a $1.7-billion package still winding its way 
through Congress, would be administered locally with the guidance of the 
federal government, said Michael Siegel, a federal Housing and Urban 
Development spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will have a tremendous impact," Siegel said. "This really offers a 
dramatic new approach to treating the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 But local officials are not celebrating just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no use getting excited about anything that has regulations attached 
because the federal government tells us what to use it for," said Nancy 
Nazario, ombudsman for the Ventura County Public Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $1.3 million is a nice chunk of money, but how much it helps depends on 
how we can use it," Nazario said. "If we can get low-cost housing, then I think 
it will have a real strong effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration homeless-aid package represents the first time that 
the federal government has acknowledged the severity of the problem across the 
country, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our watch at HUD, we would like to cut (homelessness) in America by about 
a third," he said. "What this entire plan does is be very frank and honest 
about the number of homeless persons in America, and that's the first time the 
federal government has done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nazario estimated Ventura County's homeless population at about 3,000. JEFF 
McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PAGEANTRY UNIT GRACEFUL IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Stacy Hunter began at Ventura High School last fall, one extracurricular 
activity at the school immediately caught her eye: the Pageantry Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination drill team and flag-and-rifle unit, the corps performs with the 
school band during football games.But it has won its highest acclaim for its 
performances in regional competitions off the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, the 14 girls in the corps captured first place 
at the Pep, Pageantry and Arts Assn. of Central California contest held a few 
weeks ago in Bakersfield. And school officials said the corps is well known 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 As a flag girl, Stacy twists and twirls the tall, brightly colored flags in 
the group's choreographed routines. One of the best parts of being in the 
group, she said, is the recognition she has received from fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like people coming up and saying, 'How do you do that?' " she said. "It 
kind of makes me feel special. It makes me feel I have a special talent." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The group practices their routine at least three hours every week. And they 
also work to raise money to pay for their uniforms, transportation and other 
costs that total about $500 per girl each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Band Director Robert Hackett said he believes the pageantry corps's dedication 
shows through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of work these kids put into the program to perform and succeed is 
phenomenal," Hackett said. "It's just a high-spirited group." 
</P>
<P>
 And at a recent school assembly, the group's performance earned them a 
standing ovation from hundreds of their classmates. "They don't realize what 
kind of work goes into it," Hackett said of the other students. "But they sure 
do appreciate the final product." MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; REWARD OFFERED FOR TIPS ON SHOOTING

<P>
 A reward of up to $1,000 is being offered by Ventura County Crime Stoppers for 
information about a drive-by shooting at a Thousand Oaks party earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 9:40 p.m. on May 20, in the 1200 block of 
Sheffield Street.Party-goers were in front of a house when three young men 
approached and asked where they were from. 
</P>
<P>
 When no one answered, one man yelled out a gang name and started shooting, 
sending the party-goers scurrying for cover. No one was hurt, said Ventura 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Kitty Hoberg. But investigators found bullet holes in a 
truck, and a tire was slashed, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we have is a description of these guys, and it's a pretty generic 
description," Hoberg said. "I think some of the witnesses are a little 
intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to Crime Stoppers may remain anonymous and do not have to fear 
retaliation, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the shooting may call Crime Stoppers at 
494-TALK. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MISSING ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT FOUND SAFE

<P>
 Two days after he wandered away from his Oxnard retirement home, an 
Alzheimer's patient was found Sunday at the entrance to a local church, 
apparently waiting for the retirement home employee who was inside praying for 
his safe return, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Baleson, 77, left the Channel Islands Gardens retirement home about 10 
p.m. Friday with the apparent intention of taking a walk, Oxnard police 
said.When he was discovered missing, police and residents knocked on doors 
within a five-mile radius of the retirement home but found no trace of Baleson, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday night, Dorito Sazzao, an employee at Channel Islands Gardens, 
was riding a bus home when she thought she saw Baleson standing on a corner 
near Pleasant Valley Road and C Street, police said. Jumping into her car upon 
getting home, she sped back to the area and drove around for several minutes 
but could not find Baleson, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In frustration, Sazzao went to St. Anthony's Church, about three miles away at 
Laurel and C streets, to pray for Baleson's safekeeping, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she emerged a few minutes later, there was Baleson, standing at the 
church's entrance as though waiting for her to come out, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sazzao said her prayers were heard and answered, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 She took Baleson back to the retirement home, where he told authorities that 
he had just taken a walk and was very tired, police said. He said he had spent 
the night and eaten dinner in the homes of various strangers, police said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : MOORPARK; SCHOOLS MAY REQUIRE COMMUNITY SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark Unified School District officials are studying whether to make high 
school students volunteer in soup kitchens or other community projects before 
they can graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark school board voted last week to spend $5,000 to study the idea of 
requiring community service from high school students before they are allowed 
to receive their diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Greg Barker, who teaches high school history and geography 
in Thousand Oaks, said the study is the first step to making community service 
a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been on my list for two years," he said. "I hope it happens. It's a 
way to create better citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker said he has studied school districts in Maryland, Virginia and 
Pennsylvania where volunteering is required. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands and thousands of schools around the country that do 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will measure parent and student opinions on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the committee conducting the study will also look at schools in 
California that have the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is expected to be concluded in November, Barker said. SCOTT HADLY

TECHNOLOGY LABS: WOOD SHOPS OF THE '90S; EDUCATION: LOCAL COMPUTER TRAINING 
PROGRAMS TEACH STUDENTS SKILLS THEY'LL NEED IN A HIGH-TECH WORK FORCE. 
</P>

 Through the mist of a humidifier, eighth-graders Chas Kindschi and Jon Spencer 
followed the path of the red laser beam as it shot across their desk. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, classmate Rodrigo Flores designed a greeting card with a 
computer keyboard, mouse and graphics software. 
</P>
<P>
 And behind a soundproof window, a trio of 14-year-olds were wiring together a 
mini-recording studio so they could play DJ and mix a tape of their favorite 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to act like we're a radio station and we get graded on it," 
explained eighth-grader Karl Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the room that once housed a wood shop at Sequoia Intermediate School, such 
disparate assignments are by design. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Technology Lab, the room is outfitted with four kinds of computers 
and a dozen work stations, all of which offer links to high-tech careers. 
</P>
<P>
 For future draftsmen and architects, there is a computer program allowing 
students to build three-dimensional homes. For automotive engineers, there is a 
computer-linked wind tunnel to measure drag on model cars. And for future 
magazine designers, there is a desktop publishing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do everything they're doing in industry, but we're exploring it," 
said Sequoia teacher Lee Drawn, who has worked for three years to bring the 
Technology Lab program to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Sequoia's program is aimed at giving all middle-school students a taste 
of technology, a Technology Lab at Newbury Park High School will give 
teen-agers a chance to focus on specific skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, seventh- and eighth-graders taking the class at Sequoia will spend 
five days on each of the work stations, also called modules. At Newbury Park, 
students can opt to spend an entire quarter on projects in just one or two 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the high school will also offer a semester-long course next year 
in computer repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Bob Hendricks said he volunteered to set up and teach Newbury Park's 
Technology Lab program because of what it could offer teen-agers not planning 
to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were becoming too elitist," said Hendricks, who also teaches 
world history. "Too much attention was being focused on college-bound kids and 
not enough was being done for non-college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started 26 years ago, we had a metal shop, a wood shop and other 
crafts," Hendricks added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, some of those electives are offered only at one high school or 
have been cut altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nicholson, president of the California Industrial and Technology 
Education Assn., said the pressure to cut out traditional industrial-arts 
electives has helped spawn Technology Labs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of one-subject electives, Technology Labs are seen as a way to 
pack more options into a single class. They also grew in popularity, Nicholson 
said, as school districts acknowledged the need to better prepare students for 
tomorrow's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new tools are not the hammer and the bench vise. It's a keyboard, a 
mouse, a monitor, a robotic arm," he said. "The tools have changed, so we just 
need to change with the times." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the state, about 300 middle schools now operate high-tech 
classrooms, he said. Approximately 100 high schools have similar programs or 
are in the process of developing them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the Ventura Unified School District has been a leader in 
the movement. Five years ago, the district outfitted DeAnza Middle School with 
a $120,000 high-tech classroom. Since then, more of the high-tech classrooms 
have been built for less money, and by next fall all of the district's middle 
schools should have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Stoddart, director of vocational education for Ventura schools, said the 
program's benefits go beyond exposing students to new careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no formal studies have been done, teachers have noted that students in 
the high-tech classrooms have a lower absentee rate and fewer discipline 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go out to the labs unannounced, I always see students on task," he 
said. "They're not screwing around and throwing things." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacles that districts face in setting up high-tech classrooms, 
Stoddart said, are funding and resistance from longtime industrial arts 
teachers who feel threatened by computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we had at first was trying to get instructors to change their 
line of thinking on technology. But once they're hooked, they're born-again 
teachers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson said districts typically spend between $30,000 and $80,000 to 
renovate and purchase equipment for the high-tech classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, school officials spent between $35,000 and $40,000 to equip 
the two rooms at Sequoia Intermediate and Newbury Park High School, which were 
ready in mid-March. Much of the renovation was done by district employees and 
some computers already owned by the schools were incorporated. By the fall, 
Hendricks and Drawn said the number of work stations will be expanded from 12 
to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do this on a shoestring," Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to exposing students to new career options, the Technology Labs 
are one way the Thousand Oaks district is heeding the demands of parents 
anxious for their children to become computer literate. If the program is 
successful, school officials say they hope to expand the two-campus pilot 
project to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students complained recently that they feel like "guinea pigs" in the new 
classes. Others said they like the variety and the chance to work with a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cool class," said 14-year-old Jason Woods, a pupil of Drawn's who was 
using Lego-like blocks to experiment with levers and pulleys. "It's a little 
tough, but it's OK."

 Cellular phone users in Brazil are being forced to master the art of the 
sudden pull-over. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because of a law put into effect this month that makes it illegal to 
talk on a cellular phone while driving or even while halted at a stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators can be fined as much as $25.20, and repeat offenders are subject to 
the temporary loss of their driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Orestes Bastos, president of the National Traffic Council, told the Rio de 
Janeiro newspaper O Globo: "Anyone who wants to answer a cellular phone should 
pull over to the side of the road." MARTHA GROVES

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: 'HEAD OF THE CLASS' IN DEALS FINANCING; COMPANY TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If this year's Cannes International Film Festival produced remarkably few 
memorable business deals, one small exception was the $8.5-million sale of 
George Harrison's Handmade Films to Paragon Entertainment Corp. of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale brought an end to the former Beatle's movie-making career and gave 
expansion-minded Paragon the rights to a modest but desirable film library that 
includes "Time Bandits," "Life of Brian" and "Mona Lisa." 
</P>
<P>
 Brokering the deal was Intermedia/FilmEquities, an investment banking firm 
that's making its own waves in international entertainment financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermedia's Joseph N. Cohen, Malcolm Reeve and Nigel Sinclair advised 
Polygram International on the formation of its Polygram Filmed Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 They also consult with Bertelsmann Music Group and, along with Creative 
Artists Agency's John Ptak, helped assemble an independent financing package 
with a potential value of $140 million for directors Ridley and Tony Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think we can throw as many bodies at these deals as a major Wall 
Street (brokerage) house, even though we're a boutique," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources call Cohen the primary strategist at the aggressive Beverly 
Hills firm. He has extensive industry experience but is probably best known for 
helping to create Largo Entertainment, the Japanese-backed production company 
that fell short of its lofty goals under producer Larry Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve spent 10 years at NHI Nelson Entertainment International Limited. 
Sinclair is a veteran Hollywood lawyer who co-founded Sinclair Tenenbaum & Co. 
Inc. The firm is in the same office as Intermedia, which has 10 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our different worlds can work together quite well," Reeve said. "Our best 
moments have come during brainstorming, think-tank sessions." 
</P>
<P>
 Intermedia's specialties are media investment banking and movie and TV 
packaging. In the packaging area, the company claims to have raised more than 
$500 million to support some 60 movie and TV projects with its partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Richard Lewis, who received the firm's help in lining up foreign 
backing for Trilogy Entertainment Group, says Intermedia is "at the head of the 
class when it comes to the very complicated financing arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, Reeve and Sinclair see their next challenge in conquering the world of 
new media. "Joint ventures are ever more attractive," Sinclair said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While Walt Disney Studios already has a partner called Cinergi, the best 
example of synergy may be coming from another subsidiary, Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After selling nearly 70,000 copies of a book containing the screenplay and 
pictures from "The Piano" through Disney's Hyperion publishing division, 
Miramax plans to aggressively expand its output to as many as 12 books a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company inaugurated the division with a party at L.A.'s trendy Monkey Bar 
on Saturday for people attending the American Booksellers convention. "I'm 
passionate about it," Miramax's Harvey Weinstein said. "We feel we can do well 
in this field. Ultimately, we'll live and die by our taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming books include a full novel inspired by "The Piano;" author David 
Rabe's novelization of "The Crossing Guard," based on a Miramax film from Sean 
Penn, and "You So Crazy," taken from the Martin Lawrence movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein plans to apply the same tenacious marketing approach that he and his 
brother, Bob, used on films such as "The Crying Game" and "Tie Me Up, Tie Me 
Down," to sell their books. "The Piano" screenplay was augmented by personal 
observations from the participants and museum-quality stills from the film. An 
Academy Awards-night video of director/writer Jane Campion discussing "The 
Piano" will accompany the arrival of the novel in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Crossing Guard" book arrives shortly before the movie starring Jack 
Nicholson, in what Weinstein sees as cross-promotional paradise. Inspired by 
its recent hit movie, "Like Water for Chocolate," Miramax has also commissioned 
a Mexican cookbook called "An Appetite for Passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein credits much of the book division's marketing success to Donna 
Daniels, vice president of communications. He says upcoming projects include a 
novel from Paul Auster and the autobiography of boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein met Leonard at the infamous Friar's Club Roast for Whoopie Goldberg 
last year. An avid boxing fan, he eventually persuaded Leonard to co-author his 
life story for Miramax. "We also told him he could star in our next seven 
movies," said Weinstein, adding: "Not really. If we did that and he found out 
it wasn't true, it wouldn't be pretty." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Talk about gone but not forgotten. Wyatt Earp's story has already been retold 
once this year in Cinergi's "Tombstone." Next, it's retold again in next 
month's "Wyatt Earp" from Warner Bros. Now comes word that Orion Home Video 
plans to release an Earp special starring Hugh O'Brien, reprising his early TV 
role as the lawman in "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Produced by Rob Word in association with CST Entertainment Imaging, this Earp 
includes colorized scenes from the original 226 TV episodes. By summer's end, 
it'll either be Earp-o-mania or a serious case of Earp overkill.

 Cable: Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has been trying for nearly two years 
to launch a game show channel on cable TV, is moving ahead without one of its 
partners. Mark Goodson Productions, which owned a minority stake, has pulled 
out.The reasons for MGP's withdrawal are unclear, but one source said the 
family of the late Mark Goodson is divided about what it wants to do with the 
company. MGP is a longtime game show producer and is behind such programs as 
"The Price Is Right" and "Family Feud." The pullout is not expected to hinder 
Sony's plans to launch its game show channel -- recently renamed The Game Show 
Network -- by Dec. 1. Sony still has access to MGP's game show library. The 
cable TV channel will initially feature old game shows with new "wrap-arounds," 
and Sony executives hope it will eventually have an interactive element. JOHN

BANKS MAKING IT TOUGHER TO USE CHECK 'FLOAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GULLO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us do it from time to time: Write a check for groceries the day before 
payday, figuring that by the time the store cashes it, the money will be there 
to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are quickly coming to an end. Banks are beginning to use 
electronics, rather than airplanes or the postal service, to speed the time it 
takes to clear checks. 
</P>
<P>
 By sending electronic information to each other about the checks you've 
written, banks are making it tougher for customers to rely on the so-called 
"float," the lapse in time between when a check is deposited and when the funds 
show up in the bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks are not necessarily out to nab customers who keep their accounts in 
good standing but occasionally rely on float when writing a check for groceries 
right before payday. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are really after criminals and deadbeats, who exploit float to 
pass bad checks. Experts estimate that of the 60 billion checks written every 
year by businesses and consumers, about 1%, or 600 million, turn out to be 
bogus for one reason or another. Losses from fraudulent checks are estimated at 
between $5 billion and $10 billion a year and rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing around with float has now lost its innocence," said Wyn P. Lewis, 
managing principal at J.D. Carreker & Associates Inc., a Dallas-based 
consulting and software company that is working with several dozen banks 
testing the use of electronics in check clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks are members of the Electronic Check Clearing House Organization. The 
59 members, which include the nation's largest banking companies, handle 60% of 
all bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the members are now sending check information to each other 
electronically every night. The information is captured by computers that 
"read" the magnetic code on checks at the bank where the items are deposited. 
That information is sent via telephone lines to computers at the bank where the 
check is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank can then assess whether the checks are covered by sufficient funds in 
customers' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve banks, which play a big role in check clearing, have an 
electronic clearing project underway. Other private consortiums are signing up 
banks to do electronic clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, it can take three to seven days to find out whether a check clears" 
using conventional means of delivering paper checks to the paying bank, said 
Sydney Smith Hicks, senior vice president at NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank, based in Charlotte, N.C., is the nation's fifth-largest banking 
company as measured by assets and clears more checks every day than any bank in 
the country. It is a member of the electronic clearinghouse organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is clearing a small percentage of all its checks using electronics, 
but plans a big increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the system is fully operational, which is still a few years away, it will 
take the bank 24 hours to find out whether a check is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows us to give good customers the availability of their funds and 
lets us protect ourselves too," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, banks must make funds available on local checks within two days of 
deposit. Funds on checks drawn on out-of-state banks must be available within 
five days. Such laws were passed in the early 1980s partly in response to 
consumer complaints that banks were exploiting float to their own advantage, 
holding on to funds and putting them into short-term investments that would 
earn interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many banks make funds available on local checks the day after they are 
deposited, as a convenience to customers. Criminals can easily exploit the 
system. For example, in one recent scam on the West Coast, counterfeiters using 
sophisticated copying equipment created payroll checks that were nearly 
identical to the real thing. The criminals would cash the checks at grocery 
stores, and by the time the check reached the bank on which they were 
supposedly drawn, the scam artists were long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this type of fraud that bankers hope to stop.

THEATER REVIEW; STAR MAKES 'COUNTRY' EXCURSION WORTH THE TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's any postwar play that represents everything contemporary American 
playwrights run away from in an instant, it's Clifford Odets' 1950 melodrama 
about the theater, "The Country Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 With writers as disparate as Suzan Lori-Parks, Roger Rueff and John Steppling, 
nothing stands better for what they are not about than this Odets warhorse, 
long presumed to have been sent to the theatrical glue factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Sandy Silver's revival for San Clemente Community Theatre indicates 
that it hasn't arrived at the factory quite yet and that, with the right 
actress, this overwritten, muscle-bound drama on booze, Broadway and not-quite 
broken dreams can actually hit on some emotional wellsprings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Smeets' deeply affecting portrayal of Georgie Elgin, the long-suffering 
wife of fallen acting star Frank Elgin (Ron Lance), is actually about 
overcoming two big obstacles: as Georgie (who endures and survives Frank's 
destructive self-deceptions) and as an actor (who rises above the sticky, 
nearly unmanageable nature of Odets' material). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of her colleagues (most of them professionals, the venue notwithstanding) 
accomplishes the same trick -- a few so dog-tired that they remind us what a 
near-dead play this is. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, it doesn't matter, because Georgie is the play, with the 
others mostly along for the bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, that's the fundamental problem with Odets' conception: Who would you 
say is the central protagonist in a scenario involving an alcoholic actor, 
supported by his wife and prodded by his director as he tries out for the lead 
in a bound-for-Broadway play that could relaunch his career? 
</P>
<P>
 That Odets chose the wife was his own kind of innovation, though not in any 
kind of feminist spirit. Georgie belongs to another era, the ultimate Tammy 
Wynette stand-by-your-man stage character who knows her husband's frailties all 
too well -- and makes them known to director Bernie Dodd (Sean Ginley). She 
threatens to leave, but she'll finally do what's good for Frank, not what's 
good for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgie is a museum-piece character who now seems a million years older than 
any number of Ibsen and Strindberg creations. But Smeets finds a way to make 
her interesting, even magnetic. 
</P>
<P>
 From her first moment, Smeets' drawn face has the look of a subject in one of 
Walker Evans' photographs -- bone-tired but firm, emotionally denuded but still 
standing. Smeets suggests that Georgie's emotional core is hollowed out by time 
and pain, but what we see for more than two hours is that this Georgie is 
finding a way to fill it again. 
</P>
<P>
 In '90s parlance, it's a recovery -- one unearned in Odets' drama, but utterly 
convincing with an actor of Smeets' strength of will. She acts as much through 
her eyes as her voice (it would be lovely to hear her do Shakespeare), and not 
a moment is lost in the barn-like yet intimate Cabrillo Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smeets has dimensions, but Ginley and Lance, though game for their Big 
Moments, have almost none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginley's Bernie is more like a high-school football coach on a bad day than a 
hot, ambitious Broadway director. Frank's ultimate breakdown feels very real, 
but it's about the first authentic moment in Lance's performance. While Smeets 
has internalized the Elgins' domestic fissures, Lance is still very much on the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is all, but Silver's direction is sensitive enough that such 
differences don't cloud our own involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Smeets is strong enough that even a weak cast, Paul Vogler's threadbare set, 
Ed Howie's harsh lights and Diane Green's mediocre costumes don't get between 
us and this amazingly durable country girl. Make that woman. * "The Country 
Girl," Cabrillo Playhouse, 202 Avenida Cabrillo, San Clemente.

'COCKTAIL PARTY' LOSES ITS FIZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 .S. Eliot's "The Cocktail Party," at the Burbage, is an arcane amalgam that is 
part drawing-room comedy, part mystical exegesis and part downright 
psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, the psychobabble wears a bit thin. 
</P>
<P>
 When the play was first produced in 1950, it was no doubt novel, even mildly 
revolutionary, to hear characters discuss their innermost emotions with such 
candor and at such length. Nowadays, when relative strangers plunge into the 
most grisly personal revelations at the drop of a canape, these characters' 
endless confessional chatter strikes one as merely self-absorbed and 
self-indulgent. 
</P>
<P>
 A superb performance by Alexander Zale as the mysterious stranger makes this 
three-hour-plus evening move more quickly -- although not quickly enough. 
Rebecca Bonar is excellent as the vapid busybody who is in actuality 
super-human and all-wise, as is William Lithgow as a mincing magus with similar 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alley Mills (best known for her role as the mom on the long-running television 
series "The Wonder Years") is elegant but restrained as the dissatisfied wife. 
Loren Lester, who plays a philandering middle-aged barrister concerned about 
his own mortality, is simply too young for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy spirit of iconoclasm could have enlivened this somewhat stuffy 
production, but Lester, who also directed, is more reverent than revisionist, 
and seems overawed by the piece's pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, this cocktail party is a still-life, and even the mysticism 
rippling under the surface cannot enliven it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Cocktail Party," Burbage Theatre, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los 
Angeles. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends June 4. $15. (310) 478-0897. Running

CONDO CRISES MULTIPLY IN QUAKE'S WAKE; RECOVERY: OWNERS BATTLE WITH EACH OTHER, 
LENDERS AND INSURERS OVER WHETHER TO REBUILD, SELL OR ABANDON DAMAGED UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the owners of the earthquake-ravaged Sherman Court condominiums in Reseda, 
the question was simple and agonizing: Should they try to rebuild their 
132-unit complex -- abandoned since the quake -- or sell the cracked, pink 
stucco building? 
</P>
<P>
 But as they met in their clubhouse to discuss the issue this month, angry 
shouting erupted when owners who had stopped paying their condo association 
dues were barred from voting. "You're taking away my rights!" one man yelled, 
shaking his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Condominium association President Douglas Scott pleaded for peace. "Look, 
we're all married to each other here, whether we like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a marriage of extreme inconvenience. And there are dozens like it 
throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,500 condominiums were condemned or yellow-tagged after the quake. 
Four months later, their owners are at war on several fronts over what will 
happen to homes that some of them put their life savings into. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles are pitting neighbor against neighbor, condo owners against 
insurance companies and developers -- and lenders against anyone threatening 
their financial interest in these properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing terrible problems with condominiums," said Bill Rake, president 
of Greenspan Co., a Los Angeles firm that represents homeowners against 
insurance companies in exchange for part of the settlement they get. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cooperation from insurance companies has been abysmal," Rake said. "A lot 
of people are being forced to live in some of these units that are in shambles. 
It's taking forever to get anything fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Encino, Arthur Rosenberg, president of the Encino Oaks Condominium Assn., 
said he and most other residents of the 509-unit complex will probably have to 
put up with the mess months longer while they sue their insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten some money, but not enough" to cover all the needed repairs, 
said the 47-year-old actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, I'm living in little Beirut here, or maybe Sarajevo, with all the 
walls split open," Rosenberg said. "My son's room has a hole in the wall that 
goes clear through to the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other condominium owners are running out of patience, money and time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of deadlines we're facing," said Donna Goodwin, 30, an 
administrative assistant and Sherman Court's treasurer. "The moratoriums people 
have on their mortgage payments are expiring. The association has bills to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost everything," she added. "This was my first home. All my furniture 
was brand-new. It's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Time is Anne Siegman's enemy too. The 30-year-old pediatric nurse has been 
living in a rented apartment with her 3-year-old son since the Northridge 
earthquake destroyed her federally subsidized condo at Sherman Court. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, she went without other things to keep paying her monthly dues to 
the condo association and rent on the two-bedroom apartment. "But when I found 
out a lot of people who make a lot more than I do weren't paying, I quit too," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the owners have joined Siegman in not paying their dues, leaving 
the rest bitter about having to shoulder the burden of ongoing expenses, such 
as $9,000 a month for 24-hour security at the vacant complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angst that Sherman Court owners are suffering is typical of the financial, 
legal and personal troubles condo owners and lenders are experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of condo owners awakened at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17 were 
first-time home buyers. While a two-bedroom house was out of their reach, they 
could get into a condo the same size or bigger in a nice complex with a pool 
and clubhouse for less than $150,000 and as little as 3.5% down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cheaper than renting if you could come up with the down payment," said 
Lisa Leonard, 28, a Glendale attorney who was one of the first to move into 
Sherman Court when the complex opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, condo prices have fallen below what many buyers paid for 
their units, wiping out their equity. In the past four years, the average price 
of condos in the Valley has dropped 15%, to $129,000 in April from $151,983 in 
April, 1990, according to the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those who initially invested less than that to buy their condos don't 
want to rebuild. They view it as throwing good money after bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Court did not have earthquake insurance. The owners have received 
estimates from several contractors that they will have to pay anywhere from 
$700,000 to $1.5 million themselves to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say it costs $1.5 million plus interest, even if it's low interest on an SBA 
loan," Leonard said. "Who's going to borrow that much on property they have no 
value in? The assessment on each of the owners would be more than $11,000. A 
lot of people can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two condominium associations have walked away from their 
quake-damaged buildings, one in Sherman Oaks and the other in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda resident Lorraine Hernandez said her mother, a teacher's aide, felt she 
had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen or so residents of her mother's Victory I complex in Reseda 
voted to abandon the red-tagged building at Victory Boulevard and Tampa Avenue. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Other condo owners, including most of those in Sherman Court, are not that 
desperate. But they are fed up enough to sell their units for whatever they can 
get -- if only to get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So the association met recently in the clubhouse to take an advisory vote on 
what they should do with their building. A motion to not rebuild failed by just 
two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older residents were glad. "I put 50% down on my unit in 1991, so my 
payments were small," said one 60-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the vote was advisory, and not final, is another indication of how 
complex and touchy rebuilding issues have become. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Mortgage Co., Sherman Court's biggest lender and one of the 
largest in the country, went to court this month to keep the owners from doing 
anything that might hurt the firm's financial interest in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that a distress sale of the building in its present condition could 
cost the Santa Rosa-based company millions, North American obtained a court 
order that, in essence, ties the owners' hands for now. That is why the vote 
was merely to gauge which way residents were leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, two lawyers in a Costa Mesa-based firm representing North 
American also said the company would only negotiate individually with the 
owners of the 87 Sherman Court condos it holds mortgages on -- not with the 
owners as a group. One of the lawyers even suggested that each owner might want 
to retain an attorney, rather than using the condo association's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David Hershorin said North American might work out a payment plan for 
some of its mortgagees. Another option those owners would have is to turn over 
the deed to their unit to North American in lieu of foreclosure, perhaps in 
exchange for some money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to stall," said Daniel Perwich, a lawyer whose San Diego-based 
firm represents the Sherman Court owners and several other condo associations. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reads the legal documents governing both Sherman Court's owners and its 
lenders, 75% of the individual unit holders with voting power must vote before 
July 17 whether to rebuild, Perwich said. Otherwise, the condo owners can sell 
the quake-scarred complex just as it is, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, North American's lawyers disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 They took a lot of abuse from the 80 or so Sherman Court residents at the 
recent meeting. "You're trying to force us into rebuilding whether we want to 
or not and we don't have the money," one condo owner charged. 
</P>
<P>
 As if headaches with their biggest lender weren't enough, the condo owners 
already had another legal fight on their hands before the quake. In December, 
they filed suit against their developer and the investment partnership that put 
up the money to build the complex. The complaint: shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Many condo owners now believe those alleged defects contributed to the quake 
damage at Sherman Court, a charge the defendants deny. It is unclear how or 
when this legal battle, or the one pitting the owners against North American, 
will be resolved.

AMID BATTLE, SOKA SEEKS TO PLEASE; PROPERTY: THE JAPANESE SCHOOL IS LOCKED IN A 
CONFLICT WITH CONSERVANCY OVER ITS CALABASAS LAND. ONCE RECLUSIVE, IT HAS 
DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF POPULAR PUBLIC PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Soka University still does not have a library or a student union, but the 
embattled school is building something else it dearly needs: goodwill and 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroiled in a legal and political fight with state parks officials over use 
of its scenic Calabasas campus, the once-reclusive Japanese school now welcomes 
the public with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials there say this is part of a plan to expand the small language school 
for Japanese exchange students into a full liberal arts college. Critics say it 
is a cynical effort by a wealthy institution to buy favor, but nonetheless are 
impressed by the sheer scope of Soka's programs, which include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Six free tours of the campus a month, with special attention to the 
sycamore-lined drive used as the entrance to the plantation Tara in "Gone With 
the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 * Free or low-cost weekend retreats for nonprofit groups and their members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Evening classes in Japanese and other languages taught by highly 
credentialed instructors at low rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the new botanical garden with an enormous California-native seed 
bank and free gardening classes. And on the academic front, a free human rights 
lecture series studded with Nobel laureates and a prestigious research program 
affiliated with Harvard University but funded solely by Soka. 
</P>
<P>
 While some community groups praise the avalanche of offerings, others are 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this isn't an organization trying to buy off the community, then what is?" 
said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that has been trying to acquire the land on which 
the campus stands. "They have enormous resources, and they're using them to 
attempt to build a constituency base they would not otherwise have. What 
worries me is that, at a certain point, money talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Soka University spokesman Jeff Ourvan dismisses that notion: "We're not that 
Machiavellian." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan said the open-door policy and new academic programs are meant to help 
transform the small school, located at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and 
Mulholland Highway, into a college for 3,400 students. They have nothing to do 
with Soka's effort to ward off an attempt by the conservancy to seize the 
campus for a park visitors center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what universities do," Ourvan said. "We are a nonprofit, public 
benefit corporation, so we feel it is incumbent upon us to serve the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The school was not always so community-minded, Ourvan concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three years, starting in 1987, this place was run by all Japanese, 
and they didn't talk to anybody," he said. "Then we suddenly announced our 
expansion plans and no one knew who we were." 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing criticism by local residents, environmentalists and parks 
officials mobilized Soka, which spent more than $935,000 on public relations 
and lobbying, not counting legal fees, during the two-year period ending April 
1, 1993, according to the latest federal tax returns available. The Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy and its nonprofit foundation have spent about 
$834,000, including legal fees, lobbying and public relations, to obtain the 
land during the past seven years.  
</P>
<P>
 Soka's public relations effort includes deluging news organizations with press 
releases announcing its nature talks and other activities and publishing a 
newsletter that touts several of its programs, including some sponsored by its 
sister campus in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 One academic program, a post-doctoral research center on Pacific Rim policy, 
is based at Harvard. Soka, the program's sole benefactor, spent more than 
$438,000 on it during the two-year period ending April 1, 1993, according to 
Soka's federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent edition of the newsletter mentions an exhibit that critics say 
is designed to improve Soka's image, particularly among American Jews. The free 
newsletter is mailed to about 30,000 households in Calabasas, Malibu and Agoura 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about anti-Semitism in Japan, the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal 
Center looked for years for a Japanese sponsor of its traveling exhibit on the 
Holocaust. It recently found one in Soka University in Japan, which underwrote 
the $150,000 cost of bringing the exhibit to Tokyo City Hall in May, said Rabbi 
Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the best American institutions find it hard to ignore the blandishments 
that Soka can offer," said Edmiston, of the mountains conservancy. "That means 
that our task is all the more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ourvan insists that the programs have nothing to do with Soka's legal and 
political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would do all this even if we weren't trying to defend ourselves against 
the conservancy," Ourvan said. "These programs will continue when the fight is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of Soka's motives, the school's investment appears to be paying off 
in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Soka has not formally asked groups to endorse its expansion plans, 
one private, nonprofit group that saved more than $14,000 by using the campus 
for free weekend retreats has become a staunch supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they've been so generous, yes, we would testify for their expansion 
before the Board of Supervisors," said Paula Crisostomos, a spokeswoman for the 
Educational Issues Coordinating Committee, a Los Angeles-based group that has 
taken about 75 poor children up to the campus twice in the past two years. 
"They're a valuable community resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, not all recipients of Soka's generosity are stepping up to support 
the school's expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the school treated 70 clients of Educare Foundation, 
another private, nonprofit group that helps disadvantaged children, to a free 
weekend retreat at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They even cooked us meals," said Stu Semigran, vice president of the 
Calabasas-based group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group is not taking sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of respect for what the conservancy does too," Semigran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka has also donated about $10,000 worth of computer equipment to the nearby 
Las Virgenes Unified School District. Grateful as school administrators are, 
the gifts will not affect the district when it comes time to take a position on 
the possible traffic impact and other effects of Soka's expansion, said Leo 
Lowe, an assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't expect it as a trade down the line," Lowe said. "We'll just 
consider the direct impact on our 13 schools."

L.A. POLICE DEPLOY 'LESS LETHAL' WEAPONS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FOAM RUBBER 
PROJECTILES AND BEANBAGS REPLACE TEAR GAS AND BATONS AS CROWD DISPERSAL TOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In controlling disturbances and clearing the streets at L.A. Fiesta Broadway 
earlier this month, Los Angeles police commanders were determined to minimize 
direct contact with the crowd and avoid shedding blood in a situation where 
many families with young children were present. 
</P>
<P>
 So they turned to their array of "less lethal" weapons, firing foam-rubber 
projectiles and beanbags, and using their batons sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to give our officers a means to defend themselves without 
injuring people," the officer in charge at the scene, Lt. Michael R. Hillmann, 
said later. "We have had five events with the use of the rubber projectiles 
since the (1992) riot, without any serious injury so far." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fiesta Broadway, Hillmann said, "I told my officers to be very 
discriminating with the use of the rubber projectiles to avoid women and 
children. And over the next 30 to 40 minutes, before the dispersal was 
complete, we fired a total of only 32 37-millimeter foam-rubber rounds and 
three beanbag projectiles. We were shooting the rubber projectiles in front of 
the crowd, and only the beanbags at specific individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, officers relied primarily on tear gas and batons to disperse 
unruly crowds. Today, the growing array of less lethal weapons gives law 
enforcement a variety of options. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department buy most of these weapons from Defense Technologies, a Wyoming firm 
that is the largest producer of such equipment in the United States. Its chief 
executive officer, Robert Oliver, prefers to call the rubber projectiles, 
beanbags, pepper spray and tear gas that make up the heart of the present 
arsenal "totally non-lethal." 
</P>
<P>
 "These products are designed to be used by a completely trained special 
response team, and their purpose is to bring rioting people under control 
without any serious damage to those people," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equally important, it allows the police officers to remain at a distance 
where they too are not in danger of being seriously hurt. When you get to the 
level of batons, by contrast, you risk serious injuries to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Capt. Dan Burt, chief spokesman for the department, takes exception 
to Oliver's assertion that the new weapons should be called "non-lethal." He 
prefers the term "less lethal." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things will kill you if the situation is right," Burt said. 
"Where something is fired with an explosive charge, depending on where it 
impacts, such as the heart or the temple, it could strike with a blunt force 
that could cause death." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, with pepper spray, which is not fired with a charge but is set 
off by hand, "I'm not aware of any case where it was used and caused death in 
and of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray is used against specific individuals, not in crowd-control 
situations where its temporarily incapacitating capabilities could actually 
impede crowd dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has cited a few cases in which people with 
physical weaknesses or diseases died after being pepper-sprayed and has 
questioned whether it should be used without further study. The ACLU has 
suggested that, if it is used, paramedics be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, 
said the organization has not taken a stand against use of rubber projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at their use and gathering statistics," Ripston said last week. 
"We haven't amassed a lot of situations to make a judgment yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, she feels in principle that "you can't take everything away 
from the police." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU has been a vehement critic of such police tactics as chokeholds and 
hogtying individuals, in part because of a history of fatalities in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver said the rubber projectiles that his firm produces for police work 
should not be called rubber bullets, which are used by Israeli forces to 
confront crowds in the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our products do not in any way, shape or form resemble rubber bullets," he 
said. "Rubber bullets can be as lethal as lead bullets, and what we are 
producing and the LAPD is using is an entirely different line . . . 
predominantly made of foam rubber and limited to a specific hardness." 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons that have come into use in civil policing have little to do with 
much more exotic, less lethal alternatives now under secret development and 
experimentation by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reportedly substances that can envelop targets in a "glue" or 
"sticky foam" that will attach them to whatever they touch. And 
super-lubricants that make roads or bridges so slippery that they cannot be 
used by motor vehicles are also the subject of experimentation.  
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is high-intensity strobe lights, emitted at human brain 
wave frequency, that could cause long-term dizziness and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 These are probably more likely to be used in future wars than in controlling 
civil disturbances or rioting prisoners, although, because they have not been 
released for civilian police review, their precise eventual applications are 
speculative. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for the use of the contemporary less lethal arsenal are quite 
precise, and training of the comparatively few officers designated to use such 
weapons has been extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillmann emphasized that the crowd-control capabilities of rubber projectiles 
are as much psychological as physical. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fiesta Broadway, he said, no announcement was made that such weapons would 
be employed after he told the crowd on a loudspeaker that he was declaring an 
unlawful assembly and warning it to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, the rounds of foam rubber were fired at an angle to hit 10 to 
15 feet in front of the crowd. Bouncing up to sting people's feet and legs, the 
goal was to leave them in fear that they were being subjected to a more deadly 
form of pellet, he said, and it was instrumental in getting the crowd to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise, the sight of some weapons firing, and the deployment of scores of 
other officers, slowly advancing, created an impact that resolved the situation 
without injuries. It also avoided, Hillmann said, provocative photos of 
injuries being caused by baton-wielding police, which might incite later 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to use any of this," he said. "It's unfortunate this happened, 
and it was unfortunate we had to react at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "at the point we acted, it was a riot. We had a riot situation 
at 4th and Spring (streets) that afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said the favored crowd-control weapons of the Sheriff's Department are 
the rubber projectiles, which come in two sizes, and the beanbags. 
</P>
<P>
 The less lethal weapons existed at the time of the 1992 riots, but the police 
and sheriff's agencies in the area were not trained in their use, Burt said. 
The Less Lethal Arsenal Moving to minimize physical contact between law 
enforcement officers and the violent suspects they are trying to control, 
police agencies ar acquiring a diverse arsenal of less lethal weapons. The new 
weapons and gases occasionally cause injury, but there are fewer and less 
serious injuries than previously, when batons were often the chosen instrument. 
* Standard issue riot helmet with Lexan face shield used by most U.S. law 
enforcement agencies. * Military M-17 gas mask, used during crowd control 
operations in which tear gas is employed. * 12-gauge pump action shotgun, 
frequently used to fire less lethal rubber projectiles in civil disturbances. * 
Wooden riot baton, frequently used in crowd control as a prodding and 
short-range striking weapon. * Side-handle baton, often used in close quarters 
with violent crowds. * 37-millimeter gas gun, fires a wide assortment of 
tear-gas projectiles and rubber projectiles. It is widely used in riot control, 
and is often used in jail riots. * Tear-gas grenade, releases several types of 
tear gas, usually about 10,000 cubic feet. It will burn for about 40 seconds 
and is used outdoors to disperse large unruly crowds. Its residual effects will 
impede access to areas for several hours in some cases. * Pepper gas aerosol 
canister, issued to most police officers. It has limited usefullness in riot 
situations because it is effective against one person at a time. * Long-range 
cartridge for foam stinger. * Short-range cartridge for foam stinger. * 
37-millimeter tear-gas cartridges, used to deliver tea gas at 50 to 70 yards 
against hostile crowds. *37-millimeter foam projectile, used to disperse 
hostile crowds. It is fired from a stinger gas gun or other less lethal gun, 
with range of 40 to 50 yards. Projectiles travel about 250 feet per second. * 
Rubber stinger-type pellets. Depending on size of cartridge, 140 or 220 
pellets. Source: L.A. County Sheriff's Department

HONORING SACRIFICES; MEMORIAL DAY: A NEW EASTSIDE MONUMENT SALUTES FALLEN 
LATINOS. OBSERVANCES IN OTHER COMMUNITIES RANGE FROM THE SOLEMN TO THE FESTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When they talked of their wars -- in Europe, in Korea, in Vietnam -- it was 
the faces of their fallen comrades that they remembered. They called out their 
names -- such as Moreno, Nunez and Torres -- then watched as the slips of paper 
on which they were written were set on fire and disappeared in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbols mattered on Memorial Day on the Eastside, and even more so in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of planning, local veterans and Latino leaders dedicated the 
Time Capsule All Wars Memorial Monument in Boyle Heights. The monument, in 
which memorabilia representingevery American conflict since the Civil War was 
buried Friday, stands just a few feet from another that honors Latino veterans 
at the intersection of Cesar Chavez Avenue and Lorena Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers addressing the gathering of about 200 people dedicated poetry to 
fighters now gone and spoke of valor and pride. They noted that 38 soldiers of 
Mexican descent have been awarded the Medal of Honor. Mexicanos are like that, 
they said -- the first called to battle and the last to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 And the veterans on hand -- most in uniform and all sporting some indication 
of where they served -- vowed to the world that they would gladly defend the 
United States if called again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people have often been maligned or ignored," said Vietnam veteran Eddie 
Morin, whose late father wrote the book, "Among the Valiant," about 
Mexican-American soldiers. "This time capsule will help put things in 
perspective. Dignity demands it." 
</P>
<P>
 The capsule, which will be unearthed in 25 years to add artifacts from what 
the veterans assume will be future conflicts, was the brainchild of Jess Lopez, 
a World War II veteran who is 88. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an Indian from Mexico," Lopez said in Spanish, explaining that he came 
to the United States during the Mexican Revolution in 1911. Then he switched to 
English to add, "But the American dream is mine!" 
</P>
<P>
 Similar scenes unfolded throughout Los Angeles County on an overcast, 
occasionally rain-spotted Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Small American flags were placed in cemeteries, wreaths were laid, prayers 
whispered and the Pledge of Allegiance was the order of the day. Veterans 
organizations held open house. A section of Wilshire Boulevard was closed 
briefly between Veteran and Federal avenues -- and affixed with the honorary 
moniker "Veterans Parkway" -- during a ceremony attended by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, 80-year-old Yvonne Files charmed a small crowd at McCambridge Park 
War Memorial with a dramatic account of her life as a young resistance fighter 
from Belgium who committed espionage and sabotage on behalf of the Allied 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Files spoke with the vigor of a woman half her age as she recalled how she 
took daily risks to harbor Allied soldiers in her one-bedroom apartment -- men 
she referred to as "my airmen." 
</P>
<P>
 "On this Memorial Day, let me emphasize that the basis for and thrust to 
pursue our activities was patriotism, love for our country," she told the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "How my reputation suffered! Don't forget, I was a woman who lived alone. The 
only people nosy neighbors saw coming and going were men." 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities held barbecues and parades, including La Canada's 22nd 
annual Fiesta Days in which preschool students marching down Foothill Boulevard 
were the hit of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canoga Park, organizers estimated that 60,000 people turned out for the 
Memorial Day parade held by the Canoga Park-West Hills Chamber of Commerce and 
Canoga Park Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking in the scene was Rita Pater of Woodland Hills, who came to see her 
granddaughter perform with the Hale Middle School drill team. "It's glorious," 
Pater said. "Perfect parade weather." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was far rowdier in Topanga Canyon, where residents were treated to a 
spectacle more resembling a gantlet than a parade route. The young and 
young-at-heart settled by the side of Topanga Canyon Boulevard armed with 
garden hoses, super-sized water guns and water balloons in anticipation of the 
bizarre assortment of primitive floats that passed by -- most armed with their 
own water weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour ragtag parade featured members of a nudist camp wearing togas 
made of towels, a pickup truck whose occupants passed out wine instead of 
candy, and another truck featuring the "Topanga Tribal Village," consisting of 
five men and women in various stages of undress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the primate in all of us," said Patty Jackson, 23, a topless 
participant in the music and dancing on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 At Will Rogers State Beach in Santa Monica, lifeguards reported moderate 
crowds on the sand and the bike paths, with sunshine that seemed to be playing 
hide-and-seek. At Zuma Beach in Malibu, senior lifeguard Don Olson estimated 
that there was a near-capacity crowd of 25,000 people, trying to soak up as 
much sun as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said the only event that marred the holiday was the discovery of an 
apparent homicide victim -- a man described by the Sheriff's Department as a 
transient -- on the beach near the Malibu Colony. Olson said the man, who was 
fully clothed, apparently had been hit in the head.

PRESSURE RISES AGAINST CBS AS AFFILIATES MEET; TELEVISION: DESPITE RATINGS 
SUCCESSES, THE NETWORK IS PLAGUED BY LOSSES RANGING FROM STATION DEFECTIONS TO 
LEADERSHIP CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a network in first place, CBS has gone into a remarkable tailspin 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sagansky, the ace programmer credited with turning the network around, 
plans to leave this summer when his contract expires. The National Football 
League has already beaten him to the door by defecting to the Fox Network after 
38 years. And Fox dealt another blow to CBS's solar plexus just last week, when 
it raided eight key affiliates from the rival network. 
</P>
<P>
 Those developments will lead to some tough questions being raised by local 
affiliates from around the country when CBS executives gather for their annual 
affiliate conference this week at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be looking for (specifics)," said William F. Sullivan, 
president of WPAX-TV in Missoula, Mont., and head of the affiliate advisory 
board. "If it looks like they are just treading water, then everyone is going 
to be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Those specifics include what CBS plans to do to replace the Sunday afternoon 
National Football Conference games it is losing to Fox. While the football 
contract is costly for the network, it is a bonanza for stations because the 
games boost local advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing football -- the network argues renewing the rights was economically 
unfeasible since Fox's bid was $400 million higher -- is not the only incident 
straining the relationship between CBS and its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS last year led the battle in Washington to get local cable systems to pay 
affiliates for the right to retransmit broadcast signals, but the ploy 
backfired after cable operators refused to pay. While ABC, NBC and Fox used the 
opportunity to launch new cable networks in partnership with affiliates, CBS 
acted too late and ended up with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is more debilitating for CBS, however, than the loss of eight key 
affiliates to Fox. Characteristically, Fox owner Rupert Murdoch attacked with 
total surprise, striking a deal with investor Ronald O. Perelman's New World 
Communications Group to switch 12 of his TV stations -- some yet to be acquired 
-- over to Fox in exchange for an investment of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And more surprises are in store. "We're covering 98% of America now but we 
want more and better affiliates," Murdoch told a correspondent of his Weekend 
Australian newspaper. "I had lunch today with someone who owns two affiliates 
of another network who's considering coming," he was quoted as saying. "We'll 
announce another one in a month." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS affiliates that will join Fox include stations in Dallas, Detroit, 
Atlanta, Cleveland, Tampa, Phoenix, Milwaukee and Austin, Tex. The changeovers 
will give Fox valuable VHF outlets covering a total of 8.5% of U.S. TV homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's serious, but the quality of CBS' response is much more important than 
the severity of the wound itself," said Jim Saunders, president of CBS 
affiliate KXTV in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Those setbacks have hammered CBS' stock -- it fell nearly 12% in two days 
before making a slight recovery last week -- and led to renewed speculation 
that it may be sold. As the only "pure play" left in the network field, the 
company has reportedly attracted the interest of suitors in the past, but 
Chairman Laurence A. Tisch has said he's not interested in selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculate that CBS will deflect criticism over recent setbacks by 
announcing a fortune-reversing deal at the affiliates meeting, although the 
nature of such a deal is unknown. Others point out that the network still has a 
lot to crow about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An aggressive campaign to woo David Letterman away from NBC has paid off even 
better than imagined. The network is first in prime time, daytime and late 
night -- an unusual confluence unseen since the early 1980s. And thanks to a 
boost from the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, CBS Inc.'s first-quarter 
operating income soared to a record $102.2 million and net income increased 28% 
to $69.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the near-term future for CBS looks a good deal more uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CBS is No. 1 in household ratings, it lags behind ABC in key 
demographics, enabling ABC to frequently charge more from advertisers. 
Moreover, a network's financial performance typically tends to trail about a 
year behind its ratings performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season CBS will not have any of the big ratings grabbers it had this past 
season like the Olympics, Super Bowl and World Series. Moreover, some analysts 
think that the "ratings momentum" is now behind ABC, NBC and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue advertising executives were disappointed when CBS unveiled its 
new prime-time schedule two weeks ago, replacing a total five hours of 
programming with seven new series. Although CBS said the changes were made to 
attract the younger audience desired by advertisers, Madison Avenue executives 
weren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one bright spot in all their development is 'Chicago Hope,' " says Bill 
Croasedale, president of national broadcast at Western Media. "Chicago Hope" is 
a medical drama from producer David Kelley ("Picket Fences," "L.A. Law") 
scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS will have to move swiftly if it wants to contain the damage from Fox's 
affiliate raid. Already CBS executives have been calling and visiting competing 
affiliates in the markets where they will be losing stations. Among the 
stations reportedly being courted are KPHO-TV in Phoenix and KTVT-TV in Dallas. 
Both stations planned to affiliate with the new fifth network to be launched 
next year by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is that CBS will make minority investments in station 
groups and then convert those stations to CBS affiliates -- similar to what Fox 
is doing in the New World deal. However, it's not clear yet whether such 
maneuvers violate the spirit of Federal Communications Commission rules that 
limit station ownership to 12 TV stations or 25% coverage of U.S. TV homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, finding new affiliates will be costly. After years of trying to 
cut down on the decades-old practice of paying affiliates to carry network 
programming -- known as "comp" in the broadcasting industry -- CBS will now 
have to ante up once again to lure new affiliates.

LOCKHEED LOOKS TO EXPAND ITS AIRPORT BUSINESS; AVIATION: OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE 
THE U.S. ARE INCREASING AS MORE COUNTRIES IMPROVE AND, IN SOME CASES, PRIVATIZE 
FACILITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 After quietly and profitably running Burbank Airport for decades, Lockheed Air 
Terminal Inc., expanded slowly in recent years to provide services to 20 other 
U.S. airports. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company's most promising expansion may be overseas, thanks to 
worldwide demand for new, state-of-the-art airports and a privatization 
movement taking hold in many countries. That is, if Lockheed can keep its 
momentum in the face of competition from other companies awakening to the 
growing opportunities for airport management abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "A significant number of international airports will be privately operated and 
we expect to have our fair share," said Viggo Butler, president of the 
subsidiary of Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the only foreign airport Lockheed manages is the Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada. The company was a partner in 
a group that built the $480-million terminal, which opened in 1991 and includes 
a shopping center. Lockheed is now a minority owner and still manages that 
terminal, which has been a money maker from the start, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next stage of growth in the airport market worldwide seems to be from 
developing nations that want to build modernized airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is already involved in some airport projects in the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 In Khanty-Mansiysk, an autonomous oil-producing region of Siberia, the 
government hired Lockheed to draft a development scheme for a new terminal. 
Currently, Khanty-Mansiysk depends on barges to transport cargo, but its 
waterways are frozen all but four months a year, so the region needs an airport 
ready to handle cargo year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 In Turkmenistan, also in the former Soviet Union, Lockheed led a consortium 
that is now finishing a $150-million runway and airport terminal, installing 
everything from conveyor belts to handle baggage, to air conditioning in the 
sweltering airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Regions once geared only for travel behind the Iron Curtain must now update 
their airports to accommodate Western air traffic, said Robert Aaronson, 
executive vice president of Lockheed Air Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airports, unlike most other infrastructure, generate most of their revenues 
in hard currency -- hard foreign currency," which is why developing nations are 
interested in privatizing airports, said Robert Poole, president of the Reason 
Foundation, a Los Angeles-based economic think tank that specializes in 
privatization issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing nations also see airport expansion as a necessary part of economic 
development, said Hensley Evans, manager of the international privatization 
group of Price Waterhouse in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more developed countries are privatizing their airports in search 
of cheaper ways to run or expand them. Australia might sell some of its 23 
airports to the private sector. Lockheed would like to bid on the Australian 
airports if they are put up for sale, and the company is looking into similar 
projects in Eastern Europe, South America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the airport development and management business, Lockheed Air Terminal "is 
really the only real U.S. player on a world scale now," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others are hastening to get in on the boom. A unit of Hughes Aircraft Co. 
is completing negotiations with the airport authority of Trinidad and Tobago. 
Hughes will lead an international team that will build a new $80-million 
terminal in that sunny, oil-producing former outpost of the British empire. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hughes said it has completed studies for the Ukraine on ways to upgrade 
that country's airports. One reason is that the Ukraine wants to transform the 
Crimea, site of successive military invasions, into a tourist spot, said Dan 
Reeder, spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Air Terminal is girding itself to expand and meet any competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, four new executives, including Aaronson, have been brought in 
to help steer the company into international markets. Aaronson is the former 
president and executive officer of the Air Transport Assn. of America, and was 
also director of aviation at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
where he was responsible for management of Kennedy International and La Guardia 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is also awaiting word on its bid for a contract to supervise 
construction of a new airport terminal in Istanbul, Turkey. Lockheed has been 
asked by governments in Hungary, Argentina and Venezuela to make suggestions 
for possible airport improvement projects. And the company has completed a 
study on a possible new airport terminal in Beijing, at the government's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging airport market overseas, although promising, is marred by 
political uncertainties, warned Wolfgang Demisch, analyst for BT Securities 
Corp. In Canada, after last year's parliamentary elections, the new government 
withdrew from an agreement to hire private companies, including Lockheed, to 
revamp two more terminals at the Toronto airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed's Butler said the risks of airport development and management are 
not as great as in other enterprises. After all, an airport amounts to a public 
utility, and so "You have a certain measurable traffic that goes through these 
cities and you can predict over time what that traffic will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's roots in the airport business date back to 1929 when it was 
called United Airport Co., then a part of United Airlines. The company was sold 
to Lockheed Corp. in 1940, said Butler, and it once owned and operated Burbank 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, it sold the airport to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority, but Lockheed stayed on as airport manager and now manages the 
complex there, overseeing aviation safety, maintenance, construction and a host 
of other operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lockheed's attention is mostly focused overseas, the company still 
hopes to line up more domestic contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard Riordan was campaigning for mayor, he talked of leasing all or 
part of Los Angeles International Airport to the private sector to raise 
additional money for the city. The suggestion has since been shelved, but not 
for lack of effort by Lockheed Air Terminal, which generates about $100 million 
of Lockheed's $13 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company poured $158,000 into lobbying city officials for privatization in 
1993 -- the second-largest corporate lobby to the Los Angeles city government 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Riordan ever revives his plans to privatize the airport, Lockheed 
officials promise they'll be first in line to bid on that project, too.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: MADE IN THE SHADES; SUNGLASS MANUFACTURERS TRY TO 
CASH IN ON THE CULTURE OF COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America has become a sunglass culture. A society of shades, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, marketers convinced us that we can make bold statements about 
ourselves by the brand of soda pop we drank -- or the sneakers we wore. But 
now, it is those dark spectacles on our noses that tell all. Sunglass makers 
are making a killing on our mass desire to look cool. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all of today's talk about ultraviolet sun protection, consumer 
psychologists say that when we slip into our $275 Revos, we are mostly 
protecting ourselves from looking ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as athletic shoe makers convinced us that we need $100 tennis shoes -- 
and a different sneaker for every sport -- the sunglass industry is now 
spurring its own growth by persuading us that we need different sunglasses 
while driving the car, steering the boat or competing in the Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about imagery," said Marge Axelrad, editorial director of the trade 
publication 20/20. "Fashion and styling have never been more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing -- absolutely nothing -- sells sunglasses like style. "Ultimately, you 
buy a pair of sunglasses because you think they look good on your face," said 
Jeff Turner, general manager of Nikon Inc.'s eye wear division, which is 
running ads that nudge consumers to buy several pairs of its performance 
glasses for different activities. 
</P>
<P>
 This is prime sunglass season. Between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, 
sunglass makers expect to peddle nearly 60% of the estimated $2.5 billion in 
non-prescription sunglasses that will be sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
 California reigns as the nation's sunglass capital. By one estimate, nearly 
25% of all sunglasses sold in 1994 will be sold in California. Although flea 
markets -- and tourist attractions like Venice Beach -- sell lots of low-end 
glasses for under $10, the big-ticket sunglasses for over $100 are increasingly 
being bought at sunglass specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
 While sales of all sunglasses jumped 14.6% last year, sales of upper-end 
sunglasses (those over $30) were up nearly 17%, according to Bausch & Lomb. 
Manufacturers say that smaller, geometric metal frames are among today's most 
popular designs. 
</P>
<P>
 For $330, you can pick up a pair of fancy Serengeti sunglasses guaranteed to 
cut reflective glare from water, snow or your $120-an-hour tennis pro's metal 
racquet. 
</P>
<P>
 And if your 8-year-old needs a new set of shades -- because the last pair 
ended up getting flushed down the toilet -- Bausch & Lomb has just introduced 
its new "Covers" line of sunglasses that, for $30 a pop, come with a kiddie 
neck cord to avoid immediate loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass industry executives concede that the current sunglass mania was 
carefully carved out by manufacturers -- many of which pay celebrities to wear 
their shades. "All of this has been greatly enhanced by marketing," said Jim 
Pritts, president of the Sunglass Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time some major Hollywood hunk slips into a new pair of shades on 
screen, sales of the brand tend to skyrocket. Tom Cruise sent Ray-Ban sales 
through the roof when he wore them in "Risky Business." Ditto for Arnold  
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger and his too-cool Ray-Ban "Baloramas" in "Terminator 2." And the 
film "Blues Brothers" caused a run on Ray-Ban's thick-framed "Wayfarer" 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Kennedy Onassis made over-sized sunglasses the craze among the over-40 
set for years -- although few realized that her designer frames were actually 
prescription sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bausch & Lomb pays baseball slugger Frank Thomas to don its outer space-like 
"Killer Loop" glasses. Oakley Inc., which virtually owns the so-called 
"performance" segment of sunglasses, has Winter Olympic gold medalists Bonnie 
Blair and Dan Jansen wearing its brand. Serengeti pays A.J. Foyt to slips on 
its shades. And Revo has Reggie Jackson in its glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok has just begun trying to do with sunglasses what it did with athletic 
shoes. But the company finds it can't coax its big-name athletes to wear its 
shades because most already have deals with other companies, said Marty Blue, 
director of licensing. Thomas is with Bausch & Lomb, as is Olympic skater Nancy 
Kerrigan, who wears the company's Ray-Ban line. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster-Grant, a company that once ruled the industry, resurfaced over the 
weekend with its first national TV ad campaign in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which makes lower-end sunglasses (under $30 a pair), was king of 
the sunglass market in the 1960s and 1970s. But after years of mismanagement, 
it sought protection from creditors in 1988 when it filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. Recently, Foster-Grant was purchased by Rye, N.Y.-based Benson 
Eyecare Corp., which is about to spend millions to re-establish the brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Memorial Day Weekend, Foster-Grant began airing a new ad that features 
its 30-year-old slogan, "Who's that behind those Foster-Grants?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Brand awareness is incredibly strong," said Ken Shaw, senior vice president 
of sales. Indeed, Foster-Grant tested its slogan among groups of consumers and 
discovered that 35- to 54-year-olds were as familiar with that line as the 
slogan, "Look who's squeezing the Charmin." 
</P>
<P>
 By next year, Foster-Grant may try to introduce a line of higher-end 
sunglasses, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing in on the high-end sunglass craze is the Sunglass Hut chain, which has 
nearly 750 stores nationwide. It will also expand into several European 
countries this year, said Jack B. Chadsey, president of the Coral Gables, 
Fla.-based chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all boils down to lifestyle," said Chadsey, who said the typical sunglass 
customer will own 30 pair of sunglasses over a lifetime. "We all sit on our 
sunglasses, drop them or leave them sitting on the table in the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the typical customer spends $77 on sunglasses at Sunglass Hut, Chadsey 
said. To improve its bottom line, the firm recently developed its own 
private-label line, SunGear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also trying to cut in on that action is the giant LensCrafters optical chain. 
In five test markets, LensCrafters is linking up with the Sunglass Hut chain by 
offering discounts to Sunglass Hut customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the current sunglass craze is a simple cry for attention by many people 
who wear them. "It's the upscale equivalent of the tattoo," said psychologist 
Dr. Joyce Brothers. "Wearing sunglasses may be the last bit of lure that we 
have left." Eyes on Growth 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by new inroads into niche marketing and a growing number of sunglass 
specialty stores, sales of non-prescription sunglasses in the U.S. jumped 14.6% 
last year and are expected to see bigger growth this year. 06,22,08,08,08,08,08

 NEC to Expand U.S. Production: Computer maker NEC Corp. plans to increase its 
production of DRAM semiconductors in the United States within a year in an 
effort to reduce costs, officials said.NEC, which has more than half of Japan's 
personal computer market, will boost production of 16-megabit DRAMs, or 
"dynamic random access memory" chips, to 1.5 million a month at its plant in 
Roseville, Calif. The move will put half of NEC's DRAM production in the United 
States, company spokesman Mark Pearce said. Rising personnel costs and the 
strong Japanese yen have made manufacturing costs higher in Japan than in the 
United States.

 Saigon Beer Coming to the U.S.: The beverage will soon be on sale in the 
United States under a contract signed by Vietnam's Saigon Brewery, a spokesman 
for the firm said. It is the second Vietnamese brewer to win a U.S. export 
order in the four months since President Clinton lifted an economic embargo 
against Vietnam dating from the Vietnam War era. The spokesman said the brewery 
and a U.S. firm called Trichi Inc. signed a contract this month for the export 
of 3.2 million bottles of Saigon Beer valued at $1.2 million to California, 
mainly for the Vietnamese community.

 BP Says Shipping Unions Agree on Export Deal: British Petroleum Co. has 
reached a deal aimed at winning support of key U.S. maritime unions toward 
lifting a ban on Alaskan oil exports, the company said. In exchange, BP said it 
has agreed to use U.S. ships and crews to transport oil to foreign markets if 
the ban is lifted.Law requires that cargoes transported from one U.S. port to 
another move on U.S. ships, but no such law applies for goods moving out of the 
country. Shippers have long feared a loss of jobs if companies producing oil in 
Alaska won permission to export it. Winning the support of the maritime unions 
was a key hurdle in efforts to lift the ban.

 Drillers Find Oil Off Cuban Coast: Foreign companies and Cubapetroleo, the 
state oil agency, said they have discovered crude oil in Cuba's Bay of 
Cardenas.The well, first drilled Dec. 18, reached a total depth of 10,670 feet 
and tested 16-degree API oil at a rate of 3,750 barrels per day, the companies 
said. The size is under evaluation. Canada Northwest Energy Ltd. has a 60% 
interest in the well. A discovery of significant size would throw a lifeline to 
Cuba, which is facing severe economic crisis since the collapse of its old 
trade and aid partner, the Soviet Union.

 B of A to Close Egyptian Branches: Bank of America, one of the first foreign 
banks to open in Egypt, said it is closing branches in Cairo and Alexandria and 
will not accept new business after June 30. "The reason for closing down 
operations in Egypt is purely a strategic change in the bank's business," 
senior vice president and area manager Michael Seibel said. "It is not logical 
to compete with an Egyptian bank which has at least 300 branches."

PENNIES: THE THROWAWAY COINS WE CAN'T LET GO OF; MONEY: SHOPKEEPERS SHRUG THEM 
OFF, WHILE CONSUMERS COLLECT THEM IN JARS AND PIGGY BANKS. BUT AMERICANS WANT 
THE LITTLE FELLAS TO STAY IN CIRCULATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A dollar isn't what it used to be, and to many Americans, a penny is close to 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have inspired the folk wisdom that "A penny saved is a penny earned," 
but the coin, now made of zinc with a copper coating, is tossed away like a 
candy or cigarette wrappers at newsstands and food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shops throughout the country keep cups of pennies by registers with 
hand-scrawled signs encouraging customers to drop in extras or pick out what 
they need to pay a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Some don't even bother with cups, simply rounding up or down and giving away 
or charging customers the extra penny, two, three or four. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place next door must be losing money," one Washington office worker said 
of a convenience store where he shops. "If the bill is $4.61, they tell you to 
keep the penny. But if your change is $4.61, they give it to you to the penny 
exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Several large supermarket chains encourage customers to round up their bills 
to the next dollar and donate the coins to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans, by the tens of millions certainly, accumulate pennies at home 
in jars, piggy banks or cans. What they are used for is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have come up with more creative solutions to how to best use the lowly 
coinage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently tiled my bathroom with pennies," one American told the USA Today 
newspaper. "I put down 12,000 pennies for a cost of $120. It was the cheapest 
alternative to tiling or putting down carpeting or any other floor surface." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a poll conducted at Walt Disney World, the average American 
stores $9.93 in pennies at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that explains why billions of pennies disappear each year from 
circulation and must be replaced by the government. About 12.1 billion pennies 
were manufactured last year and another 12 billion to 13 billion will be made 
this year, according to the U.S. Mint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mint says the service life of pennies is much longer than the two to three 
decades for nickels, dimes and other U.S. coins since so many pennies do not 
circulate, according to U.S. Mint spokesman Michael White. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many pennies are in piggy banks," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in poll after poll, Americans say they want to keep the penny and condemn 
any suggestion the penny be eliminated. The last time a congressional bill was 
proposed to legally allow rounding of bills to the nearest nickel was five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense to get rid of the penny from a change standpoint," said Thomas 
Howard, associate professor of finance at the University of Denver. Retailing 
transactions could, in fact, be made more efficient if the coin were abolished, 
and coin handling might be more convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but scores of Americans worry that doing away with the penny or 
rounding up bills would cost them money and cause price inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demand for the penny remains high, and the public is skeptical about the 
effects, particularly on the poor, of rounding retail transactions to the 
nearest five cents," the General Accounting Office said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, the penny is good for government revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The penny revenue is very important to states for sales taxes," White said. 
"When it's on everybody's bill that adds up to a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. government, it does not mind making and distributing pennies, 
since the business is profitable. Each penny, according to White, costs 0.8 
cents to make but yields a full penny in value. 
</P>
<P>
 That difference, known as "seigniorage" (pronounced SEEN-your-age), amounted 
to $24 million in fiscal 1993 for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not cash," White said. "It goes against interest on the national 
debt." 
</P>
<P>
 And some Americans pick up the discarded pennies and value them for more than 
their meager purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents started me saving pennies when I was a youngster, a habit that has 
stayed with me," Scott Alexander of Dansville, N.Y., told USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not, I was able to help pay for a major portion of my college 
education -- 2 1/2 years at Ithaca College and 2 1/2 years at SUNY-Cortland -- 
by saving pennies. I plan to teach my children this valuable lesson when the 
time comes, and I hope pennies are still around."

 Tokyo's Nikkei posted a new 1994 closing high for the second trading day in a 
row Monday, but most world markets changed little on low volume because of 
holidays in the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo share prices advanced on continued buying by European investors, traders 
said. One trader said more upbeat corporate profit projections encouraged the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 20,838.97, up 61.81 points, or 
0.30%. On Friday, the average gained 281.36 points to 20,777.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 104.40 yen, down 0.13 yen from Friday's close. 
It closed on Friday in New York at 104.28 yen. In Europe, the dollar ended 
mixed. It rose against the German mark from Friday to 1.6455 marks. Gold 
hovered near $385 on several markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Toronto exchange, shares in Inco, the world's largest nickel producer 
outside the former Soviet Union, were down as much as 1 to 35 3/5 after news 
that it reached a tentative agreement on a new three-year contract with the 
union representing 4,900 workers at its Ontario nickel mining and processing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinking Inco shares pulled down the Canadian mining group, which was off 39.93 
points at 3743.72. Inco fell 1 1/8 to 35 5/8 on 1.16 million shares after 
averting a strike this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickel prices are expected to fall back after surging above $3 a pound last 
week on speculation of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Before today's slide, Inco shares had risen steadily by more than 13% since 
May 12 in anticipation that a strike would bolster nickel prices by reducing 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been far too much discounting of the potential to strike in Inco," 
said Ben Joyce, chief equities strategist at Burns Fry Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights of other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 Italian stocks closed slightly higher today after the new government's first 
package of economic legislation, announced late Friday afternoon, was greeted 
with a ripple of enthusiasm in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip Mibtel index rose 64 points to close at 11,696 in trading today 
after falling about 4% last week. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was elected 
March 28 with a mandate to reform Italy's business regulations and pull the 
economy out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 German shares ended weaker and volume was very light. The DAX index closed 
22.84 points down at 2,118.15. French shares ended the session barely changed 
from Friday's close. But Swiss shares gained more than 1% on moderate turnover. 
Firm index futures and low volume due to holidays in Britain and the United 
States helped to push prices higher, dealers said. The broad SPI closed up 
20.89 at a day's high of 1,801.08. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks closed little changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "National investors were sitting on the sidelines," said Jorge Gonzalez, 
sub-director of research at CBI Casa de Bolsa SA. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index, which has risen 10.95% in peso terms over the past week 
and a half, rose 0.36 points, or 0.01%, to 2,485.41.

 Japan's Vehicle Exports Decline: The nation's vehicle exports fell for the 
13th straight month in April, but exports to the United States rebounded, the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. said. Overall vehicle exports for the year 
to April sank 16.2% to 367,230 from year-earlier levels, hit by weak demand in 
Europe and the strong yen, which has prompted Japanese car makers to shift 
production overseas.Exports by four of Japan's five biggest car makers fell. 
But Honda Motor Corp. posted a 38.7% year-on-year gain. Japan's vehicle exports 
to the United States posted an 11.4% year-on-year gain to 135,147 in April, 
their first rise in nine months. Japan's vehicle exports in 1993-94 fell 18.3% 
to 4.62 million, the second straight year of decline.

 New Investment Bankers to Open in India: CS First Boston tied up with an 
Indian investment bank and Morgan Stanley won permission to open an office in 
India, joining a host of international names entering the country to take 
advantage of its economic reforms. CSFB announced it allied itself with J.M. 
Financial & Investment Consultancy Services, one of India's biggest private 
investment banks.Morgan Stanley said the government had given it a go-ahead to 
set up an investment banking liaison office in Bombay. "India, along with 
China, today provides the biggest opportunities for investment banking," said 
Robert Baylis, chairman, Pacific, of CSFB. "But India could probably become the 
biggest if China does what it has been indicating recently, to limit the number 
of issues from its companies and limit returns on investments."

ITALY MAY OFFER TAX BREAKS FOR AUTO BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy is likely to offer tax breaks to buyers of new cars in an effort to 
reverse a 7% slide in sales this year and jump-start the economy, a government 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy would follow France, Spain and Denmark, which have each increased sales 
14% or more during the first four months of this year with various incentives, 
while overall European sales rose 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Car sales in France, Europe's fourth-largest car market, rose 14% during the 
first four months of the year after the government offered buyers $890 if they 
traded in a car at least 10 years old. Car makers matched the offer, leading to 
a strong increase in small car sales after the combination of government and 
car maker incentives lopped as much as 20% off prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain last month began a similar offer, and Denmark's tax breaks to car buyers 
have helped sales rise 47% during the first four months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian government is still evaluating various plans to increase sales, 
Finance Ministry spokesman Carlo Nocera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian auto maker Fiat, which sells 46% of all cars in Italy and is the 
country's largest privately owned industrial company, is expected to be the 
biggest beneficiary of any measures. Fiat is Italy's major domestic car maker, 
owning the Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Masserati and Ferrari brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say the month-old government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 
needs to encourage consumer spending to help the economy. Fiat's sales during 
the first quarter rose 11%, but much of that was because of exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors' Adam Opel division, the next biggest car 
sellers in Europe's second-largest car market after Germany, also may benefit 
from the incentives to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports said the government was looking at abolishing taxes to encourage 
car sales. These include car registration taxes of several hundred dollars, 
depending on the size of the car, a $35 annual tax on the driver's license, and 
a similar tax on car radios. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Ministry's Nocera declined to comment on whether the government 
would duplicate France's incentive to trade in old cars. One-fifth of Italy's 
30 million cars are at least 10 years old.

 If you're on medication, either prescription or over-the-counter, here's what 
you should know before summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Light Problem: Certain medicines increase the skin's sensitivity to 
sunlight, sometimes resulting in a rash, a quicker-than-usual sunburn or both. 
This occurs because some ingredients in drugs react more intensely with 
sunlight than other ingredients, explains Theresa Lane, a clinical pharmacist 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of medicines that increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight is 
long, says Fred Raleigh, director of pharmacy services for Atascadero State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The List: Commonly used drugs likely to increase sensitivity to sunlight, 
Raleigh and Lane say, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The antibiotics tetracycline, doxycycline (Vibramycin) and minocycline 
(Minocin). 
</P>
<P>
 * The anti-infection drug ciprofloxacin (Cipro), prescribed for infection of 
the eye, urinary tract and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil).  
</P>
<P>
 * Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen (Anaprox, Naprosyn) 
and piroxicam (Feldene). Motrin and Advil do not seem to increase sensitivity 
to sunlight, Lane adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Certain diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazides. 
</P>
<P>
 * The acne treatment drug isotretenoin (Accutane). 
</P>
<P>
 The Clues: Skin redness is usually the first symptom of photosensitivity. But 
it might not occur immediately. It's also possible to take a medication for a 
long time and not have sensitivity problems until much later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Rx: If you are taking any medicine known to increase sunlight 
sensitivity, avoiding the sun is the best thing to do -- both while taking the 
drug and for a week or so after, because medications can stay in the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunscreen is a must. Raleigh recommends using one with a sun protection factor 
(SPF) of at least 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thermostat Problems: Certain medicines can hamper the body's built-in 
temperature-regulating ability, inhibiting sweating and other necessary 
functions. Among the drugs: antihistamines, decongestants and antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
 When the body's thermostat doesn't work properly, you are at risk for heat 
stroke, which is serious and life-threatening. Among the first symptoms: 
weakness, fatigue, faintness and chills. Seek medical help immediately if you 
suspect heat stroke. Place the victim in a cool, shady place until help 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Temperature Problem: High temperatures can cause medicine to break down. 
Tetracycline is one example. You'll know by the very pungent smell.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: H & H OIL TOOL TO BE ACQUIRED BY WEATHERFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H & H Oil Tool Co., a Santa Paula firm that rents drilling and production 
equipment to the oil and gas industries, has agreed to be acquired by 
Weatherford International Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Weatherford provides services, products, and specialized rental 
and fishing tools to the energy industry.The company had 1993 revenue of $314.7 
million. H & H, which operates primarily in California and the Rocky Mountains, 
had 1993 revenue of $21.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon news of the deal last week, H & H's stock surged 50% on very heavy 
trading, to $7.50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger agreement calls for a tax-free pooling of interests under which 2.6 
million shares of Weatherford common stock would be exchanged for all the 
outstanding shares of H & H common stock. The exchange ratio will be 0.789 
Weatherford shares for each H & H share. The merger is subject to creation of a 
definitive agreement and approval by H & H shareholders, the company's board, 
lenders and regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is expected to be completed in early September. The existing letter 
of intent will terminate, however, if a definitive agreement hasn't been 
reached by June 30.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DATAMETRICS, CRAY TO MAKE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., the Chatsworth provider of computer equipment, said it has 
signed an agreement with Cray Research Inc. of Minnesota to produce a 
supercomputer system designed to withstand harsh conditions such as those found 
on a ship, submarine or airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the two-year agreement, Cray will manufacture central processing units 
and components for high-powered computers worth about $250,000 each, and sell 
them to Rugged Digital Systems, a business unit of Datametrics.Rugged Digital 
Systems will provide tough, shock-resistant shells, connections and other 
equipment to make the devices hardy enough for use on an oil platform or steel 
mill. 
</P>
<P>
 The product, called the Cray R/EL94 supercomputer, will be sold by both 
companies. It will be ready for sale in the fourth quarter of this year. There 
are as yet no orders for the supercomputers, but Datametrics said it expects to 
sell them to the government for military uses and to oil-exploration and 
chemical companies.

FOOD-SERVICE ENTREPRENEUR STANDS THE HEAT; MANAGEMENT: KATHY TAGGARES 
DIVERSIFIED INTO THE FROZEN PIZZA BUSINESS WHEN HER SALAD DRESSING PRODUCT HIT 
A SLUMP. THE MOVE HAS PAID OFF FOR K.T.'S KITCHENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy Taggares kept reading about entrepreneurs who'd built businesses from 
nothing and she wanted to join the club. 
</P>
<P>
 So seven years ago Taggares sold everything from her jewelry to her 
condominium to help raise enough money to help buy a salad dressing company 
from Marriott International. 
</P>
<P>
 She renamed the business K.T.'s Kitchens, and when the salad dressing business 
hit a slump, she jumped into the frozen pizza market. It's paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her stewardship, K.T.'s sales have jumped from $8 million to $26 million 
last year, and employment has jumped from 16 to 450. Even Taggares concedes she 
didn't get this far without having some bad days. Why just recently she lost 
her temper and threw a frozen pizza against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But that kind of strong will may have kept Taggares' company growing during 
the recession because, "She knows how to get (the) product out the door. She 
doesn't know what the word no means," said Lloyd Greif, president of Greif & 
Co., a Los Angeles investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif said K.T.'s Kitchens also prospered because of Taggares' good business 
instincts, by diversifying into the pizza business to lessen its dependence on 
the salad dressing market. "She has an intuitive feel for the marketplace," 
Greif said. And Taggares is "a relentless salesperson," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Taggares also recently won the U.S. Small Business Administration business 
person of the year award for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggares decided to run her own business after a seven-year stretch as a sales 
and marketing manager with food processing companies, when she became fed up 
with inadequate pay and recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott, the hotel and food services chain, had a business it wanted to shed, 
Bob's Kitchens in Glendale, maker of Bob's Big Boy salad dressings and dips. 
The only hitch: Marriott was willing to carry a note for $5 million, but 
Taggares also had to come up with $1 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggares talked to California First Bank, and got about a $700,000 loan based 
on the plant's inventory and receivables. For the rest Taggares sold her 
condominium, car, life insurance policy and jewelry. But she was still a bit 
short. So, Taggares collected the balance by selling a hamburger patty maker in 
the factory she didn't own yet to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting to where the company now is hasn't been a snap. K.T.'s salad 
dressing business, the onetime company stronghold, has slipped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taggares bought the block-long factory in Glendale, she gained exclusive 
rights to manufacture Bob's Big Boy salad dressing and dips sold at the family 
restaurant chain's California locations and in supermarkets. But after the 
purchase, Marriott sold the Bob's California restaurants to Restaurant 
Enterprise Group (now Family Restaurants Inc.), which has converted some into 
Coco's and Carrows, and sold others. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bob's salad dressings have been -- and remain -- a high profit 
margin business, the Bob's restaurant selloff hurt K.T.'s sales. Marriott 
wasn't promoting the Bob's brand anymore, and K.T.'s didn't have the financial 
resources to support it with big advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to reverse the trend, K.T.'s experimented with fat-free variations and 
expanded into new markets. But it didn't help. Taggares concluded that Bob's 
salad dressings -- its cash cow -- would no longer be the company's mainstay. 
"I want to keep the brand alive. I see it as a steady business, but I don't see 
any major increases there," said Taggares. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When K.T.'s got into the frozen pizza business in late 1988 Taggares went out 
and contacted supermarket food buyers herself. Pizza has become K.T.'s most 
potent revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
 K.T.'s supplies frozen pizzas for various supermarket labels such as Vons and 
Albertson's, plus the Price Costco warehouse club stores, and for military 
bases, hospitals, amusement parks and schools. It also packs the Wolfgang 
Puck's California frozen pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 K.T.'s now pumps out an average of 300 frozen pizzas a minute on a conveyor 
belt assembly line at its Glendale plant. After the crust is baked it journeys 
through a waterfall of sauce and cheese, then toppings, such as pepperoni and 
sausage, are added by hand and by machine, then are frozen. Within 48 hours the 
pizzas have been shipped around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual pizza sales stand at $20 million, and Taggares boasts that pizza sales 
will grow another $10 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing seems to be right. U.S. consumers spent about $1.4 billion on 
frozen pizza in 1993, with sales rising 7%, according to Chicago-based 
Information Resources Inc. In contrast, supermarket frozen foods sales in 
general have been flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven C. Anderson, president of the American Frozen Food Institute in McLean, 
Va., believes frozen pizza's popularity reflects the rise of busy, two-paycheck 
households who demand convenience. The limp economy may also be a factor since 
private label frozen pizza remains a relatively low-cost meal, Anderson added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taggares has run into some problems too. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, K.T.'s International, another division of the company, developed a 
line of vending machines that keeps frozen food frozen and dispenses it hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to push sales, K.T.'s International hooked up with a telemarketing 
executive who, according to a suit recently filed by the Federal Trade 
Commission, was bilking small investors. Taggares' company was not cited by the 
FTC case. But Taggares said K.T.'s had to shell out $250,000 in legal fees, 
plus it lost several hundred thousand dollars in inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Taggares has been around the food industry most of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggares, 42, hails from Othello, Wash., a tiny potato farming community with 
one stoplight. She enrolled at New York University as a dance major. To support 
herself, she tended bar and waited tables. It was an inauspicious start in food 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Today her trusted lieutenant is Joan Paris, a former colleague and friend of 
20 years. Paris is now K.T.'s general manager. The Taggares-Paris management 
team apparently works well. Taggares admits she has a short fuse; in contrast, 
Paris is calm and steady. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggares hopes to open a second factory on the East Coast to cut shipping 
costs. Taggares has already started scouting possible sites in Kentucky, Ohio 
and the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days at K.T.'s, Taggares spent lots of time on the factory floor. 
She still strolls through regularly, but as the business has grown, she's 
learned to delegate.K T'S KITCHENS (

IN A HOLDING PATTERN; DEFENSE, AEROSPACE FIRMS TRY TO MAINTAIN JOBS, BUT THE 
FUTURE IS CLOUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After eliminating 15,000 jobs this decade, the eight major aerospace and 
defense concerns in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys and Ventura County 
still cannot make any promises about job security. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co., ITT Corp., Litton Industries Inc., Lockheed Corp., 
Northrop Corp., Rockwell International Corp., Teledyne Inc. and Textron Inc. 
have collectively slashed 40% of their local work force since 1990, and they 
are understandably wary about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Military and aerospace programs are funded by Congress on a yearly basis, and 
pressure continues to keep spending in check. Many programs affecting local 
employment, from the space station to Stealth bombers and navigation systems, 
are under review in the current federal budget process. And if companies don't 
win new contracts, more layoffs could come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is to stay even or try to stay even, which is difficult to do in a 
down revenue environment," said Bob Knapp, a spokesman for Litton Industries. 
Litton has cut employment from 4,800 in January, 1990, to 3,530 today at its 
Guidance and Control Systems Division in Woodland Hills and its Data Systems 
Division in Agoura Hills and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to run faster and faster and make those kinds of advancements 
in technology to stay competitive," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 To offset defense spending cuts, some companies are pursuing more work from 
foreign governments, others are pushing into commercial markets and getting 
contracts to upgrade older aircraft, weapons and space systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But these efforts are not likely to increase employment levels anytime soon. 
"It doesn't work that way," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton keeps advancing its technology. Its battlefield control systems can 
respond to incoming artillery almost the instant the shell is fired. Litton is 
also developing new systems that track and destroy enemy missiles for Lockheed 
Corp.'s anti-missile system, which is still under development but is often 
mentioned as a successor to Raytheon's Patriot missile, which intercepted Iraqi 
Scud missiles during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Litton -- which this fall is moving its corporate headquarters from 
Beverly Hills to Woodland Hills -- expects to cut another 250 workers locally 
by August, 1995, because the number of aircraft and missiles being built 
continues to decline. Another 100 Guidance and Control workers will move to 
Salt Lake City this summer, part of an ongoing consolidation of manufacturing 
operations there. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rocketdyne International in Canoga Park, employment has dropped 27% from 
8,600 in January, 1990, to 6,300 today. The $900-million-a-year division of 
parent company Rockwell International makes the space shuttle's main engines 
and engines used to launch the Atlas and Delta satellite rockets. It is also 
developing an electric power system for the proposed space station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our target is to see if we can stabilize our work force, then look for other 
growth opportunities," said Paul Ross, Rocketdyne's vice president of 
production operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But so much depends on unknowns. The Clinton Administration has requested $2.1 
billion for the controversial space station project in the next fiscal year, 
but some in Congress are certain to try to kill the program, which would create 
a floating laboratory in space. Also, Rocketdyne's current space shuttle work 
is confined to maintenance and upgrades on existing engines because no new 
engines have been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne just received a $200-million order for 40 Delta engines. But its 
Atlas engine deliveries are expected to wind down in 1996 because by that time 
there will be enough of the rockets to satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is trying to convert its aerospace expertise into new businesses. 
Last week it was chosen to design a device for helping turn steam into energy 
at a solar power plant near Barstow. Rocketdyne has also proposed with Lockheed 
a radical design for a reusable spacecraft, called a single-stage-to-orbit 
rocket, to replace the current space shuttle fleet. But that is a decade away 
at best, and it's unclear whether this technology would work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Southern California's shrinking aerospace industry, some observers are 
optimistic. "We're coming to the trough" of defense and aerospace layoffs, said 
David Lewin, director of UCLA's Institute of Industrial Relations. In a few 
years companies that are shifting resources to commercial markets might add 
small numbers of employees, he said. And if the threat of certain countries 
developing nuclear capability, such as North Korea, leads to a rethinking of 
U.S. defense policy -- as Lewin believes it will -- some companies could reap a 
windfall of new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even Northrop, the only major aerospace contractor that has 
actually increased local employment this decade, faces a cloudy future. 
</P>
<P>
 As the B-2 Stealth bomber has gone to full assembly-line production, 
employment at Northrop's assembly plant in Palmdale and its flight-testing 
operations at Edwards Air Force Base has more than doubled to 4,500. In 
December, Northrop delivered the first operational wing-shaped B-2 aircraft to 
the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force has ordered 20 B-2 bombers, which will end up costing $2.2 
billion each, with final deliveries scheduled for early 1998. Barring more 
orders, Northrop's Antelope Valley work force could decline to 3,000 by the end 
of the decade, with the remaining workers kept on to refurbish five of the 
flight-test B-2s to bring them up to operational level, said Northrop spokesman 
Ed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar-evading B-2 is considered unequaled in its efficiency over long 
distances, and some legislators favor ordering more. Yet budgetary pressures 
are so intense that the program might die anyway, said analyst Wolfgang Demisch 
at BT Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many mouths to feed in a declining defense budget," Demisch 
said. "Thus far, Congress has decided this particular mouth is not a high 
enough priority." Without more orders, Northrop's B-2 work force could fall "in 
a straight line to zero by very early in the next decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demisch also sees problems for Lockheed's Advanced Development Co., the 
Palmdale operation known as the Skunk Works, famous for developing the U-2 spy 
plane, and F-117 Stealth fighter that was used in the Iraqi war. Although the 
Skunk Works programs are shrouded in secrecy, "the evidence suggests at least 
that the cupboard is relatively bare in terms of new programs," said Demisch, 
and that "the Skunk Works is inventing furiously right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's regional employment has plunged to 4,600 today from 14,300 in 
January, 1990. Nearly 4,100 workers are in Palmdale, with the rest split mostly 
between corporate headquarters in Calabasas and Lockheed Air Terminal in 
Burbank, an airport management unit. The big drop in Lockheed's local work 
force came in 1990 and 1991 when its aircraft manufacturing operations were 
shifted from Burbank to Marrietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed expects no layoffs for the rest of the year, mostly because the Skunk 
Works has steady work modifying and upgrading the U-2 and F-117 planes, said 
Jim Ragsdale, a Lockheed spokesman. Beyond that it's difficult to predict, 
since no new aircraft have been ordered. The company has proposed building 
newer versions of the F-117 for the Air Force and Navy and a major modification 
program for the Air Force's existing fleet of F-117s. Lockheed also hopes that 
a $32-million contract it received last year from the Pentagon to develop a new 
type of fighter aircraft will eventually lead to a production contract.

 ITT Corp. has cut its local employment to 1,020 from 2,120 in 1990 because 
fewer U.S. ships and aircraft use radar systems made at ITT Gilfillan in Van 
Nuys and valves and switches from its Aerospace Controls in Burbank and 
Chatsworth. So ITT is trying to increase sales to foreign countries. "The bad 
news is, everybody is doing the same," said Victor Rios, ITT Gilfillan 
president. "It's a very, very tough market out there worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the loss of local jobs as operations continue moving out of state 
isn't finished yet. General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft is relocating its 
missile systems group from Canoga Park to Tucson as it consolidates its 
manufacturing. About 1,000 Canoga Park workers will be gone by August, and only 
a maintenance staff will stay on while the 85-acre site is put up for sale. 
About 300 Hughes workers will also remain at satellite facilities in Sylmar and 
at a Van Nuys Airport hangar where the company's helicopter fleet is 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major company that has slashed its local employment because of the 
declining defense budget is Teledyne, based in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 In four years, Teledyne's work force at its troubled Electronics Systems 
Division in Northridge and Newbury Park has fallen by nearly half, to 1,272. 
Teledyne officials declined to discuss future employment trends. 
</P>
<P>
 The most optimistic job forecast came from H. R. Textron in Valencia, where 
its work force has shrunk to 750 from 1,600 in 1990. Those cutbacks came as 
defense and commercial aircraft contracts declined, reducing demand for 
Textron's control systems and valves. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past year, the company has added a handful of engineering jobs and 
expects to hire more as new military development programs gear up, said Textron 
Senior Vice President Craig Johansen at the parent company's headquarters in 
Providence, R. I. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this decade, Textron will begin producing control systems for McDonnell 
Douglas F/A-18 fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It also hopes to win more aircraft and weapons contracts, and has won more 
commercial work for Textron's Cessna Aircraft Co. and Bell Helicopter units. 
</P>
<P>
 Textron's move into commercial markets has even resulted in the sale of a few 
prototype models of control system valves to Walt Disney Co. for the theme park 
company's animatronic figures. And it's hoping to expand into the automotive 
market with valves for suspension and breaking systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of these efforts could be a doubling of H. R. Textron's work force 
by the end of the decade, Johansen said. "But," he added, "a lot of things have 
to happen." Local Aerospace Cutbacks 
</P>
<P>
 Major aerospace and defense contractors with local operations have reduced 
their employment in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys and Ventura County by 
an average of 40% since January, 1990. Although most companies hope that their 
reduced employment levels have finally stabilized, they cannot rule out further 
layoffs if Congress cuts additional funding for their projects.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: WITH DESIGN REPORTS LOSS OF $509,922 IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Design In Mind International Inc., a troubled Woodland Hills company that 
sells novelty gift items, reported a $509,922 first-quarter loss on $294,900 in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, With Design lost $563,747 on $136,124 in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said that a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed against it 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in February, 1993, was dismissed last 
Tuesday by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint had alleged violation of federal securities laws stemming from 
alleged embezzlement by With Design's former chief executive, Steve Zuloff; 
Barry Benjamin, its former chief financial officer, and Benjamin's son, David, 
a former company executive. The three were ousted from the company two years 
ago and later settled a complaint brought by the company by agreeing to pay 
about $1 million, mostly in cash and stock. The former executives did not admit 
or deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, With Design was dismissed from another shareholder lawsuit 
stemming from the alleged embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In reporting the first-quarter results, With Design said its sales increase 
was due to its October acquisition of children's products manufacturer Janex 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it eased its cash shortage by raising $494,100 through a 
private sale of units consisting of stock and warrants and $135,000 from the 
exercise of options. It also said it has completed negotiations with a bank for 
a $650,000 line of credit.

OXNARD'S LTC PROPERTIES AMONG HEALTHIEST OF RESURGENT REITS; REAL ESTATE: THE 
INVESTMENT TRUST PUTS ITS MONEY IN NURSING HOMES, WHICH AREN'T OVERBUILT. DUE 
TO DEMOGRAPHICS, DEMAND KEEPS ON GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts took a pounding in the late 1980s, but now 
they're coming back. And leading the Wall Street rally are health-care REITs 
such as LTC Properties of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year LTC shareholders got a hefty 39% return in the form of dividends and 
higher stock prices -- double the average return for the entire REIT industry, 
according to the National Assn. of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a Washington, 
D.C.-based trade group. Even among health-care REITs, LTC, with assets of about 
$205 million, is ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because LTC has been putting all its money in nursing homes, which unlike 
other real estate, weren't overbuilt during the 1980s, thanks to state 
regulatory restrictions. So unlike hospitals, which are struggling with too 
many vacant beds, nursing homes have an overall occupancy rate above 90%, says 
Peter Sidoti, a health-care analyst at Natwest Securities Corp. in New York. 
And demand for long-term elderly care continues to grow as the population ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think LTC is the most attractive of the health-care REITs," Sidoti said. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate investment trust is effectively a real estate mutual fund. REITs 
pool investors' cash and invest directly in properties or make mortgage loans 
on them. Because REITs pass most of their earnings through to shareholders, 
theoretically at least, they provide more income to investors compared with 
most other stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But REITs tend to have boom and bust cycles. They fell out of favor in the 
mid-1970s, and again in the 1980s when the real estate market performed poorly, 
but in the last couple of years, investors have flocked back to REITs for their 
relatively high dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of REIT trading has created a boom of new REIT market offerings on 
Wall Street, which is likely to spawn more competition for LTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, traditional banks that had once shied away from financing health-care 
facilities are now starting to step back into the arena. Another risk for LTC 
is the uncertainty of national health-care reform, which is driving sweeping 
changes in the medical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, LTC is one of only a few REITs that specialize in nursing homes, 
and analysts like LTC even more because of its experienced management. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC's Chairman and Chief Executive Andre Dimitriadis and President William 
McBride used to be senior executives at Beverly Enterprises, the nation's 
largest operator of nursing homes, based in Fort Smith, Ark. In the late 1980s, 
the pair helped restructure Beverly Enterprise, and their experience in the 
field has paid off so far by finding good nursing-home operators and properties 
to invest in. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, for example, Dimitriadis and McBride picked up a 200-bed nursing 
home in Tucson at an auction held by the federal government, which foreclosed 
on the property after the owner defaulted on a $6-million mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The nursing home was badly managed and had only a 50% occupancy rate, said 
McBride. But the property was relatively new, had a large therapy center and 
was near a major hospital center. So LTC bought the nursing home for $4.25 
million and leased it to a stronger nursing-home operator, who has since filled 
80% of the beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's value-added," said Dimitriadis, 53, who left Beverly Enterprises as 
its chief financial officer in 1992 to form LTC. McBride, 34, was a vice 
president and controller at Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, they know what they're doing," Andrew Turner said of LTC management. 
Turner is chief executive of Sun Healthcare, a large nursing home chain based 
in Albuquerque, N.M., and one of LTC's borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC -- short for Long Term Care -- started out in August, 1992, with a 
$142-million public offering of stock, at $10 per share, and convertible debt. 
Last March, LTC followed with a secondary offering of 4.8 million shares of 
common stock at $13.25 each, raising $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC's stock closed Friday at $14 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 While LTC buys nursing homes, most of the $280 million of investments it's 
made so far have been mortgage loans to partnerships that own or lease nursing 
homes in more than a dozen states, mainly in the Sun Belt. Last summer, LTC 
sold off about $75 million worth of these mortgages to institutional investors, 
so it could pick up more cash for other investments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LTC earned $6.9 million last year on revenue of $15.8 million. In the first 
quarter of this year, LTC's profit more than doubled to $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC currently pays a quarterly dividend of 27 per share, so its annual yield 
would be 7.7% at the present stock price of $14 a share. It's that yield, 
coupled with the rise in the stock price, that gave LTC a 5% return to 
shareholders in the first quarter of this year. That compared with a 
first-quarter average return of 2.2% for the entire REIT industry and 4.2% for 
all of the 13 publicly traded health-care REITs, according to the REIT trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these results, some investors appear to be betting against LTC. Short 
interest in LTC's stock surged sixfold in May from April, to 364,651 shares. In 
a short sale, investors sell borrowed stock -- in effect betting the stock 
price will drop -- after which they can buy back the stock at a lower price, 
return the shares to the lender and pocket the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC officials think the short interest surge reflects some investors engaging 
in arbitrage, rather than a broader sentiment that the stock is overpriced and 
headed downward. John Lutzius, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a Newport 
Beach firm that analyzes REITs for institutional investors, agrees. At the 
current price of $14 a share, he said, "we'd be a buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Lutzius likes LTC's prospects because "they've been aggressive in booking new 
deals and seeking out a relatively underserved portion of the market." He said 
LTC also takes a conservative approach to lending, "demanding and receiving a 
low loan-to-value ratio and a high cash flow coverage of the interest." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride also says LTC doesn't allow the borrower to take out too much equity 
in a refinancing deal, nor does LTC invest in very big nursing homes because 
quality is hard to control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just rely on an appraiser," Dimitriadis added, noting that he and 
McBride inspect every property before an investment is made. "Because of our 
experience in the industry, at the end of the day, we know what the value is."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: AVOCADOS, CELERY SHOW MAJOR INCREASES IN '93 
</P>

 Avocados and celery showed the most dramatic production increases among 
Ventura County crops last year, according to Agricultural Commissioner Earl 
McPhail.Avocados jumped 67% over their 1992 value, reaching $49.9 million, 
while celery leaped 44%, to $113.8 million, McPhail reports. 
</P>
<P>
 McPhail isn't making any predictions about avocados, but he expects celery to 
decline this year. "The demand isn't what it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the county's agricultural output last year rose about 17%, to $848 
million. The top crop: lemons, valued at $216.1 million.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: TOURIST-RELATED BUSINESSES GEAR UP FOR A BUSY SUMMER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Ventura County's hotels, restaurants and other tourist-related 
businesses are gearing up for their busiest summer season in years, thanks 
largely to an expected increase in visitors from the Greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The season, which began unofficially last weekend, should be the strongest 
since the late 1980s, says Debbie Solomon, the city of Ventura's tourism 
marketing supervisor. She predicts that more than 1.5 million people will visit 
Ventura, Oxnard and other beach areas in the county between now and Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hotels and other businesses that cater to tourists did unusually well in 
January and February, and we expect the trend to continue," she said. 
"Generally, those months are quiet. They may have been helped this year by the 
earthquake and the riots. Whatever the reason, we're quite optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its recently refurbished pier, Ventura hopes to lure 
vacationers with such attractions as beachfront art shows, strolling 
troubadours and a sudden revival of coffeehouses. "We've had 10 to 15 new 
coffeehouses started in the past couple of years, and they all seem to be doing 
well. People enjoy taking time out and resting in them," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, too, expects an upsurge of visitors this summer. Carol Lavender, 
executive director of the city's tourism bureau, says she expects solid results 
from cable TV and newspaper ads being placed in Los Angeles and the Antelope 
Valley. "We drew 85,000 people to our Strawberry Festival a couple of weeks 
ago," she noted. "That's a record, and we expect the trend to continue. People 
are more interested in going places than they've been in several years." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lavender says Oxnard has no illusions about attracting long-term 
vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concentrating on people who live within a three-hour drive," she said. 
"We'll be happy if they stay a day, but we'll be especially happy if they're 
with us several days and nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard will help launch its official summer season with a jazz and blues 
festival July 8 to 10. Numerous other events are planned at Channel Islands 
Harbor and other locations.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 13 FAMILIES CAMP OUT TO BUY NEW HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nearly forgotten real estate ritual -- the home buyers' camp-out -- has 
resurfaced briefly in Ventura County. Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. says 13 
families pitched tents the night before the opening of the firm's California 
Landings project in east Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a phenomenon we haven't seen since 1988," Kaufman & Broad spokesman Greg 
Romano said. "Apparently, people decided the houses were well-priced for the 
market, and they were willing to stay up all night to make sure they got one." 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening weekend late last month, Kaufman & Broad sold 17 of the tract's 
31 houses, Romano said. He added that the developer didn't even build a model 
of the two-story homes, priced in the low $200,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six of the houses have been sold, Romano reported.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SURVEY FORECASTS BETTER JOB MARKET IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's job market will stabilize in the third quarter, according to 
a survey of major employers by Manpower Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the companies responding to the survey -- 73% -- said 
they expect no change in the size of their payrolls in the three months 
starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining companies, 9% plan increased hiring, 6% expect layoffs and 
12% are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest findings represent a net improvement over job prospects three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, 17% of the companies expected to increase hiring in the second 
quarter while 27% expected layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the county's employment outlook lags behind that of California and 
the nation. Statewide, 23% of large companies predict increased work forces and 
10% expect layoffs. In the nation, 29% plan increased hiring while 7% expect 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's jobless rate in April was 7.4%, compared with 9.1% statewide.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; KENNY G CASTS A 'SILHOUETTE' ON CF GUILD GALA 
</P>

 It was the next best thing to having Kenny G perform live in your living room; 
the saxophone player with the long curly hair gave an intimate concert for 
guests at the Cystic Fibrosis Guild of Orange County's 11th annual gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling among the tables in the grand ballroom of the Disneyland Hotel in 
Anaheim, Kenny G serenaded the crowd of 500 with his saxophone like a 
modern-day Pied Piper.  
</P>
<P>
 The $250-per-person benefit netted about $275,000 for the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation. Low-Key Performance 
</P>
<P>
 With little fanfare, Kenny G began his performance by simply walking out from 
the back of the ballroom and strolling up to the stage while playing his 
signature song "Silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making up arrangements as we go along," he later joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a backdrop of electronic fireworks (leave it to Disney), Kenny G formed 
"Songbird," "Sentimental" and "Forever in Love."  
</P>
<P>
 He closed the concert by slowly circling the entire ballroom while blowing his 
horn -- making sure all guests got a close-up view. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing Kenny G was a coup for the guild. The sax player had participated in 
an American Airlines celebrity ski weekend for the national Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation in 1992, where he auctioned himself to play in someone's home.  
</P>
<P>
 Gala chairwoman Sue Hook and her husband Dave ponied up the $25,000 for his 
performance, then asked if he and Michael Bolton (who had also auctioned off 
his services) would play at the guild gala. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this woman was just having a party at her home," Kenny G said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year he volunteered to perform at the gala again. At a champagne 
reception held before the concert, he explained why he supports the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of fell into doing this. I didn't know anybody who had cystic 
fibrosis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was invited to the foundation's ski weekend: "The people were so nice; 
I never met people like that before," he said. "I wanted to be part of this 
group." G Is for Great 
</P>
<P>
 "My last name is Gorelick," he said. Asked why he dropped his full name, he 
quipped, "It's obvious, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Kenny G fans, it was a night to remember: "He's the most humble, 
thoughtful person; we're in awe over how wonderful he is," said Karen Hall, 
event co-chairwoman. "His involvement with (the foundation) is so special. It's 
created a whole new forum of interest in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests enjoyed the concert at tables draped in white and gold striped cloth 
with white and gold floral centerpieces. For dinner, they were served a "Kenny 
G soup" (cream of artichoke en croute with a "G" inscribed on the crust), beef 
filet and sea bass stuffed with spinach and for dessert a caramelized apple in 
a puff pastry shell or a chocolate tulip filled with fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the gala will go to researching a cure for cystic fibrosis, the 
most common fatal genetic disease in the United States that affects 30,000 
infants, children and young adults. In cystic fibrosis, a thick mucous clogs 
the lungs, causing breathing difficulties, repeated infection, lung damage and 
eventual suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Intiso, president of Falcon Cable TV, was presented with the guild's 
Breath of Life award for raising $1 million for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many guests had personal reasons for supporting the foundation: "We had two 
sons who died of leukemia. What they went through was very similar to what CF 
kids have gone through," said Ralph Mann, a gala sponsor. He and wife Eva have 
attended the galas for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have one heck of a party when they find a cure," Eva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were: Dean Gerrie, event co-chairman; Frank and Betty 
Arciero, Allen and Barbara Balik, Robert Bein, David and Leann Benvenuti, 
Michael and Jacquie Casey, Steve and Gere Gastineau, Bob and Charlene Goetz, 
Barry and Jan Grumman, Barry and Pati Gump, Brian and Gloria Hale, Marion and 
Lula Halfacre, Debbie Hartunian, Helen Johnson, Dick and Sue Ellen Knieper, 
Bill and Jackie Lilly, Heidi Miller, Bob and Nancy Myers, Barry and Myra Ross, 
Michael Rudencia, Rene and Anna Vega and Kevin and Sophia Woodbridge. KATHRYN

GALLANTRY FROM OMAHA BEACH TO QUANG TRI; HONORS: AMERICA'S FALLEN HEROES ARE 
SALUTED IN MEMORIAL DAY SERVICES AT EL TORO MEMORIAL PARK. VETERANS, MOTHERS, A 
BROTHER ATTEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 America's heroes who fell during the D-day invasion 50 years ago received 
special recognition at Memorial Day ceremonies at El Toro Memorial Park, where 
about 200 people gathered to honor the nation's war dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Held under a warm, muggy sky, the hourlong ceremony honored all veterans who 
died fighting in the nation's wars. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the living and deceased veterans of World War II -- described as "Our 
sons, pride of our nation" by wartime President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- were 
singled out for praise and thanks as the nation commemorates the 50th 
anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen aging warriors, many wearing caps from local Veterans of Foreign 
Wars posts, honored their fallen comrades, whose young faces have never faded 
from memory. The bonding between the living and the dead remains as strong 
today as half a century ago, when they went into harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's ceremony had a special significance for Norbert Blaskowski, 73, of 
Lake Forest. Blaskowski, a Pennsylvania native and D-day survivor, said this 
was the first Memorial Day ceremony he has attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I had to do. My younger brother was killed in Bavaria in 
1945, five days before the war ended," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaskowski, who was 23 at the time, went ashore unscathed at Normandy with the 
4th Infantry Division. The division landed at Utah Beach, where German 
resistance, while stiff, was not as fierce as that faced by the 1st Infantry 
Division at Omaha Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blaskowski's luck ran out on July 27, 1944, when U.S. troops who had 
battled inland from the beaches broke through at the French town of St. Lo and 
begin chasing the retreating Germans across Europe. On that day, Blaskowski was 
seriously wounded in a mine explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months later, Blaskowski said, while he was in England recovering from his 
wounds, he received a telegram telling him that his younger brother had been 
killed in action while fighting with the 3rd Infantry Division. Less than a 
week later, Germany surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother is buried in Europe, and I can't be there. But today is special, 
and I feel like I am honoring him. It's a good feeling knowing that some people 
still appreciate what we did 50 years ago," Blaskowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in attendance shed quiet tears during the ceremony as speakers 
offered words of praise for the servicemen and women who died while in uniform. 
One elderly woman stood alone at the back, tears streaming down her cheeks, 
when one speaker mentioned those who died in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two Gold Star mothers in attendance lost sons in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Horner's son, Carl Nicholas M. Horner, was a paratrooper with the 101st 
Airborne Division. He died Sept. 7, 1968, about a month before his 21st 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Franks, who helped arrange the Memorial Day ceremony, lost her son, 
Barry Richard Franks, on Jan. 17, 1969. Franks, a Marine, was 22 when he died 
in Quang Tri Province. Janet Franks said her son, who volunteered for duty in 
Vietnam, was in his final day there when the helicopter he was in crashed while 
flying him and other Marines to Danang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go through a few tears and sadness," said Janet Franks. "But I also have a 
great deal of pride. In one of his last letters, Barry talked about how proud 
he was doing what he believed in. That's a good feeling for a mother to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Franks opened Monday's ceremony by telling the audience that when a 
soldier falls in battle, a part of his mother's soul also dies with him. "When 
a soldier dies, he does not die alone," she said.

RIVALS HURL CRITICISM AT REP. JAY KIM; PRIMARY: BUT CROWDED FIELD OF GOP 
CANDIDATES IN THE 41ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT MAY WORK IN FAVOR OF THE 
INCUMBENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the June 7 primary approaches for Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), election 
rivals have wasted no time unleashing an avalanche of criticism at him prompted 
by evidence of federal election code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "BETRAYED" is emblazoned in red on a black cover of a recent mailer from 
candidate Valerie Romero. The inside features a photo of the congressman with 
"FBI target" superimposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay Kim is being investigated by the FBI, the Federal Election Commission and 
the IRS. . . . Jay Kim has betrayed our trust and lost our respect," declares 
the mailer, which also included a collage of newspaper articles detailing the 
congressman's legal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the charges and the negative campaigning, it is unclear if the 
investigation will cost Kim his seat. His primary challengers are not political 
heavyweights; none has held public office before. In addition, they are likely 
to split the anti-Kim vote, leaving a large opening for the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowded nature of the field, all of them smelling blood here, probably 
means none of them will get to taste it," said Alan Heslop, professor of 
government at Claremont-McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, issues such as violent crime, jobs and health care are playing 
second fiddle in the 41st Congressional District, which includes parts of Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. The central issue is Kim's 
financial campaign dealings, raised by Romero and, to a lesser extent, the 
other three GOP challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the two contenders in the Democratic primary, urban redeveloper Ed 
Tessier and attorney Richard L. Waldron, are leaving the issue of integrity to 
the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Kim became the target of a federal probe into possible election, 
tax and labor law violations after The Times reported that he secretly used 
about $480,000 from his engineering corporation to finance his 1992 federal 
campaign. Despite a prohibition on corporate contributions to federal 
campaigns, JayKim Engineers Inc. provided Kim's campaign with free rent, staff 
and office supplies, according to internal company records and checks signed by 
Kim that were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, Kim went on the offensive earlier this week, sending out a mailer 
that attacked the 30-year-old Romero as a political nobody who is relying on 
the wealth and reputation of her auto dealer father to win election.  
</P>
<P>
 "Her short life has not produced any marks of achievement," the mailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's mailer, which uses the theme "lies, lies, lies," also said Romero 
distorted the accusations against Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said she stands by her statements on Kim's legal problems and 
acknowledged her father's importance to her campaign while maintaining she 
would be a good congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very clear about who I am," Romero said. "I'm a 30-year-old and I 
work in a family business." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, meanwhile, has been shunning public forums, running a low-key campaign 
and attempting to divert attention from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Kim has been seen campaigning at a Republican women's club in 
Yorba Linda, at GOP-sponsored receptions and at two fund-raisers held on his 
behalf in Diamond Bar and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 In his only recent media interview on the investigation, Kim told the Daily 
Bulletin of Ontario that, at most, he is guilty only of a technical violation. 
He declined an interview request from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation hovering over Kim, the first Korean American ever elected to 
Congress, has not hurt his fund-raising ability.  
</P>
<P>
 He reported raising $224,260 -- almost four times as much as his nearest 
challenger -- for his reelection campaign, according to the latest finance 
statement, filed last week in Washington. That total includes a $23,000 
personal loan Kim made to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Korean Americans and other Asian-surnamed donors contributed all but 
about $28,000 of that amount. And the vast majority of donations came from out 
of state, from as far away as New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has pretty strong support," said Newport Beach developer William Buck 
Johns, a Kim campaign contributor and fund-raiser. The investigation is "much 
ado about nothing" as it relates to the race, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, meanwhile, has gone into debt to fund her campaign, making personal 
loans to her campaign totaling $70,000. According to the latest finance 
statement, Romero has raised $61,343 for her congressional bid, and has spent 
$108,715. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of her campaign contributions came from the automobile 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kim focusing on issues such as health care and illegal immigration, 
supporters believe he will suffer little damage from the ongoing probe and 
emerge victorious in the primary and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents see it otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very upset with Washington and the corruption that seems to be 
associated with many of our elected officials," said Angela Bay Buchanan, 
former GOP candidate for state treasurer and sister of former presidential 
candidate Pat Buchanan. She is supporting Bob Kerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero also called attention to the probe during a recent candidates forum 
before the Orange County Republican Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Republican seat is in jeopardy if Jay Kim wins the primary," said Romero. 
"The Democrats have targeted our district. We cannot afford to let this 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her fund-raising ability, Romero is considered the strongest of the 
challengers. But as a political neophyte in her first campaign, she is still 
studying some of the key issues in the district. Asked her opinion of air 
pollution regulations and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which regulates stationary sources of pollution in the area, Romero responded, 
"I'm still looking into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero also acknowledged that she has voted in only two of the last seven 
elections, saying, "There's no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other three challengers, Kerns, 38, who owns an oil field development 
company, ran for Congress in 1986, losing to Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City). 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, Kerns has been more foot soldier than general. He has 
worked for various conservative candidates including Pat Buchanan, who tried to 
defeat George Bush in the 1992 Republican presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Thaker, 36, a lawyer who once served as director of intergovernmental 
affairs for then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, was a candidate in the state Senate 
primary in 1992 but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a liability; he lives in Orange, outside the 41st District. Thaker said 
he plans to move into the district after the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald L. Curtis, 48, of Upland, also running for office for the first time, 
is a straight-talking mining company executive and Vietnam veteran who has no 
difficulty mentioning his more than 70 "confirmed kills" during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis says Kim "sold his vote" and betrayed the American worker by voting in 
favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the barbs have not prevented support for Kim, some of it coming from 
congressional colleagues and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Kim campaign mailer listed 26 statements of endorsement, including 12 
by congressmen from across the country and two from mayors of cities in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the endorsements came from Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach), the state 
congressional delegation's representative to the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay has been working very hard in Congress and deserves to be judged on his 
accomplishments here," Cox said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But some prominent Republican activists have signed on with the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James V. Lacy and ex-Assemblyman Charles Bader, who both lost to Kim 
in the 1992 Republican primary, have endorsed Romero. Together, Lacy and Bader 
received more than 55% of the vote compared to Kim's 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kim survives the primary and his legal troubles do not worsen, he is given 
a good chance of winning reelection in November. Republicans make up 48% of the 
voters in the district compared to 40% for Democrats.

MISSING GIRL, 11, CALLS PARENTS FROM MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of a missing 11-year-old girl on Monday got the telephone call they 
were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Flores, who was reportedly abducted by a family friend, called her 
parents collect from Mexico at 11:30 a.m. to say that she was safe and on her 
way home, police and parents said. She told them she did not know where she was 
in Mexico, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica told her mother, Rosario Ortega, that she was alone and needed her 
parents to raise $300 to pay someone to take her back to Garden Grove, Ortega 
said. Her daughter sounded scared on the telephone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she was coming home, but she did not say when she was coming," said 
Ortega, 30. "She also did not say who was bringing her."  
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Monica was abducted at 2:30 p.m. Friday while walking 
home with classmates from Cook Elementary School on Woodbury Avenue. Police 
said the sixth-grade student was reportedly taken by Valentin Gonzalez, 22, who 
lived with Monica's family as a boarder for two years before moving out last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the family got a telephone call from Gonzalez's sister, Ortega 
said. According to Ortega, the woman, who also lives in Garden Grove, said 
Gonzalez had called her from Tijuana and said he had taken the girl there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega said that Gonzalez apparently had given several letters to Monica 
telling her that he was in love with her and that he was going to take her to 
Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 Monica's stepfather, Pedro Gonzalez, who is not related to Valentin Gonzalez, 
said he found the letters about two or three months ago. "She had come home 
from school and left her books on the table" that day, Pedro Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a typical parent, I was curious about what she was reading and leafed 
through them. I found two or three letters and read them." 
</P>
<P>
 The letters were written in Spanish and addressed to Monica, her stepfather 
said. Monica barely reads Spanish because she only completed two years of 
school in Mexico before coming to California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pedro Gonzalez found the letters, he said, Ortega confronted Valentin 
Gonzalez about them. The young man replied that he wrote Monica's name on them 
on a whim, and that they were not meant for her, Pedro Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica began to cry when her parents asked her about the letters, Ortega said, 
and she denied that she was involved with Valentin Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents said they are unsure about the relationship between their daughter 
and their former boarder. They said they were busy Monday trying to raise money 
from friends to bring their daughter home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to expect," Ortega said. "I expect the worst. I don't know 
what happened to her. . . . I don't know if she's been abandoned, we can't do 
anything because we don't know where she is, and I don't know who we're 
supposed to give the money to."

ONLY THE BEGINNING; HEAD START PROGRAM'S EXPANSION LAUDED, BUT COSTS A CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Leaders of Orange County's Head Start program for low-income preschool 
children, already so overbooked that they placed more than 1,500 needy children 
on a waiting list this year, now wonder how they will cope with a federally 
mandated expansion of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, on the 29th anniversary of the federally funded anti-poverty 
program, President Clinton signed a bill designed to extend Head Start services 
to children under 3 years old and to pregnant women. Previously, only 3- and 
4-year-olds whose families met certain income guidelines were eligible to 
enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, federal officials want to expand the scope of the preschool program, 
which has received nationwide praise for its achievements. Although details are 
still being worked out, Head Start will eventually be required to teach 
parenting skills to pregnant women and provide day care for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is being expanded because research shows that the sooner some 
families receive assistance, the greater the chance that they will lead 
healthy, productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials applaud the expansion of the program but are not optimistic 
that they will receive the federal funds required for such a major undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree it's wonderful to get to the family early on," said Ana Jacquette, 
deputy director of Orange County Head Start. "But we can barely serve the 
4-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, 730,000 children were enrolled in Head Start programs in 1994. In 
1995, $4 billion will be spent on Head Start, enabling another 100,000 children 
to benefit from the program. About 3% of the $700-million increase over last 
year's budget is expected to go to pregnant women and children under 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Start gives children from poor families a leg up by helping prepare them 
for kindergarten. The program includes everything from making sure the children 
eat two square meals a day -- the only food that some of them may get -- to 
teaching them social skills. They are also given medical checkups, to make sure 
that they are healthy and to detect signs of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of the children were born to mothers who used drugs, are 
victims of child abuse or come from broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Head Start officials say it is too soon to tell exactly how the 
new federal law will affect local programs, because they have not yet received 
the official guidelines. Many applaud the principles embodied in the new law, 
but simultaneously express concern over how they will be able to serve more 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In a reflection of the poor economy of recent years, Orange County's Head 
Start program has grown by leaps and bounds. Today, Head Start serves 3,263 
children -- double the number enrolled five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, officials plan to make room for another 260 children and will 
experiment with operating a full-day program and an evening program. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the 1993-1994 school year, one of every four children who applied 
for admission to the county's 40 Head Start programs was put on the waiting 
list, Orange County Head Start officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be eligible for Head Start, children must turn 4 by Dec. 2 in that 
school term. Total income for a family of four must not exceed $1,233 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies have shown that children who go through Head Start perform 
better in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents like Alfonso Rossano have noticed dramatic improvements in their 
children's behavior. Rossano's 5-year-old foster child, Malia Simonisi, attends 
the Head Start School on Grand Avenue in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter needed a lot of help because she was a coke baby," said Rossano, 
59, who has three adult children in their 20s and has cared for Malia since she 
was 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a very short attention span, so she needed a lot of individual help," 
he said of Malia. "Before, it was, 'me, me, me,' but now she's become a lot 
more sociable," Rossano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossano spent a recent morning volunteering at his daughter's Head Start 
school. Seated at a pint-sized wooden table, he supervised the children as they 
busily chopped tomatoes, onions and cilantro with plastic knives in a weekly 
cooking class designed to help them learn about nutrition and improve their 
motor skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their painstaking efforts were later transformed into guacamole for that day's 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Head Start School on Grand Avenue, one of the oldest of the Orange County 
programs, is run by the Council of Affiliated Negro Organizations. The program 
served 276 children this year, with another 48 on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is seeking $198,000 in funds from Orange County Head Start in 
order to accommodate another 68 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Alta Manning, who has worked with Head Start for nearly 30 
years, remembers the early days when it was all but impossible to find 
affordable space for Head Start programs and officials depended on the good 
graces of neighborhood churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But today there are more disturbing problems, like the host of social ills 
that are reflected in the backgrounds of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot of foster parents, grandparents and child abuse," said 
Manning, 59, who is raising a grandson herself. "It's been increasing with the 
economy the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Those troubles seem all but forgotten in a classroom where a group of children 
danced uninhibitedly, following their teacher's energetic lead. Betty Collins, 
a 62-year-old grandmother, stood at the center of the group. Like Rossano, 
Collins volunteers once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired special education therapist raises her granddaughter, born to 
Collins' daughter during a stay in state prison. Collins has raised the child 
since she was 2 days old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Head Start really helps them socially and makes them feel good about 
themselves," Collins said. "And that's the most important thing." Who's 
Eligible 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 40 Head Start programs serve 4-year-olds from low-income 
families. An overview of whom the programs try to serve: 
</P>
<P>
 * Enrollment: Currently, 3,263 children countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eligibility: 4-year-olds whose parents meet federal income guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Waiting list: In the 1993-94 school year, 1,571 children were waiting for 
spaces in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion: Funding for 260 more children is expected in the 1994-95 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funding: Orange County spent $18 million in the 1993-94 school year on Head 
Start programs.

SCOTT HARRIS: POLITICS AND POTPIES: DINER MAKES TRACKS; THIS ANTELOPE VALLEY 
EATERY IS KNOWN FOR GENEROUS SERVINGS AND A CURIOUS AMBIENCE, ESPECIALLY THE 
CHRONIC TREMORS OF PASSING FREIGHT TRAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing you notice is the giant sign perched on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "EAT," it commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Crazy Otto's Diner is that kind of place. Tucked between Sierra Highway and 
the Southern Pacific railroad tracks, this Antelope Valley eatery is known for 
generous servings and a curious ambience, especially the chronic tremors of 
passing freight trains. Three came by at lunch the other day. The biggest, I'd 
say, felt like a 3.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Crazy Otto's has worked hard to be a local legend. It has, for example, sued a 
competitor for allegedly stealing recipes for hash browns and chili. Like any 
landmark, it sells its own postcards. The souvenir commemorates the historic 
date of June 12, 1993, when Crazy Otto's cooked up a 19,000-egg omelet, which 
the Guinness people certified as "the world's largest." Such records are 
difficult to confirm. But at 1,364 square feet, this entree should have 
included at least two bedrooms and a bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Now another rendezvous with destiny is approaching. On June 14 -- that's 
right, just two days after the Omelet Anniversary -- this diner will serve up 
its last supper al freight. Crazy Otto's is being forced out, an unlikely 
casualty of the political aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't shed tears for Crazy Otto's. A victim it isn't. To hear proprietor 
Scott Tranter, Crazy Otto's isn't just fighting the good fight. It's winning. 
Come June 17, it will move two miles west, taking over the building on the 20th 
Street West site now occupied by Dilligafs, another diner owned by Tranter. 
Alas, there is no railroad next door. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tranter's telling, Crazy Otto's is the hero in a potboiler that involves 
the Southern Pacific, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and Lancaster 
City Hall. The struggle to save Crazy Otto's turned Tranter into a political 
propagandist. He isn't so bold as to claim that the Crazy Otto's controversy 
cost Mayor Arnie Rodio his reelection. But Rodio's defeat, he adds, "didn't 
really break my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complicated tale. Understand, first, that when Tranter and his 
father-in-law, Donald Whitbeck, purchased Crazy Otto's in 1989, they bought a 
business located on Southern Pacific land. Three years later, when Southern 
Pacific sold part of the adjoining right-of-way to the MTA for the ultimate 
extension of Metrolink, officials assured Tranter that the commuter rail 
wouldn't reach that far "until after the turn of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Jan. 17, that all changed. Broken freeways created an urgent demand for 
rail service between the Antelope Valley and the area known in these parts as 
"down below." An interim rail service was initiated and MTA officials, eyeing 
an unexpected bonanza of federal disaster money, gave Crazy Otto's and 
neighboring businesses 90 days to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, of course, requires Metrolink to compensate the business owners at 
fair market value -- but value, of course, fluctuates with the economy. 
Metrolink's first offer for Crazy Otto's was about half the purchase price in 
1989 -- and $90,000 less than money still owed. That's when the worries really 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did it help that City Hall didn't seem to care. When it looked as though 
Metrolink would be satisfied if Crazy Otto's simply remodeled its backside, 
Tranter says, City Hall refused to issue building permits. His suspicion is 
that city officials wanted them out to make way for the planned widening of 
Sierra Highway -- and they were happy to have Metrolink foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that war was declared. "SAVE CRAZY OTTO'S DINER," the flyer 
proclaimed. First it tugs at the heartstrings, suggesting that many longtime 
employees, "the same people you have come to know and love," would lose their 
jobs. Then it goes for the political jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought a business. In the name of progress, Metrolink is kicking us out 
and buying the building. There is no compensation for loss of business goodwill 
and no consideration for employee severance. With a large mortgage that must be 
paid off first, we may not be left with any funds to use for rebuilding or 
relocation. The Lancaster City Council has not even bothered to communicate 
with us. They have offered no support or assistance of any kind. Costco was 
offered a new building and money to move. PetsMart was offered $180,000 and 
free rent. And the saga continues. We've all heard the horror stories. Now 
Crazy Otto's. . . has been sentenced to death with no reprieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes a sales pitch -- an appeal for customers to help out in the crisis 
by purchasing gift certificates that could be redeemed at the new Crazy Otto's 
location, or would be refunded "if, for some reason, we are prevented from 
reopening." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers of Lancaster politics may admire the way Crazy Otto's made no 
mention of Mayor Rodio, yet scored a direct hit on the man who had become a 
lightning rod of complaints over redevelopment policies. Truth is, Crazy Otto's 
was miffed that he ignored the world's largest omelet. If Gov. Wilson and the 
Palmdale mayor were impressed enough to send letters and issue proclamations, 
why not Lancaster's very own mayor? 
</P>
<P>
 Since that first flyer appeared, much has changed, all to the benefit of Crazy 
Otto's. The MTA has come up with an offer that would enable Crazy Otto's to pay 
off its mortgage and cover its move. Meanwhile, hundreds of customers have 
rallied to the cause, buying more than $7,000 worth of gift certificates. 
(Mayor Rodio, it seems, offered some sweet talk, but Tranter would have none of 
it.) 
</P>
<P>
 The only people who may lose jobs, Tranter says, are the part-timers who staff 
Dilligafs. Judging by Tranter's smile, the crisis has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that I'm not so sure. How can the new joint duplicate the original? 
</P>
<P>
 If you happen to be at the new Crazy Otto's and the place starts to shake, 
don't forget to duck for cover.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY WON'T CHANGE BUILDING HEIGHTS CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City residents who live on the bluff overlooking the ocean can rest easier 
knowing that their view cannot be obstructed by taller buildings sprouting up 
along Mariners Mile, a stretch of West Coast Highway that extends from Newport 
Boulevard to Dover Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders decided last week that the city's law limiting building heights 
to 26 feet will remain unchanged, as residents had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy reached its zenith three weeks ago, when 175 people packed 
City Hall to express disapproval when the City Council considered a change in 
the law setting building height limits in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariners Mile business owners were seeking the change, which could have paved 
the way to seeking city permits to exceed the height limit, according to city 
officials. But the owners have since backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much dust that filled the air that (Mariners Mile) property 
owners want to step back and let things cool down for a while," said Steven 
Sutherland, co-chairman of the Mariners Mile Assn. "This was not worth fighting 
with our neighbors over." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who spoke passionately before city leaders were clearly happy with 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We achieved a major victory," said Arthur De La Loza Jr., a resident of the 
Newport Heights neighborhood and a deputy city attorney in Huntington Beach. 
"The homeowners let the merchants know that we were willing to go to the mat on 
those issues that affect views." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a basic 26-foot building height limit on properties along the inland 
side of Mariners Mile. However, commercial property owners can build to 35 feet 
if they get permission from the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 To get that approval, the developers must prove during a public hearing that 
residential views would not be blocked by the additional height. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate the issue, property owners along that stretch of highway must 
set aside a 12-foot strip between the front edge of their land and the edge of 
West Coast Highway, in anticipation of some future plans to widen the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners complain they can't realize the full value of their land 
because development is boxed in by the land and height restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city at some future date will consider a resolution that may relax parking 
and landscaping requirements along Mariners Mile to compensate for the loss of 
12 feet of land. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; $40 LOW-FLUSH TOILET OFFERED BY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because every flush wastes water, county residents may trade in their 
inefficient toilets for a subsidized low-flush toilet, which only use 1.6 
gallons to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The toilets -- valued at $100 -- come with seat, bolts and installation 
instructions and are being offered by the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 All a person needs is a wrench or pliers and about 40 minutes to install the 
new toilet, according to Joe Berg, conservation coordinator for the water 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district offers simple, American-made toilets for $40, Berg said, or will 
give people a $50 rebate to buy their own toilet from an approved list of 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's toilets are white, so people who want color toilets need to buy 
them through a supplier, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and June 11, residents who live in single-family homes may buy up 
to three low-flush toilets to replace their old five- to seven-gallon clunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each low-flush toilet can save 10,000 gallons of water per year, said Berg. 
That is a 25% savings in the typical water bill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If people also use the low-flush shower heads the district is giving away, 
they could save $40 yearly off their water bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program started, more than 1,400 district toilets have been 
distributed, and more than 800 people have bought toilets off the approved 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of the programs are a lot more popular than we really anticipated," Berg 
said. "So we're really happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said the programs could save more than a billion gallons of water in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The municipal water district is a wholesale supplier to 26 water districts in 
the county, supplying about 70% of the county's water needs, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said his staff has seen some porcelain relics during the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have run into some 11-gallon toilets, but they are few and far between," 
Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those behemoths appear to date from the 1920s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reserve a low-flush toilet, call (800) 676-4853. 
</P>
<P>
 The toilets will be distributed in Laguna Niguel on Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday and in Buena Park on June 9, 10 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 People who want a rebate on a low-flush toilet of their choice should call 
(800) 378-8587. 
</P>
<P>
 Both options are on a first-come, first-served basis, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district will crush old toilets to make a porcelain base for road 
construction. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FREEWAY OVERPASS BEING STRENGTHENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers are strengthening an overpass of the Costa Mesa Freeway to protect 
against earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.9-million project should be completed in August, California Department 
of Transportation spokesman Albert Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting is being done to the bridge that connects the southbound lane of 
the Costa Mesa Freeway to the southbound San Diego Freeway, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 General Construction Co. of Irvine began work in January to increase the size 
of the foundations of the concrete columns that support the overpass, he added. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Welders were working last week to encase the columns in 3/8-inch-thick steel, 
he said, and will add cable restrainers to strengthen the connection between 
the columns and the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans decided to do the work after studying the damage caused to freeways 
and bridges by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overpass was not damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is still studying the effects of the Northridge quake, and it is too 
soon to know if additional changes will be recommended for the Costa Mesa 
overpass and other overpasses and bridges throughout the state, Miranda said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ETHICAL CODE URGED FOR CITY EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has directed officials to develop a code of ethics for city 
employees and to draft a statement that encourages workers to report waste and 
mismanagement at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith suggested the code because "the citizens of the city 
should look to city government for leadership in this area," he said."I want to 
make sure people have confidence that we are serving them in an ethical 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what the code will contain remains unclear. City Manager Paul O. Brady 
Jr. drafted a code of ethics four years ago, but the council failed to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
 The current City Council received a copy of Brady's code last week and is 
scheduled to discuss it at a future meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said his document covers about a dozen areas. It urges city workers to 
find the most economical ways to provide services, to uphold the U.S. 
Constitution and to treat fellow employees with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The code also suggests that workers not make promises or engage in side 
business dealings that compromise their integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he would like the code to require that the City Council be informed 
whenever city employees do side jobs or have financial dealings with the city 
beyond their regular salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you deal with employee relationships on a different level, there can 
be the appearance of impropriety even when everything is done to the letter of 
the law," Smith said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; WATER DISTRICT MAY RAISE ITS RATES BY 
6% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners served by the Capistrano Valley Water District may soon have to pay 
nearly $2 more a month for their water. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district's board of directors will consider a proposed 6% rate 
increase during a public hearing scheduled for 6 p.m. June 7 in the City 
Council chambers, 32400 Paseo Adelanto. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed rate hike is approved, the average household water bill will 
increase from $28.25 a month to $30 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they are proposing the new rate because the agency will 
soon begin paying 7% more for the water it receives from the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district's electricity bill for pumping water has increased 
by about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 7 hearing has been scheduled to consider the rate hike and the 
district's 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the district's Water Advisory Commission recommended adoption of the 
proposed budget and water rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's rate has increased steadily over the past three years. Last 
July, the district board approved a 12% rate hike.ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; HIGH SCHOOL WINS TECHNOLOGY GRANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley High School has won a $63,000 technology grant from the state 
Department of Education. The money will be used to buy new equipment, such as 
computers, and for teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
 The project that won the award involves making "changes in our curriculum and 
the way we deliver instruction to students," Assistant Principal Carol Osbrink 
said. She said that a specific goal will be to link the teaching of English and 
social studies using computers and other technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Osbrink said a common teaching theme would be selected for the two classes. 
"An example might be the theme of ethics," she said. "We'd make a thematic 
instruction project out of ethics, and students in English classes would read 
literature on the subject while students in social studies would research 
historical cases involving ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Computers and laser disks would enable both students and teachers to gather 
vast amounts of information on theme subjects, Osbrink said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching this will not only make connections between two subjects but also 
connect to real things students can relate to and understand," Osbrink said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hagen, superintendent of the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District, which includes Fountain Valley High, praised Principal Gary Ernst and 
Fountain Valley High for winning the grant. "It is very significant because 
competition is intense for these grants," Hagen said.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RESIDENTS' OPPOSITION STALLS PARK PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the edge of Edison Park, the thick green grass suddenly gives way to a 
patch of dug-up earth roped off on all sides by bright yellow construction 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The land was supposed to be home to a "beach" volleyball court complete with a 
sandy surface. Instead, the court remains unfinished, a testament to a 
neighborhood divided over what to do with its only park. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live next to the park fear that the volleyball court will 
attract loud players who will disrupt the area's peaceful atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 They took their case to the City Council earlier this month, presenting bags 
full of softballs, baseballs, Frisbees, golf balls and other objects they said 
had come flying from the park into their back yards over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But others in the College Park West area -- especially younger couples with 
children -- said they have a right to use the park and make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from both sides, the council sent the issue back to the parks 
commission for new hearings. The council is expected to make a final decision 
on the park plan in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began innocently enough last year when a group of College Park 
West residents got together to discuss ways of upgrading the 30-year-old park. 
</P>
<P>
 The group quickly discovered that the cash-strapped city had no money to pay 
for improvements. So they began holding a series of fund-raisers that netted 
about $8,000 -- enough to build the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when problems began. The court construction got the attention of 
residents whose homes back up against the park. And they didn't like what they 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Robert Reince complained that the park's basketball court already 
attracts loud players whose shouts can be heard from his cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained that police rarely patrol the park and that people hop over 
the fence and use the field when the park is supposed to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a volleyball court would only exacerbate the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said that they no longer use their back yards for fear that 
they'll be hit by flying balls and other objects from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complained about a lack of lighting, which they said makes the park 
an easy hiding place for burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the volleyball court said they sympathize with the residents' 
concerns about crime and flying balls. But they insisted that the improvements 
will not worsen the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree with a lot of their complaints," said David Sloan, 32, who headed 
the park improvement committee. "When we started to do this, we wanted to do a 
lot of things like adding lights. But there is no money anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan, who grew up in College Park West, disagrees with residents who said the 
park is noisier today than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This neighborhood used to be full of kids," said Sloan. "For the last five or 
10 years, it has kind of laid dormant because there haven't been as many 
families here. But now a new generation of people is moving in. And the noise 
is picking up a little." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCILWOMAN LOSES RECONSTRUCTION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled against Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser and her 
husband, Douglas, in a lawsuit they filed against the city concerning 
reconstruction of their Olinda Village home. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard said he ruled in 
favor of the city because the Wisers "failed to exhaust administrative remedies 
before filing a lawsuit" regarding their problems with obtaining a building 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisers had claimed the city refused to allow them to reconstruct their 
Olinda Village home after initially receiving approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Millard, however, said the Wisers should have appealed to the City Council 
about the city staff's decision to revoke their building permit before filing 
their lawsuit in 1990. He said that the city acted responsibly regarding the 
Wisers' permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they plan to appeal Millard's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were happy with Millard's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawsuit wasn't justified," Assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell said. 
"Unfortunately, the city's charged with the public trust and we have to defend 
ourselves against lawsuits. . . . We were pleased to see that our plan check 
and inspection processes were validated as appropriate and reasonable by the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city spent about $100,000 on its defense and would spend more if 
the Wisers appeal.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; EVICTED VFW POST SEEKING NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bar is closed, and the doors are locked at Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 
8954. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 30 years in the same building at Homewood Avenue and 8th 
Street, the local veterans' organization closed for good earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The VFW has been looking for another building for the last couple of years, 
but members cannot find an affordable place. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of parking at its current location -- smack in the middle 
of a neighborhood -- along with a past history of residents' complaints about 
noise and disturbances, the City Council ordered the VFW to move from the 
property by May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 VFW member Stan Delmore, who has been part of the post's relocation committee, 
said a new place was found in a La Habra shopping center at Imperial Highway 
and Euclid Street. But the post cannot afford to buy the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're without a home -- and without city backing," Delmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency has made an offer to buy the veterans' 
property for $50,000 and give them an additional $50,000 for relocation costs, 
plus up to $20,000 for asbestos removal from the building, said Russ Gordon, 
assistant planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said that if the city buys the property, plans are to build a 
single-family home and sell it to a low-income family. He said the use would be 
compatible with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Delmore said the veterans view the city's offer as unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they had the property appraised at $207,000, which included both the 
land and the Quonset-hut-like building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city says they don't care about the building. We care about the building, 
and we need to replace it," Delmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were depending on the city to be fair and honest. We have no money to move 
to the La Habra site," he said, adding that the group needs $100,000 as a down 
payment on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmore said that since the city closed down some of the post's operations 
about five years ago, the organization has lost much-need revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmore said there has been discussion of joining forces with the La Habra and 
Fullerton VFW posts and making one large post to serve North Orange County. But 
for the time being, Delmore said, the post will hold its meetings at the local 
Elks Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmore raised the possibility of a lawsuit. "If the city doesn't come to a 
fair resolution, we will take them to court," he said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; LOW-COST-HOUSING LAW OKD BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To create a framework for a new kind of affordable housing, the City Council 
has enacted a single-room-occupancy ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 SROs are a type of low-cost housing that was pioneered in San Diego County.The 
concept allows an apartment building-like structure consisting solely of 
single-room dwellings. Each single room contains a small kitchen and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city adopted this as part of its housing plan," said City Manager Darrell 
Essex. He said Cypress currently has no applicants who wish to build 
single-room dwellings, but he said the new ordinance prepares the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously gave final approval to the SRO ordinance at its May 23 
meeting. The ordinance becomes law in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Orange County cities, including Huntington Beach, have also 
passed zoning ordinances enabling the construction and use of single-room 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Cypress ordinance defines a single-room-occupancy development as "a 
group of guest units where each unit contains a minimum of 175 square feet and 
is limited to persons of low and very low income only." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance says that kitchens in the single-room dwellings "shall contain a 
sink with garbage disposal, counter top, refrigerator and stove or microwave 
oven." The ordinance says that bathrooms "shall contain a lavatory, toilet and 
shower or bathtub." 
</P>
<P>
 The new zoning law also stipulates an amount of open space for each SRO 
development. The ordinance requires a minimum of 400 square feet of "common 
open space" for SRO developments containing 30 or fewer units. 
</P>
<P>
 For projects with more than 30 units, the developer must provide an additional 
15 square feet of open space per unit. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL DISTRICT GETS EXTENSION ON PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District has received a 60-day extension to spend 
$5.8 million on a desperately needed school construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension rescues the district, which had missed a state deadline to spend 
the funds on converting offices into an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board, which set aside the money last year, granted the 
extension last week because the district was making a good-faith effort to 
complete the project, said Mike Vail, senior director of facilities for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will turn the former district headquarters at 1405 French St. into 
an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting the new deadline should be no problem, officials said. The school 
district board last week awarded a contract for the work, so the project is 
moving along as the state expects, Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay was due in large part to errors on behalf of two companies bidding 
on the project. They failed to submit a legally required affidavit stating they 
did not collude to fix prices, and even though they were the lowest bidders, 
the Board of Education could not consider their proposals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third bid came in at $254,000 more than was budgeted for the renovation, so 
the board requested the companies to bid for the project again. The delay 
caused the district to exceed the 180-day limit for spending the money, Vail 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, even though the delay jeopardized the project, it also resulted in 
major cost savings. Vail noted that the district awarded the building contract 
for $371,000 less than the lowest eligible bid in the original round of 
bidding.JON NALICK

SWEET SUCCESS AT AGE 89; EDUCATION: PEARL SWEET OF LEISURE WORLD, WHO AT 89 HAS 
LIVED A LOT OF HISTORY, COLLECTS HER MASTER'S DEGREE IN THE SUBJECT FROM CAL 
STATE LONG BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There hadn't been this much attention paid to Pearl Sweet for 70 years -- not 
since that fateful day in 1924 when she fell through the trapdoor next to the 
front cash register at the Wave Confectionery Shop and landed with a thud in 
the basement near the chocolate-dipping machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Here the 89-year-old was, decked out in a cap and gown, getting a master's 
degree in history from Cal State Long Beach last Thursday as a busload of 
relatives from all over the United States looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to steam out my gown and hood in the bathroom, but it didn't work," 
apologized Sweet, who lives at Leisure World in Seal Beach. "So I'm afraid 
they're wrinkled. But so am I." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet's college career has had more than its share of wrinkles, too. 
</P>
<P>
 She started it in the early 1920s at College (now University) of the Pacific 
in Stockton. But the 1924 tumble through the trapdoor cut it short. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall damaged her kidneys, knocked her gall bladder askew and caused other 
internal injuries that she says have dogged her ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the nicest stores in Stockton," she recalls. "They sold 
homemade candies they made in the basement. I slipped, grabbed a post and a 
metal chain and we all went to the basement concrete floors." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after the accident, Sweet raised two sons and watched them pursue 
college educations. But it wasn't until 1976 that she decided to resume her own 
studies. She finished her undergraduate work through a University of the 
Pacific extension program and immediately launched her master's degree studies 
at Cal State Long Beach when she learned that fees were waived for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 For her thesis, she decided to research the history of Methodist higher 
education in Northern California. She started writing it in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, she took courses from a dozen professors. Two of her graduate 
studies advisers died. Her last one, retired history professor Irv Ahlquist, 
spent a record 12 years on her thesis committee. He sat near the front at 
Thursday's commencement to watch her graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to see this day come. In many ways," Ahlquist said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Abrahamse, a former history department chairwoman who is Cal State Long 
Beach's acting vice president, praised Sweet's accomplishment: "She didn't do 
this for a career. She did it for intellectual satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 family members from as far as Florida came for the ceremony. 
Afterward, they tossed a combination celebration party and family reunion at 
Leisure World, where Sweet's three-room home and patio are filled with research 
materials for her 130-page thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if I die here nobody will have to worry about notifying my relatives. 
They're all here," Sweet joked to university administrator Shayne Schroeder as 
she waited for the ceremony to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sons Sanford, 64, and Van, 62, assisted their mother when it came time for her 
degree to be conferred by interim university President Karl Anatol. She beamed 
and waved to the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends and family are so relieved," she said. "Every year the alumni 
association kept sending me a letter welcoming me as a member, but my thesis 
wasn't finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is. And so is she. "I don't plan to go back to school again. Ever," she 
said. "This is enough."

POLICE SEEK LAGUNA BEACH MAN MISSING SINCE SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were searching Monday for a retired surgeon from Laguna Beach who has 
been missing since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. W. Basil Shardlow was last seen at 1:30 p.m. Saturday by a clerk at an 
Albertson's supermarket six blocks from his condominium, said his wife, Lynn 
Shardlow.He recently had a liver transplant and needs to take medication four 
times daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Shardlow said she last saw her 62-year-old husband when she left their 
downtown Laguna Beach condominium at 11:15 a.m. Saturday to go on an errand. 
When she came home, her husband was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shardlow, who is a retired surgeon and professor from Mt. Sinai Hospital 
in New York, has been ill for the past two years, Shardlow said. Police fear he 
may have become disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing man has an English accent and was wearing a green baseball cap, 
turquoise V-neck sweat shirt and gray sweat pants, Lynn Shardlow said. He is 
6-foot-2 and weighs about 175 pounds. He has brown hair and blue eyes. 
</P>

GARAMENDI USES CRIME SITE FOR CAMPAIGN PITCH; POLITICS: STANDING NEAR WHERE 
LEANORA WONG WAS SLAIN, GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE VOWS SUPPORT FOR DEATH PENALTY.

 Citing the killing of a 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman as an example of 
"one innocent victim of urban war," Insurance Commissioner and Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi on Monday reiterated his pledge to 
support the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Using as a backdrop the Australian Beach Club, across the street from where 
Leanora Annette Wong was found beaten to death, Garamendi criticized his 
opponents as not being tough enough on crime and re-emphasized that he is the 
only Democratic gubernatorial candidate who publicly supports capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her alleged assailant is a barbaric multiple sex offender, a parole violator 
who should never have been free to stalk the innocent and to prey upon people 
like Miss Wong," Garamendi said at a news conference on the last leg of his 
weekend campaign through the Southland. "The person who is ultimately convicted 
of this hideous sexual assault, mutilation and murder deserves to pay the 
ultimate price for committing the ultimate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is the second state political candidate to stop at the Australian 
Beach Club and use the circumstances of Wong's death as a sub-theme in their 
campaigns. At a news conference also held in the parking lot of the nightclub 
Friday, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) -- who is a Democratic 
candidate for state attorney general -- attacked Gov. Pete Wilson for a 
"relaxed parole policy" he said allowed parolees convicted of drug charges back 
onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, who apparently left with Wong from the bar, was 
arrested in the small Northern California town of Quincy in connection with the 
May 19 slaying following a statewide search. A parolee with three rape 
convictions, Morgan tested positive for drug use several days before Wong was 
killed, but the results were not known by authorities until after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight days until the June 7 Democratic primary, Garamendi said he chose 
the site near where Wong was found dead to send the message that, without 
compromise, he supports the death penalty. He also said he supports a life 
sentence without parole for convicted violent sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Without going into the particulars Monday, the candidate also promised that he 
would strengthen the state's "very lax, underfunded" parole program if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute news conference was attended by about 15 volunteers from 
Garamendi's Orange County campaign supporters.

SOMBER SKIES SET TONE FOR MEMORIAL DAY; HOLIDAY: THE WEATHER DISCOURAGES 
ATTENDANCE AT BEACHES, PARKS, BUT FAITHFUL TURN OUT ANYWAY. LIFEGUARDS REPORT 
AN EASY DAY, WITH FEW RESCUES.

 Occasional thundershowers and gray skies turned Memorial Day somber in Orange 
County, discouraging attendance at local parks and beaches on the first holiday 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thundershowers coming and going," said state lifeguard Randall 
Roberts, who spent Monday at Bolsa Chica State Beach. "But it really didn't 
stop all the crowd from coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 "People that made their plans to come here before the weather turned overcast 
seemed to follow through on them," said Roberts, who estimated that 12,000 to 
15,000 people visited the park Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With light surf, average crowds and weather described by some as "yucky," 
lifeguards had a relatively easy day. Stingrays stung a few swimmers at Bolsa 
Chica, and lifeguards made only five water rescues by 5 p.m. at Huntington 
State Beach, state lifeguard Jim Balok said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sunny for a little while, and rainy, and overcast, and windy, and not 
windy," Balok said. "You name the weather, we had it today." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials at Carbon Canyon Park in Brea reported a moderate crowd, 
with people showing up for picnics and softball and volleyball games. Officials 
closed the park to vehicles about 10 a.m. after running out of parking space. 
It was reopened to cars at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendant Ray Davis at Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park said many people 
visited the park east of San Juan Capistrano for barbecuing and horseback 
riding. Others visited the 7,600-acre park to hike on its more than 30 miles of 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had between 50 and 100 wilderness permits issued today," Davis said. 
"That's quite a few -- on a typical weekend day, probably 20 or 30 are issued." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orange County sheriff's deputies reported to extra duty at two county 
parks Monday. Extra deputies were deployed at Mile Square Regional Park in 
Fountain Valley and Irvine Regional Park in Orange -- which were both filled to 
capacity -- but they saw limited action, Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had one medical call," Mendez said. Overall, he said, "It was a 
family-type atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the county were misty throughout the morning, but only one location 
-- El Toro Marine Corps Air Station -- reported rainfall. El Toro had a trace 
amount of rain by 5 p.m., according to Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach had the lowest daytime temperature in the county, reporting a 
high of only 74 degrees, Brack said. Santa Ana had the county's high at 84 
degrees, with humidity ranging from 66% to 84%. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fairly muggy," said Brack, who attributed the conditions to a surge of 
tropical moisture from offshore. Weather forecasters had expected that 
disturbance to move toward the coast today, not Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The moist, gray skies lent a solemn air to midday memorial ceremonies held at 
Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's Saddleback High School band played for about 2,500 visitors to the 
park, along with a men's choir and barbershop quartet, mortuary clerk John 
Aguilera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the armed forces stood before a looming white mausoleum, 
accompanied by a color guard, and told seated guests about the sacrifices of 
military veterans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemetery grounds were covered with U.S. flags, and cemetery employees were 
dressed in clothes evoking memories of the late 1800s and early 1900s, Aguilera 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We only had a few drops of rain," Aguilera said. "It was not hot, it was not 
cold -- it was just the right feel."

4TH OF JULY FIREWORKS SALE IS OK'D 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council picked eight local nonprofit groups last week to sell 
fireworks for the 4th of July holiday. The council in April authorized the sale 
of state-approved fireworks after nonprofit groups said they want to use the 
sales to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department, which provides fire protection to Stanton, 
opposed the move. Cities in California can approve the sale of certain approved 
fireworks, but many others remain illegal. A majority of the council members 
argued that illegal fireworks are the most risky and that those with state 
approval present an acceptable risk. The fireworks will be sold July 1 through 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to recover the full estimated cost of providing fire 
protection when the fireworks are sold, so each nonprofit group must pay a 
$1,051 fee. Only eight groups applied for permits. All were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups are: American Legion Post 783, Boys & Girls Club of Stanton, 
Calvary Assembly of God, Calvary Assembly of God Royal Rangers, Kiwanis Club of 
Stanton, Knights of Columbus Council 6095, Stanton Little League and the 
Stanton Neighborhood Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council approved a carnival on Beach Boulevard from June 
16 through 19, to raise money for the Boys & Girls Club.

SKIP THE DATING -- FOR A GOOD TIME, CLONE YOURSELF; BIOLOGY: ARE MEN ON THE WAY 
OUT? ONE RESEARCHER SAYS FEMALES ARE BETTER OFF AVOIDING MUTATION-PRONE MALES 
IN CREATING THEIR OFFSPRING. BUT THEN, SHE'S TALKING ABOUT AMOEBAS. 
</P>

<P>
 It ranks up there with the world's other great unanswerable questions: Will 
Madonna's career ever get back on track? Are Roseanne and Tom going to reunite? 
When will Susan Lucci ever get her Emmy? 
</P>
<P>
 And now we have (drum roll, please): Why bother with sex?  
</P>
<P>
 OK, we guys know why. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosemary Redfield, a Canadian evolutionary biologist, wants the females of 
the species to know that when their hormones are in hysterics, when their 
libido is wired, when they've got "making whoopee" on their brain cells, they 
should think twice about having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Redfield, a researcher in the Department of Zoology at the University of 
British Columbia in Vancouver, wrote in the journal Nature that a female would 
be more likely to have genetically healthier offspring by not mixing her genes 
with those of a male, whose sperm are more likely to carry mutations than are 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 She was talking not about people but rather about hypothetical, 
computer-modeled species -- lonely, dateless amoeba to you and me. Because we 
know of no single-cell spokescreatures available to comment, however, we 
interviewed humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is male-bashing at the molecular and biological level," Dennis Palumbo, 
a psychotherapist in private practice in Sherman Oaks, said of Redfield's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Redfield, who was unavailable for comment, told the Washington Post that her 
ideas on sexual reproduction "do not apply to the vast majority of human males, 
who make many very important non-genetic contributions to their offspring." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Palumbo asked: "Are we, as men, basically on the way out? It sounds 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on the other hand, male scientists have sort of been the voices of record 
for so many years that some part of me now thinks that this is an attempt by 
female researchers to balance the voices out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen E. Fisher, research associate in the department of anthropology at the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York and the author of "Anatomy of 
Love" (Ballantine, 1992), said the study by Redfield "is providing balance to 
the subject and pointing out that there are some maladaptive consequences to 
sex as well." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more adaptive to clone yourself than it is to reproduce with a male 
partner who may introduce mutations and produce a more shoddy offspring," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad people can't be more like strawberries, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strawberries clone themselves when they are in the middle of a nice good 
patch. But when they get to the edge of the patch and they have to branch out 
into dangerous frontier, they reproduce sexually instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that is useful to them because they've got mutant and new kinds of 
strawberries that may survive in very unpredictable circumstances," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same could be said of human beings. It has long been said that there is 
variety in offspring." 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as Darwin, scientists have argued that reproduction is possible 
through parthenogenesis, or virgin birth. Ellen Kriedman says Darwin be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "How Can We Light a Fire When the Kids Are Driving Us Crazy: A 
Guide for Parents to Be Lovers" (Villard, 1994) said any woman who has ever had 
an orgasm wouldn't want to put the kibosh on sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like it. It's the closet act you can engage in. It's 
intimacy. It's loving. It fulfills your need to be held and to be touched and 
to be connected with another human being," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the biological, it is psychologically and emotionally satisfying 
to be engaged in the sexual act." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo said he doesn't like the notion of eliminating the "middleman" -- or 
the sexual act -- from procreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's already a growing body of literature delegitimizing the need for 
males. Our culture already suffers from the lack of fathers, a crucial aspect 
of the dysfunction in families. I know if I were a woman, I would be frustrated 
by how many men abrogate their responsibility as fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, Palumbo said, Redfield's work "will be a clarion call for men to hang 
around," even though the biologist "was studying amoeba who missed out on 
intimate dinner dates, going to the movies and holding hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Martin, a former erotic film actress and exotic dancer, said 
Redfield's sexual reproduction theory reeks of "female supremacy." Martin, who 
resides in New York, teaches a class in "How to Drive Your Woman Wild in Bed" 
at the Learning Annex in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men have been battered by feminists and are confused by courtship and how to 
please women," she said, adding that Redfield's conclusions "are anti-male to 
me. And the fact that it is anti-sex is pretty anti-human because sex is not 
only for reproduction, it is for pleasure, relaxation and intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Krain, a graphic designer who through computer chats with men has found 
love and sex on the information superhighway, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the theory is silly. If you have a child with a man who comes from a 
healthy gene pool and who is going to stick around, then certainly that is the 
optimal way to have children," said Krain, who is single and without children. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a proposal for women interested in sex without men: Plug into 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the chats get very steamy," she said. "They're rated triple X. But 
they're also a very healthy and safe outlet for sexual release. I've heard that 
people even have cyborgasms -- sexual release without physical sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget biological studies," she said. "I'm having a wonderful time."

REAL LIFE INTRUDES ON BOOKSELLERS; PUBLISHING: THIS TIME AROUND AT THE ABA 
CONVENTION, LIGHTWEIGHT TOPICS GIVE WAY TO SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON RACE 
RELATIONS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It used to be that when the publishing world came to California for its annual 
book convention, folks would talk of sun, surf and screenplays. They'd marvel 
at waiters on roller skates and swap stories about freeways. But this year, 
they're talking about Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
 In a convention more serious than any in recent memory, more than 30,000 
members of the American Booksellers Assn. have come to ponder as well as to 
play in Los Angeles. And the riots of 1992 are foremost in their minds: Not 
only as a reflection of the troubled Southern California landscape, but as a 
spur to greater social responsibility in publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know for a lot of you the question is, what does this (the riots) have to 
do with the price of books in Idaho?" author Luis J. Rodriguez asked 
conventioneers at a well-attended weekend book panel on Los Angeles called 
"Literature of the Rebellion."  
</P>
<P>
 "But the question is relevant, because it can help sellers define important 
books and keep literature vital. Good writing doesn't just reflect the world. 
It impacts the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who has won praise for "Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in 
L.A.," was sanguine at the prospect that this year's convention would 
politicize out-of-towners. Still, he suggested, there should be more to the 
event than PR stunts and movie tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the ABA meeting remains what it has always been: a chance for 
authors, publishers, literary agents, booksellers and other vendors to 
schmooze, talk deals and take a look at hot new books for summer and fall. 
Although not as lavish as in the past, this year's version has had its share of 
VIP parties, Hollywood celebrities and hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Los Angeles Convention Center has been jammed with ABA business, 
which ends today, and the four-day bash has been festive. Yet the real world 
has also made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Book mavens were rocked, for example, when ABA board members announced on the 
convention's first day that the association is suing five publishers, charging 
them with giving large chain operators special discounts that financially 
discriminate against the owners of smaller independent stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The action -- targeting Houghton Mifflin, Penguin USA, St. Martin's Press, 
Rutledge Hill Press and Hugh Lauter Levin Associates -- has provoked angry 
denials from several publishers, as well as threats by some companies to reduce 
their participation in future ABA conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 More controversy erupted in panels that drew overflow audiences. At the 
meeting where Rodriguez spoke, writers made scathing comments about U.S. race 
relations and the isolation of New York publishers. The session was sponsored 
by Booksellers for Social Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodney King was beaten physically, but I've been beaten metaphorically," 
snapped Los Angeles poet Wanda Coleman. She blasted East Coast publishers for 
patronizing her and chided out-of-town African American writers who flew in 
after the riots, becoming instant experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you (as a writer) can't make that New York connection, you'll have 
problems," Coleman said. "But whether you like it or not, we are voices and we 
aren't going away." 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists echoed those concerns, particularly Mike Davis, author of 
"City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in L.A." He excoriated President Clinton 
and other leaders for ignoring South-Central Los Angeles, charging that cities 
have become a code word for people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 He also urged ABA members to use their economic clout on a controversial local 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an ongoing rebellion in this city that offers hope to a new 
generation of trade unionists," Davis said. "There are some incredible 
struggles of some immigrant workers, including a campaign in Los Angeles to 
organize non-union hotels here. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's where conventioneers have a lot of influence with . . . the hotel 
and tourist industry," he said. "Let's talk about tourism and the ABA. You 
people have real power." 
</P>
<P>
 Political power -- or lack of it -- dominated the volatile discussion, which 
also included writers Nelson Peery, Leslie Marmon Silko, Michael Warr and Ruben 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Peery, for example, described his political evolution as a writer since the 
1965 Watts riots: "I finally realized that white folks aren't my enemy. It's 
the relationship between them and me that's the enemy . . . and then I became a 
revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a panel called "Murder, Mayhem and the Media: Have We Gone Too 
Far?" revisited the Rodney King beating and TV coverage of the Los Angeles 
riots, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers, assembled by the American Booksellers Foundation for Free 
Expression, included authors Walter Mosley and John Irving, former NBC Chairman 
Grant Tinker, playwright Tony Kushner, law professor Susan Estrich, producer 
Robert Evans and ACLU chief Nadine Strossen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My response is, there's not enough violence on television and in movies," 
said Mosley, whose Los Angeles-based mysteries featuring Easy Rawlins are 
popular with many readers, including Clinton. The problem, he explained, is 
that media violence is often sanitized, trivialized or presented out of 
context, so viewers rarely experience the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with showing that (Rodney King) tape so many times was that there 
was a slant in the coverage that kept the truth from being expressed," Mosely 
added. "When a white person saw it, they would say, 'That's terrible.' But they 
didn't see it as the consequence of our collective history in America. And 
nobody in the news media was saying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker disagreed, saying that the King videotape was overexposed and that 
endless rebroadcasts reflected pandering by TV stations. Instead of violence, 
he suggested, television and films "could pull back . . . in the belief that 
there might be a little good news once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Do TV and other media influence criminal behavior? There was strong 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving, who wrote "The World According to Garp," lashed out at pundits who 
blame books or movies for causing violence. Society was plagued by crime long 
before television, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think that if you read 'The World of Garp,' you'll be dying to 
bite off someone's penis in the back seat of a car," Irving said, referring to 
a notorious scene in his best-selling novel. "It's not the responsibility of a 
person who writes a book to worry about what some idiot who reads it will go 
out and do." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Mosley was not so sure: "Should I write something that I think will make 
people in the inner city angry, and go out and hurt people? I have to ask 
myself this question." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrich sought a middle ground, saying censorship is abhorrent -- but that 
parents and others have to take action on the media violence issue before it's 
hijacked by extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to buy into the harshest rhetoric of the extreme religious 
right to see this problem for what it is," she said. "If we don't understand 
this problem, we're living in an ivory tower."

PUBLIC GOOD OR PRIVATE GAIN?; TO GET THEIR MESSAGES HEARD, NONPROFIT GROUPS ARE 
USING CORPORATE CLOUT -- AND DOLLARS. BUT CRITICS WORRY THAT SUCH ALLIANCES 
TAINT THE AGENCIES' CREDIBILITY AND OBJECTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The frustration was growing steadily in the Washington offices of the National 
Osteoporosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was founded in 1986, the nonprofit, largely volunteer group had been 
trying to get information about the severe bone disorder to U.S. women, half of 
whom are at risk for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 1993 survey of 1,000 women showed 61% had little knowledge of 
osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at our wits' end trying to find ways to educate people," says Sandra 
Raymond, executive director of the foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 So when the pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham called one day last year 
and invited the foundation to help create a 30-minute television program on 
osteoporosis -- at no expense to the foundation -- Raymond was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that SmithKline was interested in sponsoring the "infomercial" to 
help launch Tums 500 -- a calcium supplement that helps prevent osteoporosis -- 
gave her only a moment's pause. Sure, SmithKline was touting its new product, 
but the message was good: prevent osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have a problem linking up with business when the information 
presented isn't medically sound and when it isn't a balanced message," Raymond 
says. But SmithKline "bent over backward to offer a balanced message." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the arrangement isn't all that innocent, a growing number of critics 
say. They charge that some of the nation's nonprofit consumer health groups are 
perhaps going too far in their attempts -- however sincere -- to get their 
messages heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, groups such as the NOF, Arthritis Foundation, National Safe Kids 
Campaign, the American Cancer Society and dozens of others have gratefully 
accepted corporate funding to help them promote their causes. (For example, the 
osteoporosis infomercial cost $400,000, something the NOF never could have 
afforded on its own.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other health groups -- notably, the National Breast Cancer Coalition -- have 
been criticized for aligning themselves with questionable allies in an attempt 
to generate publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, regional editions of Playboy carried an ad from the National 
Breast Cancer Coalition to raise awareness of the disease. But the ad, which 
pictures a baby breast-feeding, is topped with the rather provocative headline: 
"You've probably been a breast man since day one." The ad space, worth 
$167,000, was donated by Playboy, and the ad will run in all editions in July 
because it's such a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these groups, critics wonder, selling their souls? Just how far are they 
willing to go to cure cancer, stop the pain of arthritis, put a halt to smoking 
or keep children safe and healthy? 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty far, say people uneasy with the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people making a lot of money brokering these deals," says 
Michael Jacobson, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Commercialism in 
Washington. "In hard times, it's hard to be too much of a purist. But over the 
long run, the nonprofit sector is being jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit health groups today are savvy enough to know that the traditional 
boring pamphlets, telethons and 20-second public service announcements don't 
cut it, Jacobson says. Moreover, charitable giving has dropped since the 1980s, 
making the organizations needier, according to the Society for Nonprofit 
Organizations in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had trouble getting their messages out in the past. So industry says, 
'We'll fund them.' I think maybe now (the health groups) are getting a little 
greedy," Jacobson says. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a little shock value to be heard nowadays, health experts say. 
Witness the success of the AIDS advocacy group Act Up, which does everything 
from heckling politicians to staging sit-ins, to get its messages heard. Breast 
cancer groups have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like diseases have become crusades," says Jim Petersen, a senior 
staff writer at Playboy who helped coordinate the breast cancer ad. "This is 
about getting Washington to respond. It's sad that that is what it takes."  
</P>
<P>
 Desperation is what drove the NOF to join SmithKline in the osteoporosis 
infomercial, Raymond says. And it's what motivated the National Breast Cancer 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Playboy ad idea arose last summer when breast cancer advocates were 
working furiously to collect 2.6 million signatures to deliver to President 
Clinton, pressing for government action. A coalition member approached Playboy 
about placing an ad in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playboy loved the idea . . . and agreed to put it in when they had a blank 
page in various regional editions, says Christine Brunswick, a coalition 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bold move. I think there was some concern that people might be 
offended by it. But I think the bottom line is it may anger some people, but we 
are very angry about the disease. And we are willing to do whatever it takes to 
get the message out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Brunswick says the ad has generated a few sizable donations from Playboy 
readers and very little criticism. (Ms. magazine staffers lambasted the NBCC 
during several radio talk shows.) 
</P>
<P>
 And Brunswick denies that the organization has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is 'too far'? We are in no way compromising our mission, our goals. What 
we believe is that women have been too polite and too silent for way too long. 
The headline catches your attention -- which is what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>

 Indeed, forming partnerships with for-profit businesses is increasingly seen 
as the best way for health groups to be effective, says Jay Winsten, director 
of the Center for Health Communications at the Harvard School of Public Health, 
who has studied health-related public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's win, win, win for everyone," he says, noting that health groups get 
exposure while the sponsor gets to either promote a product or polish its 
image.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 study, Winsten -- an early advocate of health education supported by 
advertising -- criticized the effectiveness of the traditional public service 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his research, PSAs depend on donated air time, which is usually 
in the wee hours. And while PSAs help boost awareness, they rarely prompt 
viewers to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public service announcements don't achieve much," he says. "Organizations get 
upset that their messages don't get on the air, but their messages wouldn't be 
very effective anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 But with a fat corporate bankroll, organizations can produce television 
specials or more sophisticated PSAs and educational materials.The American 
Medical Assn., for example, recently joined forces with a media company and the 
health-food store chain, General Nutrition Center, to produce a smoking 
cessation program. The program is sold only at GNC. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some purists might be bothered by a joint commercial-public health 
program, AMA Vice President Steve Seekins says: "It's the only way you can 
develop (programs) that will get into the mass market."  
</P>
<P>
 And few health organizations with corporate sponsors appear to be hanging 
their heads in shame. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Massachusetts Division of the American Cancer Society, a program 
providing free mammograms in a van that toured low-income neighborhoods was 
running out of money when the organization joined forces with a local TV 
station and CVS Pharmacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The cancer society received 15 free PSAs, two hourlong prime-time TV specials 
and sponsorship for the mammography van in the deal. The television station and 
pharmacy chain got their names printed on the van and boosted their images.  
</P>
<P>
 The real winner was the fight against breast cancer, says Karen Rouse, vice 
president for marketing and communications of the ACS, Massachusetts Division. 
Calls for breast cancer information rose 60% after the campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forming these types of partnerships is the way of the future," Rouse says. 
"We can no longer count on PSAs to get the kind of airing that they need to get 
people to take action on their health. We consider our sponsors to be gold." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rouse also acknowledges the debate surrounding this trend and the 
possibility of a downside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's up to the members of the partnership to make sure the line isn't 
crossed in terms of conflict of interest," she says. "It wouldn't help an 
organization like ours to cross that line. But we didn't see a conflict in this 
case. We saw it as a plum of a deal."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit groups have always been reluctant to accept money from sponsors who 
might, ultimately, try to influence their work or opinions, says Daniel 
Callahan, director of the Hastings Center, a nonprofit ethics think tank in New 
York. But the trickle of corporate money -- and the potential for meddling -- 
is turning into a gusher. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems these days is that corporations are doing much more 
targeting of organizations than they used to do," he says. "They used to just 
give in general. Now they say, 'We are interested in children' or 'We are 
interested in arthritis.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Jacobson, of the Society for Nonprofit Organizations, says health groups 
that accept corporate money, free ad space or other services risk losing their 
independence and their public image. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as a nonprofit organization takes money from a company, they have 
sold off a bit of their independence," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit health groups should not sacrifice their ability to speak freely, 
agrees Cindy Pearson of the nonprofit National Women's Health Network in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are constantly offering them money. But, she says: "We've made it 
simple for ourselves. We take no money from drug or device makers. So it's easy 
to weigh in with our opinions on what drugs should or shouldn't be used." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many women's health groups are being asked whether the Pill 
should be sold over-the-counter. One nonprofit health group that plans to 
testify before the Food and Drug Administration on the issue routinely accepts 
operating money from makers of the Pill. That, says Pearson, is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel they have lost the ability to give their opinion that is free from 
business interests," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A more difficult decision is whether to accept money or services from a 
business that probably can't or won't attempt to influence the organization, 
Pearson says -- such as the Playboy-NBCC pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playboy is sexist. It exploits women's bodies. It exploits women's breasts. 
But (accepting the free ad) is different, I think, from taking money from 
organizations that make a profit from the health issue," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downside would be if there is a conflict of interest; if (the 
sponsorship) interferes with the credibility of the message,"  
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is whether the corporate giver remains in the background.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case, McNeil Consumer Products, the makers of Tylenol, issued a 
$500,000 grant to the Arthritis Foundation in 1992 to produce consumer 
education programs. In one commercial for the foundation, the Tylenol 
spokeswoman, actress Susan Sullivan, praises the partnership of Tylenol and the 
foundation. Tylenol is often used for arthritis pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the corporation has a legitimate service or product, I think that allows 
for a very supportive partnership between the two groups," says Katie Burnham, 
executive director of the Society for Nonprofit Organizations. "I see nothing 
wrong with that." But Jacobson says any group that blurs its image loses 
credibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "A nonprofit (group) is normally thought of as being objective, unbiased, 
independent. Companies want to buy some of that credibility. That is what they 
are buying: innocence by association," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it diminishes (the health organizations') credibility. If one or two 
nonprofits out of thousands do it, it's not a problem. But if large segments of 
the nonprofit groups are compromised by associations with industry, then I 
think we're jeopardizing a large portion of our society. And that is the 
direction things are going."

 As part of his study on the impact of candidates' appearance on voters, UCI 
political science Prof. Shawn Rosenberg had a cosmetic make-over done on two 
volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 The pictures at the left show the "candidates" at their greatest visual 
disadvantage.Forty-five minutes later, they had been transformed into what 
voters prefer, as confirmed by later studies.  
</P>
<P>
 Clothing went from informal to formal, hair from long to short and combed to 
the side, not straight back or in bangs. Through makeup, the faces were made 
broader, the jaws more angular, the lips thinner, the eyebrows lighter.  
</P>
<P>
 "In general, we did things to try to age the person. We'd gray the hair out, 
put in wrinkles. The older, the better," Rosenberg says. And a toothy smile is 
preferred to a straight face.

 If you're like most Americans, you've had a lifelong love affair with snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Popcorn at the movies. A cracker or six before dinner. Party mix on Saturday 
night. Peanuts at the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the word snack is sometimes put in the same category as evil. 
With little nutritionally redeeming value to speak of, they tempt, they taunt 
and when you finally give in, they anchor their munching, crunching selves to 
your hips and create the chaos that comes with being unable to fit into your 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 But snacks don't always deserve their bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three snacks a day can be healthy -- as long as they are the right 
kind," says Diane Grabowski, a registered dietitian and nutrition educator at 
Pritikin Longevity Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 This means cooling it on the lard chips and upping your apple intake. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it really possible to ease your hunger pangs without spending your 
entire fat-gram allowance on a potato-chip binge? 
</P>
<P>
 The following suggestions are from Grabowski and Gail Frank, a registered 
dietitian and professor of nutrition at Cal State University, Long Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 * Try fat-free potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get unbuttered popcorn. And, if you can stand it, skip the salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go for pretzels. They are usually very low in fat.  
</P>
<P>
 * Eat a bagel, also very low in fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take time out for atypical healthy snacks. Suppose the hungries hit at 3 
p.m., a typical time. Indulge in a baked potato, fat-free and sugar-free yogurt 
or a banana. At dinner time, you are less likely to overeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at snacks as a reward-type food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize when a snack has grown to "small meal" status. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch for eating frequency. If you eat occasionally throughout the day, it's 
snacking . If it's constant, it's probably grazing . 
</P>
<P>
 * Closely monitor the nutritional values of the food, minimizing fat and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * When trying to reduce snacking, keep it a secret at first. There are too 
many people wanting, consciously or not, to sabotage your plans. Announce your 
success after you've built confidence with willpower. Or, better yet, let 
others notice your new eating habits.

FIRST PERSON: BODY WATCH; SNACK ATTACKS; FOR BETWEEN-MEAL MEALS, DO YOU GO FOR 
HEALTHY OR NOT-SO-HEALTHY? OR MAYBE YOU REACH FOR NOTHING AT ALL.; CONFESSIONS 
OF A MUNCHY MISFIT 
</P>

<P>
 As soon as she arrives at my house, the search begins. Chips, crackers, 
cookies, "just a little something to nibble on," my mom says. Finding meager 
munchables, we make the compulsory trip to the grocery store snack aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom is a world-class snacker, and she knows that if munchies were water, my 
house would be the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 As the daughter of a snacker, the wife of a snacker and mother of two little 
snackers, how did I become so snacking-impaired? When people talk about their 
favorite snacks, I'm at a loss for words because I don't have any. Even our dog 
sits patiently with pleading eyes whenever a crunchy carbohydrate comes through 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Have I taken the idea of spoiling my supper too seriously? It's not that I 
don't have a good appetite. I truly love desserts. I've just never cared much 
for filling up on fillers -- especially when I know that breakfast, lunch or 
dinner is less than a few hours away. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, have you checked out some of those snack names? If you're having a 
good day, do you pick the "Sociables" and on the day you suffer from PMS choose 
"Screaming Yellow Zonkers"? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy being a munchy misfit. We're often misunderstood -- like my 
friend and fellow non-snacker Jane, a successful career woman whose father 
wonders if she's having financial difficulties because she never has any 
Do-Dads or Cheese Tid-Bits on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks if I don't have snacks in the cupboard, I'm having trouble buying 
food," she says. "I try to tell him, 'I don't like Do-Dads,' but he doesn't get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does my family. They'd snack all day if I let them. 
</P>
<P>
 The first words my 2-year-old put together were "Beer-Nuts." My husband 
maintains that he's not responsible for that one, but he is responsible for the 
disappearance of a bag of chocolate chips in the freezer. He claims it was the 
only thing fit to munch on in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are inventive too. From about 2 p.m. on, while I'm urging them to eat 
fruit, they insist on Dixie cups filled with miniature marshmallows and 
sugar-sweetened breakfast cereal -- at least until they hear the ice cream 
truck coming down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm known for my snack-free ways, not everyone appreciates it.  
</P>
<P>
 When it was my week to provide snacks for my son's kindergarten class, I tried 
to do the right thing. I baked whole grain muffins and cookies made with peanut 
butter, oatmeal and raisins. For my efforts, I received a note from the teacher 
chastising me for not sending prepackaged items. The lesson learned here: If 
it's dated for spoilage in the year 2000, it's OK for the kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Snack if you must, but I'll take broccoli over pork rinds any day.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: TRIVIA MAKES O.C. WRITER TOAST OF 'CHEERS' 
</P>

<P>
 If you know -- or think you know -- the name of the restaurant above Cheers, 
what ruined Sam Malone's baseball career, or why Carla's family liked to watch 
"America's Most Wanted," Mark Wenger of Irvine has written the book for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cheers Trivia Book" (Citadel Press; $9.95) provides the answers to those 
and 750 other questions pertaining to the award-winning comedy that aired from 
1982 to 1993. (Answers to the above questions: Melville's, Sam was an 
alcoholic, to rat on their neighbors.) 
</P>
<P>
 The entire barroom gang from the popular comedy is represented with individual 
chapters -- from Sam and Diane to Norm ("It's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm 
wearing Milk-Bone underwear") and obscure-fact-quoting Cliff (Nobody messes 
with Switzerland because they all carry Swiss Army Knives). 
</P>
<P>
 Think you know your stuff? Scoring on the "Cheers" Trivia Rating includes The 
Cliff Clavin Award (You know it all -- or at least you claim you do); The Carla 
Tortelli Award (You achieved this level not on your knowledge, but because you 
cheated); The Frasier Crane Award (Though not completely interested, your 
desire for barfly companionship helped you reach this level), and the Norm 
Peterson Award (You have spent way too much time at Cheers and only got the 
beer question correct). 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, Wenger spent way too many hours in front of his TV set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the show -- lots, " said Wenger, 37, manager of employee benefits 
for a medical testing laboratory in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he began taking notes about two years ago, during the second to last 
season of the series. He also spent a couple of hours a night watching reruns 
or videotapes of reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took notes while I watched and at the end of the week I typed everything up 
on a computer," he said, explaining that he kept his eyes open for such details 
as: On what "wall" did Carla claim Cliff's social calendar could be found? (the 
men's room wall) and, what was Rebecca's nickname in college? (Back-seat

 "What I didn't want was very dry trivia stuff," Wenger said. "I also didn't 
want it to be too challenging. I wanted anybody to be able to pick up the book 
whether they saw the show 100 times or not and be entertained by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wenger said a couple of retrospective-type books on "Cheers" are available, 
and the series has been featured in other books about TV in general, but this 
is the first book to deal with the show's trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was a fan of the show, Wenger said the idea behind doing the book 
was "to start a writing career -- to do something a little more satisfying, a 
little more fun with my life, and maybe make a little money for my kids' 
college education." 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting a subject to write, he said, he decided to tackle a book that he 
was sure would sell, despite his lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenger said he put together a book proposal before delving into his research. 
But first he had to learn how to write one. To find out, he checked out a book 
on the subject from the library and took a couple of classes -- "Seventeen Ways 
to Make Money as a Writer" at Irvine Valley College and "How to Get Published" 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 He then wrote a 12-page proposal, which included sample chapters and 
emphasized that a reported 83 million people were watching the reruns. "I 
figured that would be a good selling point, knowing the show would be going off 
the air sometime soon," said Wenger, who sent his proposal to a dozen 
publishers simultaneously and received a half dozen rejection letters and one 
acceptance -- from Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the time he spent plucking the trivia out of each episode, Wenger said 
he never burned out watching the folks at Cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually when I watched the last show I had (on tape) I cried," he said. "I 
was enjoying it that much. It was sad not to watch anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 For Wenger, the show's primary appeal was "the development of the characters 
and the crisp writing. I found it to be entertaining that way, and I also think 
it's the thing a lot of people would find (appealing): how the song goes, 'It's 
a place where everybody knows your name.' The characters were a diverse bunch, 
and yet they bonded as friends and supported each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Wenger thinks Norm, who spent more time than anyone bellied up to the Cheers 
bar, was probably the funniest character, while he enjoyed Frasier the most 
"because he had that intellectual, yuppie side and yet he couldn't resist being 
a barfly at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Memorable Quotes, he said, "is probably my favorite chapter. If you know the 
characters at all, you can probably figure those out pretty easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Sample quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 Who said: "I don't know where you guys got the idea I'm some passive, 
easygoing lump"? 
</P>
<P>
 Who said: "It's a sad world when Sam Malone becomes the voice of reason"? 
</P>
<P>
 Who said: "Just like all women -- if they're not turning down your proposal of 
marriage, they're accusing you of suspicious behavior in the lingerie changing 
room"? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers: Norm, Diane, Cliff.

 Marshall Taken Ill: Director and actress Penny Marshall was released from a 
hospital Monday in East Hampton, N.Y., where she was kept overnight because of 
chest pains. Marshall, 50, was rushed by ambulance to Southampton Hospital on 
Sunday after tennis at the estate of Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman, where she 
was visiting, according to local police. Sources close to her called the 
problem "nothing serious." Marshall will reportedly make tonight's premiere of 
her new movie, "Renaissance Man," starring Danny DeVito, in Los Angeles. There 
is no word whether she will still participate with a cadre of stars -- from 
Arnold Schwarzenegger to James Garner to Pauly Shore -- in an elaborate 
military obstacle course constructed in the parking lot of Hollywood's Cinerama 
Dome and patterned after the one featured in her new film.

 * Film Novels: A romantic Mexican recipe book called "An Appetite for 
Passion," inspired by the movie "Like Water for Chocolate," and "You So Crazy," 
a book written by comic Martin Lawrence based on his controversial concert 
film, will be published by Miramax Books, a new division of Miramax Films. The 
Academy Award-winning screenplay for "The Piano," written by Jane Campion, was 
the first book to be published by the new Miramax imprint of Hyperion Books. 
Upcoming Miramax releases that will get novel treatment include "The Crossing 
Guard," written by playwright David Rabe and based on an original screenplay by 
Sean Penn; Paul Auster's "Smoke" and the first North American printing of 
Alexandre Dumas' "Queen Margot."

 * Alexander's Band: "Seinfeld's" Jason Alexander passed on his TV co-star 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus when picking the cast for his film-directing debut. 
Instead, he chose Lolita Davidovich to star opposite Bill Pullman in the comedy 
"Stranger Things." Alexander selected Davidovich after an all-day reading 
session for eight actresses, including Louis-Dreyfus and Marcia Gay Harden. The 
movie, which also stars Joe Mantegna, begins filming in Los Angeles in June for 
a 1995 release.

 * Hollywood Invasion: Sylvester Stallone showed up for the opening of Asia's 
first Planet Hollywood restaurant in a rickshaw pulled by four women. Traffic 
was halted for hours near the restaurant in Hong Kong Sunday as some 2,000 fans 
jammed the street to catch a glimpse of a star. Stallone, Don Johnson and 
Steven Seagal were among the luminaries attending the opening. Stallone and 
Bruce Willis, whose band the Red Devils provided music, are part owners of the 
Planet Hollywood chain, which also has restaurants in New York, Chicago and 
London. Arnold Schwarzenegger, another partner in the venture, did not attend.

 Smokey Explanation: Schools superintendent Charles Fowler in Sarasota, Fla., 
cited the Supreme Court's ruling not to promote religion during class 
activities as the reason for canceling a speech by Motown artist Smokey 
Robinson. Robinson was the featured speaker during the Youth Explosion 
Anti-Drug rally last week when he briefly talked of how God saved him from a 
bout with substance abuse. School officials reacted by canceling a second 
planned rally, saying Robinson had violated an agreement to keep religion out 
of his comments. "Parents have every reason to believe that when their children 
come to school, we will not attempt to mold their religious beliefs by word or 
by example," Fowler said. ART

 Lost Art: German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a gesture laden with historical 
significance, handed back the first of 28 masterpieces taken from France by the 
Nazis during World War II and later kept by communist East Germany. Most 
belonged to Jewish families, seven of whom have been identified by French 
authorities. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the French government 
requested the return of the works by Monet, Cezanne, Corot, Courbet, Delacroix, 
Gauguin and Pissaro from an East Berlin museum. Kohl symbolically presented 
Monet's "The Louveciennes Road, Snow at Sunset" to President Francois 
Mitterrand at a summit dinner in Mulhouse, France, on Monday night. German 
officials told the French government it could collect the other 27 paintings 
from Berlin -- as a gift, not an exchange. QUICK TAKES

INSURANCE PROBLEMS ARE LATEST SHOCK OF THE QUAKE; AFTERMATH: SOME PROBLEMS 
APPEAR TO BE WIDESPREAD. VALLEY POLICYHOLDERS FORM LOCAL CONSUMER ADVOCACY 
GROUP.

<P>
 As the struggle to rebuild after the Northridge earthquake continues, so do 
the battles hundreds of Southland victims are having with their insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still very early in this whole process," said Ina De Long, president of 
United Policyholders Inc., an Oakland-based nonprofit insurance consumer group. 
"Some people are just finding out they have serious damage." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 San Fernando Valley residents attended six meetings conducted 
by United Policyholders last month. So many unresolved issues surfaced that a 
group of Northridge residents decided to form a new local organization, 
Community Assisting Recovery (CARe). The group announced Friday it had opened 
an office at 11145 Tampa Ave., Suite 19B, in Northridge. George Kehrer, 
formerly of United Policyholders, is CARe's new executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting June 1, CARe will conduct a series of "carrier specific" meetings for 
people whose homeowners' insurance or earthquake coverage policies are with the 
same carrier. For a schedule of those meetings, call CARe at (818) 363-3062. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are questions and answers about several insurance problems that appear to 
be widespread: 
</P>
<P>
 * My insurance company isn't responding to my calls and letters. What can I 
do?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California Insurance Department adopted new, more consumer-oriented 
regulations last year that specify how insurance companies are supposed to 
handle claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new regulations, "insurers are generally required to respond to 
written complaints from policyholders within 15 days," said Nettie Hoge, head 
of the Insurance Department's consumer services division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Department also has a consumer hot line you can call to register 
a formal complaint against your insurance carrier or simply get information at 
(800) 927-HELP. The toll-free number, however, doesn't work in the 213 and 310 
area codes. If you call from those areas or outside California, dial (213) 
897-8921. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line has received more than 10,000 calls so far, and policyholders 
have filed 700 formal complaints related to the quake, Hoge said.  
</P>
<P>
 If negotiation doesn't work, you may have to turn to litigation. Several Los 
Angeles-area law firms specialize in real estate and insurance matters.  
</P>
<P>
 * The insurance adjuster who came to look at my damage was an auto-insurance 
adjuster from Iowa. Is this legal?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately yes, Hoge said. California is one of several states that doesn't 
require insurance adjusters to be licensed in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know more adjusters with degrees in music than anything that's 
building-related," said De Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "all too often, adjusters are promoted because they close a lot of 
claims and their average paid claim is low," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 250,000 insurance claims related to the quake, companies have 
called in adjusters "who are clearly, clearly not qualified to handle these 
claims."  
</P>
<P>
 * Should I worry about possible asbestos contamination from the quake?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being told by adjusters, 'Oh, you don't have asbestos,' but only a 
state-certified asbestos consultant can tell you for sure," said George Kehrer 
of United Policyholders.  
</P>
<P>
 An inspection by a certified consultant typically costs between $200 and $300, 
he said, and your insurance company should pay for the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos consultants are listed in the yellow pages of the phone book.  
</P>
<P>
 * How can I stop my insurance company from pressuring me to accept a 
settlement I think is unfair?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurers are prohibited from coercing people to take a settlement in any 
way," Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That includes holding up a claim check or refusing to pay living expenses," 
she added. "Anything that says to a person, 'Oh God, I better settle or else.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The state Insurance Department has a free booklet, "A Guide to the Claim 
Process for Residential Property Losses," which spells out all rights of 
policyholders. For a copy, call the department's consumer hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 And get your own experts to look at your damage, said Bill Rake, president of 
the Greenspan Co., a Los Angeles firm that represents insurance claimants on a 
contingency basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The carriers have begun to acknowledge that the damages are considerably 
greater than they first thought, and they are fighting tooth and nail to 
minimize everything they can," Rake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every policyholder should have a structural engineer look at their property," 
he warned. "There is more hidden damage in earthquakes than almost any other 
kind of disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 De Long also recommends hiring a soils engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds stupid, but people forget the earthquake came from the 
ground. The most common problem after an earthquake is soil instability, but it 
almost never gets addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest mistake people can make because a house will never be any 
stronger than the soil that's supporting it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowner may not notice anything wrong for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then doors and windows don't open and close properly, floors start to squeak, 
and maybe you get a hump in one part of the floor," said De Long.  
</P>
<P>
 * Why is my neighbor getting a much larger insurance settlement than I am when 
we had the same amount of damage?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake policies sold by different insurance companies can vary in many 
respects, especially when it comes to deductibles, or how much of their loss 
policyholders must pay themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "People who start comparing the way their deductible is being handled with a 
neighbor who has a different carrier are only going to add to their confusion," 
De Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Insurance Information Service, an insurance trade group, supplies 
brochures about all types of coverage and can be reached at (800) 397-1679. 
</P>
<P>
 * What should I do with an insurance settlement check that is also payable to 
my mortgage holder?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a controversial issue that may end up being decided in court, Hoge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders said to us, 'Look, the law is unclear and we think we have a right to 
these checks to protect our collateral.' We've said we don't think you are. But 
we can't resolve the dispute by issuing a notice to the industry because it 
doesn't have the force of law.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're telling people to call our hot line and immediately say, 
'This is a dual-payee issue,' and we'll contact the insurer and the lender on 
their behalf and see what we can do. We've had a lot of success." 
</P>
<P>
 * My insurance check says "Full and Final Payment" on it. What if I discover 
more damage later?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Check with your lawyer, De Long advises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always caution people about signing anything that looks like a release or 
waiver," she said. "It can create major problems for you down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests asking your insurer to sign a letter saying that accepting the 
check doesn't prevent you from filing another claim.  
</P>
<P>
 * I haven't signed anything, but my insurance company says my claim has been 
closed anyway. Do they have to reopen it?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Kehrer said. "They can't close your claim without your knowledge."  
</P>
<P>
 He suggests calling the company and making it clear you know your rights. "You 
don't have to ask them to reopen your claim -- tell them."

IN THE NAME OF HONOR AND FUN; MEMORIAL DAY IN VALLEY CELEBRATED WITH PARADES, 
NATIONAL PRIDE AND FRIVOLITY 
</P>

 After a long, hard winter of mudslides and earthquakes, San Fernando Valley 
residents showed they were more than ready for a little summer fun at Memorial 
Day events that featured national pride, nabobs and in one case, nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a spattering of rain, the sky cleared in time for festivities in Canoga 
Park, Burbank and Topanga to honor those who gave their lives for their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canoga Park, parade organizers estimated that 60,000 people lined Sherman 
Way, De Soto Avenue and Vanowen Street to watch the Memorial Day Parade held by 
the Canoga Park-West Hills Chamber of Commerce and Canoga Park Community 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities were out in force, including "Saturday Night Live" comic Kevin 
Nealon and one of two calves who played Norman in the movie, "City Slickers 2." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here for the money," joked Nealon, who was actually there to help promote 
the Model-T Club of America San Fernando Valley branch, of which his 
father-in-law, Don Dupree, is a past president. Dupree drove the black 1965 
Lincoln Continental that ferried Nealon, who was spiffy in a tuxedo jacket, 
starched white shirt and green plaid shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman had no comment as he hustled to keep up with his group, the Linda 
Menari Pony Rides, which was led by a covered wagon drawn by two Clydesdales, 
and included several ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors hawked candy apples and sodas, belly dancers swiveled their hips and 
helicopters roared overhead, as parade-goers clapped, cheered and waved 
American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most exotic floats was that entered by the West San Fernando Valley 
Rotary Club, which hired a belly-dancing troupe called the Perfumes of Araby. 
Clicking their finger cymbals and swaying seductively, the mostly middle-aged 
dancers showed ample amounts of verve and cleavage as their truck drove by. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade-goers said they came to honor the war dead, cheer on friends and family 
members that marched in the parade and spend a fun day with their families. "We 
too often forget that many gave their lives that we might have freedom to 
worship, to vote and to speak our minds," said Loretta Haw, a Canoga Park 
homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's glorious," said Rita Pater of Woodland Hills, who came to see her 
granddaughter perform in the Hale Middle School drill team. "Perfect parade 
weather." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was much rowdier in Topanga, where residents were treated to a 
spectacle more resembling a battle than a parade route. The young and 
young-at-heart settled down by the side of Topanga Canyon Boulevard armed with 
garden hoses, super-sized water guns and water balloons in anticipation of the 
bizarre assortment of primitive floats that passed by -- most armed with their 
own water weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 'Doo Dah' parade," said Sylvia Hamilton, 33, a lifelong Topanga 
resident, referring to the whimsical parade held annually in Pasadena. 
"Everybody just gets into it and does whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour rag-tag parade featured members of a nudist camp wearing togas 
made of towels, a pickup truck whose occupants passed out wine instead of 
candy, and another truck featuring the "Topanga Tribal Village," consisting of 
five men and women in various stages of undress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the primate in all of us," said Patty Jackson, 23, a topless 
participant in the music and dancing on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes were anything but civilized in the back of a truck carrying several 
preteen girls who had spray-painted the truck with various slogans, most 
condemning the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys Drool; Girls Rule," read one. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Goodwin, 11, said her friends had stashed eggs as well as the usual 
water balloons and squirt guns, which they planned to use to retaliate for a 
similar prank pulled by some boys last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, if any, of the participants and spectators left the parade dry, as 
everyone from the Cub Scouts with their water pistols to the fire department 
with mammoth hoses took part in what turned out to be a two-mile-long water 
fight. Terry Welles could do little but shake her head as her 25-year-old son, 
Jeffrey, waited with a garden hose, which was used liberally on the passing 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do fine all year long, but when (the) Topanga (parade) comes along, we 
all get wet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade has been around for about 20 years, although nobody is quite sure 
exactly when it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents said the parade brings out the best of the community's 
unusual characters. But Karen Balin, who moved to Topanga with her husband a 
few months ago, was more blunt in her assessment. "It's almost too tacky to be 
true," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 A more sedate crowd gathered for a Memorial Day ceremony in Burbank, where 
80-year-old Yvonne Files charmed a small crowd at McCambridge Park War Memorial 
with a dramatic account of her life as a young Resistance fighter from Belgium 
who committed espionage and sabotage on behalf of the Allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The petite Files spoke with the vigor of a woman half her age as she recalled 
how she took daily risks to harbor Allied soldiers in her one-bedroom apartment 
-- men she referred to as "my airmen." 
</P>
<P>
 "On this Memorial Day, let me emphasize that the basis for and thrust to 
pursue our activities was patriotism, love for our country," she told the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "How my reputation suffered. Don't forget, I was a woman who lived alone. The 
only people nosy neighbors saw coming and going were men." 
</P>
<P>
 Files was 27 when she joined the Resistance effort, a witness to the 
extermination of Jews by German soldiers. She helped get crucial war 
information transmitted to England and kept a dozen 50-pound containers of 
explosives in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, one of the Allied soldiers to whom she provided food and shelter 
turned her in. She said she was subjected to beatings, one so severe that she 
passed out. Ten days before she was due to be hanged for her activities, Files 
was released as the tide of the war effort turned in the Allies' favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Luck, it seems, has always been on her side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cheated the hanging men by a few days," she said, "giving me the pleasure

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; VERDUGO HILLS HIGH SCHOOL; 
CHESS PLAYER SKILLED AT CHARTING SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since he was 6 years old, Verdugo Hills High School valedictorian 
Thatcher Friese has been thinking ahead to his next move. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a skill he learned playing chess, but it applies to getting straight A's 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thatcher's affinity for chess, which he learned from his mother, who learned 
it from her father, turned out to be much more than a diversion from his 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting. It improves your critical thinking," said the Stanford 
University-bound 17-year-old. "Chess is a game where you can use a lot of 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet, ruddy-faced teen-ager, Thatcher started playing chess seriously in 
ninth grade and began competing in chess tournaments with encouragement from 
his math teacher. He won awards at his school, but not at the larger 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a real strong math and science background. Chess fascinates him," said 
Scott Kemple, who taught math for three years to Thatcher and lets students use 
his room to play chess during the day. "He's the best at the school by far." 
</P>
<P>
 Thatcher keeps a traveling chess set and a computer chess board under his bed 
and plays a few games with a group of friends at school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guitars, amplifiers and stacks of alternative rock and heavy metal 
compact discs that crowd his bedroom suggest that his attention is sometimes 
splintered by other interests. Thatcher also plays golf on the school team, and 
basketball and baseball with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lived with his mother and sister in a cozy house in the hills of 
Tujunga ever since his parents divorced more than a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekend, Thatcher sees his father, who has written for television shows 
such as "Roseanne," "The Wonder Years" and "Evening Shade," in Studio City. 
Thatcher said his father, who attended Stanford University, urged him to do 
well so he could attend a top university. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to say C's weren't allowed," Thatcher said. "But then it became an 
ego thing. I thought, 'There's no reason for me to get a B.' "' 
</P>
<P>
 A modest teen-ager who blushes when talking about his accomplishments, 
Thatcher said he plans to keep his graduation speech short.  
</P>
<P>
 He could only guess at what he might say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about living up to your potential," he said. "I've done my fair 
share of hard work."

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; MONROE HIGH SCHOOL ; 
IMMIGRANT SETS HER SIGHTS ON HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Byrnes, Times Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When she opens the door of her family's modest Northridge home, dressed in a 
gray T-shirt and jeans, Monroe High School valedictorian Yoo-Jean Chi looks 
like an ordinary teen-ager. But then she opens her mouth and all illusions of 
ordinary disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be chief justice of the Supreme Court," said the 18-year-old 
matter of factly. She ticks off the route to the chief justice's chair as 
casually as the days of the aaweek: from Stanford University to Yale Law School 
to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that as an ultimate goal. I'd like to play a vital role in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a country that Korean-born Yoo-Jean didn't know until the third grade, 
when she moved to the San Fernando Valley from South Korea with her parents and 
a younger sister. But it's a country she is getting ready to embrace 
wholeheartedly, when she becomes an American citizen next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already feel like I belong," said Yoo-Jean, a student in Monroe's law and 
government magnet. "But I wanted to make it official. I know I'll be living 
here for the rest of my life. I want to be able to vote and to take an active 
role in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 With the confidence and articulation of someone much older, Yoo-Jean said her 
drive for success is fueled by a desire to shape America's future and to make 
her family proud. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, her family lived comfortably in a modern condominium in Seoul, 
and she attended a private kindergarten. But for as long as she can remember, 
big-name American universities were raised in casual conversation and 
correspondence with relatives in the United States was frequent. It was 
understood, Yoo-Jean said, that one day the family would immigrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents took a huge risk in coming to this country," she said. "And I know 
they did it for us."  
</P>
<P>
 But once in America, things quickly fell apart. Yoo-Jean's father had trouble 
finding work and her parents soon divorced. Her mother, who had a college 
degree in political science in South Korea, began working as a cashier in a dry 
cleaner, and as a bookkeeper and waitress.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when it was really tough," Yoo-Jean said. "I felt desperate 
and hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers the beginning: not knowing how to talk to her classmates or to 
even ask for ketchup at McDonald's. But she worked hard in school, read Dr. 
Seuss books at home, and learned English in about a year. Soon she was at the 
top of her class, speaking perfect English.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only person motivating me was me," she said. "I wanted to make my family 
proud. There's still a drive to show my mom my gratitude for everything that 
she's done for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoo-Jean lived with her mother and sister in a one-bedroom apartment until she 
entered high school, but her mother owns a card and gift shop in a downtown 
skyscraper and the three live in a one-story house off a quiet street in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoo-Jean's fascination with U.S. law began in the ninth grade, when she 
learned about the U.S. Constitution. But her admiration of the United States 
came much earlier, she said, when she began to notice the differences between 
South Korea and America. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Korea, the education system is corrupt," she said. "It's hard for poorer 
kids to get a good education. Here, anybody can do it, even if you are a poor 
kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people have to realize how lucky they are to live here."

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; CANOGA PARK HIGH SCHOOL ; 
SHE COVETS STRAIGHT A'S, IF NOT BETTER 
</P>

<P>
 Even as a kindergartner just learning to write, Canoga Park High School 
valedictorian Urvi Patel remembers being fanatical about making straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
 As she moved from elementary school to junior high and on to high school, the 
18-year-old Urvi, whom friends and family call "Mini" because she was tiny when 
she was born in Ahmedabad, India, translated her quest for perfection into late 
nights of studying, flawless homework and exemplary grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantastic is putting it mildly," said Mariana Stark, Urvi's Academic 
Decathalon coach. "Nothing will get in her way." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the most intelligent students I've had in 25 years of teaching," 
said Mike Weigand, her Advanced Placement biology teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Urvi, who moved with her parents and older brother to Canoga Park when she was 
2 years old, said her parents' example and encouragement motivated her to work 
hard in school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, she said, her family struggled, first living with 
relatives, then working long hours until they could afford a modest apartment 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Urvi's mother, who worked as a psychologist in India, took community college 
courses in accounting when she arrived and eventually found work as an 
accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Urvi's father, who was an accountant in India, does the same work for a 
reinsurance firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very hard workers," Urvi said, her voice quiet in the spacious 
living room of the two-story house that has been her home for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Urvi sometimes stayed up finishing her homework until 2 a.m., long after most 
of her classmates were asleep. In her spare time, Urvi, who will attend UCLA in 
the fall and plans to become a doctor, volunteered for community service 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 If she has a regret about high school, it's that she worried too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've taken my life a little too seriously," she said. "Sometimes I'm 
a little too hard on myself. By having to work so hard, I think I missed out on 
some things."

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; OVERCOMING WAR, POVERTY --

 Some came to California as infants or teen-agers, from war-ravaged countries 
or impoverished towns, where education was an impossible dream. Some were born 
in the United States, children of middle-class parents who wanted them to 
achieve more than they had. Others were brilliant beyond their years, excelling 
in school from the moment they walked through its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But as different as their lives have been, these valedictorians of the San 
Fernando Valley, who live in plush two-story homes on tree-lined cul-de-sacs 
and in one-bedroom apartments on inner-city streets, share more than a title. 
</P>
<P>
 In their own way, they demonstrated the guts and foresight to forgo the 
enticements of high school life that lead so many teen-agers astray. Undeterred 
by peer pressure, they set their own rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said it was their parents who spurred them to do well in school. But all 
agreed that at a certain point, their own pride and motivation took over. As 
they look forward to college, many of these valedictorians, and dozens of 
others like them in the Valley, are writing speeches for their graduation 
ceremonies, searching for the words that will encourage their classmates to 
follow their example. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many opportunities here," said one, who immigrated to California 
from Korea when she was 8. "You can get anything you want if you want it badly 
enough. . . . It doesn't come freely."

 SCHOOL DISTRICT

<P>
 The district's high schools use a variety of methods to determine their 
valedictorians; some schools name just one, while others have as many as 20. 
All district schools give Advanced Placement classes more weight than regular 
classes: an A in an Advanced Placement course is worth 5.0, while an A in a 
regular class is 4.0. But some schools name every student with a 4.0 or above 
as a valedictorian, while others take the student with the highest overall 
grade point average.

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; GRANADA HILLS HIGH SCHOOL; 
YOUTH PROVES YOU CAN BE BOTH SMART, COOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernesto Carlos could be a walking poster for the it's-cool-to-be-smart 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 With trendy baggy jeans, spiked hair and exuding self-confidence, the Granada 
Hills High School valedictorian is shaking up the stereotype of a scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come up to me and say, 'you don't look like a valedictorian,' " the 
18-year-old said with a grin. "I'm proud of that. I'm trying to provide an 
example. Just because you are interested in school doesn't mean you have to be 
an introvert." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as his taste in music ranges from rap and hip-hop to Broadway musicals, 
Ernesto said, his friends include rowdy party-goers and studious college-bound 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do both," said Ernesto, who likes to go to parties and dance clubs on 
weekends to unwind from the pressures of school. "It's been so polarized. 
People who are considered cool are the ones not into school." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he tries to persuade his friends to complete an assignment rather 
than attend a party. But he believes his example is the best way to persuade 
them that being cool doesn't preclude doing well in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether my talks or my example has influenced them, I don't know," Ernesto 
said. "But I have earned their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Excelling in rigorous advanced placement courses, he has earned the respect of 
his teachers too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more than just a top student; he's the nicest person you could ever 
meet," said William Lee, his honors chemistry teacher. "If you were to have a 
child, God might bless you and you'd have a child like Ernesto." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest son of a postal clerk and a middle school teacher, Ernesto was born 
in Culver City and grew up in a two-story home on a quiet cul-de-sac in Granada 
Hills. His parents, who moved to Los Angeles from the Philippines before he and 
his younger sister were born, always talked to their children about the 
importance of education. Ernesto could read when he was just 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got lodged in my personality that I had to be the best," he said. "It was 
almost an expectation. My entire family set me up, saying, 'he's the smart 
one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An extended family of more than 50 aunts, uncles and cousins living in Los 
Angeles provided additional incentive to excel. 
</P>
<P>
 "One aunt said to me, 'I want to tell my kids to be like you,' " he said. 
"It's a lot of pressure. They look upon you to make a name for the family." 
</P>
<P>
 In his bedroom, where an unmade bed, piles of books, a cluttered dresser and a 
computer terminal take up most of the narrow space, Ernesto stopped talking to 
answer the phone for the third time in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I don't know, bro,' " Ernesto said into the receiver to a friend from 
school. "I've got a big chemistry test to study for tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Ernesto will head to UCLA aided by a combination of loans and 
scholarships. He plans to study computer science and engineering, but two years 
of volunteer work at Northridge Hospital Medical Center have persuaded him to 
consider medicine as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he is hanging out with friends and working on his speech for 
the graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound too much like an educational film," he said. "But 
everyone seems so downhearted about education these days. There are a lot of 
kids working hard and I want to show that it's going to get better."

<P>
 In 1980, Cindy Phan was a sickly toddler, fleeing Nha Tran, Vietnam, on a 
rickety boat with her parents, her grandmother and her two older sisters. In 
1994, she will stand before her classmates as an outgoing, determined, 
16-year-old valedictorian of Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy remembers nothing of the arduous passage from Nha Tran to Hong Kong to 
California, but she has heard her parents tell the story countless times: As 
the rough sea pounded the crowded boat, a tiny bundle lay at the point of the 
rocking bow, too young to anticipate what her new life would hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a couch in the kitchen of her modest Granada Hills home, as family 
members and workmen repairing earthquake damage traipsed in and out of the 
room, Cindy explained how that story and her vivid memories of the struggles 
that followed sparked her desire to excel.  
</P>
<P>
 "My parents worked really hard," Cindy said. "It made me work harder. They 
expected us to get a better life than they had." 
</P>
<P>
 The academic success has become a Phan tradition, making the family legendary 
at Kennedy, where Cindy's two older sisters were valedictorian and salutatorian 
before her. Her two younger sisters, born after the family arrived in the 
United States, seem to be following the academic-excellence mold. Just inside 
the main entrance of the tidy house, nearly a dozen school plaques and awards 
hang on the wall. "It's an incredible family," said Kennedy academic counselor 
Karen Whicker, who has known four of the five sisters. "They're all just 
dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
 But the family's beginnings in the United States were humble. After the fall 
of Saigon, Cindy's father, who was a pilot in the South Vietnam army, spent 
three years in prison. Shortly after his release, with only about $20 and some 
family jewelry, they escaped to California, where both of Cindy's parents took 
crash courses in English and vocational training. Cindy remembers sharing one 
of two bedrooms in a Los Angeles apartment with her four sisters and 
grandmother until the fifth grade. She remembers her mother and father working 
long hours at their jobs as a cashier in a gift store and an electrical 
technician, positions they still hold. But what she remembers most is that from 
the beginning, she wanted to do well in school and make her parents proud. She 
spoke Vietnamese at home but learned English quickly and skipped the second 
grade. In high school, taking as many honors courses as she could, she often 
stayed up until 3 a.m. studying. There was the tennis team, the academic 
decathlon team and community service work, but school always came first. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cindy heads to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September, it 
will be her first trip outside California. She started a weekend job to pay 
some of her college expenses, but grants and loans will cover most of her 
higher education costs -- $29,000 a year. She plans to study biology and hopes 
to become a biochemist or a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever my parents had in Vietnam was thrown away," she said. "I want to 
grow up and be well off so they don't have to worry so much anymore."

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; VERDUGO HILLS HIGH SCHOOL; 
COLLEGE WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sandra Ruiz moved with her family to Huntington Park from Mexico four years 
ago not speaking a word of English. Starting a new life in the United States 
meant riding two hours a day on a school bus to Tujunga and back and sleeping 
three to a bed with her sisters in a one-bedroom apartment shared by her 
parents and five siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Verdugo Hills High School valedictorian said the hardest part has been 
just finding a place to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I studied on the bus," Sandra said. "And sometimes I would go in the kitchen. 
I really didn't have a place." 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, the petite 19-year-old scanned the living room of her family's 
small apartment, the back half of a bungalow across the street from a busy 
playground. Two couches, a narrow coffee table and a double bed crowd the room 
that doubles as sleeping quarters for Sandra and two sisters. Her parents and 
three other siblings share the only bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 15, Sandra, who is the third child, moved to the apartment from 
Zacatecas, Mexico, with her mother, three sisters and two brothers. Her father 
has worked as a cook in a downtown Los Angeles restaurant for as long as she 
can remember. The family arrived in the United States with little more than a 
few suitcases of clothing to begin their new life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always told us, 'I want to go there so you can get a better 
education,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After all her hard work, Sandra still faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 She awaits news from Cal State Los Angeles about financial aid. If she doesn't 
get it, she said, her dream of being the first member of her extended family to 
attend college will be shattered. Her parents only attended school through the 
third grade in Mexico, Sandra said, and immigrated to the United States to give 
their children a better opportunity for education. 
</P>
<P>
 They struggle to support the family and have nothing left over to pay for a 
college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father still works in the same restaurant six days a week, and her mother 
sews for a textile factory where she is paid by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Because her neighborhood school was overcrowded, Sandra enrolled at Verdugo 
Hills when she arrived in California, rising before dawn every day to make the 
hour trip from Huntington Park to Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the epitome of a good student," said Fred Boobar, her math teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 After school every day, as the bus rumbled down the highway, Sandra would pull 
out her books and read. After washing the dinner dishes, she would finish math 
or science homework in the cramped kitchen. There was an occasional game of 
basketball in the park across the street with her brothers and sisters, but no 
time for a boyfriend or other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 While she nervously waits to hear about college, Sandra is concentrating on 
her last semester of high school and preparing a speech for the graduation 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of shy -- I'm not much of a talker," Sandra said, blushing at the 
thought of speaking in front of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But as she pondered for a moment what she might say to her peers, some of the 
words came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do the best you can," she said. "You don't give up. If you keep trying, 
you can do it."

THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST / VALLEY VALEDICTORIANS; N. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL; 
DEDICATION PAYS OFF FOR CHILD OF REFUGEES

<P>
 In a cramped apartment on a gritty, graffiti-marred street east of Chinatown, 
Betty and Alex Lee are living the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese refugees, whose parents escaped to Vietnam after the Communists 
took over, fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in search of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 With two young boys already born and two more to come, the couple arrived in 
the United States in 1979, penniless and in debt to relatives for the cost of 
the passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 15 years later, their second son, Timmy, is preparing to address his 
classmates at North Hollywood High School as the second valedictorian in the 
Lee family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dreams are filled already," Betty Lee said, her eyes shining with tears as 
she looked at Timmy, sitting across from her in the family's tidy living room 
in El Sereno, where her sons' academic medals and awards line the walls. "I 
tried my best. I just wanted my sons to be good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 They are turning out to be much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest son, who was valedictorian of his class at Garfield High School, is 
studying medicine at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy, a 17-year-old student of the Highly Gifted Magnet at North Hollywood -- 
who plays tennis, piano and violin -- will head to Stanford in the fall on a 
combination of loans and financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents had a great influence on me," he said. "They taught me honesty, 
integrity and respect." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine years of his life in the United States, Timmy slept on one 
of two bunk beds in a one-bedroom apartment he shared with his parents and 
three brothers. His father rose at 4 a.m. every morning to deliver baked goods 
to local markets. His mother stayed home and taught her sons to read and write, 
starting when they were 18 months old. She encouraged all of them to play piano 
and took them to a local community center for art lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy said he owes much of his success to his parents, who taught him the 
value of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of smarter people," Timmy said. "But they are not as dedicated. 
They didn't come from a poor family. When you come from a poor family, you 
don't take a lot for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 An eager teen-ager with a bright smile and confident air, Timmy sat down at 
the centerpiece of the room -- a polished mahogany piano -- to demonstrate his 
musical talent with a nearly flawless rendition of "Everything I Do, I Do for 
You." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents listened as the apartment, decorated with Buddhist statues, 
Chinese art and children's drawings, filled with music.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never pushed my boys," Alex Lee said. "I encouraged them." 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy, who took the school bus to and from North Hollywood every day, said his 
accomplishments did not come easily. He studied several hours every night and 
had to forgo the trendy clothes and parties that some of his friends enjoyed. 
But instead of regrets, he said, he has gained a bit of wisdom that he looks 
forward to passing on to his 650 classmates at the upcoming graduation 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll want to know how I did it," he said. "I'm more than happy to share. I 
think it's mostly the parents, but you have to be determined."

VALLEY INTERVIEW ; CITY USES LICENSE REVOCATION STEPS TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC 
NUISANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like one of those routine city notices that are even less interesting 
than junk mail. But toss it in the waste basket and it could cost you your 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The notices are part of the city of Los Angeles' revocation process -- a 
costly, growing strategy that can demand that the owners of businesses deemed 
"public nuisances" get involved in preventing illegal activities on their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean hiring security guards, putting in new lighting, walls, fences 
or even closing during certain hours. Failure to clean up the problem can 
prompt city zoning officials to revoke business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, city zoning officials imposed 27 conditions against five Van Nuys 
motels deemed magnets for prostitution and other crime. A decision on a 
doughnut shop and a coin laundry facility in the same area of Sepulveda 
Boulevard is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Los Angeles Chief Zoning Administrator Robert Janovici recently talked 
with Times correspondent Jeff Schnaufer to explain how the process works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Who initiates this process?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Typically either the police, community groups or a (City) Council 
office bring an issue to our attention in writing. We don't take phone calls. 
It has to be something that can be documented. So, for instance, an individual 
letter by one person wouldn't necessarily trigger a review without cooperation 
from police or a council office. What we want to make sure is that it's not 
just a battle between two neighbors. That it's a community problem. This 
includes litter, loitering, narcotics sales, public urination, drinking in 
public, prostitution, and various other items that are nuisance activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Once this process has been initiated, how do you evaluate the complaints 
about the business?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Unless we've initially got the letter or the report from police, well ask 
for that, if we haven't got it already. If the council office has a history of 
complaints coming in, we'll ask for documentation of that. We would also look 
for either a large number of individual letters or a petition signed by a large 
number of neighbors. There's an evaluation made from all these sources as to 
whether there really is a problem there that we would be able to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What kind of police data does this include?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We request a PACMUS report, a formal report that gives by address 
site-specific police response. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. And what does that reveal?  
</P>
<P>
 A. What it reveals is by address what police involvement was necessary. It 
might be anything from concealed weapon, assault, robbery, drug transaction, 
public inebriation -- a whole slew of things. It gives you a short summary of 
what the police record (said) happened at that location over whatever period of 
time you requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does the PACMUS reveal who made the call? Whether the call for help came 
from that location, like a manager trying to get rid of the problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A. In the police record, if you go to the original sources, it may indicate it 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you go to the original sources?  
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Not in terms of determining where there is a basis to go further. 
That's why we hold a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens at the hearing?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Notification of the hearing is mailed to the lessee or the owner of the 
property, as well as neighbors. We take testimony and we allow any person who 
is part of the proceedings to testify, to make their best case. Then you issue 
a decision where conditions may be recommended, it gets appealed or not, and 
the conditions are imposed. Then the places need to be looked at to see how the 
conditions worked. Whether we put them out of business by revoking their 
business license, we don't know initially. We don't revoke the first time out. 
There is a review period after the conditions are imposed. If they meet the 
conditions and the conditions abate the nuisances, they are fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How many revocation hearings are held yearly in the Valley and in Los 
Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I cannot tell you how many are done in the Valley. Up until 1989, we would 
engage in maybe one or two revocation/nuisance abatement cases per year. They 
were pretty rare. They involved everything from houses of worship to parking 
lots to other types of uses that we had originally approved. In 1989 and 1990, 
we did somewhere in the neighborhood of seven to 15 sites per year. In the last 
two to three years, we've been doing somewhere between 40 and 50 individual 
sites citywide per year. In terms of the total number of establishments that 
have gone out of business, because of what we've done directly or indirectly, 
that's about a dozen citywide, since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why do you think the increase has been there?  
</P>
<P>
 A. All these cases typically are appealed. They're getting exposure at the 
Board of Zoning appeals level and the City Council level. As the council people 
see a particular problem be dealt with in somebody else's district, they 
realize the process can be used to deal with problems in their district. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How successful has it been?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We would assume by the fact that we don't hear back from the community that 
there was in fact a successful procedure involved. Because we know we would be 
hearing from them if it wasn't successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Some people say they already pay their taxes to pay for police, so why 
should they be burdened by the city to hire security?  
</P>
<P>
 A. They're putting an extra burden with the city in terms of police resources. 
In addition, the motels or the doughnut shop or whoever it is, they're 
activities that bring about substantial time in terms of our staff, conducting 
investigations, long arduous public hearings, going to appeals. Our objective 
is not to put them out of business, but to have them operate in a way that the 
nuisance-like conditions are going to be abated. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But some businesses, at least those in the Sepulveda Boulevard motel 
situation, were initially charged more than $4,000 to reimburse the city for 
the revocation investigation. Does it really cost that much money?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We've found that by and large the amount of time we put in is substantially 
the same as the time we would spend on a conditional use permit. On the other 
hand, what's the cost to the neighbors who live nearby who have to put up with 
what's going on with these sites? Certainly, business owners could volunteer 
ways to deal with this at the initial onset of the process. Normally, people 
don't offer up on their own ways to solve the problems. Unfortunately, most 
people come in and say it's beyond their control. If there's some alternative 
way to deal with the problems, that's fine with us.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. Isn't there a potential for abuse? For example, targeting businesses in 
certain neighborhoods just because they happen to be motels?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We target businesses because they are the source of nuisances, wherever 
they may be. We've reviewed houses of worship. Plus, there's a lot of 
safeguards built into the system. No. 1, a single source does not trigger the 
process. Then there are two levels of appeal that exist. In addition, there's a 
final decision made even after the facts are assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have there been any legal challenges outside the normal city channels?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There have been some legal challenges as far as the liquor stores in 
South-Central Los Angeles, and so far the city has prevailed in every one of 
those. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Let's talk a moment about the Chateau Motel on Sepulveda Boulevard, one of 
the five motels that had 27 conditions imposed against it by the city. It shut 
down shortly after the city's decision. Now some residents and police fear it 
could become a worse problem. Does the city have any enforcement program to 
keep these businesses that close, either directly or indirectly because of the 
revocation process, from becoming a greater nuisance?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We haven't really directly dealt with that issue yet. To my knowledge, this 
is the only one at this point where there hasn't been another business that has 
come in to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What can a business do to avoid the whole process?  
</P>
<P>
 A. They know if they have problems. The first thing I would do is go to the 
Police Department, who would be more than happy to advise them what they can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where do you see the revocation process in the future?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We deal with probably only a fraction of the problem sites in the city. 
What we're hoping is that, by word getting out about our activities, that 
people will get a handle on the problems on their own and will self-police and 
really become more responsible owners.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RISING CRIME IN SANTA CLARITA WILL BE 
DISCUSSED AT MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With recent statistics showing that crime is on the rise in the relatively 
placid Santa Clarita Valley, a citizens group has called a meeting to hear from 
law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of Mad About Rising Crime, a group founded in the west San 
Fernando Valley by a couple whose son was murdered in 1990 -- has titled the 
meeting, "Increasing Crime in Santa Clarita . . . Is It Real?" and has 
scheduled it for the evening of June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang activity in the Santa Clarita Valley will be discussed by Deputy John 
Hudson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, and community-based 
policing tactics will be discussed by Rick Gibby, a senior lead officer for the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A presentation on juveniles and the law will be made by Michael Sanchez, a 
juvenile hall youth counselor. The area has been promoted as one of the safest 
places to live in the nation, but some recent statistics show that youth 
arrests here increased by nearly 50% in 1993 and the number of serious gang 
felonies tripled. Local officials attribute some of that increase to better 
record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the 
end of the year, Santa Clarita had the fifth fewest crimes among cities with 
100,000 or more residents. But a study in June's Money magazine that divides 
the FBI figures by each city's population, establishing a crime rate, listed 
Santa Clarita 46th out of 187 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 More information about the meeting, which will be held at 7 p.m. at the 
Valencia Town Center, is available by calling (805) 253-3330.

COCKFIGHTING RAID RESULTS IN 15 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police responding to complaints of noise in a residential neighborhood in 
Panorama City uncovered a sophisticated cockfighting operation, Los Angeles 
police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers made 15 arrests Sunday and confiscated titanium claws, which are 
attached to the birds' legs to help them kill one another, as well as three 
guns and over $3,000 in cash, said Sgt. Mario Valdez, the supervising officer 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged cockfighters had spread carpets on the floor to keep the roosters 
from slipping, and the birds were kept in handsomely finished boxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most patrol officers see something like this once in 15 years," said Los 
Angeles Police Department Sgt. Mario Valdez, the supervising officer at the 
scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said that the city Department of Animal Regulation took responsibility 
for the 19 birds, two of which were dead and two badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested -- who reportedly are residents of the San Fernando Valley, 
Arcadia, Inglewood and Carson -- were booked on suspicion of cockfighting and 
attending a cockfight. 
</P>
<P>
 The cockfight was allegedly taking place in front of a garage in the 8300 
block of Ranchito Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real sophisticated cockfighting operation," Valdez said. "The owner 
of the house admitted to us that he had these birds brought from Arizona."

SHOOTING AT PARTY LEAVES MAN CRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shooting at a party in Reseda early Monday left one man critically injured, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Hernandez Chavez, 25, was shot by a man accusing Chavez of making 
advances on his girlfriend, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect -- known to police only as Raymond -- fired one shot from a 
semiautomatic pistol, hitting Chavez in the head, according to Detective David 
Steinbacher. An ambulance took Chavez to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
Steinbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly after midnight in a house at 18631 Hart St.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was drinking and carrying on, and the victim, who had been 
drinking, made advances," Steinbacher said. The detective said that according 
to witnesses, Chavez, a Reseda resident, was not acquainted with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, the suspect and his girlfriend fled the scene in the 
suspect's car, either a black Ford Pinto or a Mercury Bobcat hatchback, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at the scene at 12:25 a.m., according to Sgt. Roger 
Ferguson, they were met by the owners of the house who led them to the 
unconscious Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson described the suspect as a 35-year-old man who is clean-shaven, 
stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs about 160 pounds. The suspect has also 
been known to use the alias Cobra, he said, and to frequent the area around 
Vanowen Street and Etiwanda Avenue.

D-DAY INVASION / JUNE 6, 1944; THE INVASION OF NORMANDY; THE LEGACY 
</P>

<P>
 News of the D-day landings traveled far and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, newspaper extras carried banner headlines of the Allied 
assault on the Normandy beaches of northern France. In Nazi-occupied Europe the 
accounts spread by short-wave radio from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 One week shy of her 15th birthday, an excited Jewish girl in Amsterdam named 
Anne Frank described in the June 6, 1944, entry to her diary how she and her 
family huddled around a radio in their attic hideaway to hear details of the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day," she wrote. " . . . I have the feeling friends are 
approaching." 
</P>
<P>
 While it was quickly understood that D-day would alter the course of World War 
II irrevocably in the Allies' favor, not even the most farsighted visionaries 
were in a position to grasp the event's lasting significance: 
</P>
<P>
 That the 70,000 Americans who set foot in Northern Europe on that gray, stormy 
June day were the vanguard of a U.S. presence that would not just help win the 
war, but remain to preside over a half-century of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, D-day was part of a watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Europe it was more. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the Normandy invasion was one of a series of events that 
propelled America past the point of no return on the road toward a permanent 
global role, a permanent European presence and its first peacetime alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologically and politically, the U.S. casualties taken that day and during 
the subsequent 11 months of fighting until Nazi Germany's surrender gave 
America little option but to push aside instinct, reject a return to 
isolationism and instead stay on to help preserve the peace in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, about 16 million American service personnel and their 
dependents have served in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the collapse of communism, a deepening budgetary crisis and a string of 
pressing domestic problems have led Washington to begin unwinding its presence 
in the region. From a peak of 325,000 in 1989, U.S. troop strength in Europe 
now stands at about 150,000. It is scheduled to fall to 109,000 by the end of 
1996.  
</P>
<P>
 The troop withdrawal reflects a larger shift in America's national priorities 
-- those now embodied in Bill Clinton, a young President with no personal 
memories of Europe's disastrous war and committed far more to tackling 
long-neglected domestic ills than strengthening U.S. influence abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more question marks hang over the future of the transatlantic 
relationship than at any time since the Iron Curtain fell across Europe. For 
Europeans, adrift on a sea of frightening new problems and searching to 
redefine themselves and their role in a post-Cold War world, this ebbing 
American interest is disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they owe a lot to their transatlantic partner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, for example, the American military and economic support in the early 
postwar years that halted the Soviet Union's westward advance, steadied 
governments vulnerable to Communist takeover in France, Italy and Greece and 
kept West Berlin alive with a 15-month airlift. 
</P>
<P>
 As Soviet Cold War bullying intensified, it was a U.S. president, John F. 
Kennedy, who traveled to Germany, reminded Moscow that the defense of America 
began in Berlin, then declared himself a citizen of the beleaguered city with 
his famous declaration, "Ich bin ein Berliner."  
</P>
<P>
 It was U.S. pressure that helped pave the way for Germany's swift 
rehabilitation into the community of Western democracies and American money 
that flowed into an exhausted Western Europe under the Marshall Plan, restoring 
hope and igniting an unprecedented economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was leaders such as Dean Acheson, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John Foster 
Dulles, who repeatedly gave crucial support to the French visionary Jean Monnet 
as he worked to overcome regional jealousies to build a European Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all buried the amazing importance of America in process of European 
integration," said William Wallace, a senior research fellow at Oxford 
University's St. Antony's College. "The whole thing was American-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Pierre Jacquet, deputy director of the French Institute of International 
Relations, "Without it (the American presence), Europe would have fallen back 
again into the 1930s, with nations trying to export their problems to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Common Market's successor -- the European Union -- stands at the 
center of the Continent's future. It is about to enlarge from 12 to 16 member 
states and -- albeit hesitantly -- has reached out to the former Soviet 
satellite states in the east. EU member nations still squabble with each other, 
but war between them is only a slightly less remote possibility than armed 
conflict between California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this transatlantic success, there have been bitter differences -- many of 
them stemming from frictions inherent in a relationship between peoples who 
share the same values but in vastly different worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 American policy-makers, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, frequently 
complained of limp, pessimistic European allies, too paralyzed by their own 
self-doubts to be effective partners. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard 
Nixon all but ignored Western Europe as the United States pursued a war in 
Asia, detente with Moscow and an opening of ties with Communist China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam War debacle, coupled with Western Europe's growing economic 
strength, the student revolutions that swept the region in 1968 and the dollar 
crises of the early 1970s, ended the European sense of awe for America that 
characterized much of the relationship's early years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sharp foreign policy clashes during the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan 
presidencies and a love-hate relationship with the growing American cultural 
invasion led many Europeans to nurture a new stereotype of the United States -- 
that of a powerful, but naive ally, whose quick-trigger, overly simplistic 
world view constituted a danger only slightly less than that emanating from 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But few on either side of the Atlantic could challenge the reality that 
Western Europe's stunning revival had unfolded and matured under the protection 
of America's security guarantees. Indeed, many argue that both a long-term 
American political role and military presence in Europe remain vital for the 
Continent's stability.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone watching the EU's futile efforts to prevent conflicts on its own within 
the region would be hard-pressed not to agree. The war in the former Yugoslav 
federation, the first major political crisis postwar Europeans have had to face 
without immediate American leadership, has been both a diplomatic disaster and 
a demoralizing blow to the EU's self-confidence -- in addition to a great human 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is that for the last 50 years, America has told us what 
to do," said Wallace, the Oxford fellow. "We may not have liked it, but it 
always gave us a starting point. Now this is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Stanley Crossick, chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center, a 
Brussels-based political think tank: 
</P>
<P>
 "We got things right after the war because of strong U.S. leadership, the 
brilliance of the Marshall Plan and the vision of our own statesmen. Now we no 
longer have the same U.S. leadership, our own leaders are weak and there's no 
Marshall Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 But there remain many elements that will keep America and Europe locked 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the new importance of Japan and other Asian markets, Western Europe 
remains America's biggest overseas trading partner. Since 1945, the Old World 
has drawn an estimated $200 billion in U.S. private investment -- roughly 40 
cents of every American dollar invested overseas. The $195 billion in EU-U.S. 
trade last year accounted for more than one quarter of all global exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Such figures help support the claim that America's decision to defend Western 
Europe was no act of altruism, but far more a policy based on enlightened 
self-interest that has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of other imperatives would also seem to guarantee a continued strong 
transatlantic link. Common problems, including immigration, the preservation of 
democratic values and free markets, growing challenges from Asia and the 
emerging economies in the South remain common ground for both. 
</P>
<P>
 After fighting bitterly against each other through seven years of global trade 
talks, Europeans quickly teamed with Americans early this year to force the 
issues of child labor and worker exploitation onto the agenda of the newly 
formed World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The European Union and the United States have the most important 
interdependent relationship in the world," concluded EU Commissioner Christiane 
Scrivener in a speech last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dazzled by the potential of fast-growing markets in the Far East, 
American policy-makers have found it hard to penetrate the Asian mind-set, let 
alone the markets themselves. In trying to cultivate Asian markets, the Clinton 
Administration has already stumbled into open conflicts with several nations, 
including Japan, China, Malaysia and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a powerful transatlantic cultural bond has emerged, that, despite 
European ambivalence, continues to grow. From the GI chewing gum, jazz music 
and Ernest Hemingway paperbacks in the late 1940s, to the Levi's, NFL sweat 
shirts, Pizza Hut restaurants, hard-rock music, Hollywood films and TV game 
shows found virtually everywhere in Western Europe, American soft power has 
steamrollered the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a truth that makes many Europeans wince, but 3 1/2 decades after the 
Treaty of Rome committed them to the path of integration, the common thread 
through Western European mass culture is American. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the mass level, it has contributed to a cultural homogenization across 
Europe," declared Philipp Borinski, part of an academic team at Mainz 
University that is studying the future of the transatlantic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 American pop music, scientific writings and successful business styles helped 
catapult English into the role of a de facto international language, adding 
further to this cultural impact. Widespread knowledge of English has made 
Northern Europe especially vulnerable to American influence and, although the 
Romanesque countries to the south have resisted this trend, they too have 
succumbed, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 "These countries are more influenced than they like to admit," noted Wilfried 
Wiegand, who edits the cultural pages of Germany's leading national daily, the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "In Italy it's now fashionable for young people 
to eat hamburgers and learn English. In a country that values form and 
elegance, this is a way for young people to show they are different." 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, American ideas flooded into a cultural vacuum left in the wake of 
Nazism. Probably nowhere else in Europe have American habits and tastes -- from 
jazz clubs to corporate boardrooms -- taken greater hold. 
</P>
<P>
 While the reaction to the Vietnam War and the 1968 student protests both 
carried a distinctly anti-American character and worked to tarnish America's 
image as a political role model, they paradoxically strengthened the American 
cultural impact. 
</P>
<P>
 With few home-grown symbols to challenge the Establishment, Western Europe's 
young revolutionaries listened to the protest messages of Joan Baez and Bob 
Dylan, cultivated Andy Warhol's art and adopted Eldridge Cleaver and Angela 
Davis as political heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lifestyle revolution in the direction of America," said Borinski, 
who views 1968 as a clear break from traditional West European mores, one that 
has brought Europe permanently closer to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that American cultural influence has generated a greater sense of 
personal freedom in Germany, eroded authoritarian strains within society, and 
generally boosted the status and confidence of the individual -- all 
developments that have enabled western Germans to thrive in a free-market, 
democratic environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sort of social, cultural convergence taking place that's making 
(Western) Europe and the U.S. more similar," Borinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has a positive effect in that it helps create a much broader 
understanding -- above all among younger generations, which have been welded 
together in a common youth culture." 
</P>
<P>
 But if decades of American cultural influence have narrowed the Atlantic, they 
have deepened the divide that still separates Germany and Europe nearly five 
years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast in experience, in outlook, and in social values along with such 
things as people skills and personal confidence still visibly separate eastern 
and western Germans. These differences also divide Europeans elsewhere between 
those who were and were not under the American umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgent popularity of retooled Communist parties in Eastern Europe does 
not reflect a nostalgia for life under the Soviet yoke, but it does represent a 
lingering sympathy for the socialist ideals and a protectionist state. 
</P>
<P>
 While many Europeans are ill at ease with the intrusions of Americana, only 
the French have cared enough to seriously fight it. Over the years, they have 
launched a series of counterattacks -- most notably in December, when they 
fought to the last bitter minute to successfully retain their leaky defenses 
against the growing influx of American films and television programs during 
global trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring the defense of the French language a "political priority," Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur's government has also passed a law requiring that a 
minimum of 40% of all songs played over the country's airwaves be in French and 
issued an official dictionary of some 3,500 new terms, such as restauration 
rapide instead of fast food and disque audionumerique instead of compact disc, 
to replace Anglicisms that have crept into the language. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about American influence is nothing new in France. It was nearly 30 
years ago that the French publisher J.J. Servan-Schreiber warned of "the flood 
of American industrial power into Europe." In his 1967 bestseller, "The 
American Challenge," Servan-Schreiber painted Western Europe's plight in 
Draconian terms: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's generation faces a . . . clear choice of building an independent 
Europe or letting it become an annex of the United States. The sheer weight of 
American power is pushing our hesitant countries along the path of annexation." 
</P>
<P>
 A generation later, those fears seem highly overdrawn, although a walk through 
Paris is proof that Americana is well entrenched. A tiny sandwich shop just off 
the Place de la Bastille, for example, seemed typically French -- except for 
the Hollywood chewing gum, the Jack Daniels whiskey, the Getaway pinball 
machine in the corner, the framed photo of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lure of Americana seems likely to remain for the foreseeable future, 
in other areas the transatlantic link appears less solid. America's reduced 
political involvement raises troubling questions at a time when Western 
European leaders stare at a bewildering mix of new problems. 
</P>
<P>
 To the east, an unstable Russia and a string of bubbling ethnic disputes in 
the fledgling post-Communist democracies threaten instability. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, West Europeans struggle to contain growing immigration and rising 
unemployment. They watch neo-Nazis chase foreigners through the streets of 
Magdeburg and listen to Italy's new parliamentary Speaker praise Benito 
Mussolini's policies toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation . . . clearly begs the question: Who protects Europe against 
its demons once reasonableness is swept away?" German historian Michael 
Stuermer wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Summed up Jacquet, the French foreign policy specialist, "Europe is undergoing 
its greatest crisis since the Treaty of Rome. It's an identity crisis (and) 
Europe is just not ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Ready or not, for the first time since Americans set foot in northern France 
to help free the Continent from Nazism 50 years ago, Europeans are facing the 
reality of reduced American involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Crossick, the Brussels think tank chairman, believe that -- 
barring earlier explosions -- the Continent's long-term future will likely be 
determined in 1996 when the EU states meet to review the 1991 Maastricht Treaty 
that committed them to political and economic union. The 1996 review amounts to 
a de facto West European constitutional convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get our act together," Crossick said. "Unless we take a lot of 
important decisions (then) and carry the public with us, the battle for (a 
united) Europe could be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Crossick, along with others interviewed for this article, believe American 
involvement remains crucial for the Continent's future. 
</P>
<P>
 But when President Clinton joins a legion of other Western leaders next week 
on the Normandy beaches to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic 
landings, he comes to a Europe of vastly different expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amsterdam hideaway where Anne Frank and her family once listened to D-day 
unfold is a well-kept museum in a city whose richness and vibrancy symbolize 
the accomplishments of the new Old World -- one increasingly ready for a new, 
more equal, transatlantic tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for any favors, we're not asking for money or concessions," 
Crossick said. "We're asking to work as partners to stabilize the world -- but 
not against anyone." European Union 
</P>
<P>
 By providing military and diplomatic support after World War II, America 
became the midwife at the birth of the Common Market, now called the European 
Union.

<P>
 The Casualty toll 
</P>
<P>
 Casualty figures for 24 hours of the D-day assault are vague and 
contradictory, depending on sources. The following numbers are from a U.S. Army 
after-action report; British figures are estimates: 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian: 946 
</P>
<P>
 British: 2,500 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.: 6,603 
</P>
<P>
 Gliders: The Allies landed about 850 gliders in Normandy, most under cover of 
darkness. The British Horsa Mark II glider could carry 28 fully armed troops or 
two jeeps. A total of 25 American and 34 British glider pilots died in the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Medals: Ten Medals of Honor -- recognizing supreme bravery in action -- were 
awarded to U.S. soldiers for their roles in Normandy; eight of those were 
awarded posthumously. Battlefield Facts 
</P>
<P>
 Target practice: For pre-D-day machine-gun practice, Allied gunners filled 
condoms with helium and released them into the sky. Condoms were also used to 
keep water out of gun barrels during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation: Thousands of British troops took bicycles with them when they 
set off for Normandy; there is no record of any Americans doing so. One 101st 
Airborne commander reportedly tried, but his men threw it in the Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway: Ernest Hemingway was a correspondent for Collier's magazine in 1944 
and landed on Omaha Beach in the seventh wave of D-day. He wrote: "Those of our 
troops who were not wax-gray with seasickness, fighting it off, trying to hold 
on to themselves before they had to grab for the steel side of the boat, were 
watching the (battleship) Texas with a look of surprise and happiness. Under 
the steel helmets they looked like pikemen of the Middle Ages to whose aid in 
battle had come some strange and unbelievable monster. There would be a flash 
like a blast furnace from the 14-inch guns of the Texas that would lick far out 
from the ship. Then the yellow brown smoke would cloud out and, with smoke 
rolling, the concussion and report would hit us, jarring the men's helmets. It 
struck your ear like the punch of a heavy, dry glove." 
</P>
<P>
 What D-day means: Invasion planners apparently appreciate redundancy. The D in 
D-day stands for "day."

 Winston Churchill (1874-1965), British statesman and Prime Minister in a 
speech delivered in Fulton, Missouri, March 5, 1946: 
</P>
<P>
 "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has 
descended across the Continent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Konrad Adenauer (1876-1967), West German Chancellor, in a speech delivered 
May, 1953: 
</P>
<P>
 "We must free ourselves from thinking in terms of nation states...The 
countries of western Europe are no longer in a position to protect themselves 
individually; not one of them is any longer in a position to salvage Europe's 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charles de Gaulle (1890-1970), French General and President of the Fifth 
Republic, from War Memoirs, Vol. III, of the Potsdam Conference in 1945: 
</P>
<P>
 "(In 1945) I intended to safeguard the primacy of France in western Europe by 
preventing the rise of a new Reich which might again threaten its safety; to 
cooperate with East and West...to transform the French Union into a free 
association to avoid dangers of upheaval not yet perceived; to persuade the 
states along the Rhine, the Alps and the Pyrenees to form a political, economic 
and strategic bloc; and to establish this association as one of the three world 
powers, acting if necessary as arbiter between the Soviet and Anglo-American 
camps. Since 1940 every word and every act of mine was dedicated to bringing 
about this possibility."

</P>
<P>
 Jean Monnet (1888-1979), French politician and economist and former head of 
the European Community: 
</P>
<P>
 "New bonds between peoples and the realization of their mutual solidarity are 
already beginning to take hold. As the Community's impact gradually increases, 
these bonds will be strengthened. Then it will become possible to find the way 
towards establishing a political union and reaching the Community's objectives: 
the United States of Europe."

<P>
 Margaret Thatcher, former British Prime Minister, in an interview in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 "What I am worried about is Europe becoming isolated...We've piled such high 
costs onto our industry -- the prices are too high, we're non-competitive. We 
have our agriculture at enormously high subsidized rates. But the (European) 
Commission are protectionists. And some countries in Europe are 
protectionist...It's absolutely absurd. (Francois) Mitterrand has tried to have 
a rule to restrict American films to a percentage coming into Europe. I said, 
"What are you doing? I thought France made good films. What are you afraid of?"

UNDERSTANDING D-DAY; THE INVASION OF NORMANDY

 Success on "the longest day" was a giant step on the road to destroying Nazi 
Germany. It allowed Allied ground forces to start their drive toward Berlin. 
The invasion, combining mostly U.S., British and Canadian forces and code-named 
Operation Overlord, marked the beginning of the end of the Hitler regime. THE 
COMMANDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight D. (Ike) Eisenhower Named supreme allied commander, not only because 
military abilities, but also because of his political skills. Made final 
decision to launch the invasion despite severe weather conditions. "I am quite 
positive that the order must be given (not to postpone).... I don't like it, 
but there it is.... I don't see how we can do anything else." -- Eisenhower to 
his generals, June 4, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin Rommel Charged with strengthening German defenses. Believed invasion 
must be stopped on beachesbecause once Allieds Allies were inland, their air 
superiority, larger numbers and greater industrial production would defeat 
Germany. "Believe me, Lang, the first 24 hours of the invasion will be 
decisive.... For the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day." 
-- Rommel to his aide, April 22, 1944 PREPARING FOR THE INVASION 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Crossing: Drive and Deception 
</P>
<P>
 Central to D-day success is keeping secret the invasion target. To that end 
the Allies invest a great deal of effort convincing Germans landings will take 
place at Calais. Allied convoys converge at "Piccadilly Circus" and 255 
minesweepers clear lanes through German minefield. As invasion force heads 
toward Normandy, other vessels sail toward Calais, towing special balloons that 
produce radar echoes similar to those of troop ships. British bombers drop 
strips of aluminum foil to produce other false radar images, and dummy 
paratroopers are dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Normandy? * Close enough for England-based planes to provide air cover * 
Beaches large and flat enough to allow troops to be landed and supplied * 
Hinterland big enough to allow beachhead development * Not heavily defended * 
Nearby ports, essential to post-invasion supply INVASION COUNTDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, the invasion force sailed, expecting a June 5 landing. But the 
weather was deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 June 4 04:00: Meteorologist tells Eisenhower June 5 will be overcast, stormy 
06:00: Eisenhower postpones landing 07:00: Rommel leaves for Germany to see 
Hitler, celebrate wife's birthday 21:30: Eisenhower told bad weather will break 
on June 6 21:45: Eisenhower decides invasion will be June 6 23:00: All ships 
have received orders to resume sailing 24:00: Convoys begin to form 
</P>
<P>
 June 5 03:15: Allied generals receive weather briefing 04:15: Eisenhower makes 
final "go" decision 19:00: Eisenhower visits American airborne troops 22:00: 
Airborne forces don chutes, equipment 23:00: Airborne troops take off 
</P>
<P>
 June 6 00:15: Invasion begins as British paratroopers land 03:00: Allies begin 
aerial bombardment 03:03: Minesweepers finish sweeping water nearest the 
beaches 05:30: Naval bombardment begins 06:30: First landing, at Utah Beach 
BATTLE AT THE BEACHES 
</P>
<P>
 The entire front, from Utah Beach in the west to Sword in the east, covers 
about 60 miles -- about the distance from Venice Beach to San Clemente. The 
famous beach code names identified with D-day didn't actually refer to beaches, 
but were names given to landing areas. Within each landing area were the 
assault beaches, where the troops landed. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airborne After initial confusion, 13,000 troops secure vital roadways 
and villages that will help invasion move off Utah Beach; they also provide 
flank protection. 
</P>
<P>
 UTAH Strong current and poor visibility cause Americans to land in wrong 
sector but against light defenses. They quickly move inland and make contact 
with American airborne troops. 
</P>
<P>
 OMAHA Americans engage in fiercest fighting of the day. Assault breaks down as 
all but a few first-wave troops land in wrong places. Attack take place over a 
wide beach and heavily defended bluffs, and moves inland by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLD Armored forces, landing ahead of infantry, lose all but one tank. British 
move off beach and establish a five-square-mile lodgment but fail to connect 
with Americans on Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 JUNO Bitter opposition surprises Canadians, but by mid-morning they capture 
local village and set up headquarters. Armored units arrive on time; contact is 
made with British. 
</P>
<P>
 SWORD British secure beaches by 10 p.m. Contact with airborne further secures 
bridges to east. Only counterattack of day repulsed, shredding German tank 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airborne Just after midnight, 8,000 troops begin arriving East of 
Sword Beach. They quickly destroy some targets, capture key bridges and secure 
Eastern flank. Air Forces Invasion succeeds in part because of air-space 
control over and around beaches. Allied air forces have 8,000 combat aircraft; 
Germans fewer than 500. Allies fly 14,000 sorties, the Germans 250 -- mostly at 
action's fringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke on the Water Naval bombardment ends just before landings begin. Short 
duration of barrage and heavy fortification helps defending guns survive. 
Three-quarters of the warships are British. Not Even a Clue German defenders 
are unaware of huge invasion force until it is in front of them. Key factors: * 
Miserable weather * Bombing has destroyed much of German radar capability * 
Cloud cover makes aerial reconnaissance difficult * Naval patrols are not 
dispatched due to weather * Rommel, convinced that tides and weather are 
unfavorable, is in Germany 
</P>
<P>
 No Tank Problem German panzers play no effective role. Only division nearby is 
sent east toward British airborne, then ordered to switch direction and 
counterattack north to gap between Juno and Sword beaches; 13 tanks are 
immediately destroyed. When survivors withdraw, they have lost 70 of 124 tanks. 
"BLOODY OMAHA": Americans Meet Savage Defense 
</P>
<P>
 Americans encounter fiercest resistance of the day. All but a few first-wave 
troops land in wrong places. Germans have the beach covered with everything 
from artillery to small arms from a honeycomb of strongpoints, gun pits and an 
extensive trench system. Allied intelligence fails to note presence of more and 
better trained troops than are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Omaha Gantlet First-wave invaders navigate rings of an Omaha hell -- covering 
more than 200 yards of treacherous beach before running into a concrete 
seawall. Enemy defenses claim 2,400 U.S. killed, wounded or missing in the 
first 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Belgian gates: Seven-by-10-foot steel frames with waterproof mines carrying 
12 pounds of TNT * Wooden stakes: Eight to 10 feet long, angled seaward, mined 
* Hedgehogs and ramps: Three six-foot steel bars welded together at their 
centers; interspersed with wooden ramps that point toward shore. These ramps 
are designed to impale retreating landing craft * Concrete seawall * Barbed 
wire * German gun positions: As part of the Atlantic Wall, the Germans built 
large coastal batteries, buried in the cliff tops. These are supplemented by 
fortified gun positions inland. Deadliest of the German guns, the 88-millimeter 
cannon is able to destroy tanks up to 2,000 yards away. It is particularly 
lethal against troops when firing air-burst shells. 
</P>
<P>
 1. American ships unload 11 miles offshore; troops in boats four hours before 
landing, many becoming seasick. 2. Tanks launched 5,000 yards off shore, 27 of 
32 sink in heavy seas; 40 of 72 boats carrying artillery capsize. 3. Many boats 
ground before reaching beach; troops wearing 70 pounds of equipment jump into 
deep water and drown. 4. On beach, wind and tide force landing boats together, 
allowing Germans to concentrate fire in small areas. 5. Many wounded, unable to 
crawl faster than a swiftly rising tide, drown. 6. Massive German cross-fire 
pins invaders behind obstacles; one-third of engineers sent to clear lanes 
through obstacles are killed. Concrete seawall, first real protection, is in 
triple cross fire: machine guns and artillery from sides, small arms from 
front, mortars overhead.

MUHAMMAD ATTACK SUSPECT HEAVILY ARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A former Nation of Islam minister who clashed with fellow Muslims had a small 
arsenal, including a hunting rifle with a scope, when he allegedly shot black 
nationalist Khallid Abdul Muhammad and five other men outside a university 
auditorium, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, identified as James Edward Bess, 49, opened fire just after 
Muhammad finished a speech on the University of California campus here Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad -- a former Nation of Islam spokesman known for his fiery 
anti-Jewish, anti-white rhetoric -- was shot in the legs. He and a bodyguard 
were reported in stable condition. Four other bodyguards were treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities said they have not ruled out a conspiracy in the 
shooting but they believe Bess, a Tacoma resident who was booked on several 
counts of attempted murder, was acting alone. Investigators have not offered a 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with the suspect described Bess as a devotee of Nation of 
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and a contentious figure who was removed from his 
post as a leader of the Seattle-area mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 He once wrote an open letter in a black community newspaper criticizing the 
mayor of Seattle for denouncing remarks by Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, he told viewers of a public access television station in 
Seattle that violence was the way to deal with black leaders who let down the 
black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this false leadership continues I won't be surprised to see the same thing 
as happened in South Africa, where the black woman was hacked to death with an 
ax and . . . thrown on a fire and burned up," Bess said on a 1985 tape aired by 
ABC and CBS. "Matter of fact, I think that's what needs to take place with this 
leadership. They ought to be doused with gasoline and burned in public." 
</P>
<P>
 A former top aide to Farrakhan, Muhammad had been one of Farrakhan's most 
vituperative lieutenants until a verbal assault on Jews, Arabs and whites 
provoked denunciations by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, black members of Congress and 
President Clinton, leading to Muhammad's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the suspension, Muhammad has remained so publicly loyal to Farrakhan 
that many wonder if he continues to speak for Farrakhan. He says only that they 
remain in contact but adds, "We don't have the closeness that we had. We don't 
have the communication that we used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad had come to Riverside to make the second of two speeches in the Los 
Angeles area over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting Sunday night occurred despite tight security inside the UC 
Riverside auditorium during his two-hour speech. The 500 members of the 
audience were searched as they entered the room. In addition to two city police 
officers, about 50 members of the Fruit of Islam -- the security arm of the 
Nation of Islam -- were present. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad drew cheers during his speech when he described whites as satanic and 
Jews as oppressors. In a speech Saturday in Los Angeles, Muhammad referred to 
Jews as "bagel-eating" and "hook-nosed" and contended that "the black holocaust 
is 100 times worse than any other holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and university spokesmen said that security personnel were caught by 
surprise when Muhammad left the podium and said he would continue to field 
questions outside. Muhammad said he was going outdoors because he had been told 
-- apparently in error -- that the sponsoring organization had to vacate the 
gymnasium or pay additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no other events scheduled (later that day in the gymnasium)," said 
UC Riverside spokesman Jack Chappell. "There was no reason they couldn't have 
stayed longer. There was no compelling reason for them to have left. There was 
no time limit." 
</P>
<P>
 University officials acknowledged that they were apprehensive about Muhammad's 
speech on campus, sponsored by the African Student Alliance, but said that to 
have blocked the talk would have been a denial of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came outside, Muhammad, 43, was hit in both legs by shots fired from a 
9-millimeter handgun. A bodyguard, Varnardo Puckett, 34, of Pomona, remains 
hospitalized with three wounds. Caliph Sadiq, 33, of Upland was shot in the 
upper right back. Terrell D. Strait, 20, of Pomona was shot in the left 
shoulder and stomach. Steve L. Washington received a minor gunshot injury, and 
Thomas L. Harri was grazed on the back by a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday afternoon, Muhammad had gotten out of his hospital bed and was 
walking around his room, according to Nation of Islam security guards who 
declined to identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is fine. His spirits are fine," said a woman who identified herself as 
Muhammad's sister at Riverside Community Hospital on Monday afternoon. "He's 
just tired. Doing his father's work makes him tired," said the woman, who would 
not give her name but was sitting in a room beside Muhammad's 9-year-old son, 
Farrakhan, in the hospital's intensive care wing. 
</P>
<P>
 One visitor said Khallid Muhammad was grateful for the bodyguards who took 
bullets for him: "He said, 'If it wasn't for (them) I wouldn't be here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Fruit of Islam members guarded his hospital room, Muhammad received a 
steady stream of visitors, including his son and other family members. He also 
reportedly talked to Louis Farrakhan on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Monday, the Nation of Islam had released no statement regarding the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess was severely beaten by a crowd of people who witnessed the shooting. 
Authorities said he suffered a fractured shoulder, multiple abrasions and some 
lost teeth. He remained hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside police reported Monday that they confiscated not only the handgun 
allegedly used in the shooting, but also found a backpack containing two other 
guns and a hunting rifle in Bess' car, which was parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess, sources said, had been involved in internal disputes with Nation of 
Islam officials, including one who was a close friend of Muhammad and was near 
the scene of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 One knowledgeable source told The Times that Bess was removed about three 
years ago from his post as minister of a mosque in Seattle by a former Nation 
of Islam minister and official, Wazir Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess "apparently had serious personality conflicts with many of the members of 
this particular mosque," said the source. "There were many complaints from 
within the mosque." At the time Bess was suspended, Wazir Muhammad was Western 
regional representative for the Nation of Islam, responsible for the area west 
of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Los Angeles, Wazir Muhammad was said to be with Khallid Muhammad 
during the speech but not at his side when the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows that Wazir and Khallid are the best of friends," the source 
said. Wazir Muhammad succeeded Khallid Muhammad as minister of Mosque 27 in Los 
Angeles and is now West Coast bureau chief of the Final Call, the Nation of 
Islam's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Khallid Muhammad, in his role as a traveling national spokesman, was 
acquainted with Bess, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 But contributing to the mystery surrounding the shooting are indications that 
Bess may have shared many of the views of the man he allegedly shot. 
</P>
<P>
 An open letter to Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle published in a local paper four 
years ago and signed by a James E. Bess, criticized the city's black mayor for 
denouncing Nation of Islam leader Farrakhan after a speech by Farrakhan in 
Seattle. "Mr. Mayor," the letter stated, "never again let Jews twist your arm 
to denounce a good man -- Minister Louis Farrakhan." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman is himself a shooting victim and has appeared frequently on 
public-access television as a preacher of his own variant of Islam, according 
to an Associated Press account. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 19, 1988, it was reported, Bess was hit by two bullets in a gang 
shootout as he was making a call in a telephone booth outside a convenience 
store in the crime-plagued High Point neighborhood of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess has no arrest record in his hometown, said Police Sgt. Ed Striedinger, a 
homicide detective at the time of the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of eight, Bess also is known as Abdul Haqq Mohammad and goes by 
Brother James X and Brother James X Bess on his TV shows that, according to one 
viewer, have both promoted and departed from Farrakhan's points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 One Seattle resident, Syid Suni Askia, a self-described mainstream Muslim and 
not a follower of Farrakhan, was familiar with Bess and his television show. 
"For whatever reasons, (Bess) and the main body (of the Nation of Islam) had a 
falling out," said Askia. "So he had a self-styled ministry, speaking for 
himself. But he still saw himself as a loyal supporter of Farrakhan." 
</P>
<P>
 His broadcasts, aired two days a week, have been advertised in the Facts, a 
weekly black community newspaper, under the heading "Hear and See, Min. 
Farrakhan, a Living Witness of 'Jesus.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Topics for the shows have included "Farrakhan: The Special Spokesman," 
"Farrakhan: The Torchlight for America," "Farrakhan: 'God's Man on the Straight 
Path' " and "Farrakhan Speaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Bess once headed the local branch of the Nation of Islam but split from the 
organization of Louis Farrakhan a few years ago, Askia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's public knowledge that he was at odds with the people" running the Nation 
of Islam, Askia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Monday that by 
shooting Muhammad, his enemies make him a martyr. "What they do, is they confer 
on a person like Muhammad the status of a martyr and that would be very 
unfortunate, very unfortunate, because basically his message is one of hate," 
Hier said.

ROSTENKOWSKI REJECTS DEAL, VOWS TO FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Monday 
that he has chosen to fight charges of fraud and abuse of his public office 
rather than make a deal with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to lesser 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always fought for what I believe in. I strongly believe that I am not 
guilty of these charges and will fight to regain my reputation in court," 
Rostenkowski said in a statement issued Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks came on the eve of today's deadline by the government to accept or 
reject its plea-bargain arrangement. "That is a far more attractive option than 
pleading guilty to crimes that I did not commit," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision appears to make it certain that he will be indicted on a series 
of felony charges -- possibly as early as today, sources familiar with the case 
said. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Rostenkowski's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago lawmaker's lawyers had urged him to consider the deal being 
offered by U.S. Atty. Eric Holder, a Clinton Administration appointee. Although 
it was understood to have meant a one-year prison term and his resignation from 
Congress, the bargain would have spared Rostenkowski and his family a public 
trial and possibly a longer prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Under House Democratic Caucus rules, an indictment on felony charges 
punishable by a prison term of more than two years would mean that Rostenkowski 
would have to relinquish his chairmanship, until and unless he were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications of his removal go far beyond the effects on the 35-year 
congressional career of a single lawmaker. Rostenkowski, whose legislative 
deal-making skills are considered unparalleled in Congress, is one of President 
Clinton's most crucial allies in the Administration's uphill efforts to pass 
comprehensive health care legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, 66, was considered so vital to the passage of the health bill 
that Clinton went to Chicago to campaign for him earlier this year, when he 
faced a strong challenge in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ways and Means Committee has already begun deliberations on the health 
bill, and it now appears it will lose its chairman just as it is to start 
voting after Congress' weeklong Memorial Day recess. Ways and Means is one of 
five committees in Congress that have jurisdiction over the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, as negotiations between Rostenkowski and federal 
prosecutors reached a critical phase, a pall had settled over the House. While 
few House members had been willing to discuss it on the record, the situation 
had seemed to overshadow all the House's official business and was the topic of 
many whispered conversations in the corridors and cloakrooms of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chairman had agonized over the choice before him, the idea of 
pleading guilty had gone against all his instincts, friends said. "He finally 
came to closure late this afternoon," spokesman Jim Jaffe said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski is represented by Robert S. Bennett, a leading Washington 
attorney well-known for his defense of public officials and others accused of 
white-collar crimes. It is expected that Bennett, who also is representing 
Clinton against a sexual harassment suit filed by Paula Corbin Jones, could 
delay any trial until after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal investigation of Rostenkowski has been under way for more than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the charges that probably would be included in an indictment: 
</P>
<P>
 * That between 1985 and 1991, he illegally converted stamps from the House 
post office to cash for his personal use. A key witness against him is likely 
to be former House Postmaster Robert V. Rota, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
embezzlement charges last July. 
</P>
<P>
 * That he improperly used office funds to buy lavish gifts for friends from 
the House Stationery Store. On the advice of lawyers, Rostenkowski earlier 
reimbursed Congress for about $82,000 of purchases, without admitting 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * That he converted government-leased cars to his personal ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 * That he used government funds to pay "ghost employees" -- people who were on 
his payroll but did no work. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the charges could be such that the chairman would face a lengthy 
prison term, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Rostenkowski said he could convince the "ordinary citizens" 
of the jury that he was not guilty, just as he had done the voters of his 
district. But he conceded: "This will be a difficult fight." 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has vast resources at its disposal, but truth is on my side," 
he said. "I am confident that I will be vindicated, and I look forward to the 
return of the gavel." 
</P>

CLINTON SALUTES WAR DEAD, CALLS FOR VIGILANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the cusp of the 50th anniversary of D-day, President Clinton remembered 
America's war dead Monday as "the backbone that secured our nation's liberty" 
as thousands gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to pay homage to the 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing a Memorial Day throng of veterans, families and friends, Clinton 
said "it was the independence and the can-do confidence of the sons and 
daughters of American and the other democracies that won the day" on June 6, 
1944, when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of northern France and laid the 
foundation for Hitler's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The President leaves Wednesday for an eight-day trip to Italy, France and 
Britain, his first visit to those countries since taking office. A highlight 
will be ceremonies to commemorate D-day's golden anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 Allied soldiers were slain or wounded in the Normandy 
landing, which Clinton said started a battle that "was not just between two 
armies. It was as clearly as any conflict in all of human history a battle 
between two ways of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he mourned the suicide earlier this month of Lewis Puller Jr., a 
disabled Vietnam War veteran who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book after 
returning from the conflict. Puller was the son of the most decorated Marine in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning when I got up I thought of Lew Puller and the countless other 
heroes he has joined and the terrible sacrifices men and women have been 
willing to make for this great land," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He laid a red, white and blue-flowered wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at 
the cemetery earlier in the day. The President also hosted a White House 
breakfast for veterans, telling them the nation must be vigilant in fighting to 
uphold its freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe our liberty and prosperity to the strength and valor of those who 
fought" in World War II, he told the veterans. "But we also inherit the 
responsibility of defending that gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Arlington Cemetery speech was greeted with warm applause from the 
4,000 people packed into an open-air amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 He ignored a lone heckler, who shouted "Go back to Oxford, you traitor, 
draft-dodger." Clinton's avoidance of the military draft while in college in 
the late 1960s brought harsh criticism from veterans during his 1992 
presidential campaign, and last Memorial Day -- his first as commander in chief 
-- he met with heckling and a cool reception when he spoke at the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 The President tried to comfort families of Vietnam soldiers still missing in 
action by underscoring "our solemn obligation to find answers for those whose 
loved ones served but were never accounted for." 
</P>
<P>
 He urged parents to teach their children about World War II, offering as an 
example the story of a Missouri elementary school librarian who brings D-day 
veterans and other war survivors to speak to students every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To honor, we must remember," he said. "Today, somewhere in America, a curious 
child rummaging through an attic will stumble upon his grandfather's insignia 
patches, a pocket guide to France, a metal 'cricket,' a black-and-white photo 
of a smiling young man in uniform. But learning about those times and those 
deeds must be more than accidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers signaled with metal "crickets" to locate each other in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans of wars from World War I to the Persian Gulf War knelt or laid 
flowers among the rows of white headstones that blanket the gentle green slopes 
of the cemetery. Soldiers from a nearby Army base planted small American flags 
in the soil in front of each of the 250,000 graves last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the ceremony was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), who was injured in combat in World War II. Afterward he signed 
autographs with his wife, Elizabeth, explaining that "I come out here every 
time I get a chance when I'm not home." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important day for all the reasons everyone already knows, but 
it's also a time to think about what a great country we live in," he said. "We 
think about those who lost their lives and those who were wounded, but I think 
the sacrifice was worth it."

POPE REAFFIRMS HIS STAND: NO WOMEN PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stern veto, Pope John Paul II reasserted a ban against women priests 
Monday, ordering Catholics to end internal debate and obey historic teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a righteous, authoritarian apostolic letter addressed to his bishops, John 
Paul marked his first day back in the office after four weeks in a hospital for 
a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 His resounding "no" to any possibility of a greater religious role for 
Catholic women in their church was the second time in a week that the Vatican 
has crossed swords with assertive Catholic women. Before returning to the 
Vatican on Friday, the Pope accepted an English translation of the church's new 
catechism that women's groups have denounced as sexist for its language. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's 1,000-word letter, "On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone," 
is remarkable for its bluntness and the absolute authority that John Paul 
asserts "in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great 
importance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly 
ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held for all 
the church's faithful," he writes in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentals of their faith make it impossible to ordain women as priests, the 
Pope tells his bishops, noting that Jesus "acted in a completely free and 
sovereign manner" in selecting only men as his apostles -- the first priests. 
Still, John Paul laments, despite an all-male priesthood unbroken across two 
millennia, "in some places it is nonetheless considered open to debate." 
</P>
<P>
 No more, in the Pope's view. An accompanying Vatican commentary said the 
letter "confirms a certainty which has been constantly held and lived by the 
church." As such, the Pope's views are not to be regarded as new, or an 
opinion, or a matter of discipline, "but as certainly true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, since it does not belong to matters freely open to dispute, it 
always requires the full and unconditional assent of the faithful, and to teach 
the contrary is equivalent to leading consciences into error," his commentary 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, 74, who has been increasingly outspoken in recent months, will host 
a private meeting at the Vatican on Thursday with President Clinton, who may 
get a papal lecture about his support for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate the Vatican no longer wants to hear among Catholics, advocates of 
women priests say Jesus' choice of disciples was determined by customs and laws 
of the time, not because he sought a unisex ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's vigorous restatement of the ban may have been prompted in part by 
the ordination of the Church of England's first women priests in March, an 
innovation that effectively scuttled reunification talks between the two 
churches. Thousands of Anglicans and hundreds of Anglican priests have turned 
to Catholicism. The Vatican is even accepting married Anglican priests as 
converts -- and priests -- despite its own ban on married priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbying among Catholic activists for women priests has increased since the 
Anglican ordinations, a Vatican official noted. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul has now fired an unanswerable broadside in response. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope clearly intends for the ban to stick, because he comes right up to 
the brink of infallibility with this teaching. Still, it is not infallible, and 
therefore it is open to possible change by some later Pope," said one senior 
theologian. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Catholic dogma, Popes are infallible in matters of faith and morals when 
they say they are giving infallible teachings. John Paul has never given one. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women joining orders of Catholic nuns has fallen dramatically in 
industrialized countries in the last 20 years, and a recent survey of nuns 
showed that many felt they are underutilized in the man's world of their 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisiting themes he addressed in a 1988 letter on the role of women in the 
church, the Pope said the fact that Mary, Jesus' mother, did not become a 
priest, "clearly shows that the non-admission of women to priestly ordination 
cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity, or can it be construed as 
discrimination against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although women may not become priests, their role in the church remains 
"absolutely necessary and irreplaceable," in the Pope's view. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting a 1977 Vatican statement rejecting priesthood for women, he says that 
"Christian women should become fully aware of the greatness of their mission: 
Today, their role is of capital importance both for the renewal and 
humanization of society and for the rediscovery by believers of the true face 
of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been inflexible on expanding the role of women to the 
ministry, last month the Vatican agreed to U.S. demands that altar girls serve 
at Roman Catholic Masses where the local bishop and parish priest agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican spokesmen stressed at the time, however, that the decision was not a 
new initiative but rather "an interpretation of existing church law." 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision has nothing to do with ordained ministry, which has a different 
juridical and doctrinal nature," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said then. "It 
would be wrong to interpret this as the first step toward women priests." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, John Paul himself hammered the point home: The Roman Catholic 
Church will launch its third millennium with a men-only priesthood.

PALESTINIANS FACED WITH CASH CRISIS; MIDEAST: NEWLY AUTONOMOUS AREAS HAVE 
VIRTUALLY NO FUNDS TO PAY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES. LEADERS FEAR DECLINE IN SUPPORT 
AND POSSIBLE DISORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even a month old, the Palestinian Authority is facing a crisis that could 
bring its collapse -- an acute shortage of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although promised $2.4 billion for economic development over five years, the 
new Palestinian administration has virtually no funds with which to operate -- 
no money to pay its police and civil servants, no money to maintain local 
hospitals, trash collection and other public services, no money for its own 
telephones and office lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is very, very serious," said Saeb Erekat, the authority council 
member for local government. "Our institutions are brand new, and they need 
money to operate and meet the people's needs. Without money, they won't 
function. The whole effort could fail for the lack of start-up funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders fear that public support for the self-governing authority, 
which already is controversial as a product of many difficult compromises with 
Israel, will decline rapidly if it falters in any way; thus, inability to pay 
its workers, maintain public services and expand the economy could lead to a 
total loss of legitimacy and perhaps rebellion against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Freij abu Midan, a Gaza Strip lawyer with responsibility for justice on the 
authority council, warns of possible food riots in Gaza if the new 
administration does not receive enough assistance to begin full operations and 
to launch its initial development programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had many promises that we would get the money as soon as we signed the 
Cairo Agreement on autonomy," Abu Midan said in Gaza City. "It has been nearly 
four weeks, and we have received only a fraction of our immediate and most 
urgent needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis is so serious that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is looking 
at ways to assist the Palestinians, perhaps by continuing a public works 
program that employs 16,000 in the Gaza Strip, perhaps by lending the 
Palestinian Authority some of the operating funds it will need for June. "I am 
worried because, if it will not work, it will not take more than three months . 
. . until there will be no food," Rabin said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Israeli officials, military and intelligence alike, have sketched 
alarming scenarios of possible riots, bloodshed and even civil war for the 
impoverished Gaza Strip, home to more than 850,000 Palestinians, if the new 
authority does not establish itself fast and effectively -- with the money to 
back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless money is immediately pumped into the institutions of the Palestinian 
autonomy by the donor countries, these institutions will collapse within days 
or weeks," Dr. Ahmad Tibi, an adviser to Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, warned in Jerusalem. "Clearly, this will damage the 
peace agreement immensely and perhaps irretrievably." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the mounting concern, Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian Authority 
member, sought to assure the Palestinian police and civil servants Monday that 
they would be paid in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money's there," he told a news conference in Jerusalem, alluding to a 
$19-million emergency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan abu Libdeh, deputy managing director of the Palestinian Economic 
Council for Development and Reconstruction, added, "I can say that every single 
person will be getting his salary on time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Abu Libdeh, whose organization is administering development projects, said 
the authority would have to tap various foreign sources to meet the payroll -- 
and he named only one, the Johan Joergen Holst Peace Trust Fund, named for the 
late Norwegian foreign minister who brokered the peace agreement between Israel 
and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials estimate the Palestinian Authority will need $600 million to 
$700 million a year to administer the Gaza Strip and the West Bank; the 
Palestinian police force alone will cost about $105 million. Local revenues may 
come to only $200 million to $300 million, depending on local tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The development program, starting with the 27-year backlog of public works but 
reaching well beyond to the industrialization of some regions and the 
rehabilitation of agriculture in others, will cost at least as much on an 
annual basis, Palestinian economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The money has been slow in coming for these reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Western donors, mistrustful of Arafat, his secretive ways and past 
profligacy, have insisted on full accountability of how their money is spent. 
Arafat, wanting to ensure his own control of the funds, was slow in staffing 
the Palestinian Economic Council, approving its bylaws and appointing a Western 
investment bank, Morgan Stanley Asset Management, to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many Western governments prefer to finance specific projects -- and to give 
contracts to their own companies, thus boosting their exports, as well as 
providing foreign aid. This has led to a proliferation of proposals to PLO 
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, for projects such as the construction of 
airports, offshore generation of electricity and a new telephone system, while 
immediate needs have been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Palestinian Authority's own tax collections will probably not start for 
months. A new tax system must be adopted to replace the one imposed by the 
Israeli army during its occupation; the new administration would like to lower 
the burden carried by local businessmen to foster an economic resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat said he hopes the Western countries that pledged extensive economic 
assistance and development advice last September when Israel and the PLO signed 
the autonomy agreement will now free substantial amounts to underwrite the 
authority's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were born without a penny, and we are told that our ability to cope will 
test our readiness to govern ourselves," Erekat said bitterly. "In a sense, 
this is right -- if we can run Gaza and Jericho without cash, we are miracle 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of real help, we are getting one delegation of experts after another, 
flying in first-class and business-class from around the world, spending money 
on hotels and meals that we could use to pay salaries, and then telling us they 
will make a recommendation after the summer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians place the U.S. Agency for International Development in this 
category of donor, although Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally 
ordered payment of $5 million of the American pledge of $500 million to help 
speed deployment of the Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat said that authority members, back from weekend meetings with Arafat, 
were now organizing departmental staffs, drawing up 100-day action programs and 
working out their budgets. The Palestinian Economic Council, established last 
November to funnel foreign assistance into priority programs and coordinate 
development projects in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, will then seek funds from 
the World Bank and individual donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a danger that our planning will become donor-driven rather than 
Palestinian-driven because of the restrictions on the assistance," Samir 
Abdullah, a senior official of the Palestinian Economic Council, said, "but the 
immediate problem is starting the cash flow -- today."

COLUMN ONE; PUTTING THE HEAT ON THE DEFENSE; LAWYERS CLAIM THE GOVERNMENT IS 
USING SUBPOENAS, IRS AUDITS AND PRESSURE TACTICS TO TARGET THOSE WHO REPRESENT 
HIGH-PROFILE DRUG AND MOB SUSPECTS. PROSECUTORS SAY THE FEARS ARE EXAGGERATED.

<P>
 Prominent defense attorney Patrick Hallinan was alone, reading in the library 
of his luxurious, mountaintop Marin County home, oblivious to the strangers 
lurking outside. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash of guns and a blur of barked commands, a dozen armed men burst into 
the mansion and forced the shaken lawyer to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Hallinan thought he was being robbed. Then he spied the letters "DEA" 
on their black leather jackets. The truth hit him like a bullet, sinking in 
with wrenching, humiliating clarity as handcuffs were slapped on his wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 The intruders were federal drug agents and other law enforcement officers. 
They hauled the lawyer off to jail on charges that could put him away for life. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested because a former client in a drug smuggling case had turned 
government informant. In hopes of a lighter sentence and in exchange for other 
considerations, the client agreed to testify that Hallinan laundered drug 
profits for him and coached a federal grand jury witness to lie. Hallinan 
denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The August arrest has sent shudders through much of the nation's criminal 
defense bar. Feeling vulnerable after a decade of increased federal scrutiny, 
many defense lawyers believe that the government has been selectively targeting 
their most effective colleagues in hopes of discouraging zealous representation 
of accused criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government denies any crackdown. "There is no concerted effort to 
go after the defense bar," U.S. Justice Department spokesman John Russell said. 
"We go after criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers' fears are not without foundation. During the past several 
years, the government examined attorneys who represent drug dealers, 
white-collar criminals and organized crime figures, subpoenaing many to testify 
about their clients, threatening to confiscate their legal fees and prosecuting 
some for criminal complicity. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another unsettling signal, the Internal Revenue Service in December 
began levying hefty fines against lawyers who failed to report the names of 
clients who paid them large sums in cash -- even though identifying those 
clients could make them vulnerable to prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 study published by the Brooklyn Law Review, 80% of the criminal 
defense attorneys responding to a survey said they believed the Justice 
Department intentionally prosecuted attorneys to inhibit zealous representation 
of defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 1,648 respondents, or 42% of those mailed questionnaires, two-thirds said 
they had received a grand jury subpoena or an IRS summons, discovered 
government confidential informants at defense meetings, had their fee 
questioned by the government for possible forfeiture, had their office 
searched, or had the government attempt to disqualify them from a case. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys who reported most of these problems represented accused drug 
dealers and white-collar criminals. They also were among the highest paid and 
most experienced of their profession, according to the study by William J. 
Genego, then a clinical professor at USC Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scrutiny has had profound effects on how defense lawyers practice law, 
the study said. Nearly half of the lawyers said fear of prosecution had 
prompted them to change their practices. Some turned down cases if they thought 
the focus could shift to them. Others rejected clients out of fear that the 
government would take their fees, alleging that the money was earned in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years after the completion of the study, defense lawyers said in 
interviews that their precautions have exacted a price. Some have stopped 
accepting cash as fees and have lost clients. Many said they tend to be 
suspicious of clients, particularly if they are new, and speak to them only 
guardedly, as though they were being recorded, or only in the presence of a 
witness. Many say the fear of government prosecution has diminished their 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how good a lawyer you are," said attorney Donald Beskind of 
North Carolina. "Once they are coming after you, it is very hard to focus on 
your client." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal laws passed in the 1980s have made it easier for the government to 
target criminal defense attorneys, creating a series of legal minefields. Some 
lawyers have felt the chill of hearing their conversations with criminal 
clients played back to them in court: They were overheard on federal wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
 To help lawyers avoid these hazards, legal magazines feature such articles as 
"Staying Out of Jail" (tips for defense attorneys), and "Crime Doesn't Pay -- 
but Counsel May." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors dismiss this so-called war against the criminal defense as 
a figment of the lawyers' overwrought imagination and deny claims that they 
have encouraged defendants to inform on their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the clients are telling the lawyers one thing, and the prosecutors 
and the agents another thing," said San Francisco U.S. Atty. Michael Yamaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say their offices are particularly careful if the target is a 
lawyer, and they usually cannot proceed without approval from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Justice Department, the federal government in the fiscal year 
ending in October issued 975 subpoenas of lawyers or their records in 
connection with clients they represented, most of them in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers become suspects only when they cross the line from representation to 
"promoting or facilitating" illegal acts, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen 
Nelson. "It's usually an evolutionary thing," the San Diego federal prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on such a theory, federal prosecutors indicted three San Diego 
attorneys in recent years in connection with their representation of drug or 
mob clients. A federal judge in 1991 disqualified two prominent New York 
lawyers from an organized crime trial after prosecutors charged that they were 
part of their client's criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the San Diego lawyers was acquitted, a second pleaded guilty to reduced 
charges and a jury acquitted the third of one count and was hung on others. 
Former New York mob lawyer Michael Coiro was treated more harshly: He is in 
prison, convicted in 1989 of racketeering on behalf of Gambino crime family 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest of Hallinan underscored the dangers of representing major drug 
dealers and other clients who may be under federal investigation. Federal 
agents searched his law offices and home, and the government wants to seize his 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys suggest that Hallinan may have been asking for trouble if he 
did what prosecutors charge: putting money that belonged to the client into his 
personal bank account, purportedly to shield it from the IRS, and creating a 
fictitious officer for an offshore corporation allegedly used to launder drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant U.S. Atty. L. Anthony White, who is prosecuting Hallinan in 
Reno, said the evidence against him "goes far beyond a lawyer who was 
aggressive in representing his clients" and shows that he engaged in "criminal 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping indictment alleges that Hallinan was a co-conspirator in a 
drug-smuggling operation and charges that he told his former client to "get rid 
of" a cooperative government witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those San Francisco defense lawyers seem to think he is entitled to some 
(break) because he is a lawyer," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest of so prominent a lawyer caused an uproar. His father, Vincent, was 
a legendary trial attorney. His brother, Terence, is a member of the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, 59, nicknamed Butch, is widely liked and considered an excellent 
trial attorney. Jurors are said to love his gentlemanly style, his unassuming 
manner. Prosecutors tend to respect him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat is a wonderful man," said U.S. Atty. Yamaguchi, who is not involved in 
the Hallinan case. "He's a surgeon when he does cross-examination. He doesn't 
pound it out of witnesses. He just goes through and makes the right cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallinan's pending trial this summer has only magnified the tension festering 
in the defense bar since the government stepped up prosecution of drug and 
white-collar criminals a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina attorney Beskind said he switched to a civil practice eight 
years ago because his "paranoia" about government prosecutors began to 
interfere with his obligations to his clients. "Everything you did, you had to 
worry about," said Beskind, a senior lecturer at Duke University Law School. 
"Not whether it was right or wrong, but could it be misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
 The final straw, he said, came when a federal prosecutor threatened Beskind 
and his partner with an obstruction of justice indictment for their handling of 
a union client accused of stealing federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The client used information the attorneys gave him in a union election against 
an opponent, who happened to be a cooperative government source. Federal 
prosecutors charged that the lawyers had attempted to punish the government 
witness, Beskind said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the lawyers were not indicted, the threats were unnerving. "It 
required us to hire a lawyer and turn our focus away from our client to 
worrying about ourselves," Beskind said. 
</P>
<P>
 David F. Axelrod, who prosecuted lawyers as a former assistant U.S. attorney 
in Florida, said racketeering laws and other federal statutes aimed at drug 
dealers give the Justice Department "powerful weapons" that create "an enormous 
potential for mischief." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Axelrod defends people accused of white-collar crime, the Columbus, 
Ohio, lawyer strives to be cautious: "I always try and talk to clients as if I 
am being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can sometimes make it more difficult to establish a relationship of 
trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamaguchi said it is not uncommon for a prosecutor to pick up the telephone 
and hear an accused criminal offer evidence against his lawyer. "Then you say: 
'Buddy, I can't talk to you,' and you hang up," Yamaguchi said. "If a defendant 
is willing to turn in his lawyer, he is willing to turn in you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the once chummy relationship between prosecutors and defense 
attorneys has largely vanished. The "code of honor" between attorneys, the 
frank, open exchanges and the drinks after a day in the courtroom gave way to 
distrust during the war on drugs in the 1980s, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody got tainted," he said. Some defense attorneys got too close to 
their drug-dealing clients. Some prosecutors engaged in misconduct in the 
government's zeal to nab drug dealers, he said, and judges were split into two 
camps -- the pro-war and the anti-war. 
</P>
<P>
 That "was just a very terrible time for the bench and bar," he said. "It 
divided people, just like the Vietnam War or the Civil War. . . . We lost a lot 
of ourselves in that." 
</P>
<P>
 The war on drugs had other effects on the legal profession. It created a new 
pool of affluent defendants, attracting more lawyers to criminal defense work. 
A few got rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that some prosecutors resent the fact that I may have 
earned large fees," said Barry Tarlow, a nationally prominent criminal defense 
attorney, who is believed to earn $500,000 to $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow has the trappings of wealth that many people might envy. He drives a 
black Jaguar convertible. His second car is a navy blue limousine. And he lives 
in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, Tarlow obtained the release of a man accused of drug crimes. 
He said his client was arrested not long afterward by Los Angeles police on 
another drug offense. The client, according to Tarlow, was released on bail the 
second time after he lied to the police, claiming he could implicate Tarlow in 
his crimes. Because of the age of the case, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
police could neither confirm nor discount Tarlow's version. 
</P>
<P>
 The client arrived for an appointment at Tarlow's office, according to the 
attorney, and then picked up a paper and pen off his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say anything," he wrote. "I am wired. Tell me to come back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow said he followed his instructions, and the client jumped bail and 
eluded the police for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tarlow, who primarily defends white-collar suspects, the episode was a 
lesson in the power of the government to try to entrap attorneys by promising 
leniency to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 A former federal prosecutor, he and many other lawyers follow certain rules 
"for staying out of trouble." He does not invest with his clients. He will not 
pass on messages for clients and their associates: He could be accused of 
helping to arrange a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not socialize with his clients. He will not purchase property for 
them, just in case the property might one day be used in a crime. He does not 
accept gifts, for fear of possibly being accused of accepting stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense lawyers note that attorneys who represented certain kinds of 
clients have always received government scrutiny. For instance, lawyers 
defending leftist radicals during the 1960s and 1970s found themselves and 
their offices under FBI surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 New York criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who helped famous 
fugitives surrender, including former radical Abbie Hoffman, said each time he 
has been approached by people he assumed were undercover government agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had people come to me and ask me to do illegal things," such as 
helping them jump bail or obtain false identification, he said. "Do I know for 
sure they were sent by the government? I can't be sure, but people involved in 
crime don't come off the street and get a stranger and ask him to do something 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefcourt is now handling cases for attorneys facing stiff fines because they 
did not tell the IRS the names of clients who paid them more than $10,000 in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first eight months of 1983, 465 of 796 lawyers who filed the tax 
form on cash receipts left it incomplete, said an IRS spokeswoman. They face 
fines of as much as $100,000 for each form filed without the client's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the reporting requirement applies to other trades and businesses 
besides lawyers, some Bar associations prohibit attorneys from identifying 
their clients without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 A client with no visible means of income would appear suspicious if his lawyer 
reported that he paid him $80,000 in cash. Many clients also do not want to 
leave a trail showing they consulted a criminal defense attorney, particularly 
if they are not yet under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the IRS said the forms are important in tracking down narcotics 
traffickers and other criminals and note that courts have ruled that such 
disclosures do not violate client confidences. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers also risk losing their fees if the money was earned in crime 
or laundered. Willful blindness is no defense. A Justice Department spokesman 
said the government has confiscated attorney fees in 65 to 70 cases since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not seem like many, but Genego and other lawyers contend that it is 
misleading. Lawyers often drop clients as soon as prosecutors threaten to 
forfeit their fees, making forfeiture unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Genego said he may have to drop a client who paid him an "asset" he would not 
identify because a federal prosecutor has threatened to forfeit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are dirty lawyers out there and some need to be prosecuted," Genego 
said, but he believes the government has gone too far in some cases. "It 
intimidates the private defense bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Ethical dilemmas in the criminal defense bar. Taking Action 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent of 1,648 criminal defense attorneys responding to a survey said 
they believe the U.S. Justice Department intentionally prosecuted attorneys to 
inhibit zealous representation of defendants. Sixty-seven percent said they had 
been the object of actions by federal prosecutors. Here are the types of 
actions and the percentage of attorneys who reported being subjected to them: 
Confidential informants used against them: 39% Disqualification sought: 26% Fee 
questioned: 21% Grand jury subpoena: 18% IRS summons: 11% Law office searched:

BREYER'S PUBLIC LIFE OFFERS FEW CLUES TO PRIVATE BELIEFS; SUPREME COURT: THOUGH 
AMBITIOUS, NOMINEE HAS TRIED TO HAVE PRACTICAL IMPACT. BUT LEANINGS ARE 
UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When friends and colleagues of Judge Stephen G. Breyer search for anecdotes 
about him, what they recall is his career advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Sullivan, now a law professor at Stanford University, was starting as 
a member of the Harvard Law School faculty when she met Breyer. At a faculty 
reception, Breyer urged her to get involved in "something like the federal 
sentencing commission -- something practical." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need intellectuals to get involved in projects that have an impact on 
people's lives," Sullivan recalls Breyer telling her. 
</P>
<P>
 To Akhil Amar, who worked as a law clerk in Breyer's judicial chambers and now 
teaches at Yale Law School, the judge offered a more direct suggestion: After 
listening to his young clerk's plans for a series of law review articles, 
Breyer counseled him that to really have an impact, he should write a book. And 
he should not wait too long, Breyer added. "I really wanted to have a book 
before I was 40," Amar recalls him saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The advice, as Breyer told those he counseled, was autobiographical -- 
reflecting twin elements of his life that explain why Breyer now stands on the 
edge of an all-but-certain confirmation to the nation's highest court: a strong 
desire to use his formidable legal talents to make a practical impact beyond 
Ivory Tower theorizing, coupled with a keen appreciation of the quickest, 
surest routes toward his own advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every move he has made has paid off," said his friend Alan M. Dershowitz, a 
Harvard Law School professor and noted criminal defense lawyer. "Steve just 
never makes a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Breyer's path has been so smooth and steady as to appear almost 
effortless, it has provided few clues to answer the ultimate question: If he is 
to become a leader of the Supreme Court, as President Clinton hopes, where 
would Breyer take it? 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer has become well-regarded as an expert on federal regulatory law, about 
which he has written influential articles and books. But by contrast with 
several past Republican nominees, who had staked out clear ideological 
positions before being chosen, Breyer has made almost no public comment on 
constitutional law or on such controversial topics as abortion or privacy 
rights or affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is a lot like President Clinton in many ways. He's a pragmatist, a 
centrist with an enormous array of friends," said Dershowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of his goals, Breyer has traveled a route from Stanford to Oxford 
to Harvard to a Supreme Court clerkship, back to Harvard, to the staff of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and then to the federal appeals court bench -- 
mixing academic work with immersion in practical politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve has the same philosophy his father had," said his aunt, Shirley Black, 
whose brother, Irving Breyer, was a prominent attorney and public servant in 
San Francisco, counsel for nearly 40 years to the city school board. "It's 
doing the most good for people. If you want to help people, you should try to 
gain power." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he has impressed and charmed scores of people scattered through 
the upper reaches of American law and politics, from the late Justice Arthur M. 
Goldberg, who used to tell friends he hoped to see his former clerk one day don 
a justice's robes; to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), for whom he worked in 
1974-'75 and again in 1979-'80 as a top Judiciary Committee aide and who then 
secured an appeals court judgeship for him in the Jimmy Carter Administration's 
closing days; to such conservatives as Sens. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.), whose support for him has virtually guaranteed a smooth 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 What he has not done, conceded another longtime friend, Peter Edelman, is live 
a life that makes "good copy." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's biography includes no epic struggle, none of the up-from-obscurity 
morality tale that so delights (and sometimes deludes) American audiences. At 
home in Cambridge, Mass., in a comfortable house not far from the Harvard 
campus, Breyer lives the life of a conventional and successful member of the 
American intellectual and policy elite -- enjoying fine food, wine and 
conversation, rooting for his hometown baseball and basketball teams, running 
and riding a beat up, one-speed bicycle to stay fit, driving a dark blue Volvo 
station wagon, sending his three children to Harvard, Stanford and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 55 years of life and 30 years as a lawyer, a law professor and a judge, 
Breyer "has never represented the underdog and never been an underdog," said a 
prominent Washington attorney and friend who is otherwise highly complimentary 
of the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of drama in his life, Breyer could become one of the most 
influential public figures of his generation. Many lawyers who study the court 
believe Breyer has a strong chance of being far more than merely one vote among 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The current court, in the opinion of most lawyers and academics who study it, 
notably lacks a leader. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin 
Scalia, who could exercise leadership by virtue, respectively, of position and 
intellectual prowess, stand too far toward the judicial right to do so 
effectively. The justices in the court's conservative center -- David H. 
Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy -- have shown little ability to 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, of the nine men and two women placed on the court in the last 
generation, only Scalia and, perhaps, Clinton's other nominee, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, come close to matching Breyer's record of legal scholarship, 
intelligence and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many federal judges complain frequently about the crushing 
burden of their workloads, Breyer was able to handle the work of an appeals 
court judge while still teaching at Harvard, playing a central role on the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission and educating himself about architecture to guide the 
construction of a new federal courthouse in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, unlike Ginsburg, who often has appeared to associates as distant, 
shy or aloof, Breyer is gregarious and charming. His experiences heading a 
Senate staff, on the court of appeals and on the sentencing commission 
demonstrate that he is a highly effective small-group politician who inspires 
genuine affection on the part of those who have worked under him and loyal 
friendship from those he has served. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only open opponent to his nomination so far has been consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader, who objected that Breyer has sided with big business too 
often in antitrust cases and has been too skeptical of federal regulatory 
efforts. But in a telling example of the network of Breyer's friendships, 
Nader's top lawyer, Alan Morrison, is a close friend of the nominee's who has 
defended Breyer's views. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's judicial opinions on antitrust prove little. He is clearly no 
economic populist, but the Supreme Court's conservative rulings on antitrust 
cases over the last two decades give lower court judges relatively little 
leeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But his views on regulation reveal more about him. Breyer's writings show a 
desire to bring order to messy legal problems and an underlying belief, 
reflective of the California progressive tradition in which he grew up, that 
government programs are subject to improvement by careful, expert thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's work on regulation also reveals his skill at practical politics. As 
an aide to Kennedy, he played a key role in winning approval of federal airline 
deregulation, though he and Nader, who was an ally in the effort, later 
criticized the Ronald Reagan Administration's unwillingness to use antitrust 
laws to police the deregulated airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In his writings, Breyer has objected to the wholesale efforts at deregulation 
pushed during the Reagan Administration but also criticized the weaknesses of 
many current regulatory programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, delivering Harvard's prestigious Oliver Wendell Holmes lectures, he 
described system-wide problems of regulation. In particular, he objected to the 
tendency of regulators to spend 90% of their energy cleaning up the "last 10%" 
of a problem. He also described the difficulty of allocating scarce regulatory 
resources rationally given the way the public and Congress overreact to some 
minor risks -- he cited intact asbestos in existing buildings as a prime 
example -- while underemphasizing more serious ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's desire to bring order to complex subjects, as well as his ability to 
bridge ideological gaps, also can be seen in his work on the federal sentencing 
commission, a body set up in the early 1980s to end disparities in sentences 
imposed by different federal judges for similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, many members of the commission believed they could devise formulas 
to cover every possible circumstance that might influence a sentence. In 
practice, however, the effort quickly bogged down amid disagreements over 
attempts to weigh various types of heinous acts, as well as ideological 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer convinced both sides to drop their more ambitious goals. Instead, 
relying on a statistical study of some 10,000 sentences handed down by federal 
judges, he constructed a formula that eliminated wide disparities by largely 
ratifying existing average practices. 
</P>
<P>
 While that experience provides a clear picture of his leadership abilities, 
neither his appeals court opinions nor his scholarly writings indicates much 
about Breyer's views on the great constitutional issues that attract attention 
to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 That absence of comment has made some liberals uneasy about Breyer's imminent 
ascension to the high court, particularly given his endorsements from such 
prominent conservative voices as Hatch and the Wall Street Journal editorial 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's choice has caused more than a little behind-the-scenes grumbling 
from Democratic liberals who have complained that, after years in which 
Republican presidents carefully sought out strict conservatives for the court, 
President Clinton has now chosen two justices, Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
who joined the court last year, who are known for moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's friends have responded in recent days, arguing that as a justice he 
will emerge as a newly liberated champion of an updated form of judicial 
liberalism -- one who will uphold strong protections of civil rights and civil 
liberties but be more skeptical about the ability of federal judges to improve 
society than was the case during the court's liberal era under former Chief 
Justice Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Breyer has achieved his ultimate goal, argued Dershowitz, "all the 
constraints are off. There's nothing else he wants in life." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar prediction is made by Edelman, who serves as counselor in the 
Department of Health and Human Services and who, along with his wife, Marian 
Wright Edelman, who heads the Children's Defense Fund, is also a longtime 
friend of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very deeply committed to civil rights issues," Edelman said, citing 
Breyer's work handling civil rights measures as chief counsel to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, make more tentative judgments. John Hart Ely, former dean of 
Stanford Law School who now teaches at Yale, clerked for Earl Warren the year 
Breyer clerked for Goldberg. The two then taught at Harvard together for 10 
years and served in Washington together in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guessing he'll be protective of civil liberties, but that's an inference 
from the fact that he's generally a fairly liberal Democrat," Ely said. "The 
only thing we ever discussed at length was deregulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend, Philip B. Heymann, who until recently was the Administration's 
deputy attorney general, offers a compliment that not all of Breyer's liberal 
doubters will find reassuring -- likening Breyer to the late Justice John M. 
Harlan, who was by many accounts the most distinguished justice of the last two 
generations, but who also dissented from many of the Warren court's liberal 
rulings. Like Harlan, Breyer has strong views, but also a deep intellectual 
honesty that allows his views to affect, but not decide, his judicial 
decisions, Heymann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't predict his positions, but you can detect his opinions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's steady march toward the nation's highest court began in San 
Francisco, where Irving Breyer and his wife, Anne, raised Stephen and his 
younger brother, Chuck, who is also now a lawyer, in a modest, two-story home 
in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in the shadow of the University of San 
Francisco. Their street was bordered on one side by the university and the 
other by a private college for women, symbolic, perhaps, of the place that 
education took in the family's list of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Education came easily to the young Breyer. In addition to his classes, he 
insisted that his parents, who were Jewish but religiously unobservant, send 
him to religious school on Sundays, Chuck Breyer recalled. As a college 
student, he later taught religious school at a local synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anne Breyer pushed constantly for him to be "well-rounded," his brother 
recalled, chiding that -- if he did not put his books down and go outside -- he 
would end up like her brother, Leo, a curmudgeonly man who taught for a brief 
time at Radcliffe College and then retired to a book-lined study for a life of 
reading and avoiding others. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Breyer insisted that her son take part in sports, although he was not 
particularly good at them, and attend camp, although once there his tender feet 
quickly won him the nickname Blister King. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in a pattern that would become typical of his life, Breyer 
persevered and excelled, becoming an Eagle Scout at 12. "He wasn't very popular 
but he was well known as the troop brain," recalled his Scoutmaster, Bob Anino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breyer boys attended the city's prestigious Lowell High School, the elite 
academy of the San Francisco public school system. There, Steve Breyer took an 
active part in the school debate team, competing against the likes of future 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., who attended rival St. Ignatius Loyola High 
School. In 1955, Breyer graduated with only one B marring an otherwise 
straight-A record. He was voted "most likely to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the brightest kids in my 30 years at Lowell," said Paul Lucey, 
his economics and social science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer wanted to go on to Harvard but bowed to the wishes of his parents, who 
feared, again, that he would become too bookish, and attended Stanford instead. 
After graduating, he won a Marshall Scholarship to attend Oxford, where he 
picked up a fascination with economics, then went on to study law at Harvard, 
where he became an editor of the law review and quickly developed a reputation 
as one of the school's bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1964, Breyer received word that Goldberg had selected him as 
a clerk for the high court term beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians recall the 1964-65 term primarily because of Griswold vs. 
Connecticut, in which the court for the first time recognized a constitutional 
right to privacy in sexual matters. The court held that states could not forbid 
married couples from buying or using contraceptives, a ruling that laid the 
grounds for Roe vs. Wade a decade later that guaranteed women the right to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, according to fellow clerks, helped Goldberg draft his opinion. But the 
opinion's central idea that a right to privacy could be grounded in the Ninth 
Amendment, which protects rights not listed elsewhere in the Bill of Rights, 
was one that Goldberg had toyed with earlier and provides little evidence of 
Breyer's views. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several years, Breyer worked in the Justice Department's 
antitrust division. He also met the woman who in 1967 became his wife. She is 
the former Joanna Hare, an Englishwoman who then was working as an assistant in 
the Washington office of London's Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Breyer, now a psychologist at Boston's Dana Farber Clinic, was the 
daughter of Lord John Blakenham, a British political figure who was a leader of 
Britain's Conservative Party. The marriage contributed heavily to Breyer's 
current wealth. According to his financial disclosure forms, which report 
assets in broad categories, the couple has at least $3.2 million and perhaps as 
much as $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From Washington, Breyer returned to Harvard to teach regulatory law but he 
continued to visit the capital, working for several months in 1973 on the 
Watergate prosecutions, joining two other Harvard colleagues as aides to 
special prosecutor Archibald Cox. In 1974, he accepted Kennedy's offer to head 
the staff of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on administrative law. In 
1979, he returned to Washington again, this time as the Judiciary Committee's 
chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 That background, plus his years on the bench, made Breyer an immediate 
candidate for the "short list" of high court nominees when Clinton returned the 
White House to Democratic hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when he arrived in Washington last year for a luncheon interview with 
Clinton, in pain from a bicycle accident in which he had broken a rib, White 
House officials and Breyer's friends believed the Supreme Court job that was 
then open would be his. That afternoon, as he stretched out on the floor of 
White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum's office to rest, officials told him to 
delay his return to Cambridge and begin preparing an acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Clinton pondered his choice, Breyer's lack of an engaging life story 
-- a factor that has always had strong appeal to the President -- did him in. 
Clinton opted instead for Ginsburg, a pioneer in women's rights whose biography 
offered more excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, disappointed, returned to Cambridge but characteristically avoided any 
negative comment about Clinton's selection and conspicuously attended 
Ginsburg's swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, with the White House already finding that it had more 
excitement than it could handle, a nominee with a conventional background and 
broad support in the Senate seemed newly appealing. Breyer's time had come.

MERCHANTS HOPE WORLD CUP KICK-STARTS SLOW ECONOMY; SOCCER: BUSINESSES BET ON A 
$623-MILLION BONANZA. RESIDENTS DREAD CROWDS. SO FAR, HOTEL BOOKINGS LAG. 
</P>

<P>
 Tom Rosenstein spent an afternoon fixing his espresso machine, ordering 
foreign cigarettes and figuring out how to say "Welcome World Cup" in 15 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 With tens of thousands of tourists descending on the Rose Bowl in a few weeks 
to watch seven matches and the championship of the international soccer 
tournament, Rosenstein and hundreds of other merchants and restaurateurs are 
hoping the event will be their ticket out of the financial doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup organizers figure the tournament will give a $623-million kick to 
the region's economy between June 17 and July 17 -- a month of tourists 
shopping, dining and finding other ways to spend money. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a world class marketing blitz has begun to overtake Los Angeles. At 
the corner convenience store you can buy your official World Cup mug. For your 
official World Cup wardrobe -- from hat to shoes -- stop by any of your 
favorite malls. On the way there, of course, you will undoubtedly see 
billboards pitching the products of some of the tournament's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the final game arrives, the World Cup's mascot, Striker the Dog, 
could rival Barney the Dinosaur as Los Angeles' most overexposed celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how big is all this supposed to get? Some Pasadena officials say it will 
be like cramming the crowds of eight Rose Parades into a span of less than a 
month. If the numbers hold, it would be a dream come true for the Chamber of 
Commerce, but a nightmare for some of the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, forget about a July wedding in Pasadena. Hotel and reception 
rooms in the city are a scarce commodity during the final week of the 
tournament, although room bookings during June have been disappointingly low. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pasadena plans dozens of events to lure tourists, some residents have 
begun plotting their escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic, the noise," said Rosemary Lonergan, who lives near the Rose 
Bowl. "I'm going to Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic, crowds and revenue estimates aside, American soccer buffs are using 
the event as an opportunity to tout their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 During June and July, soccer groups and officials throughout the Los Angeles 
area will be sponsoring workshops and cultural festivals to raise community 
awareness and bring together locals and foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein, who owns the Pasadena Creamery yogurt shop and the General Store 
in Old Pasadena, said he is determined to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the 1984 Olympics, we were all supposed to get rich and that didn't 
happen," Rosenstein said. "I'm going to keep my expectations realistic. I don't 
expect to make a year's worth of revenue in one month. But we hope to get our 
share of what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 If the giant welcome sign fails to lure customers into his Colorado Boulevard 
yogurt shop, Rosenstein will offer another incentive to hungry tourists: an 
international ice cream sundae, complete with French vanilla ice cream and 
Italian gelato, espresso-flavored. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be creative if you want to compete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tourgeman, owner of the nearby World Classics clothing store, hopes to 
win over visitors with used Levi's and a wide selection of bowling shirts, the 
kind Dad used to wear in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retro. Everything is very, very retro," Tourgeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the foreign travelers who are into the Seattle scene, Tourgeman has 
expanded the grungewear section. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure everything American will be big sellers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner at Game Trends, a novelty shop off Colorado Boulevard, store 
manager Erin Noonan has spent the past four months stocking up on World Cup 
trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 For $12.99, you can buy a candy jar with a miniature soccer ball and shoes 
sealed inside the glass lid. A pack of playing cards decorated with the World 
Cup emblem is available for $4.50. And for big spenders, there's a giant nylon 
banner picturing a soccer ball. The price: $53. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another benefit from the tournament besides increased tourism dollars, 
Noonan said. It's the foreign men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have visions of Raul Julia and Andy Garcia," said Noonan, age 19 and 
single. Grinning, she added: "It will be very, very nice to see the Spanish and 
the Colombian guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Bride-to-be Amanda Beall, however, dreads the giant soccer fest. She had no 
idea what the World Cup was -- until a few months ago, when she started 
planning her July 23 wedding in neighboring San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is struggling to find hotel rooms in Pasadena to accommodate relatives 
when they arrive from Connecticut the week of the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called literally five or six hotels looking for rooms. Nothing," she said. 
"Picking this date was a big, big mistake. If I had known, I would have totally 
done it differently. Can you imagine the human overload in Pasadena?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a city that has become accustomed to throngs of people descending on 
its doorstep for the Rose Bowl every New Year's Day and for an occasional Super 
Bowl, this will be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just going to be terribly difficult to get in and out of our houses," 
said Lonergan, who lives on a street north of the stadium. "The Rose Bowl is 
different. It's over in one day. But this is going to go on all month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions that are not valid. We'll probably all 
survive, although a little worse for the wear. I can tell you, I've written all 
the game dates down on my calendar." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl schedule goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 On June 4, the United States and Mexico will play an exhibition game. On June 
18, the tournament starts with Colombia playing Romania. On June 19, it's 
Cameroon vs. Sweden. On June 22, the U.S. team plays Colombia. And on June 26, 
the United States plays Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 The second round will be held July 3, the semifinals July 13, and the third- 
and fourth-place games July 16. The championship game is July 17. Tickets -- 
which range from $30 to $75 -- are sold out for most games. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike any other sporting event, the World Cup takes place at nine venues 
nationwide, including San Francisco, Dallas and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Pasadena has extensive plans to keep the soccer fans -- who are 
often boisterous and sometimes violent -- under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, the city announced that it would prohibit alcohol within 
the Rose Bowl. It has also asked all residents living around the stadium to 
apply for special parking permits just to get to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Police Department, which has been undergoing riot training, will 
bolster its force with officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department and the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be eight days of crowds even larger than Jan. 1," Pasadena Mayor 
Kathryn Nack said. "We are doing everything we can to make it bearable for the 
families who live on the edge of the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman and Trudi Bradley, who have lived on Linda Vista Avenue next to the 
Rose Bowl for 30 years, said they are trying to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it presents an inconvenience to us because of the traffic 
problems," Trudi Bradley said. "But at the same time it is very exciting for 
Pasadena to have this happening here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Pasadena hotel officials, however, are worried that the city may be 
overestimating the crowds. As of last week, there were still rooms available 
during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is somewhat of a disappointment to us," said Robert Yeoman, general 
manager for the Pasadena Hilton. "Going into the program, we had assumed that 
we would be full during the entire 30 days of the tournament. But during the 
first few weeks, we still have plenty of rooms available." 
</P>
<P>
 During the final week, however, the hotel is completely booked, Yeoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is going to be a nail-biter to the bitter end," he said about 
filling the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena is not the only Southern California community trying to attract the 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Glendale, city officials have spent $15,000 to organize local 
activities related to the World Cup and hire a public relations firm. The 
activities include a soccer relay along an 18-mile course June 11 and street 
parties June 24 and July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Glendale Galleria, a number of stores are prominently displaying World 
Cup merchandise, from T-shirts and caps to jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a longtime recession. We see this as a stimulus," Glendale Mayor 
Eileen Givens said. "Glendale is anonymous to a lot of people who don't live 
here. This is a chance to make a name for ourselves. We're looking to seize the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all about making money. It's about winning converts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not now, never," said Frank Rojas, president of the California Soccer 
Assn. and a local official for the World Cup in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups throughout the region will participate in SoccerFest, a giant soccer 
expo, in an effort to attract players to the sport. The event, which will be 
held at the Los Angeles Convention Center July 8-17, will feature international 
entertainment, educational displays, soccer clinics and player appearances. 
Meanwhile, four soccer fields will be constructed in central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased attention brought by the World Cup seems to be paying off for 
soccer buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas said that when he became president of the California Soccer Assn. in 
1990, there were about 23,000 adult members in Southern California. Now there 
are 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time there are full-blown color pictures in the newspapers and 
soccer scores on the radio stations," Rojas said. "That should generate an 
awful lot of new members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have 17 million people playing soccer countrywide. If they don't 
(play), they will."

<P>
 Giggles. That's what she gets for uttering the "f" word. Naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Hands on the hips of her faded jeans, lipsticked smile starting to crack, Lucy 
Swindell is perched casually at the podium, calling the swim coach ' 'a damn, 
picky bastard ," making snide comments about the new girl's butt. She saunters 
around, ticking off a string of forbidden phrases -- words that rhyme with 
"class," "spit," "witch" and, of course, "luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the teen-agers are laughing out loud, trying to swallow nervous snickers 
as this 51-year-old woman -- their teacher, for gosh sake -- forges ahead: " It 
wasn't exactly an orgy of pleasure for me, you dumb . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the vocabulary you expect from a high school English teacher, but 
Swindell is just reading aloud from the assigned text, Judith Guest's novel 
"Ordinary People." Chapter 3 to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell has been teaching this book at La Palma's John F. Kennedy High School 
in the Anaheim Union High School District for more than a decade. For just as 
long, people have been telling her -- and teachers nationwide -- not to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinary People" is among the most frequently challenged books nationwide, 
says the Washington-based public-interest group People for the American Way. 
Last year, California led the nation with more censorship struggles than any 
other state -- including one concerning "Ordinary People" in the Anaheim school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 To delve beneath the political debate, The Times spent a month studying the 
book alongside Swindell's students. A reporter watched classroom sessions, then 
read students' personal reflections in daily journals, essays and poems 
exploring the characters' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Published in 1976 and later made into a film that won the Academy Award for 
Best Picture, "Ordinary People" is a 263-page bestseller about 17-year-old 
Conrad Jarrett, who grew up pampered in suburban Chicago, then lost big brother 
Buck in a boating accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Racked with guilt over Buck's death, the teen slits his wrist, leaving blood 
in the bathroom and himself in a psychiatric hospital. Despite problems 
communicating with his harried tax-attorney father and self-centered socialite 
mother, the boy survives. But it remains unclear whether the family will. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the big fuss? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's the frank talk about suicide. Fights between parent and child, 
including some harsh back talk. Musings about masturbation and premarital 
intercourse between Conrad and his girlfriend. Plus, the teen-agers in the book 
talk like teen-agers, which means slang and swearwords. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell says she teaches the book to help build cross-generational discussion 
of dysfunctional families and teen estrangement. That's just what keeps it on 
the firing line. Critics dislike Guest's portrayal of teen and family life and 
fear that reading about the Jarretts' inability to communicate will stifle 
teen-parent dialogue rather than foster it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no place in a teen-ager's hands in an English class," argues Treva 
Brown of Anaheim, a single mother of four who led the local protest against the 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown lists 26 reasons why "Ordinary People" doesn't belong on district- and 
state-approved reading lists. Language, sexuality and suicide are her top 
concerns, but she also contends that the story is "boring," the author 
unimportant and the vocabulary too simple to merit a spot in the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare the district allow books laced with words banned in its own 
discipline code? 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised (my) kid to be a fine young man who doesn't curse, who doesn't 
swear, who believes that sex before marriage is wrong," Brown said. "I put him 
in the public school system, expecting them to go beyond what I had given him, 
and they give him this nonsense. It was a slap in my face and a slap in my 
son's face." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim school board and the California Department of Education have both 
rejected Brown's request to ban the book, and a recall movement against several 
Anaheim school board members failed last month. But the controversy continues, 
with Brown promising to revive the issue in next fall's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Ordinary People" is still being taught. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy High was the first in the nation to be named for the slain President 
when it opened in 1964. At the home of the Irish, all is green and yellow: 
healthy lawns under bright sun; kelly cheerleading uniforms with butter trim; 
pale walls with bold letters: "Ask not what your country can do for you. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Classroom No. 3 in the corner of the campus sits Swindell, who started 
her career in the 1960s. Now she coaches future teachers and advises half a 
dozen student clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a school with a student body that includes 24% Asian, 17% Latino, 5% black 
and 5% Filipino, one of Swindell's five sophomore English classes includes 
immigrants from Burma, Taiwan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Korea, Mexico, Romania, 
India, Samoa and the Philippines. They sit in a horseshoe, surrounded by 
posters praising racial unity, world peace and environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 One front-row seat contains Sean Temple, a hockey lover whose writing shows 
sharp wit and intellect. Nearby sits Mike Caira, who flirts a lot with the 
girls behind him, then flirts with Swindell to get out of inevitable 
detentions. Then there's Brian Castles, a bright boy whose dad also teaches 
English at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A gold "Sweet 16" ring adorns one girl's hand. The hands of Kristin Jondle and 
Ronnie Ellision, a couple who do homework together, are usually intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet Kristen Vetica seems unmoved by the novel, but her journal reveals 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 To wake the students up one morning, Swindell asks each to name one of 
"Ordinary People's" many themes. "I could use this novel for a whole year," she 
says. "We could build a whole course on this, couldn't we?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Swindell's yearlong syllabus includes the requisite Shakespeare, 
Julius Caesar; classic English-class tomes "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Lord of 
the Flies"; "Fahrenheit 451," Ray Bradbury's futuristic tale of book-burning; 
Lorraine Hansbury's play, "A Raisin in the Sun"; and "Ordinary People." 
</P>
<P>
 Some books are there for lessons in literary structure, vocabulary, character 
development, metaphor and narrative style. "Ordinary People," she says, 
provides life lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin with the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we're going to determine in this novel is that there is no 
such thing as ordinary people," explains the teacher. "We're all ordinary, but 
we're all extraordinary in one way." 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell knows that relatively few teens will lose a sibling to tragedy, but 
that most have trouble talking to their parents. Only a handful ever step 
inside a psychiatric hospital, but all shudder before their first date and 
experience stress over extracurriculars. They've lied to their parents, kept 
secrets, worried about the changes in their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, Swindell takes a poll: What are teens' biggest problems?  
</P>
<P>
 Of 33 students in one class, 17 name drugs as their No. 1 worry. Eleven say 
sex. Parents: five. Violence: three. Depression: four. "Peer pressure?" 
Swindell suggests. They all nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, writing in the journals Swindell requires them to keep all year, the 
students list their personal troubles. Too young to drive; too poor to afford 
auto insurance. There are divorce survivors and veterans of switching schools 
-- or switching countries. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy lives here; his parents work in Taiwan. A girl has an alcoholic 
stepfather. Another's mother "works two jobs, and when she comes home she 
sleeps. We don't have time for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 A white student's mother won't allow her to date blacks. Another student's 
father doesn't allow dating at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a reason to get up in the morning, it is necessary to possess a 
guiding principle. A belief of some kind. A bumper sticker, if you will. People 
in cars on busy freeways call to each other Boycott Grapes, comfort each other 
Honk if You Love Jesus, joke with each other Be Kind to Animals-Kiss a Beaver. 
They identify, they summarize, they antagonize with statements of faith."  
</P>
<P>
 The students are lost in the opening passage, the opening pages. Guest 
confuses them by alternating narrators, switching between Conrad and his father 
from one chapter to the next. They hate Conrad's stream-of-consciousness 
blabber. Many cultural references seem dated -- they don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't read the book, if they don't like the book, how will Swindell 
make her points? 
</P>
<P>
 A week passes, and half the class hasn't cracked a page; the assignment 
calendar says they should be through Chapter 15, but the students concede they 
are on Chapter 3, maybe 4. Swindell keeps reading aloud, devotes a class to 
silent reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms folded across his book bag, Sean is silent but not reading. Instead, he 
stares at the guy next to him selling Blow Pops, at the girls across the room 
rubbing lotion on their hands, at the threesome in the corner passing prom 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean is an A student, but "Ordinary People" strikes him as, well, kind of 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's worth reading, but I don't know if anybody in this class really 
wants to read" anything, he shrugs. "Most people are probably thinking it's 
kind of lame." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in early journal entries, most students seem less than enchanted with 
the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book seems very boring," Brian Castles writes during the first week. "It 
doesn't have any action, and all it does is tell about a boy's life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad is a very troubled boy, stuck in a complicated life. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed final exams getting shock therapy in the hospital, so now he's stuck 
in junior classes -- his friends are all seniors. He can't stand his 
once-beloved swim team; it now reminds him of his dead brother. Worst of all, 
Conrad thinks his mother wishes he had died instead of Buck when the two 
brothers got caught in a storm while sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 In class, Swindell harps on the family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, the students sit with magic markers and white paper, 
brainstorming in groups, making lists of "things that tear us apart as a 
family" and "what holds us together." Another day, the groups prepare skits 
depicting a typical day in the life of various stereotypical families. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first major writing project in connection with the novel, each student 
interviews a relative, then writes an autobiographical family history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn more about your family," Swindell explains. "I want you to 
learn more about your family." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, it is the first time in awhile they have spoken to their parents 
about school -- or about anything, really, beyond negotiating curfew or 
borrowing the car. 
</P>

 A boy who failed English in the fall is the first to turn in the essay; his 
mother calls Swindell, jubilant, saying: "My son actually talked to me about an 
assignment!" Another student writes 28 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are on Chapter 13, the painful scene in which Beth confronts Conrad 
about having hidden his quitting the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I would have told you," Conrad says, "if I thought you gave a damn! 
. . . You never wanted to know anything I was doing, or anything I wasn't 
doing; you just wanted me to leave you alone!"  
</P>
<P>
 The students grow quiet, reflecting perhaps on their own parental battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky to have a mom who listens to me," one girl says. "But I never 
thought she did until I read this book."

 Kristin Jondle and Ronnie Ellison stride into class together, sometimes grab a 
smooch before the bell rings, then sit side-by-side in the back row. As the 
teacher talks, they hold hands across desks. She leans her head on his 
shoulder, fiddles with his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their smiling eyes lock whenever Swindell talks about Conrad and his 
girlfriend, Jeanine, whenever the classroom discussion turns to dating and 
romance and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 " Conrad's head is on his arm, one hand curved around her breast. . . . His 
heart floats inside his chest. His skin feels branded everywhere that she has 
touched him. . . . ," Swindell reads from Chapter 30 as the nervous laughter 
and snickers begin anew. " Gently, he asks her, because now he is her protector 
against the world, "Did I hurt you?"  
</P>
<P>
 Kristin and Ronnie have been dating about a year, and have not been involved 
sexually. Since reading "Ordinary People," they've been bugging Swindell and 
her boyfriend to join them on a double date. And the book has helped the young 
couple discuss sex in a new way, Kristin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need sex out in the open. Teen-agers these days are more explorative," 
she writes in her journal. "Parents don't want to talk about it, so books or 
magazines are teen-agers' only source." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatting later, she adds: "I've tried to talk to my mother about it, but she 
graduated in '75 so she thinks totally differently!" 
</P>
<P>
 Her own feelings are a bit conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I want to, but other times I think it's fine where it is right 
now," Kristin says one sunny day in the campus courtyard. "Some girls that I 
know think 'I've got to do it to be popular.' Me? I take no BS from Ronnie." 
She laughs. "I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of books where girls who 
do it, the guy leaves and that is the last thing I want." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, sex brings Conrad and Jeanine closer. Afterward, the young lovers 
lie in bed, shyly sharing secrets: she tells of her parents' divorce and a 
previous sexual encounter she regrets then, as she traces the scars on his 
wrist, he tells of his attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicide," a student calls out, "is a permanent solution to a temporary 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 They've finished the book, and psychologist Sharon Garrett is visiting class 
for the day, trying to debunk some common myths. Like the notion that if 
somebody says they want to commit suicide, they're probably not serious. Or 
that once people try to kill themselves, they never get over suicidal feelings. 
Or that suicide is random, arising without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried so many different things. Starvation, a blade, and other stuff, too," 
one student writes in her journal, recalling her own suicide attempts several 
years before. "I even tried to overdose on Tylenol. I guess I just wanted 
attention, and I couldn't get any because of my attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "To even think about it now I feel so stupid. I'm glad I didn't kill myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad seems glad, too, until he reads in the newspaper that a friend from the 
psychiatric hospital has killed herself. Reeling with pain, the boy's thoughts 
race back to the boat accident, his bloody suicide attempt, and his long 
hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He walks swiftly, without direction. To calm himself. To get away from 
dreams, because there are worse ones and he doesn't want to remember them, 
doesn't want to think at all, less intense, less intense, but how to do it?"  
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Vetica, a 15-year-old basketball star, gets glassy-eyed as Swindell 
reads the frightful passage. She's thinking of her own friend, who shot himself 
to death as Kristen read the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be somebody that was going to commit suicide, and there's 
nothing that anybody can do about it," she sighs. "If you don't talk to anyone 
and tell what's going on then no one's ever going to know how you're feeling 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, the students have gotten into it. They carry to class 
anecdotes of family life, their own alienation, their curiosities about growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who were bored and confused by the opening pages now gush about what 
they've learned. Once put off by the differences between '70s Midwestern 
suburbia and '90s Orange County, they now ooze with empathy for the 
protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally a book we can relate to," says one girl. "A book to help us 
understand we're not alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Brian Castles, who lamented the lack of action, is converted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that no matter what happens in my life, no matter how drastic, I 
will try to never blame myself for it if it wasn't my fault," Brian writes in 
his last journal entry of the "Ordinary People" unit. "I also learned that 
stress can trigger big emotions in your life, and that committing suicide makes 
no help whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Every day, Swindell wears an enamel red AIDS ribbon on her lapel. Last year, 
she marched in the Paris gay-pride parade. She's not afraid to make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the fuss over "Ordinary People" -- and, by extension, her class -- 
just offers a chance for another life lesson: Stand up, speak out, do what you 
think is right. She's been teaching the novel for a decade, but now she's on 
the stump, talking about censorship over breakfast at the Kiwanis Club, in her 
sermon at church, during her housewarming party. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I do it is because so many teachers do not. They're embarrassed," 
she explains. "I raised four boys." She laughs. "I can't get embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, things get sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Caira, a precocious student who gets good grades but doesn't like to pay 
attention, asks permission one morning to use profanity for a classroom 
exercise about family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to," the boy says. "Just a little bit, to get our point across." 
Holding up the book, Mike reminds the teacher how Guest employs racy language 
to make her characters more real, her story come alive. "How come they can but 
we can't?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now Swindell is giggling, like the class did that first day when she read the 
text aloud. 'There's a difference," she says, shaking her head a firm "no" to 
Mike's request, "between using it in a literary piece of work and using 
profanity to put people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years after it was published, author Guest is surprised that 
"Ordinary People" is still making headlines, especially for the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The themes in the book are way more threatening than the language," Guest 
said of the book that earned a prestigious award for "best first novel" of 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of (Conrad's) recovery is also the story of his autonomy, 
learning that neither of his parents are perfect, and learning that he can't 
keep living by these rules that he doesn't believe in," Guest explained. "That 
is the kind of material that some people think is subversive and threatening -- 
you can cover that all by complaining about the language." What's Your Opinion?

 In class, the students were often quiet. But each day in their journals, they 
responded to the novel, relating its many themes to their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the biggest problems teen-agers face? Why do people want to ban this 
book? Do you find the language in the book offensive? Is life fair? What is a 
dysfunctional family? What did you learn from the novel? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the students' reflections: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teen-agers have something to do with drugs or sex, and the ones that 
don't want to do or talk about either subject end up being laughed at or losing 
friendships because they choose to say no. . . . We are going through a period 
of time when a lot of pressure is put on us about just anything people can 
think of, and this pressure doesn't always come from adults but from our own 
peers. It's a very confusing time because you're stuck in between being a kid 
and an adult, and you don't know which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My number one problem is my parents. I've been a problem child for a long 
while. I've been trying to improve, though, I really have, but my parents must 
not see it . . . we don't tell each other our problems, which lead to more. All 
we do is argue until someone is hurt. We never talk things out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate other stories that always use the same formula. They don't use the 
'normal language.' They stop when the story reaches the bad side of society or 
human beings. I don't think that is a good way to write the story. The world is 
not perfect. We do not need to cover up the bad side because we want to have a 
perfect world. Maybe the language is not necessary, but we cannot cancel all 
the bad language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I do find this novel rather strange and stumbling. Too much profanity for my 
taste. And I don't understand where they are or where they came from. But I 
guess I will have to read more and understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers don't like to read fairy tales, they like to read the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is confusing because what is ordinary people? I have never heard the 
words ordinary people before. What is an ordinary person? Is there really an 
ordinary person? I hope to answer this question when I read the novel . . . 
maybe!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all families are considered dysfunctional nowadays. No family is 
perfect. Because I know my family is dysfunctional. Actually, I don't know a 
functional family. But I think they should change the rating so that a normal 
family with normal problems should be considered functional." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People go to parties, have fun, and sometimes get carried away with things 
like drinking so they get drunk and vulnerable and then they're easy to take 
advantage of, then they have sex and, afterwards, when they're all sobered up, 
they regret what they did and they're too ashamed to tell someone about it, so 
they feel down and depressed, like they've been used for a good time and start 
taking drugs and others keep having one-night stands because that's what they 
feel is all they can get -- no relationship. So they get some kind of disease 
or even pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex becomes a big factor in your life at this age. You want to be able to 
brag about it to your friends and to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When do they think we should hear about teen-age suicide? When we are adults 
it will be too late! And the same with teen-age sex. It's very important that 
we talk about it before we do things we might regret, which many kids have. 
Also, most teen-agers are having or thinking about sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that there is no such thing as an 'ordinary' family. Everyone 
experiences problems and deals with them in their own way. Every family has 
feelings of guilt, loneliness, depression. Almost everyone experiences lack of 
communication, selfishness, family problems. I also learned you can't hold in 
everything. You have to communicate with others, because it will come back in 
your face or it will keep haunting you. Suicide is not something to joke about. 
You should take it like it's really going to happen. It's the safer 
assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that parents don't understand teen-agers. It's like they were 
born parents and never were teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't live with my mom because we don't get along too well. With my 
friends, some act so stupid that I can't stand to be around them. I was seeing 
a psychiatrist, but my mom was having financial problems so she took me out. So 
for now, I'm on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One important element in keeping a family together is communication. Not only 
do families have to communicate, but they also have to get along and respect 
each other. If the members of a family don't respect each other then, 
obviously, they would not get along, which would eventually lead to not 
communicating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has problems. Me and my dad are both stubborn and there really is 
no communication. A dysfunctional family is a family that doesn't talk at all 
and doesn't like to be around each other. All they do is yell and fight and 
argue. They avoid each other and don't eat together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A good family is like the Brady Bunch. That is a perfect family. The Bundys 
are a dysfunctional family. My family is an in-between, nice and not nice. I am 
a Brady Bunch/Bundy family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am a survivor. If something went wrong in my life, I do feel I would 
be able to handle it. If there was a death in my family, of course, I would be 
sad and not know what to do. But some way, I know, I would still be able to go 
on and be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "From this novel I learned that my own life isn't as bad as I thought it was."

BRAIN TUMOR FAILS TO DIM STUDENT'S HOPES FOR FUTURE; VALEDICTORIANS: ENCINO 
YOUTH REFUSES TO QUIT ATTENDING CLASS AND PREPARES FOR COLLEGE.

<P>
 Nothing will stop Birmingham High School valedictorian William Ress from 
collecting his accolades at the upcoming graduation ceremony -- not the 
recovery from four-hour brain surgery, not the daily radiation treatments, not 
the fear of death. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old Encino senior has lost most of his hair and much of his energy 
since January when doctors found a brain tumor behind his right eye. But Ress 
keeps on with the determination that has helped earn him straight A's through 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite advice from teachers, counselors and friends to study at home after 
the surgery five months ago, Ress is finishing his last three advanced 
placement courses on campus with his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a lot of people telling me to quit, I've really had to assert myself," 
Ress said. "But I would have felt like a quitter, like I didn't take on what I 
knew I could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early morning hours of Jan. 29, without warning, a seizure shook Ress. 
His rocking bed woke his parents in the next room. He was taken to a local 
hospital where, after a myriad of tests, doctors found the tumor. One week 
later, he was flown to San Francisco for surgery to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a month later, Ress was back at Birmingham, taking advanced 
placement courses in government, English and calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day after school, Ress braved radiation treatments at St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank that robbed him of his energy and his hair. Mingled with the 
professional baseball pennants, caps, posters and Little League trophies that 
clutter his bedroom are vivid reminders of his ordeal: the plastic mask he wore 
during radiation sits on a bookshelf by the door and three hospital 
identification wristbands are taped to the wall above his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They remind me that even though I am looking toward the future, looking 
toward college, I have to stop and smell the roses. I have to remember the 
people around me now," said Ress, who plans to attend Brown University in Rhode 
Island after a year at the UC Berkeley. He will continue to receive 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting cross-legged on his bed, a Brown University baseball cap masking his 
nearly bald head, Ress said of his experience: "I found out that I'm a lot 
stronger than I thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the importance of earning straight A's faded after the surgery, Ress 
said, he stayed in school to regain a sense of normalcy in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still want to do well, but it's not the top priority anymore," he said. 
"What's more important to me is I'm finishing, that I stuck this out to 
completion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ress grew up in a comfortable house on a quiet street in the Encino hills with 
his parents and older sister, who just graduated from UC Berkeley. He attended 
a private school for gifted students through the eighth grade, but went on to 
Birmingham High, as his sister had, because he wanted to meet students with 
backgrounds different from his own. 
</P>
<P>
 At first it was a shock, he said, going from an eighth-grade class of six 
students at The Mirman School to a campus where he knew only a handful of the 
3,000 teen-agers crowding the halls. But Ress quickly immersed himself in 
honors classes, motivated by a desire to go to college and an inner voice that 
he said had always urged him to excel. Soft-spoken and with an unassuming 
manner, Ress made close friends and impressed his teachers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a brilliant, charming young man," said Anita Gershten, his academic 
counselor at Birmingham. "He has a genuineness, a sincerity, that makes him a 
rare human being." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of his teachers like him and respect him," said Carmen Hermosillo, one of 
Ress' Spanish teachers at Birmingham. "He's a wonderful person." 
</P>
<P>
 During high school, Ress dabbled in photography, taught himself to play 
harmonica and faithfully followed his favorite baseball team, the Dodgers. But 
most of his energy was reserved for academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really devoted to my schoolwork," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden illness forced Ress to face his mortality in a way few teen-agers 
ever do. The tumor became the topic of conversation at home, Ress said. His 
father, who is an arthritis specialist, spoke to colleagues all over the 
country and read everything he could about tumors. But instead of feeling 
despair, Ress said, the illness and the powerful support of his family and 
friends that it summoned helped him look to the future with more enthusiasm 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our class song is 'These are the Days,' " said Ress, who will be graduated 
June 16. "But I don't think these are the days. A lot of high school students 
are living for now instead of looking toward the future. My life is in front of 
me."

TIMES O.C. POLL; FEW VOTERS HAVE CONFIDENCE IN COUNTY LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If California's new "three strikes" law governed civic leadership, most every 
elected official in Orange County would be looking for other employment. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to name a leader in the county -- and given three chances to do so 
-- more than half of the 600 registered voters interviewed in a Times Orange 
County Poll May 19-22 could not utter a single name. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who could provide names, respondents most often mentioned county 
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, and Sheriff Brad Gates, but 
no leader was named by more than 11% of those questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Some looked more to Orange County-based corporations, naming Taco Bell and 
hamburger giant Carl's Jr., rather than individual politicians or business 
leaders. One respondent even named Richard Nixon to the local leadership list 
in the poll taken nearly a month after the former President's nationally 
televised funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The void cited by poll respondents seems to be taking its toll on the public's 
general confidence in government's ability to deal with such serious issues as 
the lagging economy, increasing concerns about crime, immigration, gridlock and 
lack of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 9% of those polled said they have a lot of confidence in their city's 
elected officials to deal with the area's problems, while 40% said they have 
little or no confidence. And only 5% have a great deal of confidence in county 
leaders, while 46% have little or none. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people don't have a clear sense of who their leaders are, I think it's 
very difficult to solve some of the troubles we're facing today," said Mark 
Baldassare, who conducted the poll. "I think people sense there is a void." 
</P>
<P>
 For San Clemente florist Cheri Miramontes, 43, one of the poll respondents, 
local leadership has been virtually "invisible." Although Supervisor Riley has 
represented the South County for two decades, Miramontes said she barely 
recognized the name, let alone knew him as her county supervisor. The other 
four supervisors didn't even register on her political radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what any of them are doing," Miramontes said. "I know they aren't 
doing anything about crime. Maybe they are having lunch in Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Miramontes said the absence of any identifiable guidance is particularly 
troubling as the county struggles to deal with rising unemployment and, 
especially, crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This county used to be such a prosperous area," she said. "Now people are 
struggling, and they don't know where to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kim, a 20-year-old tutor and college student of Buena Park, was one in 
the 56% who could not identify a single county leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't make a significant impact," Kim said. "That's why I don't know who 
they are. Orange County has always been more of an upper-class area, where 
there is money in politics. It's kind of a game. If they are just going to play 
that game, I guess it doesn't matter who is (in charge)." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Miramontes, Kim said he is concerned about increasing crime and the 
spread of violence to areas virtually untouched in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is in charge of the Sheriff's Department needs to tighten up," he 
said." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors may be the ranking political leaders in the county, but 
poll respondents found them to be either unknown quantities or not very 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is running 
unopposed to succeed the retiring Riley, is better known and better liked among 
voters than the supervisors she is expected to join, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% expressed favorable views toward Riley, Vasquez and Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder. Supervisors Roger R. Stanton, who took office in 1980, and 
William G. Steiner, appointed last year, were the least known on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity rating of Steiner, newest member of the board, stood three 
points below that of his predecessor, Don R. Roth. The Roth rating was taken 
two years ago, before Roth's resignation and conviction on state ethics 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 While 40% of the voters found the board members to be performing well at 
promoting the county as a business center, three in 10 or fewer gave them equal 
grades for leadership, maintaining high ethical standards and representing the 
views of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Newport Beach businesswoman Lucy Erickson, another poll respondent, 
said she believes politicians are often and unfairly the target of community 
discontent. Part of the minority in the poll who believe government and 
business leaders are doing a good job, Erickson said she is "shocked" that more 
people don't take greater interest in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson knew the names of several county leaders. And she said she was more 
than familiar with state Sen. Bergeson as a leader -- Erickson described 
Bergeson as an acquaintance and has followed her political career closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected officials "are donating a lot of their time to public service," 
Erickson said. "I think it's a cop-out for people to say that they don't know 
who they should turn to or what's going on. . . . I know Marian Bergeson to be 
a woman of her word." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson was not the only one singled out for praise. Of the few local leaders 
who merited recognition, Sheriff Gates won the highest marks for job 
performance of any county official. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than 50% of the voters polled said Gates was doing an excellent 
or good job. However, Gates' county law enforcement colleague, Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi, did not fare as well. About as many voters -- 36% -- said 
they were unaware of Capizzi's performance as rated his work as excellent or 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, Baldassare said, the poll results tell a story of a 
relatively "immature" county whose leadership has become fragmented with each 
new municipal incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a region, the pollster said, whose identity has become muddled, 
partly due to its lack of a major television station that could beam local 
news, events and people to Orange County homes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first hints of a potential leadership crisis in Orange County came 
last September when some South County officials, frustrated by the lack of 
progress in planning the civilian conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, lashed out at the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmish spotlighted the county board's diminishing influence as the 
region's dominant political force and the emergence of both the new and 
established cities as rival political forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, former Irvine Mayor Sally Ann Sheridan described the lack of 
political consensus on El Toro as a "fundamental issue" in the future of Orange 
County government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is it going to be governed by?" Sheridan asked at the time. "A group of 
dinosaurs who make $80,000 a year each and do not have a mandate of the 
people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baldassare: "I think we're at a real turning point in Orange County. We 
have a military base closing. Jobs are not coming like they used to. Building 
has slowed down. We're trying to find ourselves. But when people can't focus on 
a set of people to deal with these issues, there are real serious limitations." 
Times Orange County Poll: Tough Test: Name Your Leader 
</P>
<P>
 When asked in a Times Orange County Poll to name an Orange County leader, more 
than half of voters cannot name anyone. Nevertheless, they did have something 
to say about the Board of Supervisors, namely that its ability to provide 
overall leadership has slipped in recent years. And two in three voters say 
that homeowner and neighborhood groups have too little influence in decisions 
affecting Orange County.

EZRA TAFT BENSON, LEADER OF MORMONS, DIES AT 94; RELIGION: THE CHURCH'S 
PRESIDENT- PROPHET ALSO SERVED IN EISENHOWER'S CABINET AS SECRETARY OF 
AGRICULTURE AND WAS ONCE KNOWN FOR HIS CONSERVATIVE POLITICS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ezra Taft Benson, the U.S. secretary of agriculture under President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower who put aside his advocacy of ultraconservative politics late in 
life when he became the president-prophet of the Mormon Church, died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 94 and died at his Salt Lake City home. He had been in failing health 
for some time, had undergone surgery four years ago to relieve a fluid buildup 
on his brain, and died of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to speak, Benson spent his last years under the 24-hour care of a nurse 
in his apartment across the street from church headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to his once outspoken support of the controversial John Birch 
Society and his ardent anti-communism, Benson's messages to the nearly 9 
million members of the church during his tenure as church president were 
spiritual ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson typically endorsed traditional morality and faith in the Book of 
Mormon, the church's principal Scriptures, and reasserted long-held Mormon 
beliefs about the sacred nature of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would classify President Benson as a man of steel and velvet," said Tom 
Thorkelson, a Mormon bishop and public affairs director for the Mormon Church 
in Orange County. "He was very forceful, a strong leader, very active 
politically, very conservative -- but at the same time, he had a soft, sweet, 
humble and self-effacing side to him that made him a very beloved person." 
</P>
<P>
 Lola Belnap, a 90-year-old Mormon of Laguna Beach, said she had been praying 
for Benson since hearing of his illness. "He was a wonderful president," Belnap 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson was 86 when he was named 13th president of the Mormon Church, formally 
known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on Nov. 10, 1985. He 
was the second oldest man ever to be installed in the powerful position, one in 
which Mormons believe the holder receives revelations from God. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded Spencer W. Kimball, who died at age 90. Presidents of the Mormon 
church serve for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's tenure was not marked by major pronouncements or new directions. He 
kept a low public profile by declining all interview and news conference 
requests, maintaining that church business took first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in seniority on the Council of 12 Apostles and Benson's likely successor 
is onetime Los Angeles lawyer Howard W. Hunter, who would be the first Mormon 
president born in the 20th Century. He is 86. 
</P>
<P>
 When Benson's predecessor, Kimball, was installed as Mormon president in late 
1973, it was widely thought that it would not be long before the second in 
line, the politically vocal Benson, would accede to the high church office. The 
ailing Kimball had undergone heart surgery only a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some church members, especially a liberal minority, openly speculated on 
whether Benson, if he survived Kimball, would use the church presidency for 
right-wing political ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson encouraged that speculation early in 1974, saying that it was "entirely 
possible" that the president of the Mormon Church might someday endorse 
political candidates, despite the church's carefully nurtured political 
neutrality in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 He had lauded the principles of the American Party, the successor to the 
American Independent Party, which had nominated Alabama Gov. George Wallace for 
President in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at that time felt he would be Wallace's running mate, but Wallace instead 
chose retired Gen. Curtis Le May. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, speaking to the fall church conference, Benson lamented that America 
was never so vulnerable to communism as it was then because the government, in 
his words, had allowed Cuba to become a Soviet military base and had permitted 
the Marxist takeover in Nicaragua, "the surrender of the Panama Canal (and) the 
infiltration by enemy agents within our American borders." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time Kimball died in 1985, Benson was rarely heard on political 
subjects. Church officials said upon Kimball's death that Benson had moderated 
his political views and that politics was "not really his agenda anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon Church experienced steady growth during Benson's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York, the church underwent 
vilification and persecution wherever it tried to establish itself in the 
Midwest, mainly because of polygamy, a practice rescinded in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 By World War II, Mormons were beginning to gain grudging respect from 
Americans for their clean living, hard work and the popular Mormon Tabernacle 
Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Mormons of the first half of the 20th Century, Benson had his roots 
in the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Aug. 4, 1899, in Whitney, Ida., he was descended from Mormon pioneers who 
accompanied Brigham Young on the westward trek to Utah in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of 11 children, Benson left the family farm in 1919 to study 
agriculture in college, interrupted his studies for two years of missionary 
service in England, then graduated from the church-run Brigham Young University 
in 1926. That same year he married Flora Amussen -- who died in 1992 -- and 
left for Iowa State University, where he earned a master's degree in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson returned to Idaho where, besides becoming a church leader in Boise, he 
was a county agricultural agent and secretary of the Idaho Cooperative Council 
from 1933 to 1939. In 1939 he moved to Washington to become executive secretary 
of the National Council of Farmers Cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by the church in 1943 to join the high-ranking Council of the 12 
Apostles, Benson returned with his family to Utah. He was installed on the 
council on the same day as Spencer Kimball, but a few minutes after Kimball -- 
a difference which placed Benson after Kimball in seniority on the council, and 
thus behind him for the church presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 He performed high-level volunteer work with the Boy Scouts and went on a 
post-war mission to Europe to aid the recovery of Mormon churches there. From 
1946 to 1950 he served as director of the Farm Foundation, receiving national 
exposure with zealous attacks on "paternalistic government" and his calls for 
farm groups to endorse the free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, President-elect Eisenhower named him to head the Department of 
Agriculture, an appointment interpreted at the time as a concession to the 
conservative wing of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Farm problems mounted in the 1950s. Despite a steady decline in farm 
population, improved technology at ever-larger farms produced crops in excess 
of the market demand. Previous administrations had bought the farmers' surplus 
and sought to bolster farm income with subsidies, or price supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson, who served during both of Eisenhower's terms, believed that the best 
long-term solution was for the farm economy to return to the free market of 
supply and demand. But a variety of proposed approaches, including flexible 
price supports, met repeated opposition from Congress and many farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 South Dakota farmers once pelted Benson with eggs when he spoke in favor of 
flexibility in farm programs. In his book "Farmers at the Crossroads," Benson 
wrote that 21 Midwestern congressmen stormed into his office demanding rigid 
price supports for hogs. He refused, and wrote that the price of hogs soon rose 
on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's name had surfaced in conservative circles as a possible candidate as 
early as the 1964 and 1968 presidential elections but his fervent 
anti-communist rhetoric and close identification with the John Birch Society 
was thought to limit his appeal to Republicans in general. The mini-movements 
also became of some concern to Mormon leaders who wished the public to see the 
church as loyally American but politically neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, David O. McKay, then church president, issued a statement criticizing 
the John Birch Society for questioning the loyalty of elected officials and for 
seeking "to align the church or its leadership with (the society's) partisan 
views." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, that same year, Benson extolled Birch Society founder Robert Welch "as 
one of the great patriots in American history" at a testimonial dinner for 
Welch at the Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 The church then asked Benson to spend the next two years directing the Mormon 
mission in Europe -- not an unusual assignment for a church leader, but one 
widely interpreted at the time as a way to remove him from political 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson and his wife had six children, all of whom survive, as do 34 
grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren.

in 1926. That same year he married Flora Amussen -- who died in 1992 -- and 
left for Iowa State University, where he earned a master's degree in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson returned to Idaho where, besides becoming a church leader in Boise, he 
was a county agricultural agent and secretary of the Idaho Cooperative Council 
from 1933 to 1939. In 1939 he moved to Washington to become executive secretary 
of the National Council of Farmers Cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by the church in 1943 to join the high-ranking Council of the 12 
Apostles, Benson and his family returned to Utah. He was installed on the 
council on the same day as Spencer Kimball, but a few minutes after Kimball -- 
a difference which placed Benson after Kimball in seniority on the council, and 
thus behind him for the church presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 He performed high-level volunteer work with the Boy Scouts and went on a 
post-war mission to Europe to aid the recovery of Mormon churches there. From 
1946 to 1950 he served as director of the Farm Foundation, receiving national 
exposure with zealous attacks on "paternalistic government" and his calls for 
farm groups to endorse the free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, President-elect Eisenhower named him to head the Department of 
Agriculture, an appointment interpreted at the time as a concession to the 
conservative wing of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Farm problems mounted in the 1950s. Despite a steady decline in farm 
population, improved technology at ever-larger farms produced crops in excess 
of the market demand. Previous administrations had bought the farmers' surplus 
and sought to bolster farm income with subsidies, or price supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson, who served during both of Eisenhower's terms, believed that the best 
long-term solution was for the farm economy to return to the free market of 
supply and demand. But a variety of proposed approaches, including flexible 
price supports, met repeated opposition from Congress and many farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 South Dakota farmers once pelted Benson with eggs when he spoke in favor of 
flexibility in farm programs. In his book "Farmers at the Crossroads," Benson 
wrote that 21 Midwestern congressmen stormed into his office demanding rigid 
price supports for hogs. He refused, and wrote that the price of hogs soon rose 
on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's name had surfaced in conservative circles as a possible candidate as 
early as the 1964 and 1968 presidential elections but his fervent 
anti-communist rhetoric and close identification with the John Birch Society 
was thought to limit his appeal to Republicans in general. The mini-movements 
also became of some concern to Mormon leaders who wished the public to see the 
church as loyally American but politically neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, David O. McKay, then church president, issued a statement criticizing 
the John Birch Society for questioning the loyalty of elected officials and for 
seeking "to align the church or its leadership with (the society's) partisan 
views." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, that same year, Benson extolled Birch Society founder Robert Welch "as 
one of the great patriots in American history" at a testimonial dinner for 
Welch at the Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 The church then asked Benson to spend the next two years directing the Mormon 
mission in Europe -- not an unusual assignment for a church leader, but one 
widely interpreted at the time as a way to remove him from political 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it was announced that he had been chosen to lead the church, Benson 
said only that he intended to continue the church's missions "to preach the 
Gospel, perfect the saints (faithful Mormons) and redeem the dead (a temple 
ceremony in which deceased ancestors are offered baptism by proxy into the 
church). We shall continue every effort to carry out this mission," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson authored nine books and numerous pamphlets, "all dealing with the topic 
of freedom as man's God-given heritage." He also was awarded four George 
Washington Honor medals by the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson and his wife had six children, all of whom survive, as do 34 
grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; FEDERAL PROBE IS CENTRAL ISSUE AS 4 CHALLENGE 
REP. KIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the June 7 primary approaches for Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar), election 
rivals have wasted no time unleashing an avalanche of criticism at him prompted 
by evidence of federal election code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "BETRAYED" is emblazoned in red on a black cover of the recent mailer from 
candidate Valerie Romero. The inside features a photo of the congressman with 
"FBI target" superimposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay Kim is being investigated by the FBI, the Federal Election Commission and 
the IRS. . . . Jay Kim has betrayed our trust and lost our respect," declares 
the mailer, which also includes a collage of newspaper articles detailing the 
congressman's legal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the charges and the negative campaigning, it is unclear if the 
investigation will cost Kim his seat. His primary challengers are not political 
heavyweights; none have held public office. In addition, they are likely to 
split the anti-Kim vote, leaving a large opening for the congressman, who with 
a primary victory under his belt would be well positioned for reelection. 
Republicans make up 48% of the voters in the district compared to 40% for 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowded nature of the (primary) field, all of them smelling blood here, 
probably means none of them will get to taste it," said Alan Heslop, a 
professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, issues such as violent crime, jobs and health care are playing 
second fiddle in the 41st District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Bernardino counties. The central issue is Kim's financial campaign 
dealings, raised by Romero and, to a lesser extent, the other three GOP 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 (For now, the two contenders in the Democratic primary, urban redeveloper Ed 
Tessier and attorney Richard L. Waldron, are leaving the issue of integrity to 
the Republicans). 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Kim became the target of a federal probe into possible election, 
tax and labor law violations after The Times reported that he secretly used 
about $480,000 from his engineering corporation to finance his 1992 federal 
campaign. Despite a prohibition on corporate contributions to federal 
campaigns, JayKim Engineers Inc. provided Kim's campaign with free rent, staff 
and office supplies, according to internal company records and checks signed by 
Kim that were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, Kim went on the offensive earlier this month, sending out a mailer 
that attacked the 30-year-old Romero as a political nobody who is relying on 
the wealth and reputation of her father, an auto dealer, to win the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her short life has not produced any marks of achievement," the mailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's mailer, which uses the theme "lies, lies, lies," also said Romero 
distorted the accusations against Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said she stands by her statements on Kim's legal problems and 
acknowledged her father's importance to her campaign while maintaining that she 
would be a good congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very clear about who I am," Romero said. "I'm a 30-year-old and I 
work in a family business." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, meanwhile, has been shunning public forums, running a low-key campaign 
and attempting to divert attention from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his only recent media interview on the investigation, Kim told the Daily 
Bulletin of Ontario that, at most, he is guilty only of a technical violation. 
He declined an interview request from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Kim, the first Korean American elected to Congress, has 
not hurt his fund-raising ability. 
</P>
<P>
 He reported raising $224,260 -- almost four times as much as his nearest 
challenger -- for his reelection campaign, according to his latest financial 
statement filed in Washington. That total includes a $23,000 personal loan Kim 
made to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Koreans and other Asian-surnamed donors contributed all but about 
$28,000 of the total. And the vast majority of donations came from out of 
state, from as far away as New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, meanwhile, has gone into debt to fund her campaign, making personal 
loans to her campaign totaling $70,000. According to the latest finance 
statement, Romero has raised $61,343 for her congressional bid, and spent 
$108,715. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of her campaign contributions came from the automobile 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kim focusing on issues such as health care and illegal immigration, 
supporters believe he will suffer little damage from the ongoing probe and 
emerge victorious in the primary and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents see it otherwise. "Our Republican seat is in jeopardy if Jay Kim 
wins the primary," Romero said. "The Democrats have targeted our district. We 
cannot afford to let this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her fund-raising ability, Romero is considered the strongest of the 
challengers. But as a political neophyte in her first campaign, she is still 
studying some of the key issues in the district. Asked her opinion of air 
pollution regulations and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which regulates stationary sources of pollution in the area, Romero responded, 
"I'm still looking into it." 
</P>
<P>
 She also acknowledged that she has voted in only two of the last seven 
elections, saying, "There's no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other three challengers, Bob Kerns, 38, who owns an oil field 
development company, ran for Congress in 1986, losing to Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Kerns has been more foot soldier than general. He has worked 
for various conservative candidates, including Pat Buchanan, who tried to 
defeat former President George Bush in the 1992 Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Thaker, 36, a lawyer who once served as director of intergovernmental 
affairs for then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, was a candidate in state Senate primary 
in 1992 but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a liability: he lives in Orange, outside the 41st District. Thaker said 
he plans to move into the district after the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald L Curtis, 48, of Upland, also running for office for the first time, is 
a mining company executive and Vietnam veteran who mentions his more than 70 
"confirmed kills" during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis says Kim "sold his vote" and betrayed the American worker by voting in 
favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the barbs have not prevented support for Kim, some of it coming from 
congressional colleagues and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Kim campaign mailer listed 26 statements of endorsement, including 12 
by congressmen from across the country and two by mayors of cities in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the endorsements came from Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach), the state 
congressional delegation's representative to the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay has been working very hard in Congress and deserves to be judged on his 
accomplishments here," Cox said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But some prominent Republican activists have signed on with the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James V. Lacy and former Assemblyman Charles Bader, who both lost to 
Kim in the 1992 Republican primary, have endorsed Romero. Together, Lacy and 
Bader received more than 55% of the vote compared to Kim's 30%.

ECONOMICS DOMINATES NON-ALIGNED NATIONS' AGENDA; DIPLOMACY: EAST AND WEST NO 
LONGER SEEK DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' ALLEGIANCE. AND WHAT THE 108 STATES MEETING 
THIS WEEK ARE AFTER IS MARKETS.

<P>
 The world seemed to be sliding inexorably toward violent confrontation, if not 
nuclear disaster, that day in 1961 when the leaders of Egypt, Yugoslavia and 
India declared themselves officially out of the running of the Cold War, laying 
the groundwork for a network of nations that would be neither of the East nor 
of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berlin Crisis threatened superpower confrontation in the middle of Europe; 
an ill-fated U.S.-backed attempt to topple the Marxist regime in Cuba foundered 
near the United States' southern shores; disputes broke out over nuclear 
testing around the globe; superpowers still extended their military and 
colonial influence into large areas of Africa and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Non-Aligned Movement created by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, 
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal 
Nehru convenes here for its 11th Council of Ministers in a dramatically changed 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there no longer any East-West axis with which to be non-aligned, 
but Yugoslavia, host of the first meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in 
Belgrade, has for the first time been refused an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new world's confrontations are erupting along religious and nationalistic 
frontiers, and the new Yugoslavia will find itself competing for a chance to 
debate foreign ministers of breakaway Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina over an 
appropriate response to the long-running Balkans civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran, embroiled in mounting disputes with the Arab world over its support of 
Islamic fundamentalist militants, will send its foreign minister here for the 
movement meeting for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa, one of whose first actions as a new black-led government was to 
join the Non-Aligned Movement, will sit at the table with nations that spent 
decades reviling apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 108 disenfranchised, non-aligned countries that represent two-thirds 
of the world's people, the battles this week are more likely to shape up over 
trade policy than over national liberation -- the widely loathed General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact, economic relief for debt-ridden nations 
and access for Third World goods to the world's major markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is really a different agenda coming. Well over half of the active 
members are concerned about getting northern markets open to their products. 
They're concerned about being shut out. They're concerned about changing the 
terms of credit," said Tim Sullivan, a political analyst who has studied the 
Non-Aligned Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt has pushed since the last summit of movement leaders in Jakarta, 
Indonesia, in 1992 to merge the Non-Aligned Movement with the Group of 77 
developing nations, effectively undercutting its political role and focusing 
squarely on the economic frontier between developed countries and the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider the new economic realities of the world, it is important to 
try to identify certain commercial interests and formulate government positions 
which put us in a better negotiating position when dealing with the West or 
developed countries," said Nagui Ghatrify, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry 
of Egypt, which for years capitalized on its non-aligned status by playing off 
the Soviet Union against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Third World, he said, can avert economic disaster today only by developing 
a new strategy of self-help on issues such as technology transfer, economic 
development and environmental planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Non-Aligned Movement say the political crises that have been 
bungled or ignored by the world's superpowers -- such as the chaos in Rwanda, 
Somalia and Liberia -- can perhaps best be addressed closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nations at this week's meeting propose to discuss a new peacemaking 
and peacekeeping role for non-aligned nations, similar to plans under 
discussion by the Organization of African Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-aligned nations also are almost certain to continue the push for a greater 
voice for the Third World in the United Nations, with the most popular proposal 
being a permanent seat on the Security Council for a developing regional power 
like Egypt, Brazil or India. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over Yugoslavia's membership in the movement has dominated 
diplomatic activity in the days leading up to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia holds the three-year chairmanship of the movement. But host nation 
Egypt ruled that the remaining rump Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro 
were not to be automatically granted the status of successor state to the 
former Yugoslav federation. Hence, Yugoslavia received no invitation to the 
movement meeting but the door was left open for appeal when the session 
convenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgrade, outraged that Croatia's foreign minister will attend as an observer 
and Bosnia's as a guest -- particularly since the Bosnian civil war will be 
near the top of the agenda -- insists that only a summit of leaders can legally 
expel a Non-Aligned Movement founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unprecedented," said Yugoslav diplomat Danilo Vucetic, who notes the 
movement may be trying to expel the rump Yugoslavia because half of its members 
come from Islamic nations that support Bosnia's Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 The rump Yugoslavia, he said, has sought to avoid a confrontation for two 
years by voluntarily refraining from most movement activities, but it feels 
compelled to participate when Bosnia is on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Belgrade will look to at least two Muslim nations for potential 
support: Iraq and Libya, both also isolated and embittered by U.N. economic 
sanctions. They could emerge as backers of a fellow international renegade, 
though they have not yet weighed in on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest challenges of the session, officials and analysts say, will 
be to redefine the role of a Non-Aligned Movement whose very title has become 
an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement is the coalition of the weak in international politics, and as 
such it is still relevant," said Egyptian political scientist Mustafa Kamel 
Sayed. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the tumult that has 
ensued there, along with a seeming lack of American global engagement and U.S. 
economic woes, have left a "post-Cold War world (that) is not a peaceful place 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
 "Moreover, the basic problem of poverty in the world has not been resolved," 
he said. "For all these reasons, it is important for the weak of the world to 
get together, and at least to demonstrate solidarity and support with each 
other, but also to debate how they will find solutions to their own problems, 
relying on their own efforts."

SOUTH AFRICA'S TOP KILLER OCCUPIES THE DRIVER'S SEAT; TRAFFIC: NEARLY THREE 
TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE DIED IN ROAD ACCIDENTS LAST YEAR AS PERISHED IN RAMPANT 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a land with one of the world's worst murder rates and a horrific history of 
political bloodletting, the deadliest killer by far is much more mundane: 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans count the traditional death toll of the Memorial Day weekend, in 
South Africa, the deaths of 50 people in a bus accident and a minibus collision 
with a car and truck last Thursday underscored this nation's grim status as one 
of the world's most dangerous places to drive. Or for that matter, even to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 people died in traffic accidents here last year, or almost 
three times the number of people killed in political violence. Almost half the 
victims were pedestrians, mostly hit near the black townships and squatter 
camps that line many highways. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief cause of the carnage is simple, said Quinton van Eeden, assistant 
general manager of the Automobile Assn. of South Africa. "Unfortunately, the 
biggest problem is the driver," he said. "South Africans, I'd say in general, 
tend to be quite aggressive. We also have severe literacy problems. That sort 
of thing needs to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Apartheid may be dead, but its lethal legacy survives on South Africa's roads. 
The collision of First and Third World cars and conditions produces a daily 
litany of what newspapers inevitably call "horror crashes." 
</P>
<P>
 There are enough rich whites to support a BMW factory here, and their 
Mercedes-Benzes and other high-powered cars zoom at 75 m.p.h. along modern 
highways. Most blacks, however, commute in overcrowded minibuses used as taxis, 
while migrant workers and families heading home huddle in the back of 
slow-moving trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem here is you've got fast cars and slow cars," said Hubrecht 
Ribbins, head of traffic safety technology at CSIR, a private Pretoria-based 
research group. "The differentiation is a real problem, especially at night. 
When you have a truck filled with people going slowly home, and then a BMW 
comes along at high speed and doesn't expect anything, you get a rear-end 
collision." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's corruption. To avoid South Africa's strict licensing tests, 
Ribbins estimates up to 1 million drivers -- about 20% of the total -- use 
bogus licenses obtained from now-abolished homeland governments or bought on a 
thriving black market. 
</P>
<P>
 But a chief cause of the staggering body count is minibus taxis. They can 
carry 16 passengers but often cram in dozens more. They barrel along at high 
speed, suddenly stopping to pick up or offload passengers. Drivers go hours 
without rest, afraid of stopping to sleep on roads plagued by bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 Few South Africans wear seat belts. And drunk drivers are a major problem. But 
Robin Scholtz, an Automobile Assn. spokesman, insists alcohol plays another 
role as well. "Our biggest problem is drunken pedestrians," he said. "They 
wander across the road, and the poor motorist hits them." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't help that sidewalks and pavements don't exist in most towns and 
townships. So poor people without transportation must walk in the road. And 
despite the dangers, few pedestrians wear light or reflective clothing at 
night. Only 1 in 100 blacks owns a car, while about half the whites do. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Automobile Assn., South Africa's traffic fatality rate -- 
about 35 per 100,000 people -- ranks worst among 20 countries that it follows. 
It's twice America's rate, and higher than Third World nations such as Brazil, 
Botswana and Kenya. South Korea has the second-worst fatality rate with 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, South Korea doesn't have hippos. In a 1991 accident here, three cars 
and a 30-ton truck were nearly demolished in the Transvaal when they slammed 
into a hippopotamus and one another. Two people were injured; the hippo died.

INDIA HEAT WAVE BREAKS 50-YEAR RECORD IN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even for India, notorious for heat and dust, this season has been a sizzler. 
</P>
<P>
 How hot has it been? On Monday, New Delhi sweated through its hottest 
afternoon in half a century, with the mercury shooting up to 114.8 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arid, mostly desert state of Rajasthan to the southwest of the Indian 
capital, at least 71 people have died over the past few days of heat stroke, 
news reports said. In the towns of Phalodi and Jhalawar, it was an overpowering 
118.4 degrees. Dust storms were forecast for some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajasthan's chief minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, said more than 22,000 
villages are in the grip of a severe drought caused by the two-week heat wave. 
The state will spend almost $65 million on aid and make-work programs for 
farmers whose crops have been singed in the fields, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Delhi's wide streets were deserted during much of the day as wary 
residents avoided the burning sun and breezes that felt like exhaust venting 
from a brick kiln. Electric current ebbed and surged throughout the day, 
sometimes failing entirely, as the already overtaxed power grid strained to run 
all the air conditioners and fans switched on in this city of more than 8 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the British before them, many of India's high and mighty fled the burning 
plains of northern India for the cooler hills. On a single day recently, 10 
government VIPs were sighted in Dehra Dun, ostensibly on some official 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Manmohan Singh went to unveil a statue of Buddha at a 
hospital. Rajesh Pilot, minister of state for external security, was chief 
guest at a function staged by the Indo-Tibetan border police. Pressed by a 
reporter, he admitted he intended to relax in the coolness of the nearby hill 
station of Mussoorie for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 For those left behind at lower altitudes, no relief is in sight, forecasters 
warned. Ram Snehi, director of the Safdarjung Meteorological Office in the 
capital, said Monday that over the next few days, "the maximum temperature may, 
at the most, show a difference of about a half a degree only, but no dramatic 
change is expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Even rain, which could occur in the next 24 hours, wouldn't bring the

in the temperature is not ruled out, though it should not happen. But the 
weather is unpredictable," Snehi said.

 May is generally the hottest month of the year for Delhi. The weatherman's 
outlook was bad news for people across North India, who now must look forward 
to another month of intense heat before the arrival of the cooling rains of the 
monsoon, expected to reach Delhi June 29. May 29, 1944, remains the hottest day 
on record in India's capital, with the temperature peaking at 117 degrees.

WHITE HOUSE WOES; PAULA JONES NOT LACKING IN ABLE COUNSEL FOR LAWSUIT; AFTER 
CLINTON HIRED BENNETT, ACCUSER'S ARKANSAS LAWYER IS FLOODED WITH OFFERS OF 
HELP. PARTISAN POLITICAL MOTIVATION IS DENIED. 
</P>

<P>
 When Danny Traylor saw what he was up against, he quickly decided he needed 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The proprietor of a one-man Little Rock, Ark., law office whose staff consists 
of an answering machine and a shared secretary, Traylor figured that his 
client, Paula Corbin Jones, was going to need more legal ammunition than he 
could muster for her suit against the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he heard President Clinton had retained famed white-collar defense 
attorney Robert S. Bennett to defend him against Jones' sexual harassment 
charges, Traylor put out a call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the media reported that Bennett was on board, I had probably a 
dozen offers of help," Traylor said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call, he said, was from Gilbert K. Davis, a trial attorney with some 
government experience who had dabbled in state and national Republican Party 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Traylor said he looked into Davis' background and was satisfied that he had 
sufficient trial experience to handle the case and wasn't driven by a political 
vendetta against the Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis took over the case a week before it was filed in federal court on May 6. 
Traylor is now merely "local counsel" in Little Rock, with no day-to-day 
involvement in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Traylor-Davis handoff marked a major escalation in the case and touched 
off speculation that Davis was a front man for right-wing outfits bent on 
bringing down the Clinton presidency. All involved deny that the suit is 
politically inspired, but Davis' GOP ties (he worked for the presidential 
campaigns of Howard Baker and George Bush) and offers of financial aid from 
conservative religious groups have fueled speculation about the enterprise's 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 51, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, and his chief 
associate, Joseph L. Cammarata, 35, who served for four years in the Justice 
Department's tax division, won't say how they heard that Traylor was seeking 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones' complaint against Clinton had been a cause celebre in conservative 
circles since she first leveled her charges against the President at a 
conservative forum in Washington in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 27, said that in May, 1991 -- when she was a low-level state clerical 
worker -- Clinton ordered his state police bodyguard, Danny Ferguson, to escort 
her to the then-governor's Little Rock hotel suite during a state-sponsored 
management conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones contends Clinton then made a crude pass at her and asked her to perform 
oral sex. She refused and fled the room, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Mahoney, leader of a militant anti-abortion group, said that after 
hearing Jones' story, he tried to enlist a number of conservative and feminist 
groups on Jones' behalf. He contacted Traylor and offered to put him in touch 
with a number of high-powered lawyers, including the media-savvy Ellis Rubin of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney also said he tried to arrange a conference call among Traylor, Jones 
and Patricia Ireland, director of the National Organization for Women, to seek 
NOW's involvement in Jones' sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland declined to take up Jones' cause, saying only that her organization 
would monitor the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Landmark Legal Foundation of Kansas City also sought to find 
lawyers to represent Jones after deciding it did not have the resources to 
pursue the case itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Davis and Cammarata, who say they have no ideological interest in the 
matter but only want to ensure Jones gets the best legal representation 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Cammarata, in a recent interview, said that "no organizations or groups 
brought us in," although he did not rule out accepting donations from Mahoney's 
Christian Defense Coalition or other conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he and Davis were exploring the creation of their own defense 
fund for Jones, anticipating that her legal bills will exceed $100,000 as they 
do battle with Bennett and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, too, is thinking of creating a legal defense fund, to help 
Clinton defray the costs not only of the Jones suit but of the broader 
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bennett and his associates billing $475 an hour and Whitewater lawyer 
David Kendall and his team charging a similar amount, Clinton's legal bills 
could easily reach $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is planning a multi-front war against Jones and her attorneys, perhaps 
beginning with a constitutional argument that a sitting President is immune to 
civil damage suits. Resolving that question could take a year or longer, 
Bennett believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is also likely to argue that the Civil War-era civil rights statutes 
under which Jones sued Clinton are not applicable and will also seek to limit 
discovery depositions from witnesses who claim to have experienced similar 
behavior from Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas.

WHITE HOUSE WOES; DOCUMENTS HINT AT MORE HELP BY MRS. CLINTON FOR S&L OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much did Hillary Rodham Clinton know in the early and mid-1980s about the 
troubled business dealings of her Whitewater partner and sometime law client, 
James B. McDougal? And did she play a role in his efforts to bail himself out? 
</P>
<P>
 These questions have become an important part of the Whitewater controversy 
facing the President and Mrs. Clinton. And in the incremental way that the 
affair is now developing, new documents have surfaced that don't fit 
comfortably with Mrs. Clinton's explanation that her contacts as an attorney 
with McDougal and his Arkansas savings and loan company were purely routine and 
peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons contend they were remote from the tangled financial affairs of 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, owned by McDougal, their partner in the 
Whitewater real estate development. The thrift was seized by federal regulators 
in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As a partner in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., Mrs. Clinton 
represented McDougal's S&L in 1985 before the state securities commissioner 
(appointed by her husband, then the governor) on a plan that would allow the 
thrift to sell preferred stock to boost its capital reserves and meet federal 
regulators' demands. At a press conference in April, Mrs. Clinton said she 
acted only as the "billing attorney," while the case was actually handled at 
the firm by a junior associate. 
</P>
<P>
 But documents obtained by the Resolution Trust Corp. suggest that Mrs. 
Clinton's efforts on McDougal's behalf were both more active and more 
longstanding than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the documents show, Mrs. Clinton took a role in mediating a dispute 
between McDougal and the Rose firm over fees from earlier legal work. McDougal 
had refused to pay Rose's bills, prompting the firm's managing partner, Joseph 
Giroir, to declare that he did not want McDougal as a Rose client again in the 
future, according to partners at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mrs. Clinton interceded, and documents and interviews with participants 
suggest that her mediation may have made possible the subsequent Rose efforts 
on behalf of the S&L. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Oct. 10, 1983, letter obtained by the RTC, Giroir wrote McDougal that he 
was submitting a new bill "pursuant to your discussions with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 While the savings and loan matter was pending before the state commission, 
McDougal indicated an interest in ways Mrs. Clinton could help with Madison's 
dealings with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to know everything you have pending before the Securities Commission 
as I intend to get with Hillary Clinton within the next few days," McDougal 
wrote to Madison President John Latham in a July 11, 1985, internal Madison 
memo obtained by the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton may have interceded while at 
Rose to help mediate the billing dispute. As for the later memo from McDougal, 
John Podesta, a White House spokesman on Whitewater matters, said Mrs. Clinton 
did not recall getting together with McDougal in the summer of 1985 to review 
the embattled S&L's pending issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of any contacts between them and her part in patching up the 
Madison-Rose relationship, Administration officials asserted, Mrs. Clinton had 
no significant professional role with McDougal's financial institutions or any 
knowledge of the controversial practices cited after Madison Guaranty's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics suggest that having Mrs. Clinton and Rose in his corner may have 
given McDougal the potential of exercising undue influence on state 
authorities. A five-month-old special counsel's investigation is probing 
whether political influence may have been used to prolong Madison's existence 
and run up the eventual cost of the RTC bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Madison President Latham said that McDougal, who was the majority 
stockholder in Madison and effectively controlled day-to-day management of the 
S&L, told him to use Rose for legal work. In one conversation "he said, go to 
Rose, because Bill and Hillary are my friends. So I used them (Rose)," Latham 
said.

CLINTON OUTLINES PROGRAM AIMED AT HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA; ASIA: THE PRESIDENT 
SETS FORTH FIVE WAYS TO PUSH FOR IMPROVEMENTS. ACTION IS PART OF HIS NEW 
CAMPAIGN TO BETTER EXPLAIN ADMINISTRATION'S FOREIGN POLICY TO AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, striving to demonstrate continued American pressure to end 
Chinese human rights abuses, has outlined a five-point program "to support 
forces of constructive change in China while strengthening the U.S.-China 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, described in an article appearing today on the opinion pages of 
The Times, consists of steps by the Clinton Administration, American businesses 
and human rights organizations to push China to improve human rights 
conditions, even though they no longer will be linked to U.S. trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Administration announced it would effectively end the effort to 
link China's human rights record with its status as a most-favored-nation (MFN) 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's article also clearly is part of his new campaign to do better at 
explaining his foreign policy to Americans. Clinton told The Times on Friday 
that controversies and apparent shortcomings in his foreign policy were not the 
result of staff weaknesses but of his inability to communicate effectively 
about key issues and decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most controversial of those decisions was the one he made to renew 
China's MFN status, despite Beijing's failure to comply fully on human rights 
issues, as required by Congress and a presidential executive order last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annual debates linking MFN to human rights threaten to block needed progress 
on security and economic issues while yielding little if any progress on human 
rights," Clinton writes in the article. "We must pursue our human rights agenda 
with China in a way that does not isolate China. We can't help change human 
rights in China if we're not there." 
</P>
<P>
 The five points he outlines consist of: 
</P>
<P>
 * Transmitting new foreign broadcasts to China, including the new Radio Free 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supporting U.S. groups assisting private Chinese groups working on human 
rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing voluntary standards for U.S. firms doing business in or with 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 * Promoting international attention to and support for human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banning the import of Chinese guns and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of D-day commemorations this week, the President writes: "We 
must not waver in the challenge of advancing those same values -- freedom and 
prosperity -- in Asia and especially China. It is in this region that many of 
the profound challenges to America's national interest can be found; it is in 
this region that our generation's progress will in large part be measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The President commends the Chinese government for recent steps, including the 
release of two dissidents, verbal acceptance of the U.N. Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and moves toward ending the jamming of Voice of America 
broadcasts. But he underscores that these are insufficient to constitute real 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls his program "new and vigorous," although each of the individual 
points has been debated or acted on before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton pledged to make improvement of 
China's human rights record a prerequisite for renewal of its favored trading 
status and to launch Radio Free Asia to make available new foreign media 
outlets to the Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed authorization of Radio Free Asia this spring, despite China's 
vigorous opposition on grounds that it amounted to interference in its internal 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing voluntary principles for U.S. businesses -- an idea tried with 
disputed impact in South Africa -- is a longstanding option borrowed from 
parties who oppose using MFN as leverage on human rights.

SHOT DOESN'T HIT HOSOKAWA

<P>
 A suspected right-wing extremist fired a shot yards away from former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday in apparent protest over Hosokawa's open 
apologies for Japan's actions in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa was not harmed. The bullet hit the ceiling of a Tokyo hotel, where he 
had spoken at a political party meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards quickly tackled the gunman, who was identified as Masakatsu 
Nozoe, 52. He later told police that he was upset by Hosokawa's statements on 
Japan's war role, Japanese news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Nozoe was believed to be a member of an extremist right-wing 
group.

GAYS HOLD FIRST HOLOCAUST SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gay men and lesbians Monday held the first service at Israel's Holocaust 
Memorial to honor the tens of thousands of homosexuals murdered by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem refused to officially 
sanction the event, and police detained four religious protesters who shouted 
"No More Gays," "AIDS!" and "Homos! May God Save You!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 gays from 12 countries, mostly Jews from North America and Europe, 
hugged each other for comfort in the flame-lit Hall of Remembrance, where the 
names of Nazi death camps are etched into the stone floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sobbed, others shouted the Kaddish prayer of mourning to drown out the 
dozen or so protesters, mainly Orthodox Jews, who said the Bible bans 
homosexuality and the gay service had no place at Yad Vashem.

REBELS CUT OFF RETREAT FOR RWANDAN TROOPS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebels cut off the last avenue of retreat Monday for government troops caught 
in the capital, Kigali, and overran a vital army barracks near Gitarama, the 
interim government's stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim government retreated to Gitarama, about 25 miles southwest of 
Kigali, ahead of a rebel advance into the capital last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's barracks at Nyanza, about 19 miles south of Gitarama, have 
fallen to the rebels, a visit there Monday showed. But the government has not 
fled Gitarama, contrary to rebel claims. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a U.N. source said earlier on condition of anonymity that the fall of 
Nyanza would be seen as a major blow to the army's ability to defend the 
interim government stronghold at Gitarama. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' seizure of the Nyanza barracks came as they and the army began 
U.N.-mediated cease-fire talks. U.N. spokesman Abdul Kabia said the sides 
agreed to meet again Thursday.

MEMORIAL DAY RITES FOCUS ON D-DAY BRAVERY

 While thousands jammed beaches across the country, others spent Memorial Day 
remembering another beach -- Normandy -- and paying tribute to those who fought 
and died there a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 50th anniversary of D-day only days away, the invasion that was a 
turning point of World War II was a recurring topic of Memorial Day speeches, 
ceremonies and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, in St. James, France, Fabien Meron stood amid a sea of white crosses 
at the U.S. military cemetery, joining thousands of children as they released 
pigeons carrying messages back to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,410 children, one at each grave, were there to pay homage to American 
soldiers killed in France after the invasion. Fabien, 9, stood at the grave of 
Pvt. Arthur Dodler of Illinois, a 35th Division infantryman killed Aug. 17, 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "My message said that the word peace means no war, and I hope the whole world 
knows it," said Fabien, from Pontorson, near the cemetery 200 miles west of 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pawtucket, R.I., Joseph Rossi said: "When you think about what they did, 
flinging themselves out of boats and running into the enemy, it's really 
something. I think a lot of us take for granted what our fathers, grandfathers 
did. It's very humbling." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi, 35, one of about 500 people gathered at Rhode Island Veteran's 
Cemetery, said he did not know anyone buried there but had been touched by film 
footage of D-day that he had recently seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere around the nation, people flocked to beaches and back yard barbecues 
to celebrate the holiday, but one outing, in Florida, turned tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 Three women, a man and an 11-year-old boy drowned at American Beach on 
Florida's northeast coast when one swimmer got in trouble in dangerous riptides 
and the others tried to help him, authorities said. Six other people caught in 
riptides in the area were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 people attended the dedication of the Bristol War Memorial in 
Virginia. In Atlanta, a plaque was erected honoring Charles Brittian Jr., who 
was killed in Vietnam just days before he was scheduled to return home.

WHALE DIES IN CREEK DESPITE RESCUE EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A young gray whale that repeatedly got stuck in shallow San Francisco Bay 
waterways died Monday night despite rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers were trying to herd the animal toward the bay earlier in the 
evening when it failed to surface from a shallow creek, said Denize Springer, a 
spokeswoman for the Marine Mammal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in deep enough water for it to swim then it dove and it didn't come up 
again," Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists will not know for several weeks why the whale died, pending the 
results of a necropsy. They have not decided whether to remove the mammal from 
the creek or perform the tests there. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-foot gray whale, about a year old, had wandered through the South San 
Francisco Bay channels since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared headed back to the bay Saturday night, but turned around and 
headed upstream, getting stuck in the mud of San Tomas Aquino Creek near the 
Santa Clara Golf & Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The whale briefly broke free when the tide came in Sunday afternoon, but 
turned around less than a mile later and got stuck once more. 
</P>
<P>
 High tide and rescuers freed it for a second time Monday morning. But again 
the success was short-lived. By midmorning, the whale was stuck in shallow 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped they could guide the whale back to the bay through three

determine if any of the sightings are related.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; NEW COSTA MESA GALLERY IS FANCY-FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened on the way to the poorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret that the recession has dealt a heavy blow to art galleries 
nationwide, and Orange County is hardly immune. One local gallery owner whose 
debts forced him to close up shop a few months ago moaned that locals simply 
don't buy contemporary art -- or if they do, they purchase it from famous 
galleries in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, a few first-time art dealers have rushed in to fill the 
vacuum. Their secret? They are shunning shopping malls and downtown Laguna 
Beach in favor of funky industrial zones or decidedly non-yuppie downtown 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the most promising of these ventures is Griffin Fine Art in 
Costa Mesa, which opened late last month with the aim of bringing emerging 
artists together with emerging collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a former boat warehouse next to an auto body shop, the gallery has a 
facade that makes "humble" sound like a compliment. But the interior of the 
airy 3,200-square-foot corrugated metal building is a charmer, with a loft and 
a long, narrow annex. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owner Bill Griffin, 28, a slim, eager account executive at Xerox in Santa 
Ana by day, was not involved with art when he was a marketing student at the 
University of Richmond, Virginia. But when he began working in Washington, the 
Smithsonian Institution became a favorite Sunday afternoon haunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was free, and it was a marvelous way to learn," he said. "I love to learn. 
I think I'll learn until the day I die." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when Xerox transferred him to Orange County, Griffin began 
wolfing down night and weekend courses in art history and contemporary art at 
colleges and museums. A couple of years ago, he joined MOCA Contemporaries, a 
support group for young collectors at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know anyone out here," he said. "It was a great avenue for me to 
learn and see (art), to be with people my own age." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Griffin founded Newport Harbor Contemporaries at Newport Harbor 
Art Museum, which now has about 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "For younger people, (art) is real intimidating if you didn't grow up with 
it," he said. "That's why this gallery: The idea is to be very open and 
education-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 His rental agreement hinged on his willingness to refurbish the 100-year-old 
warehouse, a project that used up "all the money that would have gone into 
buying a little yuppie house." 
</P>
<P>
 But monthly overhead for the gallery is less than $1,500. "I consider us grass 
roots," Griffin said. "I don't want to get into a big retail place in a mall or 
on a corner. That's not what I believe the artists that we're going to show 
here are about." 
</P>
<P>
 While Griffin primarily sees to the business side of the venture, his equally 
energetic partner, Meg Linton, is in charge of the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton, 27, is finishing her second year in the master of fine arts program in 
museum studies at Cal State Fullerton, having earned her bachelor's degree in 
English literature from UC Irvine. "Almost all my friends are artists," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Griffin while auditing an art-theory class taught by Tom Dowling at 
Orange Coast College. Dowling told her that Griffin wanted to own a gallery, 
and the two started working on the project at the beginning of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within three weeks, I had accumulated a whole list of slides," Linton said. 
"We both just fed off each other's energy, and it grew from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery will be open to many styles and media, she said: "I'm of the 
postmodern generation. I've been brought up with so many different backgrounds. 
Technique and craftsmanship are important to me. (Artists I like) have the 
techniques down, and then they have the extra advantage of content. . . . Art 
is about concepts. Whatever medium you're working in, you can still be dealing 
with art issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Next on the exhibition schedule is "Foto" (Thursday through June 30), a group 
of photographs by about 20 Southern California artists working in traditional 
and new forms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the most interesting mix of work is hanging in the annex, which 
Linton calls "my testing grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the artists I've known for seven or eight years and have seen their 
work grow," Linton said. "There are a lot of wonderful artists who all move 
away. We're hoping we can be a reason for them to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for the small annex-gallery pieces range from $125 to $1,800. In 
general, Griffin wants to keep prices under $1,000. This approach seems to be 
working: Of the 11 pieces sold out of the current show, the majority were 
purchased by first-time buyers, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery takes only a 10% or 20% commission (rather than the usual 50%) on 
work by some artists. "We had to make some concessions because the (artists' 
usual prices) were higher than what I wanted to see," Griffin said. "I decided 
to take it off my end. . . . I can operate without selling anything, and I'll 
be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He aims to turn the gallery into a kind of clubhouse for younger art 
collectors and collectors-to-be. Summer plans include outdoor screenings of art 
films and "Afterhours Thursdays" (6 to 11 p.m.), which he envisions as a 
free-form, drop-in "cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
 A free Saturday night lecture series began recently. Coming up: Mike McGee, 
director of the Cal State Fullerton Gallery, speaks on "Victories for 
Antiheroes and Why You Have 500 Channels on Your TV" on June 11 at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This eclectic, unpretentious style, plus the snappy graphics on the gallery's 
promotional materials (some of which are amusingly packaged in CD jewel boxes) 
proclaim a distinctive attitude toward clients and artists alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In Griffin's view, marketing an art gallery like his is "not a shotgun 
approach, not like selling a commodity. . . . It's more on a personal level." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, panache and business smarts don't ensure success all by themselves. 
A dealer must have a broad and sophisticated knowledge of the scene, as well as 
an extraordinary ability for spotting and nurturing talent, and conveying 
enthusiasm about the work to potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealer-client relations in Orange County often require an extra dose of 
persuasion: Typically, collectors are loath to purchase anything their friends 
and neighbors might not like. 
</P>
<P>
 But Griffin is undaunted. He is targeting the MTV generation, not wealthy, 
middle-aged collectors looking for blue-chip work, and his notion of customer 
relations ("a long-term partnership") comes straight from Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
 Business school taught him about "benchmarking" -- learning from successful 
ventures -- and that's why he spent hours hanging out at such well-regarded 
galleries for emerging artists as Food House in Santa Monica and Sue Spaid in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a new type of gallery for the '90s," he says. "They're not 
hype-oriented or polished or stuffy. . . . As simple as we can keep things, 
that's as successful as we'll be." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, too many Orange County contemporary art gallery owners, past and 
present, seem to have looked to the wrong models. The result: suffocatingly 
bland, corporate locations -- more suited to selling Mercedes-Benzes or 
designer suits -- stocked with art straight from Dullsville. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, other commercial-art galleries in Orange County have tested the 
"alternative" route. A few years ago, Miki G. Hammond opened the Art Loft 
(since closed) right around the corner from Griffin, in the no-frills Mesa 
Business Center. Several coffeehouses show art. Community-based galleries, 
including the Caged Chameleon in Santa Ana, offer forums for a wide range of 
emerging artists. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these spaces specializes in the smart, innovative work that people 
travel to Los Angeles to see. So far, only Stuart Katz's Loft in Laguna Beach 
has been attempting to fill this niche. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, unlike most art dealers, Griffin isn't depending on art sales to 
make a living. Neither he nor Linton -- who also runs the two galleries at Cal 
State Fullerton and works as a paralegal -- is receiving a salary from the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he concedes that running a gallery full time "might make sense, down 
the road," for the foreseeable future he intends to keep his 7-to-5 job at 
Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
 His night hours at the gallery have put a major dent in his personal life, but 
he doesn't envision burning out. "At 28, I can handle this," he says. "This has 
been the best thing in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Linton, "We both have a lot of energy, and we both are very strong willed 
and want to accomplish a lot with our lives. . . . It's like, we can do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * Griffin Fine Art, 1640 Pomona Ave., Costa Mesa, is open from 6 to 10 p.m. 
Thursday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday, and by

O.C. ATTRACTIONS REVIEW; REFLECTION: LODGE'S MOST SPECIAL EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm, an amusement park of relatively modest means, has come up 
with a relatively modest new attraction, Mystery Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Modesty is a virtue that is often overlooked in the theme-park business, where 
the big guns battle for attention by building screaming new roller coasters and 
other high-tech dazzlers (witness the promotional blitz for the new Batman ride 
at Six Flags Magic Mountain). 
</P>
<P>
 As its designer has said, Mystery Lodge shoots for the heart rather than the 
stomach, and at that it succeeds in some admirable ways. Think of it as a sort 
of Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln, updated with a '90s sensibility and with a 
few new technological tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a show, not a ride, in which a live actor (mouthing the words of a 
recorded narrator) plays a Canadian Indian storyteller, spinning a 10-minute 
tale of his own life and, in the process, imparting lessons about the 
importance of passing the best in ourselves on to our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fairly sophisticated special effects aid in the storytelling: The "smoke" 
from a campfire forms images from the storyteller's past, or of some of the 
spirit gods of his beliefs. The storyteller disappears and reappears 
instantaneously at several points, and once his face turns into that of a raven 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Even upon a second viewing, the effects in the show were startlingly good. 
However, the glass partition separating actor and audience, while no doubt 
necessary to the effects, creates a somewhat distracting barrier. Overall, the 
technological gimmickry is used with taste and restraint and does not overwhelm 
what is at heart a simple story. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief pre-show, a Knott's host goes to painstaking lengths to explain 
that the attraction was developed with the help of advisers from the 
Kwak'wala-speaking people of coastal British Columbia and also has the blessing 
of local Native American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is admirable that an amusement park is taking such pains to portray 
native beliefs with some respect, it should be remembered that this is an 
entertainment show and not a cultural lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge achieves an effective balance between story and technology. The 
effects held the attention of the children in a recent audience, while the 
story -- a little rambling, but told with warmth and humor -- will send adults 
out with a positive glow. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is a good addition to Knott's, which has long aimed to blend 
adrenaline-inducing roller coasters with more family-oriented fare. It's one 
more reason to visit the park, but whether it is, on its own, a reason to go to 
Knott's this summer is a question with a less clear-cut answer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine crowds lining up for repeat viewings of Mystery Lodge, as 
some younger park-goers might with the thrill rides. But then, it's also hard 
to imagine anyone coming off Batman thinking about life and the moral 
responsibility to our children.

NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL AT NPR; NEW CHIEF DELANO E. LEWIS WANTS TO EXPAND 
FINANCIAL BASE, CUT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sixth-floor office of Delano E. Lewis, the president of National Public 
Radio, is eerily quiet for a room surrounded by a new multimillion-dollar 
broadcast facility that boasts a half dozen satellite dishes and the largest 
recording studio between New York and Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Lewis mostly listens to NPR at home or during commutes. At work 
he turns off his office stereo system in order to devote himself to reinventing 
the public-radio network, which broadcasts such acclaimed programs as "Morning 
Edition" and "All Things Considered." 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it difficult to work and listen to radio," explained Lewis, who took 
over NPR in January after serving as president of the local Washington 
metropolitan area telephone company, Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone. "I come 
from a very different kind of cultural environment. . . . You have to 
understand I had been in a business hierarchy for 21 years. But we have people 
around here that keep the radio on all day." 
</P>
<P>
 A clash of cultures is unfolding at National Public Radio, where Lewis is 
trying to infuse the non-commercial radio network with entrepreneurial fever in 
order to stem the challenge of dwindling financial resources and inroads made 
by American Public Radio, an upstart nonprofit radio network based in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has vowed to fight back by broadening NPR's audience with more diverse 
programming and by making more shows pay for themselves on a network that has 
been described as the champagne of radio and also, less charitably, by the 
Washington City Paper as "a house organ . . . for aging yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to bring to the table some business principles so that we can become 
more efficient," said Lewis, a 54-year-old lawyer. "I'd like to see us use 
other revenue streams (by) marketing and selling our programs. . . . I don't 
intend to make public radio a commercial, for-profit organization. But I do 
believe there are ways in which we can operate that will save us money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NPR executives, weaned on the financial largess of Congress as well as public 
and private grants, say they are resigned to a more competitive broadcasting 
environment and are intrigued by Lewis' ideas. Yet they remain circumspect 
about a former business executive whose commitment to the Bohemian, sometimes 
self-indulgent world of public radio hasn't been fully tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very charismatic and he's said a lot of the right things and pushed the 
right buttons," said one high-ranking NPR official who did not want to be 
identified. But in general, the official said, people are taking a wait-and-see 
attitude. And if it turns out they don't like what they see, the official said, 
some staff members are taking solace in the belief that NPR's board of 
directors won't let Lewis "get too far out of line" in his effort to make NPR 
more entrepreneurial and businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
 With his extensive ties to Washington's political, business and arts 
establishment, however, Lewis is a man to be reckoned with, friends and 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just an excellent motivator of people and a consensus builder," said Bob 
Johnson, the chief executive officer of Black Entertainment Television. And 
with a long history of charity work on behalf of such groups as the United 
Negro College Fund and the Capital Children's Museum, Lewis knows the right 
sources to tap to broaden NPR's financial base, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Kansas, Lewis attended the University of Kansas and the Washburn 
School of Law and was an early supporter of Bill Clinton's presidential bid. 
Lewis himself had been repeatedly courted to run for a variety of Washington 
political posts. 
</P>
<P>
 After brief stints as a Justice department lawyer, Peace Corps worker and 
congressional aid, he joined C&P Telephone in 1973 and rose through the ranks 
to become one of the nation's highest-ranking African American phone 
executives. In addition to recently being appointed to co-chair the Clinton 
Administration's blue-ribbon National Information Infrastructure Advisory 
Council, Lewis serves on several corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers say Lewis' corporate background is of little distinction at NPR, 
which has long prided itself as a high-brow alternative to commercial 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, commerce has been a dirty word in public broadcasting," observed 
Laurence Jarvik, director of the Washington office of the conservative Center 
for the Study of Popular Culture. "But Lewis is a guy who does not say nasty 
things about business. I think he's going to run into resistance because he is 
not openly resistant to commerce and because he is a very, very powerful black 
man" in an organization traditionally dominated by white males. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to lessen NPR's reliance on gifts and grants from the 
congressionally supported Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Lewis wants to 
form a subsidiary to market NPR programs on CD-ROM computer disks. And NPR, 
which is seeking to forge financial tie-ins between NPR consumer shows and 
their related industries, has already signed up General Motors Corp. subsidiary 
Saturn Corp. as one of the underwriters of the show "Car Talk." Lewis is also 
soliciting ideas from his 400-member staff on ways to cut waste and 
inefficiency at NPR, which has an annual operating budget of nearly $47 
million, about 67% of which comes from the network's 500 member stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' ambitious plans, however, could leave NPR even more open to criticism 
that it allows corporate interests to dictate programming and news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In an awkward moment during the taping of "Car Talk" last month in San 
Antonio, an audience member asked one of the show's hosts, Tom Magliozzi, what 
kind of car she should buy. The question came just after Lewis, who was present 
at the taping, had praised Saturn for its "wisdom and courage" in underwriting 
the broadcast, according to Current, a newspaper that covers public 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'd put my money into Chrysler," Magliozzi reportedly responded. 
Purchasing a Saturn would be good, he added, if the vehicle didn't have the 
corporate baggage of General Motors behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Such potential conflicts extend to NPR's news division, where eight NPR 
reporting positions are fully funded by corporations or foundations. The money 
is often tied to NPR providing coverage of a specific area or subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of such underwriting, contends Glenn Garvin, who wrote a long story 
critical of NPR in Washington City Paper, accounts for the fact that the 
network has a full-time reporter in Kenya while until recently it relied on a 
stringer to cover South Africa, "where one of the most exciting stories of the 
decade is unfolding." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he, too, is concerned about the balance and fairness of NPR 
programs. "We really want to be independent and not let commercial interest or 
underwriting support dictate our support to news or news gathering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he has worked hard to build staff morale and to keep the lines of 
communication open. And he said he believes that most NPR officials share his 
view that the network needs to broaden its listenership and increase revenue 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say (NPR) is elitist, but it's narrow band," Lewis said. NPR's 
audience, he added, is "predominantly white -- and of a certain economic strata 
and certain educational strata. I think you can get a wider band of listeners. 
We need to market what we do to underserved audiences -- to minority audiences, 
to younger audiences."

STEPPING OUT IN PLAY ABOUT GAY LIFE; THEATER: DAN BUTLER, WHO PORTRAYS A 
SPORTSCASTER ON 'FRASIER,' USES 14 VIGNETTES TO WEAVE TOGETHER THE ONE-MAN SHOW 
'THE ONLY THING WORSE YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Don't tell Dan Butler that his one-man show is brave. He has heard it before, 
and he doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a courageous thing," insists the actor, whose autobiographically 
inspired "The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me" has been playing to 
sold-out audiences at Theatre Geo in Hollywood. The piece, which consists of 14 
vignettes connected by a theme of homosexuality -- and in particular, his 
parents' coming to terms with their son's homosexuality -- is Butler's attempt, 
he says, "at processing my life, what being gay means." 
</P>
<P>
 The show also offers an interesting balance to Butler's ongoing role on NBC's 
hit series "Frasier," on which he plays macho radio sportscaster Bob (Bulldog) 
Briscoe. "When I read the part, they had this funny, quirky, angry bit -- over 
the top, maniacally heterosexual," says the actor, who recently signed a 
four-year contract with the show's producers. "I have a ball with the 
character. Bulldog is also a nice counterpoint to Frasier and the rest of the 
intelligentsia who come around." 
</P>
<P>
 Between "Frasier" and his own show, Butler, 39, had time last winter to 
squeeze in a role in the upcoming Nick Nolte/Julia Roberts suspenser "I Love 
Trouble" in which, he admits, his Armani-clad CEO character represents a "major 
plot point." Butler's other big-screen credits include "Longtime Companion" and 
"The Silence of the Lambs" ("I was one of the bug scientists," he reminds, "the 
comic relief"), and on the small screen, guest spots on "Picket Fences," "Life 
Goes On" and a previous recurring role on "Roseanne."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Fort Wayne, Ind., Butler remembers being drawn to the theater at 
an early age, making his debut in a local production of "The Music Man" at age 
7. As an adult, he has worked onstage at San Francisco's American Conservatory 
Theatre and Trinity Square in Providence, R.I. His Los Angeles stage debut came 
in the Mark Taper Forum's 1990 production of "The Lisbon Traviata" (he got 
stabbed by Richard Thomas at the end of that one). Since 1992, Butler has been 
one of the artistic directors at the Road Theatre in Van Nuys, where he 
appeared in "Why Things Burn" and "Vig," and directed last season's 
well-received premiere of "The Walkers." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here from New York, I had no idea I'd stay," the actor 
allows. "But it's been a really creative time." 
</P>
<P>
 In his solo show, there is a delicate line that Butler traverses: As he slides 
in and out of accents and characters, it's not always clear which of the 
stories are his own. "I drift through all the pieces," he acknowledges. "But 
specifically, no. There should be mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the voices are compelling, from Leslie (a garrulous Southern actor 
whom Butler befriended while volunteering at Project Angel Food), to a gay man 
standing up to name-callers, to Butler's own parents. Ironically, the portrait 
of his mother -- accompanied by cue cards -- is one of the show's most amusing; 
his father's words are the most devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not designed as indictments," emphasizes the actor, who lives in 
Silver Lake. As for exposing his own pain, "I never had this experience of 
clarity that this was something I had to do," he says. "I'm deeply grateful 
that the show affects people, and there is a certain feeling that what I have 
to say makes a difference. So I'm glad these stories mean something, that they 
make people think. But I don't want it to be a 'gay' show." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of that disclaimer, it's inevitable that reviewers have signaled this 
production as Butler's theatrical "coming out." Still, if there has been any 
career fallout, he has yet to notice -- or care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an actor," he says bluntly. "Our responsibility as artists is to 
challenge ourselves. It's also fun to show off the talents I've been given. But 
the real thing is, I've never felt as fulfilled as an artist. I'm saying my own 
words, talking about my life in a personal way. This is what I wanted to do, 
what I needed to do, what I'm supposed to do. And it's part of growing up."

FIDDLER MICHAEL DOUCET: HE'S NO AGIN' CAJUN; ROOTS MUSIC: FOR 25 YEARS, HE HAS 
HELPED PRESERVE PAST STYLES WITH YOUTHFUL ZEAL. HE AND BEAUSOLEIL PLAY THE 
COACH HOUSE WEDNESDAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year and a half ago, Michael Doucet was at his fellow Cajun musician 
Marc Savoy's rural Louisiana house for the annual boucherie -- a traditional 
party built around a pig roast and jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of one of those sessions under Savoy's spreading oak tree, 
Doucet, 43, looked up and was struck by a startling realization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the oldest fiddler there," he recalled, somewhat downcast, by phone 
from his home near the town of Eunice.  
</P>
<P>
 But don't call him an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I am not one!" he exclaimed at the mere mention of the term. "I still 
refer to myself as the young, rebellious Cajun. I still go to all these other 
musicians' houses, and they're octogenarians, and I've never had to worry about 
it. There's still always someone older." 
</P>
<P>
 Doucet, who with his band, Beausoleil, will be at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano on Wednesday, has been one of the leading figures of modern Cajun 
music for nearly 25 years now. With Beausoleil, he kicked open the door for the 
rural-rooted music by adding some touches of rock 'n' roll and has since 
watched as a new generation has come along and joined in his mission to 
preserve and expand the style's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Doucet -- who learned at the side of such Cajun pioneers as Canray Fontenot 
and the late Dennis McGee -- is half the age of his mentors, and truth is he's, 
well, fit as a fiddle. A steady exercise program and low-fat diet (hard to 
accomplish in Louisiana) has done away with any encroaching middle-age spread, 
but his appetite for musical discoveries remains voracious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason for the whole Beausoleil idea was that this music was being 
forgotten 25 years ago and not a lot of musicians were playing it," he 
explained. "So we visit old musicians, bring the music out, old blues and 
ballads." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Doucet is, if anything, putting even more energy into that mission 
now than before, delving deeply into the music of the Cajun heritage, which 
incorporates the styles brought by the musicians' ancestors after they were 
kicked out of Nova Scotia 200 years ago with those of other settlers in 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Beausoleil has just finished an album, "L'Echo," its second for Rhino Records' 
Forward label, with a focus on "lost" songs and styles, from string band music 
to bayou blues. The album will be released in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also just finished is another album from the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band, the 
tradition-music oriented trio of Doucet, Savoy and his wife, Ann Allen Savoy. 
The small Bay Area folk label Arhoolie will release that.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Arhoolie is putting out "The Mad Reel," an album featuring music 
by Doucet and Beausoleil from the soundtrack of the 1986 movie "Belizaire the 
Cajun," while the East Coast-based Music of the World label is set to release 
an album of live Beausoleil from the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Doucet also recently did a guest session with Mark Knopfler for the former 
Dire Straits leader's first solo album, and Beausoleil continues a busy 
schedule of concerts -- from sedate sit-down auditoriums to raucous dances. He 
and his music are clearly more comfortable in the latter setting, a point he 
uses to deflect some criticism Beausoleil has attracted from folk purists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iry LeJune, Nathan Abshire, the great Cajun musicians, what they played was 
rock 'n' roll, really," he insisted. "(Cajun music) is music that makes you 
move. I like to make people dance, and hey, I grew up in the '60s. If I 
wouldn't play (rock), sometimes it wouldn't be me. I like to put it all 
together. I don't separate rock and folk. It's a tradition that continues to 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 And Cajun music continues to flow and grow. While some Cajuns resent the 
superficial faddish appropriation of their culture when the style (not to 
mention Cajun food) became trendy in the late '80s, Doucet is glad that at 
least the culture is now known to and appreciated by a wide range of people 
from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The awareness of the fact that this is viable music that comes from only one 
part of the world and has to do with who we are and where we come from is 
great," he says. "And it's still fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * Beausoleil with Michael Doucet plays at 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $15. (714) 496-8930.

ARTIST SET TO BE HEARD IN CITY CULTURAL DISPUTE; WILLIE MIDDLEBROOK WILL APPEAL 
TO CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION FOR REINSTATEMENT AT WATTS TOWERS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A long simmering dispute between the city of Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs 
Department and artist Willie Middlebrook, a former employee in the department, 
is likely to come to a head on June 8, when the Civil Service Commission is 
scheduled to hear his appeal for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Middlebrook, a prominent photographer, was removed from his position as 
director of the Watts Towers Arts Center on June 25, 1993, after less than six 
months on the job. The action was taken after Earl Sherburn, the city's 
community arts director, judged Middlebrook's performance to be substandard and 
cited him for various infractions, including falsifying neighborhood workers' 
time sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Middlebrook denied the charges, but he was reassigned to his former position 
as a photography instructor. Ten months later, on April 26, he was terminated 
from city employment by Adolfo V. Nodal, general manager of the Cultural 
Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Middlebrook said that a false charge of tampering with four time sheets is the 
excuse for his firing, but the artist, who is black, believes the actual 
catalyst was his public criticism of the department's expenditure of $19,000 on 
an exhibition that he believes perpetuated negative stereotypes of black men.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was critical of spending that much money on the show when I couldn't even 
get a skylight fixed at the Watts Towers Arts Center," Middlebrook said. The 
exhibition, "Soul Shadows: Urban Warrior Myths," a multimedia installation by 
New Orleans artist Dawn Dedeaux, was presented last spring at the Los Angeles 
Photography Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nodal confirmed that Middlebrook had been terminated and that his appeal will 
be heard on June 8. But Nodal declined to comment on the cause of dismissal or 
any other aspect of the case, claiming that he is prohibited by law from 
discussing personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Coalition for Cultural Survival of Community Arts, an African 
American community group, has sent a letter to city officials protesting "the 
vicious, racist, fascist and character assassination behavior in the dismissal 
of CAD employee Willie Middlebrook" and calling for a review of Nodal's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the city attorney's counsel, Nodal declined to comment on the letter.

WORLD CUP '94: 17 DAYS AND COUNTING; MEOLA HOPING TO GET A GRIP; HE STILL 
HASN'T BEEN NAMED STARTER, BUT U.S. CHANCES LIKELY IN HIS HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sal Rosamilla sighed, realizing he once again would have to come to the 
defense of his bestfriend since childhood. "I'm sick of the vampire joke, you 
know, the one that says he's scared of crosses," he said, referring to Tony 
Meola, goalkeeper for the U.S. soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 They are goalkeepers' worst nightmare. Not vampires. Crossing passes. They 
come darting in from the corners of the field like stealth bombers, too often, 
even in heavy traffic, finding their targets -- heads-up, wide-eyed strikers 
who know how to hit 'em where the goalkeeper isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 A goalkeeper has two choices -- wait until he senses where the pass is 
directed and position himself in front of the net accordingly or take the 
initiative by charging off his line to intercept the ball. Neither is foolproof 
against a well-placed cross, but the goalkeeper can be assured of one thing: If 
he makes the wrong choice, he will be blamed for the ensuing goal. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is how a former goalkeeper sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what people are watching," said Rosamilla, who played for 
Columbia University. "Nobody likes to come off their line, but Tony is willing 
to take a rush and pick off a cross better than anyone who is going to be in 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable that he's taking so many hits. Maybe it's because he was 
everybody's poster boy in 1990, and, now that he's been the king for four or 
five years, people want to see the king fall." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a much discussed topic among followers of the U.S. national team in 
Kearny, which is virtually everyone in the community of 35,785 that calls 
itself "Soccer Town U.S.A.," why one of their favorite sons, Antonio Michael 
Meola, is not more appreciated.  
</P>
<P>
 They even protest because a commercial that began appearing nationwide Monday, 
promoting the offensive wizardry of a shoe company's latest soccer footwear, 
features Meola allowing one goal after another. 
</P>
<P>
 But another way to look at it is that Meola would not have been asked to star 
in the commercial if he were not so appreciated. After all, he is the United 
States' best-known and highest-paid soccer player, reportedly earning $500,000 
a year from contracts with the U.S. national team, a German glove manufacturer 
and other sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played in more than twice as many full international games -- 84 -- as 
any other U.S. goalkeeper, had shutouts in two of the most important matches in 
the national team's history -- 1-0 against Trinidad and Tobago in 1989, earning 
the United States its first World Cup berth in 40 years, and 2-0 last summer 
against England -- and is about to be part of his second World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is only 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that many goalkeepers do not reach their prime until their 
mid-30s, he could, if he remains healthy and motivated, play in four or five 
World Cups, surpass former English goalkeeper Peter Shilton's record of 125 for 
the most full international games and become a star in the projected Major 
League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such greatness was predicted for him while he was growing up across the Hudson 
River from New York City, where he was a standout for Kearny High School in 
baseball, basketball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees selected him in the 13th round of the 1987 amateur draft as a 
center fielder, but his high school baseball coach, Joe Rubbone, said that he 
would have gone much higher if it had not been apparent to scouts that Meola's 
sights were set not on the World Series but the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream was inherited from his father, Vinnie, who played for Avellino in 
the Italian professional league's second division before emigrating to the 
United States in 1958 and becoming a barber. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Meola played outfield and third base at the University of Virginia for 
two years before deciding to focus on soccer. Bob Gansler, U.S. coach at the 
time, called on him at the end of his second year at Virginia, and he spent the 
next season shuttling back and forth between his college and the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable double, he shut out Trinidad and Tobago at Port of Spain in 
the United States' final World Cup qualifying game in 1989, then, less than a 
week later, led Virginia to the NCAA co-championship in an overtime tie against 
Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 But Meola's most memorable game was the 2-0 shutout against England in the 
U.S. Cup last summer, when he made 15 saves. Afterward, English captain David 
Platt said that the only thing separating Meola from Europe's goalkeepers was a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he had one after the 1990 World Cup. He played briefly with both 
Brighton and Watford in England's second division, only to discover that he 
lacked the quickness necessary to play at that level. Upon returning to the 
United States, he enrolled in a rigorous workout program at a Syosset, N.Y., 
tennis club to improve his reflexes. Other graduates include Martina 
Navratilova, Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 Another improvement in his physical condition was prompted by his marriage 
last August to his high school girlfriend, Colleen. Once known as "Meat" to his 
teammates, Meola is leaner than he has been in years because Coleen never 
includes red meat on the menu when cooking for him at their home near the U.S. 
team headquarters in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola, at 6-1, 205, said he is in the best shape of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 So that makes it even more frustrating for him to still be wondering about his 
status as the U.S. team prepares for its June 18 World Cup opener against 
Switzerland. With only one warm-up game remaining, next Saturday at the Rose 
Bowl against Mexico, Coach Bora Milutinovic has not announced whether he will 
start Meola or Brad Friedel against the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want a decision to be made," Meola said recently. "Bora told me, come 
May, we will know. But, obviously, the plan has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to be the man, I want to be fully ready to play. I would think 
the team would want the goalkeeper to be ready to play. That's my only concern, 
having a guy ready to play in the biggest soccer tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get too frustrated because it will take away from, one, my 
play and, two, the World Cup in general. It's not affecting my play. In the 
last four or five matches, I've played as well as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Meola contended last year that he, as team captain, has the support of the 
other U.S. players, but he now says that he believes they will play equally 
well in front of him or Friedel. Protecting themselves from the wrath of 
Milutinovic, the players are noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Paul Caligiuri said that the 6-4, 202 Friedel, who played in college 
at UCLA, is more physically gifted than virtually any other player on the team, 
but he balanced that by pointing out that Meola has proven himself in big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can go wrong with either one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for public consumption, that also is Milutinovic's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the people like to know who is No. 1, but this is not important," 
he said. "It is important for both to keep their confidence. Both are good. If 
we have every position like goalkeeper, we are going to be world champions." 
</P>
<P>
 So Meola waits, his impatience level ebbing and flowing depending on what he 
has heard or read lately in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 He is particularly annoyed when he is described as a big-game player who was 
forced to work more diligently in practice when Friedel arrived. "Most of the 
people saying that never even come to practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when they say that he cannot handle crosses. "When I got here, that was the 
biggest asset in my game," he said. "For two years, I didn't drop one cross." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that his wife calms him by telling him to focus only on things he can 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen also has gotten him involved in the acting classes she takes in 
Hollywood, a craft that he likes so much that he has begun thinking that there 
might be a career in it for him. Andrew Shue of "Melrose Place," who played 
soccer against Meola in high school in New Jersey, has been encouraging him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been interested in that, but Kearny is not exactly the acting 
capital of the world," Meola said. "I didn't get much information about how to 
get involved until I came to California. I told everyone I would leave L.A. the 
day after the World Cup, but -- who knows? -- there might be something out 
there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He, however, is not adept enough at acting yet to hide his feelings from 
Milutinovic. He said that has not caused a problem between him and the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I told him, 'You wouldn't want me if I was happy with your decision 
not to play me in every game,' " Meola said. "If I was happy about that, then 
there would be a problem with me." World Cup Player Profile

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS LAMP IS RUBBED RIGHT WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jumping all around, not yet calming down, Jenine Sahadi can't help but confess 
about herself: "I'm a maniac!" Never before has Jenine been such a cheerful 
maniac. She trains the longshot winner of Memorial Day's $500,000 Hollywood 
Turf Handicap and is feeling frisky as can be, celebrating near the winner's 
circle of Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck be a lady today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five hundred thousand dollars!" she exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 A record purse for a female trainer at this famous 56-year-old track. As rich 
a purseas any female trainer has ever won -- here, there or anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In her pantaloons and golden slippers, in her I Dream of Jenine costume, she 
makes a wish and it comes true. She blinks and her horse wins. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it isn't so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 All those early mornings. All that hard work. All the effort even to persuade 
Mike Sloan's stubborn old roan to get his rump into the van and go across town, 
all those bribes of "carrots, candy, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
 But, oh, what a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At the instant Grand Flotilla kicked up his 7-year-old heels down the stretch, 
Sahadi says, "I just started screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-sixty to win. Nice price. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as nice as the $269.20 paid back to anyone who put two bucks on Arcangues 
in last November's Breeders' Cup Classic, but nice, nevertheless. Particularly 
with poor old Arcangues running a distant fifth in Monday's race, poking along 
far, far behind the 1 3/4-length winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues and Bien Bien were the favorites, but ended up flat and done as 
French toast. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was more amazed than the trainer of the winner, who willingly 
acknowledged, "I really thought I was running for second or third place." 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. Everyone else was. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years before being licensed as a trainer, Sahadi worked in the 
Hollywood Park publicity department. Now the publicity is hers. 
</P>
<P>
 How to win a Hollywood holiday horse race, starring Jenine Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
 First thing, you begin by having your lucky frozen yogurt. No day at the races 
can start without one. OK, so racing people have their superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you pick out an outfit that has been lucky for you in the past. Jenine 
recalled certain garments that had been good for her at Del Mar. She got them 
out of her closet, although she forgot her lucky belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you accessorize. Golden bracelets. Golden rings on each hand, including 
the one with the horse illustrations engraved on the band. Juanita 
Delahoussaye, jockey Eddie's wife, had gone to a jewelry shop with Sahadi to 
have the rings custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you slip on your golden, pointy-toed genie slippers and you're all set. 
</P>
<P>
 First wish is for a wet track. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi says, "I was doing a rain dance this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 It is definitely her day. Shortly before the day's fourth race, a light shower 
softens the Hollywood sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much else to do now. Instructions to jockey Gary Stevens? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no instructions. Gary is Gary. He knows what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Her hard part is over. The decision to enter the horse had been tricky enough. 
And the shipment of the horse from Santa Anita had been an exhausting one. 
</P>
<P>
 But worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi says, "He's just such a neat old horse. We call him the Old Gray 
Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 Time to watch him run. Dead last at the quarter pole. Still last after a 
half-mile. Oh, well. He's still a neat old horse. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Here comes Grand Flotilla. The race has a leisurely pace. The old 
gray goes charging along the rail. After a mile, he's fourth. Around the second 
turn, Stevens sees an opening. He slips his mount past Blues Traveller and 
sticks a nose in front. Bien Bien goes with him and races parallel in 
midstretch. But it is useless. Gary and the Ghost are flying. 
</P>
<P>
 So is their trainer.

 Sahadi says, "You can ask the people sitting around me. I'm a maniac! Even in 
a $10,000 claiming race, I'm jumping up and down, my arms are flailing. But at 
the top of the stretch when Gary came through on the rail, it was like the 
parting of the sea. I just started screaming. I jumped all the way down to the 
box-seat section. I'm sure that I really embarrassed myself. But if you can't 
do it now . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 No, by all means, do it now. Diane Carpenter once trained the winner of the 
$500,000 Jim Beam Stakes in Kentucky. Otherwise, no woman in the business has 
ever done better. 
</P>
<P>
 So, go on. Celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Memorial Day. It's memorable.

RANGERS AREN'T TAKING CANUCKS' UPSETS LIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If Pat Quinn is to be believed, the Vancouver Canucks can skip the formalities 
and simply hand the Stanley Cup to the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the Rangers have weaknesses? "If they do, I'm not sure where," said Quinn, 
the Canucks' coach and general manager. "They have strong forwards, a couple of 
mobile defensemen, defenders who have been around for a long time and (goalie 
Mike) Richter has been on a roll. . . . I know some of our guys are going to be 
tight when they get out there. This city is so hungry, the fans are going to 
try to will their team to a Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 How does he plan to shut down Ranger center Mark Messier? "I don't know that 
you can," Quinn said. "He's been awesome in the playoffs. What he's done is the 
stuff that myths are made of." 
</P>
<P>
 Might the Canucks' size give them an edge? "We've got some skill, but not as 
much experience as the Rangers," Quinn said. "We've got good scorers, solid 
goaltending and some experience. Those are the things that have gotten us this 
far and whether they're good enough to beat New York, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks are firmly embracing the role of underdogs in the best-of-seven 
finals, which begin tonight at Madison Square Garden.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got much choice," team captain Trevor Linden said. "Look at the 
experience and the talent they have. They're supposed to be here. We're not. 
There were six teams better than us in (the Western) conference. But that 
doesn't mean we want it less than they do. We deserve to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 41-40-3 season, the Canucks upset the Flames in the first round by 
winning three consecutive overtime games. They disposed of the Dallas Stars in 
five games and rode the hot hand of right wing Pavel Bure, who had a 
playoff-high 13 goals, to a five-game victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 After those results, the Rangers don't buy Quinn's line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not playing a team that's an 85-point team," Messier said. "We 
recognize that and we won't get drawn into a false sense of security. If you're 
in the Stanley Cup finals, the regular season doesn't matter. You're playing 
with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who had a league-leading 54 victories and 112 points, have had 
progressively tougher playoff sledding. After sweeping the Islanders, they went 
five games with the Capitals and needed double overtime to shake off the Devils 
in a seven-game Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you're not getting to the finals without paying a price of some 
kind," said Ranger Coach Mike Keenan, who is 0-3 in his previous tries at the 
Cup with Philadelphia and Chicago. "Vancouver faced a test real early in the 
first round and dodged a bullet three times. I think we learned from going 
through a tough, emotional series (against New Jersey)." 
</P>
<P>
 They learned they must remain disciplined when opponents try to outmuscle 
them, as the Devils did and as the Canucks undoubtedly will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver has a physically imposing team. Its top line, of Trevor Linden 
centering for Bure and left wing Greg Adams, provides most of the offensive 
spark, but 5-foot-8 flyweight center Cliff Ronning has been productive with 
Sergio Momesso and Martin Gelinas. On the third line, left wing Russ Courtnall 
finishes for center Nathan LaFayette. The fourth line can dig and hit, with 
Gino Odjick or Shawn Antoski to the left of John McIntyre and Tim Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensemen Jeff Brown and Bret Hedican, acquired from St. Louis in the Petr 
Nedved deal, get the puck out of their end quickly. Dave Babych and Gerald 
Diduck are hard hitters, and the third pair, of Jyrki Lumme with Dana Murzyn or 
Brian Glynn, has held its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Kirk McLean is 0-7-2 against the Rangers in his career, but he isn't 
worried about his past failures. What's more relevant is his .932 save 
percentage this spring. "To get to this point, we've been through a lot of 
pressure situations and we've been able to deal with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan wouldn't say if he will deal with Bure by having Esa Tikkanen shadow 
the speedy winger with the quick, deadly shot. But Tikkanen, Craig MacTavish 
and Brian Noonan will probably be on the ice whenever Bure is. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's certainly a skilled player and has the ability to bring people out of 
their seats," Keenan said. "On the rush, he's very difficult to stop. You give 
him time and space and he makes it difficult for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers will be difficult to stop. Graves, Messier's left wing, had only 
four points against New Jersey, but he's too tenacious to be silent for long. 
Keenan put Alexei Kovalev on their right side during the Devil series, but 
Glenn Anderson will probably go back there and Kovalev will center for Stephane 
Matteau and Steve Larmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Brian Leetch has been involved in 11 of the Rangers' 16 power-play 
goals, using his one-on-one skills when a sore shoulder weakened his shot from 
the point. He and the aggressive Jeff Beukeboom form a balanced pair. Sergei 
Zubov, also skilled offensively, complements veteran Kevin Lowe. However, Lowe 
suffered a shoulder injury last Friday and his status is questionable tonight. 
If he can't play, Doug Lidster, Jay Wells and Alexander Karpovtsev will get 
more ice time.

ARIZONA TOO MUCH FOR CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was supposed to be a slugfest. 
</P>
<P>
 A team batting .381 against another batting .318, with the two clubs having 
336 extra-base hits between them. And everyone expecting a slew of long balls 
and plenty of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge softball team, however, didn't live up to its 
billing. Instead, the Matadors made top-ranked Arizona look like a one-woman 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona ace Susie Parra threw a one-hitter and struck out 13 to pace the 
Wildcats' 4-0 victory over Northridge in the championship game of the Women's 
College World Series on Monday in front of 3,966 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was playing in an NCAA Division I final for only the second time in 
school history. The men's volleyball team played UCLA in the national 
championship in 1993 and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (64-3), which remained top-ranked throughout the season, scored single 
runs in each of the first three innings and never let third-ranked Northridge 
(52-10) into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra (33-1), who entered the game with a 1.08 earned-run average, surrendered 
a two-out double to Beth Calcante in the first inning, but struck out Tamara 
Ivie for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra retired 18 consecutive batters after Calcante's double. With two out in 
the seventh, Ivie drew a full-count walk before Parra struck out Scia 
Maumausolo on four pitches to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gotta give Susie Parra a lot of credit," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson 
said. "She kept us totally off balance. It didn't seem like she threw the same 
pitch twice. She changed speeds very well and it was hard to make any 
adjustments on her." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third national title in four years for the Wildcats, who beat UCLA 
in the final last season. It is a safe bet that Arizona will remain on top for 
quite a while. Only two starters are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra, who along with third baseman Susie Duarte make up the only starting 
seniors, will be sorely missed by Mike Candrea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was vintage Susie Parra," he said. "It's been a real fun year to a point 
that I never wanted it to end. It really has been a dream season for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should probably retire today because it's not gonna get much better than 
this -- until next year when we start it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching a one-hitter against a team that has batted above .300 all season was 
quite a surprise to Parra, who admitted it was her finest outing of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My changeup was working good and we kept them guessing," she said. "But, I 
was shocked to end the year like that. I was worried the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which was batting .409 as a team in the tournament going into the 
final, had seven hits off Jennifer Richardson (9-1) in four innings. Amy 
Windmiller, who along with third baseman Shannon Jones survived the first-floor 
collapse of their Northridge Meadows apartment in the earthquake, came on in 
relief in the fifth. Windmiller retired all six batters she faced, but it was 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could have hit better behind Jen, because she was pitching a great 
game," Ivie said. "The hits that they had aren't hits to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona scored the only run it would need in the first inning on Laura 
Espinoza's single. Leah O'Brien, who went three for three, doubled with one out 
and scored when Espinoza's hard liner glanced off Jones' glove and caromed into 
left field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats added another run in the second when Jones' throw home hit Nancy 
Evans in the back during her slide. Evans had singled to lead off the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Leah Braatz's single scored O'Brien in the third and Amy Chellevold scored in 
the fifth on Jenny Dalton's ground ball fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frustrating loss for the Matadors, who believe if they had another 
shot at Arizona, they would win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm (ticked) because we didn't win," Calcante said. "We've been through an 
earthquake, coach's moodiness, PMS. . . We've been through so much and we come 
here and we're like, 'Pfffft,' in our last game. I've never seen our team this 
down."

ONE-HITTER STOPS NORTHRIDGE IN TITLE GAME; SOFTBALL: PARRA PITCHES TOP-RANKED 
ARIZONA TO VICTORY IN WOMEN'S COLLEGE WORLD SERIES.

 Arizona ace Susie Parra threw a one-hitter and faced just two batters over the 
minimum Monday to pace the Wildcats to a 4-0 victory over Cal State Northridge 
in the championship game of the Women's College World Series in front of 3,966 
at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (64-3), which remained top-ranked throughout the season, scored a 
single run in each of the first three innings and never let third-ranked 
Northridge (52-10) into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra surrendered a two-out double to Beth Calcante in the first inning, but 
struck out Tamara Ivie to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra, who struck out 13, retired 18 consecutive batters after Calcante's 
double. With two out in the seventh, Ivie drew a full-count walk. Parra 
however, struck out Scia Maumausoloon four pitches to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy to be here after all that has happened this year," Northridge 
Coach Gary Torgeson said. "But I have to give Susie Parra credit because she 
changed speeds well and had everything going today." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third national title in four years for the Wildcats, who defeated 
UCLA in the final last season. Arizona could remain on top for quite a while. 
Only two starters -- Parra (33-1) and third baseman Susie Duarte -- are 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today it was all Susie Parra," Arizona Coach Mike Candrea said. "To go out 
after four years like she did with a one-hitter is incredible. To have three 
national titles in her four years, somebody ought to take a look at what she 
has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching a one-hitter against a team that has batted better than .300 all 
season surprised Parra. 
</P>
<P>
 "My changeup was working good and we kept them guessing," she said. "But I was 
shocked to end the year like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which was batting .409 as a team in the tournament, had seven hits 
off Jennifer Richardson (9-1) in four innings. Amy Windmiller came on in relief 
in the fifth and retired all six batters she faced.

CSUN HITS THE WALL AGAINST PARRA; SOFTBALL WORLD SERIES: CALCANTE PROVIDES LONE 
MATADOR HIGHLIGHT WITH FIRST-INNING DOUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Had Cal State Northridge slugger Beth Calcante not swung at a pitch a foot 
above her head in the first inning, Arizona ace Susie Parra might have thrown 
the first championship game no-hitter in the 13-year history of the College 
Softball World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calcante did swing at the Parra rise ball out of the strike zone and 
managed to tomahawk it into the left-center field gap for a double in the first 
inning of the Matadors' 4-0 loss to Arizona on Monday in the championship game 
in front of 3,966 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Arizona shortstop Laura Espinoza, who hit a record-setting 30 home runs 
this season, couldn't believe that Calcante had connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the hell did you hit that ball?" Espinoza asked Calcante, who after 
sliding headfirst into second was brushing the dirt off her uniform when 
Espinoza approached her. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, who admits she can't lay off the rise ball to save her life, 
answered honestly, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of Calcante's double however, wasn't fully realized until the 
end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After Calcante's blast, Parra retired the next 18 batters in a row before 
walking Tamara Ivie with two out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra finished with a one-hitter, 13 strikeouts and faced just two over the 
minimum, but felt she never threw a bad pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pitch was probably about a foot over her head," Parra said. "I don't 
know how she hit that ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The hit gave Calcante the school career mark for doubles.  
</P>
<P>
 Going into the game, Calcante and Ivie were tied with 30 career doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, who along with Shannon Jones and Jen Fleming, was selected to the 
all-tournament team, certainly didn't think her one hit would be the focal 
point -- not to mention the only hit -- of the championship game for the 
Matadors (52-10).  
</P>
<P>
 After all, Northridge was batting .318 as a team with 127 hits for extra bases 
and had never had less than three hits in any game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would get us going," said Calcante, who set school records this 
season for career home runs (33) and runs batted in (141). 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, it was only a hit, nothing more, nothing less. Ivie struck out on a 
3-and-2 drop to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had so much confidence in myself," Ivie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the ball so well and I swung at a pitch and it just dropped right under 
my bat." 
</P>
<P>
 While Northridge's inability to hit Parra frustrated the Matadors, it 
surprised Arizona first baseman Amy Chellevold of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold played against Calcante, a Newbury Park product, in high school, so 
she knows Calcante's ability and was not surprised that it was her double that 
spoiled Parra's no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me at all," Chellevold said. "I though she'd get a few 
hits, but Susie did a great job today." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about the sixth inning, Ivie said, when the Matadors began to pack it 
in.  
</P>
<P>
 By then, Arizona owned a 4-0 lead and the heat and humidity was penetrating 
the Matadors' black jerseys. They were hot and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Ivie went to the plate for the last time in her college career 
with two out in the seventh, she wasn't about to make the third out, instead 
coaxing a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was either gonna walk or hit a home run and I really believed that," Ivie 
said. "I wanted to get on base so bad."

IMPROBABLE ARMS HELP CYPRESS SWEEP TO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP; BASEBALL: RARELY USED 
CHARGER PITCHERS ARE THE DIFFERENCE IN VICTORIES OVER RANCHO SANTIAGO. 
SHORTSTOP OJEDA NAMED MVP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress, faced with a seemingly impossible task, used some amazing defensive 
play and improbable pitching help to beat Rancho Santiago twice Monday to win 
the State baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers won the first game, 5-3, in 14 innings then came back to win, 
8-5, in front of a crowd that jammed the stands and were two to three deep down 
both foul lines at Cerritos College. It was Cypress' second State title in four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' Augie Ojeda, a freshman shortstop, was selected as the tournament's 
most valuable player, mostly for his defensive work. 
</P>
<P>
 He saved at least a run in each game on almost identical plays on balls hit 
deep into the hole by Rancho Santiago's Darren Troilo. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, Ojeda dived to get the ball, got up and his throw beat Troilo by 
about a step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anybody play shortstop like he did today," Cypress Coach 
Scott Pickler said. Pickler picked up his 300th victory in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' Andy Gonzales, who normally plays second base, got the victory in 
each game. He had pitched 18 2/3 innings all season. 
</P>
<P>
 He allowed a run in six innings of relief in the first game then started the 
second game, going 5 1/3 innings for the victory. He is 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales was replaced in the second game by freshman Mario Opipari, who had 
pitched nine innings before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opipari was playing center field and contributed a fine running catch before 
taking the mound. He entered in the sixth with a runner on third and one out 
and Cypress leading, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Opipari walked the first batter but retired the next two to end the threat. 
The last out was the ball hit by Troilo that Ojeda went into the hole, dove, 
and threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Opipari retired the next seven (nine in a row overall) before allowing a 
one-out single to Daryle Ward in the ninth. But Troilo hit a bouncer to 
Gonzales, who returned to second. Gonzales tagged pinch-runner Brian Carlson 
then threw to first to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have been in the cards," Pickler said. "The team had the best 
chemistry of any I have ever been involved with. We beat a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, which won the State title last season, finished 40-13. 
Cypress, the Orange Empire Conference champion, beat third-place Rancho 
Santiago five of six times this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (43-11) took control early in the second game, scoring seven runs in 
the first inning. Opipari had a two-run double, Ken Granger, Josh Kliner and 
Ojeda also had RBI singles in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kliner singled, was sacrificed to second, stole third and scored on a throwing 
error for Cypress' final run in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toward the end I started to get tired," Gonzales said of his pitching. "When 
we get into extra innings, I always clutch up, I just hate to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress won the first game when two runs scored on a wild pitch and an error 
in the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers took a 3-0 lead into the ninth but Rancho Santiago rallied to tie 
it. Toby Sanchez had a two-run single to make it 3-3 with one out. Gonzales hit 
Keith Cowley to load the bases with one out and David Mallas coming up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallas tried to squeeze but Gonzales got the ball far enough outside that 
Mallas missed it. Granger, the catcher, tagged Jason Minici who was caught off 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 The inning ended in chaos when Mallas swung at a pitch in the dirt. Granger, 
who blocked the pitch, quickly picked it up and threw to first to narrowly get 
Mallas, forcing extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress had been given a big lift in the first game by sophomore pitcher Rob 
Crabtree. He had been bothered by a sore arm earlier this season and pitched 
one inning in the last seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But he looked in top form as he limited the Dons to three hits in the first 
eight innings. Crabtree also benefited from Ojeda, who turned three possible 
hits into outs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crabtree gave up a walk and a hit to start the ninth before being replaced 
by Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just happy to be back," Crabtree said. "The defense really picked me up 
today."

 For those who like their fairy tales with a decidedly athletic tone: 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the 32 teams that began the Southern Section Division II softball 
playoffs had more victories than Fullerton High School. The Indians had a .519 
won-loss percentage, which was worse than any other league champion. But 
Fullerton is still playing. The Indians have won three consecutive playoff 
games and improved to 17-13. Thirteen losses! They're in today's semifinal 
against Saugus with 13 losses? The other three teams remaining have 11 losses 
between them . What are they doing here, you ask? How could this happen? How 
far can they go? Well, it goes something like this. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The pressure got to them early. Expectations were greater than the young team 
was ready to shoulder. "Projected Freeway League champion? Fullerton." That's 
what they read. That's what they heard. That's what they couldn't live up to -- 
the expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, we put pressure on ourselves," Coach Scott Weber said. "We weren't 
playing for ourselves, we were playing for everyone else. The preseason 
predictions got to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Angie Fancuberta and catcher Kiki McAulay were good enough to make 
Fullerton the Freeway League favorite. By the time league play began, the 
Indians were 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we were nervous at the beginning of season," McAulay said, "but we 
got better every game. We took some losses that taught us a lot -- we don't 
take teams lightly; we're always in the game and we do a lot to mentally 
prepare ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, their team batting average was .175, their slugging average was 
.202, their on-base percentage was .315. 
</P>
<P>
 Few imagined then that Fullerton would be a game away from playing for a 
section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had a good team," junior shortstop Deborah Hargrave said, "but I 
never thought we would do this good." 
</P>
<P>
 Between the preseason and the playoffs, Fullerton had the Freeway League. The 
Indians won twice then lost to Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point for us," said Hargrave, one of the most vocal team 
leaders along with McAulay. "We had a team meeting, and since then, we've been 
into every game mentally and physically." 
</P>
<P>
 After their second loss -- at midseason -- came another defining moment. Weber 
put junior Jenette Guerrero in center field and left her there. It solidified 
the defense and, along with Annette Martinez at second base (the only senior 
starter), helped make the Indians strong up the middle. They haven't lost 
since. They won the league title, then set out to win some respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero threw out the tying runner at home plate in a 2-1 victory over Covina 
Charter Oak, ending a rally by the defending champion. Before that, left 
fielder Amy Simpson threw out a runner at home in the fifth inning of 
Fullerton's 12-inning, 2-0 victory over Lakewood. The defensive trend is 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Their three victories have totaled 28 innings. Despite stranding 30 runners, 
they're perfect in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've struggled a lot with (offense)," said Hargrave, the cleanup hitter who 
is batting .262, "but we still win because we play good defense; that's why we 
go so many innings. Our defense is so into it mentally; we keep pushing our 
defense because we know that we'll score eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 6-11 start, Fullerton is batting .238 with a .289 slugging average 
and .374 on-base percentage. The figures are better than they were 13 games 
ago, but still won't scare anyone. Statistically, this team is laughable, but 
that's what makes it dangerous -- it plays as a unit and doesn't rely 
completely on any individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are the underdogs of the playoffs, official representative of the 
.500 Club. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Saugus (27-2-1), the top-seeded team in the division, has the heavy 
burden in today's game at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know you're supposed to win, you do have a lot of pressure," McAulay 
said. "We're a young team, and we don't like the pressure. Knowing that you 
beat someone you aren't supposed to beat, you get so much confidence. I don't 
know if we prefer to be an underdog, but it does seem to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always say, 'We don't have anything to lose.' Charter Oak had a lot to 
lose -- they were the defending CIF champion. Lakewood was the No. 4 team, so 
they had a lot to lose. The only thing we could do was play our hardest to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to shock people."

INDIANAPOLIS 500; BIRD IN HAND, PENSKE SHAKES BUSH 
</P>

 Master salesman Roger Penske might have his biggest sales challenge ahead of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 After using a little-noticed U.S. Auto Club rule to overwhelm the opposition 
in Sunday's Indianapolis 500, Penske is now going to try to convince his beaten 
Indy car brethren that the new Mercedes Benz push-rod engine should be 
legalized for all other races. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr., who collected a record $1,373,813 at the victory banquet Monday 
night for winning the 500 for the second time, drove the Mercedes to its first 
Indy victory since Ralph DePalma in 1915. Earlier in the race, Unser and 
Emerson Fittipaldi, who crashed 15 laps from the end, had lapped the entire 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will write a letter of application to the CART rules committee requesting 
that the rule be in effect for the entire season," Penske said Monday. "If it 
is accepted, we have to guarantee engines for at least one other team." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the application is expected to be made immediately, Penske said he 
had no idea when the committee might rule on it. He said he hoped it might be 
approved for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The push-rod engine, developed by Ilmor Engineering with financial support 
from Mercedes Benz, became the first engine to win in its debut at 
Indianapolis. Only one similar engine had even finished the 500 before Sunday. 
That was when Al Unser Sr. finished third in 1992 with a Buick V6. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a groundswell of criticism of the one-of-a-kind powerplant in 
Penske's cars in Gasoline Alley. No one accused Penske of circumventing the 
rules, but it was generally believed that USAC goofed when the rule was written 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barry Green, owner of Jacques Villeneuve's second-place car: "They've got 
a heap more power than us, because of the rules, the unfair rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jimmy Vasser, fourth-place finisher: "I had to tighten my helmet one time 
when Emerson (Fittipaldi) went by, he went by so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Andretti, who finished third but was dropped to sixth for a rules 
infraction: "I'd say their advantage was 200 horsepower. When one of the 
Marlboro cars went by me, I'd try to get a tow and I couldn't keep up they went 
by me so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Indy 500 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Villeneuve's second-place finish after becoming the fastest Indy 500 
rookie qualifier made it easy for the rookie of the year selection committee, 
but not to be overlooked were fine rides by Bryan Herta, Mauricio Gugelmin and 
Brian Till. . . . Eddie Cheever won the Perseverance Award after starting 11th. 
He climbed up to third before being dropped back to 27th after a stop-and-go 
penalty for passing illegally, and finished eighth. . . . Mark Smith, who was 
bumped on the final day of qualifying two years in a row and served as first 
alternate in 1993 and this year, was given the Jigger Sirois Award for having 
the worst luck.

'FLINTSTONES' LEAVES THE REST IN ITS DUST; MOVIES: THE LIVE-ACTION FILM TAKES 
IN $37.5 MILLION OVER THE WEEKEND. TICKET-PRICE INFLATION NOTWITHSTANDING, IT 
ESTABLISHES A RECORD FOR A MEMORIAL DAY OPENING, BASED ON PRELIMINARY 
ESTIMATES.

 What do you call $37.5 million in the box-office till? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not pebbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood on Monday was calling the Memorial Day weekend gross for Universal 
Pictures' "The Flintstones" something "wonderful" and a "great start for the 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Starring John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, the live-action version of the 
Hanna-Barbera animated TV series that was a hit in the 1960s, established a 
record -- ticket-price inflation notwithstanding -- for a Memorial Day weekend 
opening, based on preliminary estimates. It surpassed the $37 million taken in 
by Paramount Pictures' sequel "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" in 1989, 
when ticket prices were somewhat lower. Both films are associated with Steven 
Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones" also helped propel ticket sales for the overall movie 
business approximately 10% ahead of last year's Memorial Day weekend, which is 
the traditional beginning to the summer season. Hollywood invests heavily in 
summer fare from which it hopes to derive 40% of an entire year's box-office 
receipts.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "After weeks of a springtime box-office slump, this certainly bodes well," 
said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., who noted that there are "many big 
titles to come," including Walt Disney's animated "The Lion King," which 
industry insiders have picked as this summer's expected box-office champ. It 
opens June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones" was launched with a massive marketing campaign -- notably a 
tie-in to McDonald's restaurants -- but to mixed reactions from the critics who 
thought the audience for the movie would be children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought this movie wasn't going to work, or that it would be 
only for kids," said Universal Pictures chairman Tom Pollock, whose studio 
released last summer's "Jurassic Park" (another Spielberg picture and the 
industry's all-time box-office champ). "But when you have a Friday night where 
families comprise only about half the business, it means that the other half 
are adults and teens on dates."  
</P>
<P>
 It also meant that about 40% of the weekend audience headed directly to "The 
Flintstones' " hometown of Bedrock, and it might appear that the stampede left 
other films in the proverbial dust. But not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick," another remake of an old TV show with Mel Gibson as a card shark 
of the Old West and a cast that also bills Jodie Foster and James Garner, 
delivered an estimated big $18 million in the Friday-through-Monday period. 
That brought the total for the Warner Bros. release after two weekends of 
national release to just over $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures' "Beverly Hills Cop III" drew an estimated $15.5 million in 
its debut. The film is the third in the series starring Eddie Murphy as a 
Detroit cop who finds adventures in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For Murphy, the opening was the strongest of his last three movies. His film 
"Boomerang" opened on a peak summer weekend in 1992 to $13.6 million. "The 
Distinguished Gentleman" scored $10.5 million in its first weekend during the 
Christmas season in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The box-office figures released Monday were based on industry estimates for 
Friday through Monday. Final results will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 In fourth place was the Andy Garcia-Meg Ryan alcoholism drama "When a Man 
Loves a Woman" with $7.1 million, followed by the late Brandon Lee and "The 
Crow" in fifth with $6.3 million and "Four Weddings and a Funeral" in sixth 
with $2.7 million, estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike Lee's "Crooklyn" finished seventh with $1.6 million, while "With Honors" 
was eighth with $1.4 million. "Little Buddha" was ninth with $834,000 and "3 
Ninjas Kick Back" was 10th with $745,000.
