CLINTON TEAM MOUNTS HEALTH CARE BLITZ; INSURANCE: CABINET OFFICIALS STREAM TO 
CAPITOL HILL IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO RESCUE FLOUNDERING LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Clinton Administration Cabinet officials blitzed Capitol Hill Friday in an 
urgent effort to rescue floundering health care reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the House Democratic leadership having chosen to delay action on health 
care indefinitely, the Senate -- which is divided along partisan lines -- 
plodded deliberately through a fourth day of floor debate on its version of 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is far short of assembling majorities in either house of 
Congress for its plans to provide universal health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Cabinet secretaries and other high-ranking members of the Clinton team 
huddled with the President for a morning breakfast then headed to Capitol Hill 
for closed-door meetings with wavering Democratic members of Congress, who are 
refusing to support the blueprints of the party's own leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering an upbeat view, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala 
said the Cabinet was "riled up and enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 "The test of this Administration is not whether we're going to trip every once 
in a while but whether we're going to get up, brush ourselves off and get out 
there and keep working," she said after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood among Democrats in Congress was much more somber. In the House, 
there seems scant chance of success for the proposal put together by Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). It would require all firms to provide 
insurance for their workers, with the companies picking up 80% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 House leaders said Friday that they will turn their attention to other issues 
before taking up health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no magic date here," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), 
deepening the gloomy assessment he offered Thursday when he announced that the 
debate scheduled for next week had been scrapped.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take it up when it's ready to be brought up," Foley told 
reporters, leaving open prospects for continued delay that might kill the 
bill's chances in this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Small business fiercely opposes the employer mandate contained in the Gephardt 
proposal. Hoping to disarm this opposition, Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) devised a plan calling for voluntary expansion of insurance 
protection to bring coverage to 95% of all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 If this voluntary effort does not work, a mandate would take effect in the 
year 2002 in states where coverage did not reach the 95% goal. The delayed 
mandate would require companies to contribute at least 50% of the cost of 
insurance, less burdensome to business than the Gephardt formula. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all Republicans and a significant number of dissenting Democrats seem 
unalterably opposed to any government requirement that employers provide health 
insurance, whether the mandate takes effect immediately or is held in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate continued its debate Friday but members clearly had been shaken by 
the developments in the House -- the double blow of the delay on health care 
and the unexpected defeat of the President's crime bill on a procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate has entered the extremely frightened zone," said one senior 
Democratic aide. "What they're doing out there today now is faking it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the aide said that Mitchell continues to make alterations in his bill 
to try to win votes, one senator at a time. Most of those changes, he said, are 
additions to the benefits package that have been demanded by various 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As floor debate continued Friday, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) offered 
the first formal amendment to the bill, a proposal requiring all health 
insurance policies sold after July, 1995, to include prenatal care for pregnant 
women and immunizations and check-ups for children. 
</P>
<P>
 No significant test votes seem likely in the Senate until next week, and the 
White House is still scrambling without success to get a majority for the 
delayed mandate contained in the Mitchell bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators who object to the mandate are looking for alternate formulas. One 
group of 14 that has been struggling with the issue for weeks met for 2 1/2 
hours Friday in a vain effort to find common ground. They will try again today. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly formed group -- Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and David L. Boren of 
Oklahoma, and Republicans Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Robert F. Bennett 
of Utah -- said Friday they will offer a plan next week that "is a voluntary, 
market-oriented approach with no employer mandates, no new massive entitlement 
program, no new taxes and no government price controls or excessive government 
bureaucracy."

APPELLATE COURT ASKED TO REVIEW STARR APPOINTMENT; WHITEWATER: SEN. LEVIN URGES 
JUDICIAL PANEL TO RULE WHETHER NEW INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S PAST POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES MAKE HIM AN INAPPROPRIATE CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the independent counsel 
law called Friday for the appellate court panel that appointed new Whitewater 
counsel Kenneth W. Starr to rule on whether Starr's past Republican activities 
are grounds for his withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 With Democratic anger over Starr's appointment continuing to rise, Sen. Carl 
Levin (D-Mich.) wrote Judge David B. Sentelle, presiding judge of the 
independent counsel division of the U.S. Court of Appeals here, to complain 
that Starr's appointment "puts at risk the historical public acceptance of the 
independent counsel process." Starr "lacks the necessary appearance of 
independence essential for public confidence," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that handled 
the newly enacted independent counsel law, said "the same standard should apply 
to Mr. Starr" that Republicans applied to former special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. when they expressed concerns that he was not independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr was named by Sentelle's panel Aug. 5 under a new independent counsel law 
signed by President Clinton on June 30. Fiske, who had been in charge of a 
six-month Whitewater investigation, was named by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno under 
pressure from Republicans, after the previous law expired.  
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have been careful not to join in public attacks on Starr 
and even distanced the President from critical statements about Starr made by 
Clinton's personal attorney, Robert S. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 As independent counsel, Starr will investigate whether Clinton benefited from 
money funneled to Whitewater Development Corp. from a now-defunct Arkansas 
savings and loan owned by James B. McDougal, his investment partner in the 
Whitewater real estate venture.  
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Democrats and other Clinton supporters have charged that Starr 
cannot be impartial and objective in his investigation because of his interest 
in a Republican political career and his earlier interest in intervening in a 
sexual harassment suit filed by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state 
employee, against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his appointment, Starr reportedly considered filing a brief in the 
sexual harassment suit to argue against the President's claim of immunity. He 
also reportedly considered a run for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate 
from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have finally uncovered a real case of political interference in the 
Whitewater investigation: the actions by partisan Republicans who successfully 
demanded that Robert B. Fiske Jr. be removed as independent prosecutor," 
complained a statement released Friday by the "Back to Business Committee," an 
ad hoc group of Democratic politicians with close ties to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentelle, a conservative North Carolinian and an appointee of President Ronald 
Reagan, confirmed Friday that he had met with conservative Republican senators 
in July, during the time that his panel was selecting a new Whitewater special 
prosecutor.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) also confirmed that he and Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) had lunch with Sentelle on July 14, but both Sentelle and Faircloth 
denied that they discussed any issues related to the selection of a new 
independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Faircloth added in a statement released Friday that the mounting criticism of 
Starr's selection "shows how very worried (the Democrats) are, now that they 
have lost control over the investigation since their hand-picked special 
counsel was rejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, key Senate Democrats have privately told top Administration 
officials that Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman should resign over his 
role in the Whitewater matter, and his departure now appears all but certain, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The negative verdict on Altman -- conveyed by Senate Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Sen. Paul 
S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who is in line to assume the chairmanship next year -- 
effectively sealed the Treasury official's fate, the sources said. Altman has 
been severely criticized by lawmakers for an alleged lack of candor during 
testimony about meetings between Treasury and White House officials concerning 
the status of a federal regulatory investigation linked to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman declined to comment Friday, but Administration sources have said he 
recognizes that it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to survive the 
controversy in his current post.

SUSPECT'S GUN LINKED TO SLAYING OF OFFICER; CRIME: MAN ACCUSED IN OREGON 
KILLING WAS QUESTIONED EARLIER ABOUT SLAYING OF MANHATTAN BEACH POLICEMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man now suspected of killing Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz in 
December was questioned by detectives just a few weeks after the crime, but 
there wasn't enough evidence to connect him to the slaying, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities say the .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol taken from Roger 
Hoan Brady, 28, after a robbery and homicide near Portland, Ore., is the gun 
used to kill Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullet that killed Officer Ganz was fired from the gun in Mr. Brady's 
possession," William A. Baker, chief of detectives of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, said at a news conference at the Martin Ganz Memorial, a 
commemorative pedestal at Live Oak Park in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said a 60-detective task force received an anonymous phone tip in 
January naming Brady as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives interviewed Brady shortly afterward at his home in Topanga Canyon, 
but "there was nothing tangible we could sink our teeth into," Baker said. 
However, he added, Brady "was not dismissed as a suspect. . . . He was just one 
of more than 2,000 clues we were following." 
</P>
<P>
 A gray, 1988 Daihatsu used in the Oregon robbery matches the car believed to 
have been used by Ganz's killer. Since the officer's slaying, detectives have 
checked out leads on 2,700 vehicles and examined 600 firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, who joined the Manhattan Beach Police Department in 1989, was shot 
in the head by a motorist he pulled over during a routine traffic stop near the 
Manhattan Village shopping mall the night of Dec. 27. The murder was witnessed 
by Ganz's 13-year-old nephew, who was on a "ride-along" with his uncle, and by 
another witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady has been charged in Oregon with killing a 55-year-old registered nurse 
who was shot Aug. 3 as she stood outside a suburban supermarket that had just 
been robbed. A witness got the license number of the getaway car -- the gray 
Daihatsu -- and police traced it to an apartment in Vancouver, Wash., where 
Brady lived with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady eventually surrendered and is being held without bail in Oregon. The 
.380-caliber pistol was found in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal court and prison records show that Brady was arrested in October, 
1989, for the robbery of Home Federal Savings & Loan in Agoura Hills, in which 
he pointed a pellet gun at a teller and got $2,053. 
</P>
<P>
 He later was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison, with five years 
probation to follow. He was released from the prison at Lompoc in October, 
1992.

CRIME BILL'S DEFEAT A BLOW TO SOUTHLAND CITIES; BUDGETS: MANY STATE AND LOCAL 
AGENCIES WERE ANTICIPATING AN INFUSION OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER 
THE NEXT SIX YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In defeating President Clinton's crime bill, Congress added another quick and 
painful thump to cash-strapped local governments, and officials said they were 
surprised and angered by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars -- perhaps 
as much as several billion dollars -- over the next six years to state and 
local governments seeking to stem the tide of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a slap in the face to everything we have tried to do to turn this 
city around," Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, whose central campaign theme was boosting the number of 
officers on the streets, called the setback on the crime bill "a real blow to 
the people of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one had factored crime bill money into their current budgets, many 
agencies were looking forward to an infusion of funds next year. Police, courts 
and jails would have been the primary beneficiaries of the bill's myriad 
provisions and programs. But agencies as varied as the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, battered women's shelters, sports leagues for at-risk youths, 
and Boys and Girls Clubs would also have received new funding under the bill's 
crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials said the crime bill could have brought as much as 
$100 million in federal funding to the city's crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department figured it was entitled to about $50 million 
from the bill to add hundreds of officers to the force, fund more overtime pay 
for officers and pay for new police equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is embarked on an effort to add 2,855 police officers over the next 
five years, and Riordan said the crime bill's defeat will not upset those 
plans. Riordan said Project Safety Los Angeles will proceed without the federal 
crime money, but "we'd sure like to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $25 million would have been available to the city for drug 
treatment, education and jobs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big losers include the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said that over the 
next six years California would have received about $1 billion to help pay for 
its prison construction program. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would have provided an additional $700 million over the next 
six years to house state prisoners who are illegal immigrants. Further, the 
bill would have authorized the hiring of 4,000 new Border Patrol agents over 
six years, some of whom would have been stationed along the California-Mexico 
border, said Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Washington watchers cautioned that much of the money that so many in 
California had been counting on may have been illusory from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tajima, a federal legislation analyst with the Los Angeles County chief 
administrative office, said that authorizing $33.2 billion in crime funds is 
one thing. But getting Congress to allocate the money is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a law passed by Congress in 1986 authorized federal funds to 
help pay the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants who committed felonies, 
an issue of tremendous import to California. But Congress has yet to 
appropriate funds for that program, Tajima said, and it is unclear what level 
of funding would ever have been available under the Clinton crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 And cumbersome rules and regulations may have kept many local agencies from 
ever receiving any funds, Tajima said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bill's major provisions, the $8.9-billion community policing 
program, requires local agencies to match federal funds on a minimum 75% 
federal to 25% local split. Communities that are willing to increase their 
share of the cost above 25% would be first in line to receive the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That could help the LAPD, which is in the process of expanding its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But cash-strapped agencies, such as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, would probably get nothing from the program, county analysts said. 
When the Sheriff's Department applied for a federal grant under a similar 
program last year, and asked that the matching funds requirement be waived, the 
request was turned down and the county received no money, Tajima said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, because of Los Angeles' large population of undocumented 
immigrants, it would have received a very large share of money for 
incarcerating foreign nationals, analysts said. Other localities with small 
populations of such offenders would probably not go to the bother of filling 
out all the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajima and others also noted that even if the funds were appropriated, the 
federal government would have to write new regulations, field applications, 
review the requests and then disburse the funds. That process, at best, could 
run well into next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, local youth organizations said they were eager to compete for 
some of the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just get tough on crime once it occurs . . . you have to prevent 
crime," said Danny Hernandez, executive director of the Hollenbeck Youth Center 
and founder of the Inner City Games. "We felt that we were going to get some of 
that money because groups like ours are in the trenches every day."

HEALTH CREWS ABANDON THEIR CARS IN JOB PROTEST; LABOR: INSPECTIONS COME TO 
NEAR-STANDSTILL AS UNION MEMBERS TAKE TO BICYCLING AND WALKING. THEY ARE 
SEEKING A PAY HIKE AND HIGHER MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENTS IN THEIR CONTRACT DISPUTE. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 300 Los Angeles County health inspectors are bicycling and walking 
to restaurants, markets and other assignments in a contract dispute that has 
brought health inspections to a near-standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 A union official said the county has suspended about 12 inspectors since the 
protest began Wednesday. The inspectors, who have been without a contract for 
nearly two years, are seeking a cost-of-living increase and higher mileage 
reimbursements for their personal cars, which they normally use for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began, about 320 inspectors in the county Department of 
Health Services' environmental health unit have pedaled bikes, ridden Metrolink 
trains and hoofed it to assignments throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not any little wildcat action," said Jim Somers, a negotiator with the 
Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental Health Specialists, the union that 
represents inspectors. "Only about 5% of the inspections are being done." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those suspended Friday was Chris Gerfen, an inspector in the Pacoima 
branch on Van Nuys Boulevard, who has been bicycling since Wednesday to his 
west San Fernando Valley assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, it took me two hours to ride my bike from here to the Fallbrook 
Fashion Mall," said Gerfen, whose inspection rate fell from about 14 to three a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the suspension, Gerfen hopped back on the bike again Friday. "I'm 
going to continue my duty to protect the public," he said. "They just can't use 
my car anymore. They have not been bargaining in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Marcus, director of labor relations for the county chief administrative 
office, defended the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has ordered them to do their work, they are refusing to, and 
that's insubordination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health inspectors do everything from investigating food-poisoning complaints 
at restaurants and markets to examining apartments for cockroach and rodent 
infestations. They also evaluate sewage plans to see if they meet health code 
requirements. The inspections sometimes lead to criminal charges or business 
closures.  
</P>
<P>
 Although health license fees that fund the department have increased 40% since 
1991, inspectors have not received a mileage increase in 13 years or a 
cost-of-living increase for three years, Somers said. The inspectors contract 
expired Oct. 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old contract, inspectors have been using their personal vehicles to 
travel to inspection sites and are reimbursed by the county at 25 cents a mile, 
which they argue is too low. The rules do not cover expenses such as flat tires 
and other routine repair and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Somers claimed that the county is illegally diverting money from his 
department to other county departments, saying that is the greatest source of 
anger among inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is very specific," he said. "The money we collect (from health 
license fees) is supposed to be spent on inspecting restaurants, markets, 
things like that. It cannot be spent on clinics and hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court over 
the issue. The suit names Department of Health Services chief Robert Gates, 
county Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed and the five county supervisors 
as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Union accountants claim that $14 million in health license fees was siphoned 
from the department's Environmental Health Section last year. The section, 
which employs about 350 health inspectors, funds itself through the health 
license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the county is transferring those funds to the general fund to 
support other programs that aren't as profitable," said union attorney Sylvia 
E. Kellison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past three years, the department's overall inspection rates have 
been down as much as 30%, Somers said. Critical inspections, such as those of 
restaurants, which are supposed to be done four times a year, are down to less 
than twice a year, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1993 and 1994, Somers said, the county raised health license fees 25%, 
although inspectors received no raises or cost-of-living hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for inspecting an average food market went up from $380 to $472, 
while apartment building inspections increased from $267 to $331, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody being charged a health license permit is being overcharged," Somers 
said. "The health department has found a way to take this legal framework and 
abuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials were unavailable for comment Friday on the job action or rate 
hikes. Marcus would not comment on the rate increases, except to say they did 
not entitle workers to a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have said that the job action will last indefinitely. The two 
sides have not met at the bargaining table since June and, Somers said, "it's 
going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerfen said he hopes it won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody calls in and complains and it takes me half a day to get there on 
a bike, it may be food poisoning," he said. "It may jeopardize somebody's 
health."

 Ventura County's fall political season kicked into high gear Friday as dozens 
of candidates registered to compete for a host of city council and mayoral 
positions, with the most crowded races emerging in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. Friday, the deadline for filing in several city races, more than 50 
candidates had been certified to run for 26 council seats in nine local cities. 
Only Ventura, which has elections in odd-numbered years, has no council seats 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the county's Nov. 8 ballot will include a record 145 elective offices, 
including positions on 17 school boards and 18 special district boards. Voters 
will also cast ballots for two seats on the county Board of Supervisors and for 
county auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 They will pick three state legislators, two congressmen and a U.S. senator. 
Nine other statewide posts are on the ballot, including the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most (races) we've ever had," said Bruce Bradley, the county's 
elections chief. "It's going to be very crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county experienced a record low 33.6% voter turnout in the June 
gubernatorial primary, officials say they expect a much higher turnout in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, we have seen a jump of about 20% to 25%," Bradley said. "In 
the last two governor's elections, we had about a 60% turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 With so many city council seats available this fall, including a number of 
open seats, Bradley said "there's going to be quite a lot of change." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's two biggest cities have drawn the largest number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, 10 candidates filed for three council seats, setting the 
stage for what could be the liveliest campaign in the east county. Incumbents 
Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah will seek reelection, but Councilman Alex Fiore 
will retire after 30 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues are expected to be growth and increasing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Gregory Cole, a trustee of the county's community college district, 
said he decided to run for the Thousand Oaks council because he wants to 
improve police protection by possibly establishing a substation in the city 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is a big issue," he said. "I've heard from a lot of people that 
they don't feel as secure in their businesses or homes as they once had." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, five candidates have filed for two council seats, while Mayor 
Greg Stratton will run unopposed for a fifth term. In Moorpark, three 
candidates filed for two seats, including incumbents John Wozniak and Bernardo 
Perez. Mayor Paul Lawrason is unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think that the reason there are so few entries this year is that 
people are generally satisfied with our performance," Lawrason said. "Maybe 
that's a dangerous thing to say. It might come back to haunt me." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, eight candidates filed for two council seats and television 
producer Antonio De La Cerda will challenge one-term Mayor Manuel Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cerda, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1992, said he has decided to 
try again because he wants to ease restrictions on small businesses and take a 
more aggressive stand against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be active, not reactive," he said. "I think I can bring a lot of 
energy to this race." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, three political newcomers have filed applications to run for 
three open seats, including that of Councilman Dorill B. Wright, who is 
stepping down after nearly three decades. Two other longtime council members -- 
Ken Hess and James Daniels -- also decided to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say it's necessarily the end of an era, but it's certainly a 
changing of the guard," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanical engineer Frank McElfish said he is running for the council because 
he is concerned about maintaining city services in the face of declining 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 After Port Hueneme voters rejected in June a property tax needed to maintain 
the city's Police Department, the City Council approved a utility tax to pay 
the $500,000 tab, a decision that upset some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a critical point in the life of the city," McElfish said. "If we 
don't come up with some creative ways to revitalize the city, then we will have 
some serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Council members Charlotte Craven, Stanley J. Daily and Charles 
Ken Gose will not have to worry about campaigning this year. All three are 
unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, seven council candidates have filed for three seats. Incumbents Steve 
Olsen, Joe De Vito and Nina Shelley are all seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, three candidates will compete for two seats, including council 
members Linda Brewster and Don Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate broker Evaristo H. Barajas, a 31-year resident of the city, said 
he decided to challenge the incumbents so he can attract more business to the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our employment here is not that great," Barajas said. "A lot of people here 
work in Oxnard, Ventura or Los Angeles, and they spend their money out of town. 
We need that money here." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Santa Paula, six candidates have filed papers for three council seats, 
including one seat being vacated by retiring Margaret Ely. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for filing candidacy papers in Ojai, Camarillo and Fillmore was 5 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Santa Paula, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, 
the deadline has been extended until Wednesday because some incumbents chose 
not to seek reelection.

MORALS LIKELY ISSUE IN SCHOOL BOARD RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS and TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Galvanized by recent debates over sex education and the firing of a former 
Ventura County school principal, at least four candidates who have supported 
conservative Christian causes have filed to run for the Simi Valley and county 
school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance of these candidates promises to make the Simi Valley and county 
school board races among the most closely watched local contests this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides these races, 16 other school boards in districts from Fillmore to 
Conejo Valley have seats up for election. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District alone has 10 candidates 
vying for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With no major issues at the forefront in Conejo Valley, some challengers say 
their main goal is to oust the two incumbents who are running -- Mildred Lynch 
and Richard Newman. The third available seat belonged to trustee William Henry 
Jr., who resigned in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, a former teacher, is pursuing her third term and Newman, a retired Simi 
Valley police officer, is seeking reelection to his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Cohen Westmiller, one of the eight challengers in the race, said she is 
concerned that no one on the board has school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current board is out of touch with what is going on in the schools," said 
Westmiller, who has three children in Conejo Valley schools. "They don't have 
any kids in the school district." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Westmiller, the challengers are Cheryl S. Heitmann; Elaine McKearn; 
Elroi Reimnitz; Charles E. Rittenburg; Barbara A. Sponsler; Susan Witting; and 
Ellyn Wilkins, who served on the school board for six years in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Moorpark Unified School District, incumbent trustees Pam Castro and 
Gary Cabriales face challenges from two longtime activists on school issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Green, an IRS auditor and NAACP member who made a previous unsuccessful 
bid for the school board in November, has criticized the district for including 
on its reading list the novel "The Cay," which Green considers racist. David 
Pollock, a corporate planner for Rockwell International, has worked on several 
education committees in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard Union High School District, three Latino candidates are 
challenging three white incumbents. The district, whose student population is 
55% Latino, has never had a Latino trustee, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Nancy Koch, who is completing her first term, and trustees 
Janet Lindgren and Jean Daily-Underwood, who have each served on the board 
since the early 1970s, are all seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for their seats are Margaret Cortese, a clinical psychologist and 
community activist; Carlos De Moss, an air traffic controller; and Robert Q. 
Valles, a civilian employment director at the Port Hueneme Navy base who has 
long been active on a school district advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these local school elections, the Ventura County Community 
College District board also has three of its five seats open. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Karen Boone, who represents Ventura, will face two challengers: 
former Ventura College administrator John Tallman, a vocal critic of the 
current district leadership, and Jim Hibbs, a local businessman who wants to 
boost enrollment and improve student services. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for the seat representing the Thousand Oaks area is wide open because 
trustee Gregory Cole is not seeking reelection. So far, four candidates are 
vying for this position: university administrator Annette B. Burrows, 
psychologist Don Kingdon, attorney Donald E. Stevens and orthodontist Norman J. 
Nagel. 
</P>
<P>
 And incumbent Pete Tafoya is facing no competition in his bid to continue 
representing the area including Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley Unified School District, which was rocked this year by 
severe earthquake damage to its schools, a raucous debate over sex education 
and the on-campus killing of a 14-year-old student, two major issues likely to 
come up for debate are school safety and a push by conservative Christians to 
teach morals in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Though board President Carla Kurachi is pursuing a second term, trustee Doug 
Crosse has decided against running. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for the two seats besides the incumbent are five challengers, including 
two -- Janice Difatta and Glenn Woodbury -- who helped lead a fight this year 
against a proposal to give Simi Valley students information on birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for abstinence-only sex education has been a popular cause with 
conservative Christians. Woodbury, who owns a weatherstripping business, said 
that although he is Christian and politically conservative, he is not part of 
any organized movement to take over the school board. Difatta could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A third candidate, Norm Walker, is principal of a Simi Valley Baptist school 
and was an organizer in the unsuccessful campaign to pass the Proposition 174 
school-voucher initiative in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The other challengers in Simi Valley are employment consultant Jacquie 
Richardson and children's literature author Sharon Hushka. 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka said she believes the presence of conservative Christians in the race 
will be an issue during the campaign. "There is definitely a presence of the 
radical right," she said. "I think the separation of church and state is going 
to be key." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the Ventura County school board, all three incumbents face 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 And two of the challengers -- Angela N. Miller and Walt Madrid -- are 
affiliated with groups aligned with conservative Christian causes. Miller 
belongs to Concerned Women of America, and Madrid is a member of the fledgling 
Simi Valley-based group, Citizens for Truth in Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Miller and Madrid were supporters of Dan Flynn, the former juvenile court 
schools principal who was fired by county Schools Supt. Charles Weis shortly 
after Flynn lost his bid for Weis' job in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is running against incumbent Juanita Sanchez-Valdez for the seat 
representing the Ventura-Oxnard area. Also vying for that seat is college 
teacher Jeffrey Moss. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said he was prompted to run partly by his concerns that conservative 
Christians, or any group with a particular political agenda, may take control 
of the county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller said there is no organized campaign for conservative Christians to 
gain control on the county school board. "This is a decision I came to on my 
own," she said. "I'm representing the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member board already has one trustee, Wendy Larner, who supports 
conservative Christian causes, such as sex education that teaches only 
abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the seat representing Simi Valley, incumbent Al Rosen is 
facing challenges from both Madrid and attorney Daniel R. Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Moss, Gonzalez said one reason he is running is to help ensure that 
conservative Christians do not gain control of the county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The third available seat represents Thousand Oaks. Incumbent Doylenne G. 
Johnson and businessman Marty Bates are competing for that position. 
</P>

J.E. Mitchell contributed to this report.

SMOG LEVELS, FIRE RISK RISE WITH THE HEAT; WEATHER: RESIDENTS HIT BEACHES AND 
POOLS, OR JUST SEEK OUT SHADE, TO ESCAPE SIZZLING TEMPERATURES, WHICH ARE 
FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY.

<P>
 Air pollution advisories were issued from Simi Valley to Santa Paula on Friday 
as sweltering temperatures and a lack of ocean breezes drove air pollution to 
unhealthful levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Smog levels were expected to remain high today in Simi Valley, Moorpark, 
Fillmore, Piru and Santa Paula, as a muggy heat wave hovers over coastal 
Southern California through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials, meanwhile, cautioned that the sizzling temperatures and dry 
brush could make for an explosive mix in the Ventura County backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case on Friday when a small grass fire on Pine Mountain rekindled 
after being extinguished a week ago with 10,000 gallons of water. The ridge-top 
flare-up, already surrounded by fire lines, was doused within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely rare that we have a rekindle like that," said Mike Preasmeyer, 
with the U. S. Forest Service's Ojai Ranger District. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tells you how dry conditions are, especially in the pine litter." 
</P>
<P>
 Preasmeyer added that forest rangers plan to step up patrols this weekend 
because today marks the opening of deer hunting season for much of the Ojai 
backcountry. Rangers will give verbal warnings to hunters for hazards such as 
illegal campfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even particles from an exhaust on a poorly maintained vehicle could cause a 
fire," Preasmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters from the National Weather Service said the unusually warm weather 
stems from a high-pressure system hovering over Arizona and is expected to last 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a pattern like that, it will usually prohibit a sea breeze from 
coming in," said forecaster David Gomberg. "And that's what we count on every 
day to keep us cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The same high-pressure system on Friday unleashed powerful thunderstorms over 
the San Jacinto Mountains and prompted officials to issue a flash flood watch 
for Palm Springs. Ventura County, however, is not expected to see rain in the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures on Friday topped 100 in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Fillmore and 
Ojai. In Oxnard and Ventura, highs ranged from the high 70s to the mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone's staying inside and sipping iced tea," said Ventura County 
Fire Capt. R. Bosman, who works at the Tapo Canyon station, where the 
temperature peaked at 105 degrees at 2:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here for 10 years," he said. "I don't recall it ever being hotter 
than 105." 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers with the county Fire Department reported no heat-related rescue 
calls. And officials with hospitals in Thousand Oaks and Santa Paula said they 
had treated no patients suffering heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents in most of eastern Ventura County, particularly those with 
respiratory problems, were warned Friday to avoid strenuous exercise because of 
high smog levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the Pollutant Standard Index was 136 on a scale that considers 
anything above 100 unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Arcemore, a meteorologist with the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District, said possible effects of exercising on a smoggy day include 
difficulty breathing, burning eyes, headache and a runny nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, residents were less concerned about health risks and more 
interested in finding some shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hart climbed down from the metal roof of the Thousand Oaks Library around 
3 p.m. after working under the scorching sun for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hot up there if you touched the metal for too long you would burn 
your hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's pretty much nothing we can do but sweat a lot and hope for a breeze," 
said Hart, who is supervising roof repairs that began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to grin and bear it." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat brought out kindness in some, such as the resident who greeted mail 
carrier Linda Morelock with a glass of iced tea midway through her postal 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really nice because we don't have air conditioning in these trucks," 
Morelock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although beaches in Ventura were slightly more crowded than usual by the 
afternoon, Thousand Oaks' city parks and streets were nearly deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone except me is inside in their air-conditioned homes," said 
Thousand Oaks resident Cheryl DeWick, who was forced outdoors for three hours 
while exterminators fumigated her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is awful," she said, trying to find shade under a small tree at Conejo 
Creek Park. "There's no escaping it."

METROLINK OFTEN LATE FROM L.A. TO COUNTY; TRANSIT: MEETING SCHEDULES IS A 
PROBLEM FOR SIXTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH. OFFICIALS BLAME THE TROUBLE PARTLY ON 
SOUTHERN PACIFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For the sixth month in a row, Metrolink trains to Ventura County were late 
more often than on any other line in the rail carrier's five-county system, a 
report released Friday shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority found that 
during July, a third of the trains returning from Los Angeles to Ventura County 
were at least five minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains from Ventura County into Los Angeles had a much better performance 
rate, arriving late only 6% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, trains to and from San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and Los 
Angeles counties were late on 4% to 12% of all trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said they are working to increase on-time performance in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday's 2 p.m. westbound train is any indication, there is plenty of room 
for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's a little late, but this is crazy," Melaniey Char, 15, 
said, fanning herself with her hand as she and a handful of passengers wilted 
in a patch of shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it doesn't come soon I'm going to die of heat." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the train finally pulled into the Simi Valley station, it was 26 
minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 The main culprit, according to Metrolink Executive Director Richard Stanger, 
is Southern Pacific Transportation Co., the railroad company that owns most of 
the track that Metrolink trains use in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink owns the track and operates its own dispatching system for most of 
its service area. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Metrolink trains first started running to Ventura County nearly two 
years ago, Southern Pacific decided to keep ownership of the track and 
dispatching rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The freight service agreed to share the single track with Metrolink, promising 
not to run freight trains during peak passenger hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Metrolink, Southern Pacific has reneged on the deal, giving 
freight traffic the right-of-way while commuters wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a dispatcher grants a Metrolink train the right-of-way, it may not 
be able to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Southern Pacific trains are as long as 7,000 feet, exceeding by thousands 
of feet the turnoffs where trains wait to allow other trains to pass. Metrolink 
trains average about 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatching problems with Southern Pacific during July accounted for more than 
half of the Metrolink delays that were longer than five minutes, according to 
the Metrolink report. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Furtney, a spokesman for Southern Pacific, said the company does not want 
to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are having ongoing negotiations and discussions with Metrolink," Furtney 
said. "It's a situation where they have their agenda and we have our agenda. We 
don't think it's something that should be negotiated in the media." 
</P>
<P>
 To penalize Southern Pacific, Metrolink has levied fines totaling $3,000 on 
the company. Fines range from $200 for a 10- to 15-minute delay to $1,000 for a 
delay of more than 30 minutes. And Metrolink is seeking to take over Ventura 
County dispatching operations from Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a train is late, we call Southern Pacific," Stanger said. "We are 
in constant touch with them about the problem. However, this approach is 
clearly not working." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, Stanger said, will be a discussion at the Sept. 9 meeting of 
the Ventura County Transportation Commission. The commission will mediate a 
discussion between representatives from Southern Pacific and Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, passenger Ned Imboden, 50, said he will continue taking the train. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to have to wait all the time," said Imboden, a Simi Valley 
resident who works for an engineering company in Los Angeles. "But it still 
beats driving."

SURVIVORS' RECOLLECTIONS OF LEAK HAZY; ACCIDENT: FUNERAL SERVICES SET FOR THREE 
VICTIMS OF PRIDE PETROLEUM TRAGEDY. INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the families of three Ventura County oil workers killed in a toxic gas leak 
prepared to lay their relatives to rest, the four survivors of the accident 
struggled Friday with hazy recollections of what had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Abbott of Oak View was released from Los Robles Regional Medical Center 
late Thursday after intensive oxygen treatments. He said the circumstances 
surrounding Wednesday's oil well accident make him depressed and are difficult 
for him to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just kind of hurt inside about all of what happened," Abbott said in an 
interview outside his home, "and I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, 18, had been working for Pride Petroleum for six months. He said he 
had no idea why he and his co-workers were feeling ill Wednesday until he was 
informed by doctors that he had inhaled hydrogen sulfide gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew it was dangerous gas until I got to the hospital and they told 
me," Abbott said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Furrow, vice president and area manager for Pride Petroleum, said the 
company may not have taught Abbott about the dangers of hydrogen sulfide but 
that the company's other injured workers had gone through a company training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Abbott) was a trainee and most likely had not gone through a training course 
yet," Furrow said. "That may be something we need to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the accident were Ronald Johnson, 24, and Jason Hoskins, 22, both of 
Ventura, and Sean David Harris, 26, of Oxnard. All three worked for Pride 
Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott said he has not decided if he will continue to work for Pride 
Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sandoval of Bakersfield, who was working at the site for Schlumberger 
Well Services at the time of the accident, was treated for respiratory problems 
at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital and released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, 34, said the details of the accident were "fuzzy" and he was still 
trying to piece together what occurred. He said he almost passed out from the 
hydrogen sulfide fumes he breathed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so quick. . . . We did everything we could," Sandoval said.

 While he held his breath, Sandoval was strapped to a harness and lowered down 
to try to rescue the three victims. But he does not think he made it all the 
way down into the concrete cellar where the men had collapsed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Thrower, 55, the site supervisor for Pride Petroleum, was released from 
St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital on Thursday after receiving oxygen 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a terrible situation for everybody," said Thrower's wife, 
Shirley, from their home in Oak View. She said her husband had been advised by 
doctors to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Walker, 41, of Bakersfield remained at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center, where he was in fair condition Friday. He declined to comment on the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Furrow of Pride Petroleum said his company is having increasing doubts about 
whether hydrogen sulfide gas caused the workers to collapse as is suspected. 
Subsequent testing by the company at the well site showed low levels of 
hydrogen sulfide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that maybe it was not (hydrogen sulfide)," Furrow said. "It 
appears that it could have been something to do with chemicals that came out of 
the ground with the water." The company has not yet determined what those other 
chemicals may have been, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County coroner's office is performing toxicology tests to 
determine if hydrogen sulfide was the cause of death, or whether other gases 
were involved. The test results will take several weeks, Deputy Coroner Craig 
Stevens said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from Pride Petroleum, Vintage Petroleum and the California 
Division of Occupational Safety and Health Administration are conducting 
separate probes of the accident, interviewing survivors and examining the site. 
The Cal-OSHA investigation, which could possibly lead to criminal and civil 
charges against the oil companies, will take several weeks, said Cal-OSHA 
spokesman John Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Harris will take place today at Ted Mayr Funeral Home in 
Ventura. Services for Johnson will take place Sunday at the James A. Reardon 
Mortuary in Oxnard, and services for Hoskins will take place Monday at the 
Charles Carroll Funeral Home in Ventura.

 Two Ventura College professors have won national science grants that will 
allow them to beef up the school's math and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Math and science instructors Richard Quint and W. Steve Quon submitted 
proposals aimed at buying new laboratory equipment to the National Science 
Foundation.Quint was awarded $45,626, while Quon was awarded $23,159. 
</P>
<P>
 Quint's award will allow the Ventura College math department to establish a 
computer laboratory to improve students' understanding of pre-calculus and 
calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 Quon's award has been used to create a modern optics laboratory course that 
features state-of-the-art optical technologies such as lasers. 
</P>
<P>
 The national award competition is highly competitive, according to the 
National Science Foundation. Only 25% of the proposals submitted to the 
foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program during the last 
fiscal year received funding. FRED ALVAREZ

TAPPING INTO TAIKO SOURCES -- TO DRAMATIC EFFECT; CULTURE: KENNY ENDO CREDITS 
INFLUENCES FROM KABUKI THEATER TO JAZZ IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND JAPANESE-STYLE 
MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sound of one hand clapping is one thing, but the sound of snow falling is 
entirely another, especially when you're trying to make that sound with drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to work in Kabuki theater, and a lot of my ideas come from sound 
effects for the stage," says Kenny Endo, whose taiko ensemble will play two 
shows tonight in the courtyard of the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. 
Taiko are drums ranging from very small, sensitive hand drums to others seven 
feet high, weighing up to 700 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the sound of snow, we use a mallet with a rounded padding at the end," 
Endo continued. "It makes a very soft sound, and in the theater it always 
accompanies tiny pieces of paper fluttering down from the top of the stage. But 
the sound of snow, the sound of waves, of wind and water and rain -- all of 
these can be used to express much, much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Endo (who will also play free concerts Sunday and Wednesday at California 
Plaza in downtown Los Angeles) explained how such effects can be used 
symbolically in Kabuki. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sound of water can mean any kind of stream or body of water in the 
literal sense. But at the end of a play, you might have two lovers walking off 
into the distance, and to show that their love is eternal we play the sound of 
water to suggest that their love is like flowing water. We use the sounds of 
nature to convey emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Endo, 41, played classical percussion and jazz-fusion trap drums while growing 
up in Los Angeles and La Habra. He studied political science and 
ethnomusicology at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, then worked with the San Francisco 
Taiko Dojo. Six months on a Native American reservation -- born of a desire to 
"do something real and off-campus" during his stint at Santa Cruz -- convinced 
him to learn more about his own roots. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Japan intending to stay one year but remained to study taiko for 
10. In 1987, he became the first foreigner to earn a natori , or stage name, in 
classical Japanese drumming, a seemingly subtle honor but actually a profound 
achievement for a third-generation American. " Natori literally means to 
receive a name, and it's an official recognition that you've achieved a certain 
level in your art," explained Endo (whose natori is Mochizuki Tajiro). "In 
Japan, the arts include the drumming arts as well as the tea ceremony or flower 
arranging. Having a natori is also a license to be a teacher. My natori is in 
the type of drumming you hear in Kabuki theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Endo -- who is is completing graduate studies in Hawaii, where he lives with 
his wife, Chizuko, and their two sons -- has performed in Europe, Egypt, 
Malaysia, Canada, Australia and the former Soviet Union. While Kabuki theater 
may seem somewhat esoteric to many Westerners, he has found that wherever he 
goes, people enjoy taiko music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Group taiko is very exciting because there's a lot of movement," he noted. 
"Hitting the drums can be a martial arts-like movement, and in some cases a 
dance-like movement. What I try to do in my own pieces is to make the music as 
interesting to listen to as it is to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kabuki is only one influence on his music. Edo festival music and modern 
Western music, including jazz, are others. In addition to taiko, he composes 
music for shamisen and koto (lute-like instruments), shinobue and shakuhachi 
(bamboo flutes), synthesizer, guitar and saxophone. His ensemble includes 
Chizuko Nishimura and Kevin Higa on taiko, Masakazu Yoshizawa on bamboo flutes 
and Noriko Tsuboi on 17-string koto. 
</P>
<P>
 If mixing Kabuki drumming and jazz seems a little like serving sushi with hash 
browns, Endo says that any combination is possible as long as it's done 
tastefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got back from a tour in Japan with a group of four Hawaiian drummers, 
each representing a different tradition," he said. "There was a Brazilian, an 
African, an American who plays conga-type drumming, and I represented the 
Japanese tradition. The four of us did a series of concerts with the Tokyo 
Symphony, and that combination worked very well.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the old Duke Ellington saying -- there are only two types of music 
in the world, good and bad. Categorizing music as jazz or rock or classical, 
those are simply labels. Rather than being true to any category, the label 
we're striving for is quality." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kenny Endo Taiko Ensemble plays tonight at 7 and 9 in the courtyard of 
the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real. Lawn chairs 
permitted. $4. (714) 493-1752. The ensemble will play free concerts Sunday at 2 
p.m. and Wednesday at noon at California Plaza, 350 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; PORT 
WITHDRAWS FROM ALAMEDA CORRIDOR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port of Long Beach has withdrawn from a proposed $1.8-billion project that 
would run freight trains between the city's docks and Los Angeles railroad 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials said they have suspended funding for the Alameda Corridor 
project because four cities along the route -- Compton, Vernon, South Gate and 
Lynwood -- refuse to drop a Superior Court lawsuit filed in July that seeks to 
block the port from expanding its terminals until the corridor is completed in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Port expansion, the cities charge in the lawsuit, is responsible for traffic 
problems along surface streets blocked by trains running to and from the 
harbor. The corridor is expected to relieve the traffic, but the cities do not 
want to endure five years of gridlock, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 The port's executive director, Steven R. Dillenbeck, and port Commissioner 
David Hauser announced that the port was pulling out of the project at the 
Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority's monthly meeting Thursday. The two 
then walked out of the meeting. "It is hard to keep the ball rolling when the 
people sitting across from you are suing you," Dillenbeck said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four cities and the port are among 16 members of the transportation 
organization. The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles had planned to provide 
about $1 billion for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The ports have committed $200 million each and plan to raise an additional 
$600 million through joint bond sales, said Gil Hicks, the project's director.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI officials are asking for the public's help in identifying a man suspected 
in two Thousand Oaks bank robberies and approximately 18 other hold-ups 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have dubbed the suspect the "Typed Note Bandit" because in most of 
the robberies a typed demand note has been presented to bank tellers.No weapons 
have been seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a white man between 25 and 30 years old, weighing 
170 to 200 pounds with light brown or blond hair and a receding hair line. 
</P>
<P>
 The two robberies in Ventura County occurred Monday at a First Interstate Bank 
branch on North Moorpark Road and May 2 at a California Federal Bank branch 
also on North Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The other robberies have taken place since August, 1993, in Tarzana, Palm 
Springs, Canoga Park, Marina Del Rey, Encino, Burbank, Sherman Oaks and Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the bandit is asked to call the FBI at (310) 
477-6565. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY WORKER STRUCK BY CAR, BADLY INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura city worker was struck by a car and critically injured Friday as he 
was retrieving orange traffic cones from Victoria Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Ramirez, 57, of Oxnard, suffered major head injuries and was in a coma 
late Friday at Ventura County Medical Center, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 10 a.m., Ramirez was clearing off four cones that he had set 
down to block off the right lane of southbound Victoria Avenue, just north of 
Olivas Park Drive. He had picked up three of the cones and was about to grab 
the fourth when he was struck by a car driven by Patrick J. Biando, 28, of 
Ventura, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biando, who was not injured, was changing lanes and apparently did not see 
Ramirez until it was too late, according to the the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked back over his shoulder to make sure it was safe (to change lanes), 
and then looked up and saw the road worker in front of him in the street," said 
CHP Officer Chris Day, who was investigating the accident Friday afternoon. "He 
then jerked hard to the right and slammed on his brakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Day said Ramirez saw the car bearing down on him and broke for the right-hand 
shoulder. Biando hit the brakes and went into a skid, but still struck Ramirez, 
Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Staci Morse said Biando's vision may have been blocked by 
traffic in front of him. An investigation into the incident continues and no 
arrest had been made Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who has only been with the city for six months, was assigned Friday 
to pick up equipment that measures traffic flow. The flow is measured as cars 
run over black rubber hoses laid across the street and connected to boxes on 
the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who was wearing an orange traffic-safety vest, had cleared the hoses 
from the street and was retrieving his traffic cones when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazir Lalani, city transportation engineer and Ramirez's boss, said that to 
his knowledge Ramirez is the first worker with the city's engineering division 
ever struck by a car while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalani said Ramirez, as with all employees in his line of work, received 
safety training before he started his job. A review will be launched to see 
what precautions Ramirez had taken and how and why he was hit. JASON GRANT

<P>
 A few openings remain in the Capistrano Unified School District's program that 
provides bilingual and literacy education for students from homes where Spanish 
or English is predominantly spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are seeking to fill the openings with kindergarten students 
from English-speaking families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Two-Way Language Immersion Program began last year. It is being offered at 
Las Palmas Elementary School, and has drawn some students from neighboring 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program guarantees that kindergartners -- half from Spanish-speaking homes 
and half from English-speaking homes -- will be bilingual and literate in both 
languages when they move on to middle school after the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Palmas Elementary School, which is on a year-round calendar schedule, 
started classes Aug. 1.

<P>
 The city of Oxnard has filed a lawsuit against the Santa Barbara Civic Light 
Opera seeking nearly $47,000 in unpaid bills for the use of the Oxnard Civic 
Auditorium, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the opera failed to pay for using the auditorium in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the opera was to pay the city $60,367 for the hall rental. Instead, 
the opera paid just $13,403. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages left for the opera's general manager were not returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Holmberg, an attorney who filed the civil suit for Oxnard, said the city 
decided on legal action after trying to work out payment plans with the opera.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; LAWYER 
FOR YOUTH IN TAPED POLICE BEATING ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney Humberto Guizar, who represents a teen-ager who was beaten by a 
Compton police officer, was arrested Friday on suspicion of carrying a loaded 
gun into a county courthouse in Monterey Park, said Sgt. John Vann of the Los 
Angeles County safety police. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was passing through the metal detector and one of the county guards 
detected a .25-(caliber) semiautomatic gun inside his briefcase," Vann said."He 
said he didn't know it was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar was taken to the Monterey Park police station and booked on a charge of 
unlawful possession of a handgun in a public building, Police Lt. William Yeung 
said. He remained in custody Friday night, with bail set at about $15,000, 
Yeung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar is the attorney for 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, whose beating by a 
Compton police officer July 29 touched off protests and heightened tensions 
between blacks and Latinos. A neighbor of Soltero's videotaped the incident, 
and Guizar became a key figure in the controversy when a grand jury ordered him 
to turn over a copy of the tape to assist in its investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Soltero was knocked to the ground and suffered a concussion and an injured 
left elbow, causing partial numbness in his hand, Guizar told reporters at the 
time.

<P>
 Bus and train operators and clerks employed by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority have ratified new three-year contracts that freeze pay for the first 
year but guarantee small raises thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Balloting of the United Transportation Union, which represents about 4,400 bus 
and train drivers, resulted in a 2,330-419 vote in favor of an agreement 
reached by the union and MTA negotiators before drivers struck in support of 
mechanics last month, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract calls for a wage freeze the first year. The drivers, whose 
average annual salary is $50,000, will receive a 30-cent hourly raise the 
second year and a 25-cent hourly increase the final year. Cost-of-living 
adjustments will be suspended until the third year. 
</P>
<P>
 To help close a $126-million operating deficit, the MTA will reduce its 
contribution toward health benefits from $570 a person to $530. But the level 
of benefits union members receive will remain the same, union spokesman Goldy 
Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited subcontracting -- a thorny issue during negotiations -- will also be 
allowed on highly subsidized bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks with the 660-member Transportation Communications Union also ratified a 
similar pact earlier this week, with a 1.6% raise the second year, then a 1.3% 
increase the final year. Cost-of-living adjustments will be suspended until the 
third year. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's contribution to their health benefits will drop from $520 to $507, 
but members will continue to receive the same package.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; NO CAUSE OF 
DEATH FOUND FOR BODIES LEFT IN STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Autopsies conducted Friday on the decomposed bodies of two men and a woman 
discovered in two trunks and a cardboard box at a U-Haul storage center in 
Northridge failed to reveal the causes of death, a coroner's spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said three doctors examined each body, but 
extensive decay made it impossible to determine the age or race of any of the 
victims, or how they died.Coroner's officials may consult a forensic 
anthropologist, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly appears that they have been there in the neighborhood of a year 
or longer," Carrier said. "It will be at least a couple of weeks before they 
come to a conclusion as to the cause of their death."  
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were found Wednesday after a man bid on the property that had been 
abandoned at a storage space at the self-storage facility at 18160 Parthenia 
St. The man smelled a foul odor and notified police.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2 WOMEN HURT AS CAR AVOIDS TRAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Simi Valley women were in critical condition late Friday after they 
swerved to avoid a runaway truck trailer on the Simi Valley Freeway and struck 
a tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 9:25 a.m. on California 118 east of Erringer Road 
when the trailer from a truck driven by Gregory Shafer of Chatsworth broke 
loose and crossed the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid hitting the load, Deeba Hashemyar, 20, veered sharply to the right 
and then slammed into a tree. A witness told California Highway Patrol officers 
that Hashemyar was traveling about 75 m.p.h. at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashemyar and her passenger, Shakila Hashemyar, 29, were both rushed to Simi 
Valley Hospital with critical injuries. They remained hospitalized Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else was injured in the accident, although two other cars were 
involved, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 A car driven by a 45-year-old Panorama City woman was struck by debris from 
the Hashemyars' crash, and a vehicle driven by a 36-year-old Sylmar man 
received minor damage when it was sideswiped by the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour later, as workers were trying to clear the accident, Laurie 
Anderson of Simi Valley was looking at the debris when she realized the traffic 
ahead had slowed down, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid hitting the car in front, she swerved sharply causing her vehicle to 
skid out of control and roll over. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center where she was treated 
and released. JULIE FIELDS

NEWBORN SURVIVES BEING LEFT IN TRASH BIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A newborn girl found in a dumpster in Lawndale was reported to be in good 
condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center on Friday, as authorities continued to 
seek information about her mother and her medical history. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant, born with six toes on each foot, was found by a passerby Wednesday 
morning, apparently just hours after her birth, said Lili Ahmadi, spokeswoman 
for the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was found only by chance in a trash bin behind the El Camino Village 
Apartments in the 14000 block of Lemoli Street, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody was looking for recyclables, went to the dumpster (and) found the 
baby with trash over her," Ahmadi said. "He heard a noise and assumed it was a 
cat, but when he searched further, he found a baby there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby's umbilical cord and placenta were still intact," Ahmadi said. "The 
baby is very lucky somebody found her in a timely way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmadi said the hospital was testing for drugs, such as cocaine, in the baby's 
system, but the results were not yet confirmed and it was unclear whether the 
mother's use of a drug might have caused the baby to have extra toes. 
</P>
<P>
 In some families of African American ancestry a sixth toe on each foot is not 
uncommon, Ahmadi said. Usually, the extra toes can be safely removed by a 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Services officials at a news conference Friday asked for 
information about the mother or about the baby's medical history. Though in 
good condition, she was being given antibiotics as a precaution, Ahmadi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most cases of child abandonment occur when the mother is a minor herself, or 
an illegal immigrant," Ahmadi said. She said 13 abandoned infants were found in 
Los Angeles last year.

TOBAGO MARATHONER FOUND AFTER 13-HOUR ODYSSEY IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mood for a long, hard run, Michael Alexander, a marathoner from Tobago, 
made a wrong turn on his way from a Burbank track to Sherman Oaks and got lost. 
Thirteen hours -- and nearly the distance of a marathon -- later, after his 
sister had reported him missing, he flagged down a police car Friday morning, 
about a mile and a half from her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little embarrassed, but OK," said Alexander, who is on his first trip 
to the United States. "I'll never forget L.A. after this." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Alexander's memories will be his jog on the Ventura Freeway and a 
collect phone call to a relative in Tobago, who passed on Alexander's 
predicament to his sister in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that he concentrates so deeply when he runs that he forgets 
everything else," said his sister, Angela Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's adventure began about 7:30 p.m. Thursday. He usually runs with a 
partner or scouts the route in advance to get a feel for it. This time he did 
neither, and soon became disoriented in the San Fernando Valley's look-alike 
topography. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said he did not know it is illegal to run on freeways -- which he 
did for about four miles between Sherman Oaks and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just like a normal street," he said. "Yes, I did hear some 
cars honking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the sky continued to darken, Alexander realized he was lost. He said he 
told some policemen he was disoriented, "but they didn't seem to care," and 
when he asked a store clerk for directions, "he told me to go left when I was 
supposed to go straight." 
</P>
<P>
 With no money, and unable to remember the address or phone number of his 
sister's apartment, Alexander jogged on, searching fruitlessly for familiar 
landmarks. Finally, he called Tobago collect. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister there phoned Angela Alexander to tell her that their brother was 
safe. Unfortunately, he had no idea where he was, so all Angela could do was 
tell police about his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, after running, then walking for a while, Alexander came 
to Moorpark Park, where he waited until daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to sleep," the 5-foot, 9-inch, 115-pound runner said. "I didn't 
feel it was safe." 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 a.m. Friday, an LAPD patrol car found him and his sister was called to 
pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's all-night odyssey proved his own philosophy of the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted in a Trinidad newspaper article earlier this year, he said, "The 
marathon race is never won by the quickest athlete. . . . The prize comes to 
those who endureth to the end."

MAN WHO FELL INTO SHAFT AT VALENCIA BUILDING SITE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A building inspector who was wedged into a 66-foot-deep shaft for nearly four 
hours at a Valencia construction site earlier this week has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Lozoya, 32, of Downey died at 7:15 p.m. Thursday at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital, where he had been in critical condition since the accident 
two days earlier. Details of his injuries have not been released, at the 
request of his family, but Lozoya went into cardiac arrest as he was pulled out 
of the hole by rescuers and had to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozoya, a contract employee with the city of Santa Clarita, fell into a shaft 
Tuesday at 23948 Via Onda, where two homes had been demolished after the 
Northridge earthquake. The openings in the ground were to be filled with 
concrete and steel reinforcements for seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic scene captured live by television cameras, rescuers 
painstakingly lowered themselves into the 2 1/2-foot-wide hole, finally pulling 
Lozoya out in a harness after he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, workers gathered at the construction site to discuss Lozoya's 
death. They described the Downey resident as likable and energetic, saying he 
often spoke of building his own home near the coast south of Los Angeles, 
according to project manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some employees indicated they are uncomfortable working near where 
Lozoya was injured, none have asked to leave the job site, Miller said. On the 
day of the accident, witnesses said, Lozoya had removed the plywood covering 
from the opening of the pit, but it remains unclear whether he accidentally 
stepped into the hole or whether the ground surrounding the opening collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't anybody's fault," said Bob Howard, a carpenter who saw Lozoya fall. 
"It was just a stupid accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozoya was employed by Anaheim-based Willdan and Associates, one of several 
building inspection firms Santa Clarita hired to help with thousands of 
structural reviews necessary after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction at the accident site is continuing because Cal/OSHA -- which is 
investigating the accident -- does not believe an imminent hazard exists to 
workers, agency spokesman John Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of an urban search and rescue team from Redondo Beach rescued Lozoya 
from the shaft, to the applause of co-workers and other onlookers. But it had 
taken hours. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, rescuers dangling from a rope were lowered into the hole to try to 
slip a harness around Lozoya, whose legs were pinned under him and who 
complained of back pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts were made to keep Lozoya alive and comfortable, including pumping 
oxygen down to him and supplying him with Gatorade. But it was not until he 
lost consciousness, causing his body to relax, that rescuers were able to lift 
him from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy by the Los Angeles County coroner's office is expected to be 
conducted today or Sunday.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REWARD OFFERED IN ROBBERY AT ANTIQUE 
SHOP

<P>
 Fed up with thieves who carted off $25,000 in antiques, the owners of a Simi 
Valley store are offering a $500 reward for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Ervin and her son Jim Ervin decided to offer the reward after thieves 
late last month threw a football-sized rock through their shop's front window, 
dismantled the alarm system and made off with hundreds of old watches, 
bracelets and gold chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ervins have operated the Penny Pinchers antique/junk store on Valley Fair 
for 28 years, stocking it with wares from 72 vendors ranging from antimacassars 
to zori sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just horrible that somebody would do this," Kathy Ervin said. "You feel 
like you've been violated." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER BUS FARE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bus riders in Simi Valley may be forced to pay higher fares if the City 
Council decides to hike rates to cover the increased cost of providing service. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will hold a public hearing Monday before deciding whether to 
increase regular fares from 75 cents to 90 cents and boost fares for the 
disabled from 75 cents to $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simi Valley Transit is carrying more riders than ever before in its 
22-year history, fare revenue has dropped as much as 5% on some routes, while 
costs have increased nearly 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run Simi Valley's buses at their current service level for another 
fiscal year is estimated at $1.6 million, $83,000 more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a fare increase, the council will consider allowing advertising 
on bus shelters and cutting back on early morning and late evening service. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Monday at Simi Valley City Hall, 
2929 Tapo Canyon Road. SARA CATANIA

<P>
 A plan that would force existing and future housing developments to set aside 
specific areas for recycling dumpsters will come before the Simi Valley 
Planning Commission on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which seeks to revise the city's current recycling ordinance, 
would help bring the city closer to state-mandated recycling goals, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requires cities to divert 25% of their trash away from landfills by 
1995 by setting up new recycling and composting programs. Cities must divert 
50% of their trash by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will begin at 7 p.m. at Simi Valley City Hall, 2929 Tapo 
Canyon Road. MATTHEW MOSK

SURVEY FINDS DROP IN EVANGELICALS' RANKS FOR 2ND YEAR; POLLS: STUDY SAYS 7% OF 
U.S. POPULATION ARE CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS, DOWN FROM 12% TWO YEARS AGO. 
PEOPLE ARE EMBRACING A WIDER SET OF BELIEFS, EXPERT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the growing impact of the Christian right on politics, a pollster who 
specializes in religious issues reports that its demographic base is shrinking, 
with the percentage of theologically conservative Christians steadily declining 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 7% of the U.S. population now consists of those with "evangelical" 
beliefs and commitment, compared to 9% last year and 12% in 1992, under a 
standard designed by pollster George Barna, founder and president of the 
10-year-old Barna Research Group in Glendale, who is personally sympathetic to 
the evangelicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement of the data suggests that we may see a continued shrinking of 
the ranks of evangelicals in the immediate future, short of a miraculous 
outpouring of God's spirit upon the people of our land," Barna wrote in a 
recently published book. 
</P>
<P>
 Barna and the better-known George Gallup Jr. are among the most active 
pollsters regularly taking the religious pulse of the nation. Despite 
occasional questions about accuracy, the results of their surveys have been 
increasingly watched as indicators of how faith is faring in an age of 
religious pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35% of Americans fall under Barna's less stringent category of 
"born-again Christian." The figure, which had dropped to 32% in 1988 after a 
series of televangelist scandals, rose to 40% in 1992, but has fallen again, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although religion of some form remains "very important" to 62% of Americans 
(compared to 59% in 1991), the number of adults who strongly agree that the 
Bible is totally accurate in its teachings dropped from 47% three years ago to 
38% this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people who might have held orthodox (Christian) views in the past 
have embraced a much broader set of beliefs," Barna said in an interview. 
"There is a big trend toward a diverse and inclusive spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
 This decline indicates that the strictest evangelical Christians, a prime 
recruiting ground for the religious right, may be shifting gradually to a less 
stringent outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Barna, however, said he was not prepared to say what that might mean for the 
politically active, religiously motivated groups such as Pat Robertson's 
Christian Coalition that have gained strength within the Republican Party and 
in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done any research on that question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But findings published recently in Barna's "Virtual America" (Regal Books), 
indicates some slippage in the number of Americans who might respond favorably 
to appeals based on a fundamentalist-like understanding of the Bible and 
Christianity. Barna's book interprets the results from telephone surveys of 
1,205 adults in July, 1993, and 1,206 adults last January. 
</P>
<P>
 A steady 95% of adults continue to say they believe in God or a universal 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 About 67% of those polled agreed with a Christian definition of God as "the 
all-powerful, all-knowing Creator of the universe who rules the world today" -- 
a substantial drop from 73% in 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest survey, 10% called God "a state of higher consciousness," 8% 
agreed with a definition of the "total realization of all human potential," 8% 
offered other descriptions and about 7% said they could not define God, 
according to Barna. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barna's company performs surveys and market research for secular and 
religious clients, his 18 books are written for evangelical readers. He is 
executive pastor of a church in Oceanside where he and his wife have a second 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Gallup does not hide his active Episcopal Church involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pollsters use standard public opinion research techniques, however, said 
sociologist R. Stephen Warner of the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "One difference between them is that Gallup tends to be optimistic and Barna 
seems to be pessimistic in interpreting results," said Warner, who was in Los 
Angeles recently for the national meeting of the Assn. for Sociology of 
Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence in the accuracy of religious polling was shaken about a year ago 
when a sample study of actual Protestant and Catholic church attendance 
suggested only about 20% of people attended a worship service in the past week 
-- about half the number reported in polls by Gallup and Barna.  
</P>
<P>
 Gallup has defended his results, and sociologists have continued to debate the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallup and Barna rely on the truthfulness of survey respondents, and even 
Barna concedes that on given questions some people give answers they think will 
make them look good. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the responses Barna received to questions dealing with Christian 
broadcasting and reading material showed such large audiences that he thinks 
they "cannot possibly be an accurate portrayal of reality." 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, some people are simply lying or posturing, seeking to convey an 
image they desire, although it conflicts with their actual behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, Barna said, is that people are defining "Christian" more 
broadly -- to include socially and politically conservative publications and 
broadcast media -- which he does not.

RWANDAN CHURCHES WERE TAINTED BY TRIBAL POLITICS, OFFICIAL SAYS; STRIFE: 
CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT LEADERS WERE ENTANGLED WITH HUTU REGIME, SAYS 
ECUMENICAL LEADER AFTER FACT-FINDING TRIP. IN MANY PLACES, NO FORMAL STRUCTURES 
ARE LEFT.

 Catholic and Protestant leaders in Rwanda betrayed their beliefs by aligning 
themselves far too closely with the former Hutu-dominated regime and its tribal 
politics, a high-ranking official of the World Council of Churches said in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every conversation we had, with the government and church people alike, 
the point was brought home to us that the church itself stands tainted, not by 
passive indifference, but by errors of commission as well," said Samuel Isaac, 
a deputy director to the ecumenical organization. He had just returned from a 
fact-finding mission to the Rwandan capital of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we have seen and heard, (this claim) was valid for all churches in 
Rwanda, Catholic and Protestant alike," said Isaac, who had visited Kigali and 
refugee camps outside Rwanda's borders in early August with officials of the 
Lutheran World Federation and the All Africa Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500,000 Rwandans have died in the carnage that has pitted members of 
the Hutu and Tutsi tribes against one another in recent months. Isaac said that 
just as the entire nation must be reborn, so must religious institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are virtually no official church structures left in Kigali, Isaac said. 
Church leaders have either been killed or are living as refugees outside the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Thursday in Geneva, Isaac said that in one incident, a 
Roman Catholic Hutu priest allegedly shot 10 of his Tutsi parishioners who 
sought refuge in the church from massacres by the former government militia. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious leaders in Rwanda "had made a mistake in being too aligned to the 
previous regime," Isaac told Ecumenical Press Service, the communications arm 
of the World Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a general feeling which regretted that the church, which should have 
been promoting reconciliation, was unwittingly aligned with a regime that had 
built itself up over tribal lines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh McCullum, spokesman for the All Africa Council of Churches and a member 
of the delegation, said Thursday in a telephone interview from Nairobi, Kenya, 
that the story of the priest's alleged involvement has become widespread 
throughout church circles in Africa, but cannot be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullum said he met the priest, who lived and worked in Kigali and was known 
as Father Wenceslas, on a previous visit to Rwanda and that the priest carried 
a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tutsi refugee who had attended the priest's church and later fled to Nairobi 
told McCullum that she had been in the church when the killings took place. But 
it was not clear from her comments how many people died or whether the priest 
committed the murders, McCullum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis Logan, director of the Africa Office of the New York- based National 
Council of Churches, said that given the horrific nature of the Rwandan 
conflict, any story about who committed specific acts of violence must be 
verified carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, it doesn't sound credible," he said about the priest's 
alleged involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezekiel Pajibo, a lay Catholic and policy analyst with the Africa Faith and 
Justice Network, a Washington-based organization of Catholic missionary 
organizations, said the report did not surprise him. There have been numerous 
reports circulating of Hutu priests identifying Tutsi in their congregations, 
marking them for slaughter by Hutu forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Pajibo said Isaac's comments reflect a prevailing assessment among many 
observers that the Rwandan church, rooted in Belgian colonialism, has been a 
compliant institution, first behaving according to colonial dictates and later 
having too close of a relationship with the former Hutu-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to see themselves in a new image," Pajibo said. "They're acting on 
the wrong side of history . . . which is why they have not played a major role 
in reconciliation efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 William Minter, associate director of information for the Washington Office on 
Africa, a church-linked group in the nation's capital, said he, too, was not 
surprised at the report of church complicity, given the context of the war in 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was caught up in it," said Minter. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the situation in Rwanda as "very comparable to what the German 
churches did in the Holocaust," when some church leaders spoke out against 
atrocities and lost their lives while others turned the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the general outlines of church activities in Rwanda suggest reason for 
alarm, said Minter, it is too early for finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial take on it," he said, "is that I would be careful about blanket 
condemnations." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Minter said, people who did the killing may have been under 
threat of death themselves if they failed to follow orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But for generations, Minter said, the question "Did they resist?" will be 
asked over and over again in Rwanda. One important part of the answer, said 
Minter, will be "under what circumstances did they do it?"

SYBERT BLASTS BEILENSON FOR DIGGING POLITICAL DIRT, NOT DEBATING; CAMPAIGN: THE 
GOP HOPEFUL LEARNED FILES OF HIS WORK UNDER GOV. WILSON WERE OBTAINED BY 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 GOP congressional challenger Richard Sybert on Friday accused U.S. Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills) of waging a disgraceful reelection 
campaign aimed at digging up political dirt on Sybert rather than debating him 
squarely on public policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompting these angry remarks was Sybert's discovery that a private 
researcher, using the state Public Records Act, recently obtained an inch-thick 
file of phone and travel records related to Sybert's former work as director of 
Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Planning and Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming he has nothing to hide, Sybert held a news conference to release 
these same records to the media. Among the documents were travel expense claims 
for about $12,500 that Sybert had submitted over the nearly three-year period 
he served as director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frankly offended at this," Sybert said. "They're spending money to root 
around in my garbage, and Beilenson is not even man enough to do it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Jonas, who made the request for the records, refused Friday to disclose 
the name of his employer or client. But later, Craig Miller, Beilenson's 
political consultant, confirmed that Jonas was employed by the state Democratic 
Party to research the public records of GOP candidates, including Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this shows is that Tony Beilenson, despite his brave facade, is 
running scared," Sybert said. "He dodges debates and digs in my garbage. I find 
it instructive that they did not ask for any of the policy papers issued by the 
planning office when I was there."  
</P>
<P>
 Sybert recently accused Beilenson of refusing to debate him. In fact, 
Beilenson promised to debate Sybert but only after the congressional recess in 
mid-October. Earlier debates would be pointless because voters won't focus on 
the election until the final weeks, Beilenson has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller called Sybert's reaction to the public records request "paranoid and 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert "should expect to be held accountable for his activities while in 
public office," Miller said. "It is quite routine for officials to have their 
records examined. . . .It sounds to me like he must have something to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the Democratic party actually contracted with Jonas to do the 
"opposition research" on Sybert, and that the party decided what records to 
seek. Finance statements show that Beilenson received "in-kind research" 
assistance from the Democratic Party valued at $3,750. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he had not had time to review the Sybert documents to determine if 
they contained signs of spending irregularities. "I honestly don't know what 
they contain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert got the tip-off about the public records request from his former 
colleagues in the Office of Planning and Research. "Rich was talking on the 
phone to my deputy, Phil Romero, and I told him to tell Rich that we had gotten 
the request," Lee Grissom, the office's current chief, said in an interview 
Friday. Grissom said Sybert did not try to influence his handling of the 
request, although he acknowledged that Sybert had called him at home to discuss 
what would be disclosed.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will 
hold a special election Nov. 5 to choose a successor to Bishop J. Roger 
Anderson, who announced his resignation in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Vance R. Knutsen, who retired from the active ministry at Salem 
Lutheran Church in Glendale, was named by the Southern California (West) Synod 
Council to serve as interim bishop. Knutsen will begin his duties Sept. 1 when 
Anderson, who turned 59 in July, moves to Arizona, where he accepted the 
pastorate of a church in Sun City. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who lives in Thousand Oaks, has been bishop for the region covering 
Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern counties since 
1987 when the synod was created. The synod includes 155 churches with nearly 
60,000 members. Anderson said he wanted to spend his remaining years of 
ministry in a local congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of the new bishop will take place at California Lutheran 
University in Thousand Oaks. No nominees will be presented at the meeting, said 
Barbara Price, assistant to the bishop. The new bishop will probably be 
installed in January or February, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knutsen was pastor for 16 years at Clairemont Lutheran Church in San Diego and 
was vice president of the South Pacific District of the American Lutheran 
Church from 1981 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 SERVICE 
</P>
<P>
 A United Methodist Church team of engineers and architects has given about 200 
free assessments of homes damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake to 
homeowners who have been uncertain about needed repairs, costs and the best 
ways to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The denomination instituted the same program after a hurricane in Florida and 
floods in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an anti-gouging device," said Don Inloes, director of emergency 
response for the Pasadena-based California-Pacific Conference of the church 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Inloes said the first printed reports were to be sent to homeowners this week. 
Referrals may be made to the Residential Assessment Program by clergy, 
community workers or affected homeowners by contacting the church body's 
headquarters at (818) 568-7332. 
</P>
<P>
 GRANT 
</P>
<P>
 Atheists United, based in Sherman Oaks, received a $50,000 grant this week to 
expand its television outreach in Southern California. The money came from the 
trust fund of James Hervey Johnson of San Diego, the late publisher of The 
Truthseeker magazine, with the stipulation that the grant be used "to expose 
religion as against reason" and to publicize Johnson's views on religion, said 
Lee Baker, television project manager for Atheists United. 
</P>
<P>
 COURSES 
</P>
<P>
 Mini-courses -- including crash courses in Hebrew -- to help people prepare 
for the Jewish High Holy Days are being offered by the University of Judaism, 
starting Aug. 28.

 CORRECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel H. Gordis was misidentified in last week's Southern California File in 
an announcement about his new post as vice president for public affairs and

DRIVING OUT UNLICENSED DRIVERS; A HUGE CHEER FOR SAFE STREETS LEGISLATION 
SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLYMAN RICHARD KATZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look around you on the freeway on your way to or from work today. Chances are 
at least one person within your field of vision will be a motorist who never 
obtained a license or is driving with a license that has been suspended or 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 These people are a menace. They are the most frequent contributors to the fact 
that California has more hit-and-run accidents than any other state and they 
are four times more likely than other drivers to be involved in fatal 
accidents, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing laws do not go far enough in preventing them from driving. Now there 
is a bill moving through the Legislature that would make the punishment suit 
the crime and would keep more unlicensed drivers off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles estimates there are about 1 million 
California motorists who have never held a license and 720,000 more who 
otherwise are driving illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what happens to such drivers when they are caught? Their vehicles are 
impounded only briefly, or not at all if the violator is accompanied by a 
licensed person who can drive the car home. A car or truck is forfeited only 
when a driver is convicted of vehicular manslaughter or repeat drunk driving 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Safe Streets Act, by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), offers 
a harsh but necessary alternative. If your license has been suspended or 
revoked within the last three years or if you have been convicted of being an 
unlicensed driver within that span of time and you are again caught driving 
without a valid license, you lose your car. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasonable exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a vehicle is forfeited only if the driver is its owner. If an owner 
unwittingly loans a car to an unlicensed friend who later is stopped by a 
police officer, the owner will not lose the car. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are half of a married couple who depend on a car and authorities find 
that one of you does not have a valid license, you get three strikes, not two. 
Under Katz's legislation the violator must sign a contract to not drive until 
he or she gets a license. If a member of a married couple is caught a third 
time, the car is seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's opponents include the American Civil Liberties Union. It is 
supported by 60 police departments, the City of Los Angeles, the League of 
California Cities and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The proposed act would 
save lives, and it deserves passage by the Legislature.

DAVID AND GOLIATH TRY TO MAKE NICE; TAIPEI AND BEIJING SIGN AN UNPRECEDENTED 
COOPERATION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taiwan is one of America's important trading partners and one of China's most 
successful neighbors. Beijing is well aware of both these facts. Now, after 
eight days of delicate talks, Beijing and Taipei -- both of which claim to be 
the government of all of China -- have reached a breakthrough agreement to 
resolve a number of outstanding bilateral issues, including the tricky ones of 
airline hijackings, illegal immigrants and fishing disputes. It is the first 
substantive cooperative effort between China and Taiwan, which have had no 
formal diplomatic relations since the Nationalist Chinese forces fled the 
mainland in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the two governments were ever so careful to steer wide of the touchy 
subjects of sovereignty and reunification, major stumbling blocks in the past. 
Nonetheless, the accord is a significant development. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to start a political dialogue began in Singapore last year. 
Although Taipei remains understandably obstinate in its resistance to Beijing 
efforts to reunify, and the mainland stubbornly refuses to recognize the 
Kuomintang government on Taiwan, the growing trade and investment ties between 
the two are matters of mutual economic self-interest. The increased contacts 
have helped to foster mutual goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, relations, which actually had been improving since the mid-1980s, 
were put to a severe test by a dozen hijackings of Chinese airlines to Taiwan 
since April, 1993. Relations deteriorated to their lowest level this spring 
after 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed in an arson attack in southern China; a 
subsequent attempt to cover up the murders fueled anti-China sentiments in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Image-conscious Beijing, eager to encourage more investment, trade and tourism 
-- and to restore a sense of security about its airline service -- was willing 
to make limited concessions to Taipei. Beijing will accept Taiwan's authority 
over Chinese hijackers and its right to determine who is to be repatriated and 
who may remain in Taiwan for political or religious reasons. China also agreed 
to pay the costs of detaining and repatriating illegal immigrants from the 
mainland whose return had been delayed by China. As for fishing, government 
vessels from both sides will be allowed to mediate disputes between boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too long ago an agreement between Taipei and Beijing on any matter was 
unimaginable. But China and Taiwan are increasingly pragmatic. In the 
breakthrough pact they endorse "increasing communication" that will "eliminate 
misapprehensions, reduce differences and nurture trust." That sounds like an 
adult formula for a better relationship between two important Pacific Rim 
countries with robust economies that won't be denied.

HIRSHMAN'S STATISTICS

<P>
 It is Linda Hirshman, not I, who in her article, "Scholars in the Service of 
Politics" (Column Left, July 31), distorts data in the service of her own 
agenda. Let the facts speak for themselves. Hirshman claims that I "describe(s) 
a recent Justice Department study of murder in families as concluding that 
'women kill almost as often as men do' " (emphasis added). She then tries to 
rebut that characterization by pointing to a sub-category of family killing -- 
namely spousal killing -- in which husbands kill wives somewhat more often 
(59%) than wives kill husbands (41%). My point was that even those numbers are 
quite surprising, since they show far more killings done by wives than media 
reports and feminist rhetoric suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 In my article (Commentary, July 21), I specifically cited the report's 
conclusion that "for all spousal murders, women accounted for more than 40% of 
defendants," despite Hirshman's implication that I try to hide this 
information. I also cite data -- not referred to by Hirshman -- showing that 
for all family crimes "female defendants were more likely than male defendants 
to have murdered a person of the opposite sex," that 55% of all family crime 
victims were males and 45% were females, and that female defendants are treated 
far more leniently than male defendants in family killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hirshman cannot rebut the specific data I cite -- since I quote them 
precisely from the report -- she quibbles over my characterization of the data. 
But that characterization is supported by the data for all family killings, as 
well as by the comparative data for other acts of homicide, in which women 
account for only 10% of all killings. The truth of gender violence is very much 
a two-way street -- a fact which Hirshman is seeking to veil with her own 
curtain of selective misinformation.

 Hirshman says she discovered "two whoppers -- Dershowitz's numbers and 
Sommers' 'feminist fiction' -- and my research didn't take me half an hour." 
She should have taken more time.  
</P>
<P>
 The conventional feminist belief, which I reject as "fiction" but which 
Hirshman defends is given in the opening essay of a popular college textbook in 
women's studies, "Women: A Feminist Perspective": 
</P>
<P>
 "The popular expression 'rule of thumb' originated from English common law, 
which allowed a husband to beat his wife with a whip or stick no bigger in 
diameter than his thumb. The husband's prerogative was incorporated into 
American law. Several states had statutes that essentially allowed a man to 
beat his wife without the interference from the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in for the feminists, Hirshman says that my book "Who Stole 
Feminism?" used "the Big Lie technique," when, in the middle of quoting 
Blackstone, it omitted a bit of Latin that talked of the old law that allowed a 
husband to "lawfully and reasonably" use force in "correcting" his wife. I 
omitted that because its content had already been paraphrased in the preceding 
language which I did quote: "The husband by the old law might give his wife 
moderate chastisement." Hirshman commits an interpretive whopper since she 
evidently reads the omitted Latin as giving Blackstone's opinion. Not so: 
Blackstone mentions the "old law" only to point out that it had been superseded 
in his own "politer" day (1768): "A wife may now have security against her 
husband." That is Blackstone's view. 
</P>
<P>
 So my three major points remain: 1) Blackstone's opinion is that violence 
against wives is no longer legal; 2) the phrase "rule of thumb" nowhere appears 
in Blackstone's discussion of wife beating, and 3) the phrase did not originate 
in wife beating. (Authorities have traced its origin to 17th-Century English 
woodworkers who expertly used their thumbs for quick rough measurements.) 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I challenge Hirshman to cite the statutes in American law justifying 
the feminist claim that our laws (not one or two sexist judges) sanctioned wife 
beating by a stick no bigger than the husband's thumb. There is no such body of 
actual law. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the American legal system -- albeit imperfect and imperfectly 
enforced -- offers women the best protections of liberty and person to date. 
Feminist revisionist legal history -- not my rejection of it -- is the Big Lie.

NATIONAL ID CARDS AND IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo! Your editorial "An ID-Card Plan That Makes Sense" (Aug. 5) is right on 
the money, because, as you state, it makes sense! 
</P>
<P>
 The banks have long used this system to verify Social Security numbers of all 
new customers, ensuring that they are the only person holding the reported 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform adopts this plan, since 
it ensures compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
Also, because it's fair to both legal immigrants and all other legitimate 
residents. It's time that we stop the cheaters who are unfairly taking jobs 
from those who play by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is just what it says -- it's illegal and it unfairly costs 
taxpayers billions of dollars annually. Since employment is the major 
attraction to those illegally entering the country, this plan will go a long 
way toward eliminating the problem. How about using the same system for welfare 
recipients and those receiving non-emergency medical treatment?

 Regarding the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform's plan on verifying 
workers' status: 
</P>
<P>
 The registry won't work. Here's why. An illegal immigrant borrows his legal 
cousin's ID (driver's license, Social Security and green card). He applies for 
the job under his relative's name and then returns the ID to its owner. I have 
witnessed this little scheme among waiters at a major Los Angeles hotel.

 Joel Kotkin's otherwise thoughtful article, "Rethinking Immigration: Intent 
Must Shape Policy" (Opinion, July 24), is marred by its perpetuation of a 
stereotype of Latino immigrants. Contrary to popular belief, legal Latino 
immigrants are comparable to their European and Asian counterparts; surveys 
show that Latino immigrants plan to settle in the U.S. permanently. Their roots 
in American society are deep, as evidenced by their high rates of home 
ownership as well as a preference for U.S. political news as opposed to that of 
their home country. 
</P>
<P>
 The low rates of naturalization among Latino immigrants are easily 
attributable to lower levels of socioeconomic standing as compared to Asian 
immigrants. For example, 62 out of every 100 Latino immigrants begin the 
naturalization process. But, lack of resources, difficulty with forms and 
problems with the language cause only 25 out of the 62 to complete it. Lower 
socioeconomic standing, in all likelihood, also may predict why Latino children 
do not fare as well in the academic world as other immigrant children who have 
a higher socioeconomic standing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest challenges facing the Latino community is overcoming the 
stereotypes that still exist concerning the immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, both detractors and friends fall victim to these stereotypes.

FUNDING FOR COUNTY LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to thank you for your recent coverage in articles and editorials 
of the plight of the County of Los Angeles Public Library, and of our plan to 
restore library services by establishing a community facilities district (CFD), 
a financing mechanism authorized under the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act 
of 1982. Yes, the Mello-Roos act does have segments which use a tax to enable 
infrastructure improvement. However, the library is using another segment of 
the act which specifically uses benefit charges, not taxes, to finance a 
service. While the charges, if implemented, will appear on each tax bill 
received for property within the area served by the County Public Library, they 
would appear on a separate line apart from the tax calculations because, as 
dedicated charges, they are not tied to the property's assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot think of a better value for the $28.50, which would be the charge for 
an entire year of library service. A family could not begin to purchase 
equivalent books with this dollar amount to help their child with homework. 
Libraries are about collaborative use. Now, with the state shift of half of our 
County Library's primary source of income -- the property tax -- we all must 
collaborate if we want to assure that this valuable community institution 
survives. Like any other business, libraries cannot operate without adequate 
funds. The 3.3 million people served by the County of Los Angeles Public 
Library need information access. 
</P>
<P>
 The community facilities district provides the single option to restore the 
$30 million in annual financing lost by the County Library this year. Absent 
this revenue, there will be no option but to close libraries and reduce 
services further. 
</P>
<P>
 We are currently working with the 52 cities we serve to obtain their councils' 
consent to participate in the CFD. The revenue collected from the CFD will go 
only to the County Library, and will go to the library serving the residents 
from whom the levy was collected. We have a chance to improve library service. 
Let us use it!

UNGLAMOROUS, MAYBE, BUT OH SO IMPORTANT; PLAN FOR 20-MILE-LONG FREIGHT CORRIDOR 
CLEARS ANOTHER HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The adjacent ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles handle more cargo than any 
other port in the United States: 2.3 million shipping containers a year. 
However, the status of the ports has long been threatened by competition from 
the ports at Seattle and Tacoma, not because of inadequacy of facilities but 
because of cargo gridlock on land. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion of an agreement in principle this week between harbor officials and 
the Union Pacific Railroad on use of railroad right of way for a long-planned 
improvement in the freight corridor is a key step toward solidifying Los 
Angeles/Long Beach as the dominant cargo point on the West Coast. It's also an 
important step toward lasting economic recovery for this troubled region. But 
if negotiation with the Union Pacific, and the other freight rail haulers, was 
hard -- and it was -- completing the Alameda Corridor project promises to be no 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the ports' cargo moves by rail along the corridor, the major link between 
Downtown and the harbor and the foremost route for the movement of goods in the 
state. Travel along the route, which roughly parallels Alameda Street, is 
grindingly slow. The track is not grade-separated, meaning that mile-long 
freight trains must stop often as they creep through congested industrial 
areas. The corridor project, years in the planning, would submerge the 
20-mile-long rail track in a trench below street level. Grade separation, with 
bridges for cars, would alleviate much of the street congestion caused by the 
existing rail lines and permit nonstop travel to and from the ports.  
</P>
<P>
 State, local and harbor officials have spent years negotiating an agreement 
with three rail lines over their rights of way and the fee-for-use structure 
that will prevail. Union Pacific's approval of this operating agreement is one 
of the last hurdles before corridor and port officials can formally ask 
Congress for construction funds. The rail company agreed in principle to sign 
this week; the final documents reflecting that agreement are now being drafted. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of overpasses for cars along the southern end of the route is 
under way. Funds for this work, and for right-of-way purchase, come from port 
revenue and bonds to be repaid with fees collected once the improved corridor 
is in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Port of Long Beach withdrew from the project until a lawsuit 
filed by four of the small cities along the route is resolved. The port's move 
is, in effect, an attempt to force the cities to dispose of the lawsuit and 
move the project along. However, the real obstacle is money. The project needs 
$700 million. Project officials are counting on either loans or appropriations 
from the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Congress must respond promptly. Continued inefficiency in cargo handling 
seriously threatens Los Angeles' dominance as a center for international trade. 
Upgrading the Alameda Corridor -- this low-tech and decidedly unglamorous 
public works project -- is among the highest priorities for this region.

THE OTHER SIDE OF 'SAVE OUR STATE' FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the article "Coalition Prepares to Battle 'Save Our State' 
Proposition" (Aug. 3), we find it interesting that the organizations behind the 
campaign stand to lose money if Prop. 187 passes in November. We understand 
their worries, we just hope that the public understands their motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money talks" is an old expression, but it's still true today. And it's ironic 
that those who advocate the violation of our laws and disrespect for our 
country seem to have the most money. Why do we reward them, not only with cash, 
but with publicity? 
</P>
<P>
 Extremist rhetoric does get publicity, but does it deserve it? 
</P>
<P>
 When the members of the Children's Alliance call us "Soldiers of Satan," or 
"Nazis" or "racists," they are trying to divert people's attention away from 
the real issue. And that issue is simply how to deal with the problem of 
illegal aliens. Do we enforce our laws? Do we try to conserve our ever scarce 
tax dollars? Or do we just do nothing because the issue is too politically 
sensitive? 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric from MALDEF and LULAC is inflammatory and does not serve the 
public interest. Could it be that they have no legitimate argument to put 
forward into the public debate? That's why some people resort to name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 We would hope that the purported "members" of the Children's Alliance will 
grow up and approach this important debate in an adult manner. Any attempt to 
inflame racial hatred can only hurt us all. We hope that in the public 
interest, they will put aside their profit motives and consider the best 
interests of California's future.

WINNER'S NAME TELLS THE STORY; HORSE RACING: MAN O' WAR SUFFERED HIS ONLY 
DEFEAT 75 YEARS AGO TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL STASHENKO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A promising 2-year-old thoroughbred, winner of the first six starts of his 
career, loses a race at Saratoga by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surprise, but no shock. The colt was poorly ridden. And counting on 
consistency from 2-year-olds is always a risky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Upset's defeat of Man o' War in the Sanford Stakes 75 years ago today became a 
landmark in racing history only after the fact -- after Man o' War took on 
near-mythical proportions as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was not a word spoken after that race, either, of Saratoga as a 
"graveyard of favorites," even though Upset's victory came later to symbolize 
how the betting favorites here seemed to lose so often. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1919 Sanford has become an event retroactively," said Tom Gilcoyne, 
librarian at the National Museum of Racing in Saratoga Springs. "Man o' War was 
such a great horse afterward that everyone wanted him undefeated. Some of it 
was cold-blooded revisionist thinking. If Man o' War had lost another race or 
two, that Sanford wouldn't have been as important." 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War nearly wasn't allowed to run on ovals at all. The stable of his 
owner, Samuel D. Riddle, specialized in steeplechasers and for a time the 
handlers of the original Big Red considered making him a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 His extraordinary talent convinced them otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 At Saratoga in August of 1919, Man o' War's promise was obvious, but 
unfulfilled. He shared the spotlight that August with other stars, including 
Sun Briar, Hannibal and Upset. Big Red went off as an 11-20 favorite in the 
Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big strong bull of a horse," said John H. Clark, a thoroughbred 
agent in Lexington, Ky. "He went where he wanted to go. He was piddling around 
that day, and his jockey was overconfident and put him on the post at the 
starting line." 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War was nearly last off the line. Later, he twice was hemmed in by 
slower horses. Finally running free down the stretch, Man o' War was gaining 
with every stride against Upset when he ran out of track and lost by a 
half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seldom has a defeated horse become such a hero as has Man o' War," the New 
York Times observed a week later. "Having all the worst of the racing luck, and 
being in a pocket twice after getting away from the post almost last, he was 
coming so fast at the end he would have won in another stride or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War's jockey, Hall of Famer Johnny Loftus, took the blame for the 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War got revenge 10 days later in the Grand Union Hotel Stakes at 
Saratoga. Bettors again installed him as an 11-20 favorite. Upset went off at 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was never close. Man o' War passed Ever Gay in the first furlong and 
stayed in front. Loftus outran the early traffic and, rounding the final turn 
in the clear, he made sure Man o' War was tight to the rail down the 
homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a gigantic stride he loped away from his rivals, and when there was no 
possible chance of losing, Loftus eased him up," wrote Ed Curley of the 
Knickerbocker Press. 
</P>
<P>
 At the finish line, Loftus, looking back nonchalantly, had slowed Man o' War 
to a walk. That allowed Upset to narrow the gap to two lengths at the finish 
line. Man o' War's winning time was 1:12 for six furlongs -- slower than he had 
run in the Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 And Man o' War won easily despite carrying 132 pounds to 125 for Upset and 115 
for the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle, who said he had turned down an offer of close to $100,000 for a colt 
he paid $5,000 for in 1918, sensed the place Man o' War was to hold in racing 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great race horse, probably one of the greatest we have seen in a 
decade," Riddle said after the Grand Union Hotel Stakes. "I look for great 
things for him as a 3-year-old. He will always remain my property. I feel that 
a great horse like this is in a way public property." 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War's incredible exploits as a 3-year-old are what he is best 
remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually no one would race against him nor bet against him. He was 
unbeatable, and everybody knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried as much as 135 pounds in handicap events, routinely giving up 10 or 
even 20 pounds, but still no one would race against him. Eight horses lost to 
Man o' War in his 1920 debut, the Preakness. In the last 10 races of his 
career, he ran against only 15 other horses. Six times, there was only one 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran out of competition," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times that year he was a 1-20 or 1-25 favorite. Four times he went off 
at 1-100. 
</P>
<P>
 He won both the Preakness and the Belmont in 1920, but Riddle skipped the 
Kentucky Derby that year. An often contrary person, Riddle knew he had the best 
horse in the country and figured he did not need the Derby to prove it, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October of 1920 at Kenilworth Park in Windsor, Ontario, a race was arranged 
with Sir Barton, a brilliant 4-year-old who had become the first Triple Crown 
winner in 1919. Man o' War, a 1-20 favorite, shattered the track record for 1 
1/4 miles by six seconds and won by seven lengths in what would be his last 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle retired the colt to stud in Kentucky in 1920. Although Riddle often 
lined up unpromising mates for him to breed, Man o' War still managed to sire a 
Triple Crown winner, War Admiral, in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 Man o' War died at 30 in 1947 in Lexington. About 2,000 attended his funeral, 
which was broadcast nationwide on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle once was offered $1 million for Man o' War by a Texas oil man. He 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people have a million dollars," Riddle said. "But only I own Man o' 
War."

PRICE MAKES LIKE A BIRDIE AND FLIES SOLO; PGA CHAMPIONSHIP: HE SHOOTS 65 TO 
TAKE A FIVE-STROKE LEAD OVER HAAS, PAVIN AND CRENSHAW AFTER 36 HOLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there anybody out there who can beat Nick Price at anything? Hair? Smiling? 
Golf? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Nick Price world right now. The moon has dimples and Earth is one big 
putting green. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker than you can say birdie, the 76th PGA Championship became a one-man 
show Friday at Southern Hills Country Club, where Price took a five-shot lead 
into this weekend's last two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens next figures to be no surprise. Golfers who spend their lives 
reading greens also know how to recognize what you call big pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know, there's going to be a lot," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because a lot of people that I've spoken to already have assumed I'm going to 
win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have to play a lot worse not to. Price birdied four holes on the back 
nine -- three on putts of 10 to 15 feet -- to conclude a tidy round of 65 for a 
two-day total of 132, five shots ahead of three players. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's an interesting group, led by Jay Haas, who revived himself after a 
triple-bogey to carve out a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like a triple-bogey to get your attention, and Haas' was 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove the light rough on the par-four ninth hole, then hit an eight-iron 
over the crowd. He chipped through the green and the ball rolled down a hill. 
He chipped again, the ball hitting the green and rolling right back toward him 
until it stopped in a divot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting a little shook by this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas finally got the ball to stick on the green with his next chip shot, but 
then he was 25 feet short. He two-putted from there for a routine seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "That flustered me a little bit," he said. "I guess after 18 years, I've seen 
a lot of things come and go in my game." 
</P>
<P>
 The others with Haas at 137 are Corey Pavin and Ben Crenshaw, who each shot a 
67. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin was encouraged that golf tournaments normally end on Sunday, not Friday. 
But he admitted he had no clue what to do about Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's going to slow Nick down," Pavin said. "I think he's 
playing the best golf of anybody in the world right now. There's no question 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much argument about that. The golfer from Zimbabwe has won four times this 
year, including the British Open, and nobody else has won twice. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Price golf's next dominant player? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Price wins here, he will be the first since Tom Watson in 1982 to win 
consecutive major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another unpleasantly hot day but nobody seemed to mind because the 
greens had been watered and were a lot softer than in the first round. Not 
coincidentally, the scores took a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaine McCallister noticed the difference right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left here last night, the greens were as hard as my head and that's 
pretty hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallister shot a 64, which was 10 strokes better than his opening round. He 
said his key was to just keep putting and hoping. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days, the holes are going to get in the way and they did that 
today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal shot a 66 and is tied for fifth at 138 
with McCallister and John Cook, six shots behind Price. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bogey on No. 2, Olazabal racked up four birdies, three of them on 
putts of 40, 30 and 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the good news for the Spanish player. The bad news was that he shot a 
66 and still lost a shot to Price. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallister launched his round with a 31 on the front nine, generally believed 
to be more difficult than the back. A left-hander except when he plays golf, 
McCallister said Price will be tough to catch with a five-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously going to be harder to make up when you've got Nick Price 
leading," he said. "He's playing a different level of golf. He's taking it up 
another notch; I don't know how he could do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Price hit every green on the back nine for the second day, but the key to his 
round might have been putts that saved pars on Nos. 8 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 On the par-three eighth, he left his two-iron short of the green, chipped 
seven feet behind the hole and made the putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a drive off the tee on No. 9 and just missed the fairway, then also 
missed the green with a pitching wedge. He chipped within a foot of the hole 
and made it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't make any mistakes today," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he does, he is on track to become the first wire-to-wire PGA champion 
since Hal Sutton in 1983 at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure that you're going to have one not-so-good round," Price said. "If 
I can go out and turn that not-so-good round into a 69 or 70, then I think I'm 
going to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've all been in this game long enough (to know) it's not over until the 
last putt is holed." 
</P>
<P>
 The fat lady must be a golfer.

 Running back Leonard Russell, released by the New England Patriots in a 
contract dispute, agreed to a contract with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell was in attendance Friday night at the Broncos' exhibition game against 
the 49ers at San Francisco.He strengthens a backfield that already includes Rod 
Bernstine, Glyn Milburn and Robert Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
 New England's first-round selection out of Arizona State in 1991, Russell 
gained 2,437 yards in three seasons with the Patriots. He had 1,088 yards on 
300 carries last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nose tackle Greg Kragen turned down an offer to return to the Broncos, saying 
he was willing to take less money but was uncomfortable as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos waived Kragen on April 22 after he rejected a 75% reduction in his 
$1-million contract for 1994. The team this week offered Kragen, 32, the NFL's 
minimum salary of $162,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't feel comfortable accepting the offer," said Kragen, who played 
nine years for Denver. "It was a tough decision for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I reacted emotionally. Yeah, I still want to play football, and 
yeah, I'd love to do it in Denver. In a football sense, it wasn't a lot of 
money. But money wasn't the only issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard where they would use me in a part-time role. I didn't want to come 
back because it meant a lot to the organization. I wanted to come back to play 
football."

DREAM TEAM II WINS FEW FRIENDS FOR ITS OBNOXIOUS BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dream team? More like our worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, a bunch of headstrong, trash-talking basketball players from the 
United States has shown the world why our country has so many problems.Whatever 
happened to respect, dignity and sportsmanship? This in-your-face tactic to 
embarrass your opponent is against everything my parents taught me about 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 I can live with the idea that these jerks can continue to play professional 
sports. I just won't watch. But let's try to represent our country with a great 
team of respectful players and show the world what we want to become, not what 
we are, a bunch of disrespectful, arrogant jerks.

A REALITY CHECK THAT SHE CAN'T TAKE TO THE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chart published in the July 31 edition of The Times showing how much 
baseball players will lose during the strike was a reality check for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I have five years of college education and have been a teacher for 12 years. 
Yet Bobby Bonilla of the Mets makes $5.7 million a year and I make $36,600. His 
daily earnings are $31,148 while mine are $201. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, he is only one player, but the minimum baseball salary is $109,000 -- 
or $595 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is obviously greatly more valued than my profession. 
</P>
<P>
 And I have no pro-rated bonuses, incentive bonuses or endorsements, only: 
"Wow! Is that how it works? I always wondered and now I know. Too cool!"

 No one can justify to my satisfaction why a professional athlete who is

the average working stiff could make in a 40-year working career.

 Therefore, speaking frankly, many of us don't give a damn if they ever settle

 As a fan, I think it's safe to say that out-of-control capitalism and the 
greed it sprouts have not enhanced the quality of play nor the excitement and 
drama of events we watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system is evil, corrupt and not a lot of fun, but some fundamental 
changes might save it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, ownership of all major league franchises should be transferred to the 
city or country where the teams are located. The franchises would be nonprofit, 
with additional revenue earned to be spent in areas of local need, enhancing 
the salaries of the truly underpaid such as teachers, policemen and firemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, each player should have a base salary of between $100,000 and $500,000 
and should be rewarded for excellence with incentive clauses that could raise a 
salary to $1.5 million maximum. Thus, if you don't perform, you get only a 
couple of hundred thousand to feed your family and extravagant lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, all current owners should receive market value for their teams and then 
be tried in a court of law for crimes against humanity (that is, the fans). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, all sports agents should have their assets seized and be forced to 
wear cheap suits, drive economy cars and practice law, or their chosen 
profession, in Amarillo, Tex.

 With a baseball strike (under way), The Times is sure to be deluged with irate 
letters from brainwashed fans. They will probably blame the players for 
everything from high salaries to the price of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks are due to Ross Newhan, who has consistently, clearly and accurately 
pointed out that it's the club owners who create and drive baseball's labor 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 If muddled correspondents looked beyond the box scores, or learned to read, 
similar conclusions would be unavoidable.

ROBITAILLE HAS NOT LOST ANY OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memo to Mike Downey: In your Aug. 7 column that spoke about the 
Robitaille-Tocchet trade, you stated that Robitaille was a hell of a hockey 
player, was a lamplighter and was a good kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone should have told you that you write sports columns, not obituaries. 
Luc still is a hell of a hockey player, still is a lamplighter and still is a 
good kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for L.A., he will now be all those things in Pittsburgh. I think 
he will fit in well and continue to be the premier left wing in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Save your obituary writing for the Kings. Without Luc's hard work and talent, 
as well as the talent of all the other victims of stupid Kings' trades, they 
will need it. Go, Pens!

 A very sad goodby to Luc Robitaille. Many thanks for the skill, courage and 
pride he brought to the Kings. Now we must suffer the time of "goon hockey" in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The current crew of Barry the puppet, Kelly the sieve and the new no-talent 
Tocchet will serve the "Great One" well. 
</P>
<P>
 Did "Gretz" arrange this deal because he feels it necessary to surround 
himself with goons to protect him in an attempt to prolong his career? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it simply that because the fans loved Luc, Gretz couldn't stand the 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, with Robitaille gone, so is the class of L.A. hockey.

 Well, the Kings have done it again. Melrose and Gretzky got their way and so 
the trade of Robitaille for Tocchet. Melrose and Gretzky are in the process of 
getting a bunch of big guys in hopes of winning the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid we will end up with a team that can beat up everybody but not beat 
anybody. It makes me wonder why the Kings even need a general manager.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; TREASURY RATES SLIDE, PUSHING STOCKS HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury rates fell, pushing stocks higher Friday on news of 
unexpectedly tame inflation in July. 
</P>
<P>
 However, reflecting the prevailing view that the Federal Reserve will hike 
interest rates next week anyway, shorter-term maturities dipped slightly. 
Indeed, the inflation news only further muddled the market debate over when and 
by how much the central bank will next push up rates. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 7.50% from 
7.57% on Thursday, pushing its price, which moves in the opposite direction, up 
5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasuries, meanwhile, rose only 1/16 to 5/32 point and 
intermediate maturities rose 1/4 point to 15/32 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the modest rally in long-term bonds erased nearly all the sharp price 
drop from Thursday, when the market tanked after a lackluster auction of new 
30-year bonds and a report of higher-than-expected producer inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traders had prepared for a sharper increase in the wake of Thursday's 
report that producer prices jumped 0.5% in July. Bond market participants fear 
inflation because it tends to diminish the value of Treasury securities and 
other fixed-income investments. Inflation also increases the likelihood that 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, the Labor Department reported that inflation as measured by the 
Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 0.2% 
in July, less than expectations of a 0.3% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agreed that it would not deter the Federal Reserve from raising 
short-term interest rates next Tuesday at its Federal Open Market Committee 
meeting in a bid to head off future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp., said it might 
convince the Fed to tighten just 0.25%, instead of the 0.50% that had been 
feared as recently as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Wall Street, where stocks rallied on the falling interest rates, the 
Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.81 points to 3,768.71, adding 21.69 points 
for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume retreated to a moderate 249.28 
million shares, down from 275.70 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index rose 1.46 points to 254.77. The Nasdaq index of 
mostly smaller companies rose 3.41 points to 731.61. The Standard & Poor's 500 
list added 3.06 points to 461.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar added 2 1/8 to 105 1/8 after the company said its worldwide 
sales and profits will be stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renewed takeover rumors in the food sector, notably of CPC International and 
Heinz, lifted food stocks. CPC added 1 3/4 to 51 7/8, and Heinz rose 1 1/8 to 
37 1/8. General Mills advanced 1 11/32 to 53 31/32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exxon rose 2 1/8 to 60 1/4 after a jury ordered the company to pay fishermen 
$286.8 million in compensatory damages for losses as a result of the 1989 Exxon 
Valdez oil spill. The figure was significantly lower than the $895 million that 
plaintiffs had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
 * Syntex was the most active issue on the NYSE, finishing off 1 to 21 5/8. 
Traders said there were rumors that Roche Holdings of Switzerland was going to 
cancel its bid for Syntex, but a Roche spokesman said the deal is going as 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen stock was higher on rumors that the biotechnology company may be the 
target of a takeover bid. Amgen was up 1 5/8 at 53 3/8 on 2.8 million shares 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed despite interest rate increases in Sweden 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average closed down 1.42%, or 30.6 points, at 
2,124.68, while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended up 4.1 points 
at 3,142.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended at 20,663.83, off 157.53 points, 
and Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 40.87 points higher at 2,637.76. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fell modestly against other key currencies as most U.S. 
dealers shrugged off an early plunge in European trading and focused instead on 
the U.S. bond and stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.S. currency finished at 1.552 German marks and 100.15 
Japanese yen, down from 1.561 marks and 100.23 yen, respectively, on Thursday.

THE GETTY FACES NEW OBSTACLE: GETTY'S SON; ART: JOHN PAUL GETTY II PLEDGES 
$1.55 MILLION TO HELP KEEP ANTONIO CANOVA'S SCULPTURE 'THREE GRACES' IN 
BRITAIN. IT'S THE SECOND TIME HE HAS HELPED PREVENT HIS FATHER'S MUSEUM FROM 
ENHANCING ITS COLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, John Paul Getty II, son of the late American oil baron, 
has donated 1 million ($1.55 million) to prevent the Malibu museum his father 
founded from buying Antonio Canova's neo-classical sculpture "The Three Graces" 
for 7.6 million (about $11.8 million) and exporting it from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 British National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said that the billionaire 
-- who lives a reclusive life in London but has emerged in the last decade as 
Britain's greatest private philanthropist -- contacted him Thursday to pledge 
the money to a campaign to buy the sculpture for London's Victoria and Albert 
Museum. Getty's pledge leaves the museum about 800,000 ($1.24 million) short of 
its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation marks the second time Getty has contributed a large sum to 
prevent the Getty Museum from enhancing its collection at the expense of 
Britain's cultural heritage. Getty -- who was often at loggerheads with his 
father -- gave $530,000 in 1985 to the Manchester City Art Gallery to stop 
Duccio's "Crucifixion" painting from being exported to California. 
</P>
<P>
 His pledge to the V&A is only the latest in a series of setbacks in the Getty 
Museum's five-year effort to purchase Canova's 19th-Century marble sculpture of 
three female nudes, however. The museum in 1989 agreed to buy the artwork from 
Fine Art Investment and Display Ltd., a Cayman Islands company that had 
purchased it in 1984 from its longtime owner, the Marquess of Tavistock. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Getty Museum's export license has been repeatedly delayed while the 
V&A has conducted an on-again, off-again fund-raising drive to match the 
Getty's price and buy the sculpture for its collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In February the British Department of National Heritage deferred the Getty's 
export license until Aug. 5, but on Tuesday Secretary Dorrell extended the 
deferral for three more months, to Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 V&A Director Elizabeth Esteve-Coll hailed the donation as "an act of 
outstanding generosity by a noted supporter of the arts." In a statement 
released to the press, she said: "It gives huge impetus to the campaign, and 
will hearten all those who wish to see this marvelous work retained in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty Museum's administrative offices were closed Friday and museum 
director John Walsh could not be reached for comment on the latest Canova 
upset. On Tuesday, when the three-month export license deferral was announced, 
Walsh expressed disappointment and a loss of faith in the British export 
license system. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture was commissioned in 1814 by John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford 
and installed in the Temple of the Graces at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire. 
Earlier this week Walsh said that the artwork is one of the greatest sculptures 
in private hands and that it sums up neo-classical ideals of beauty and 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The third of the oil tycoon's five sons, John Paul Getty II has acquired a 
fortune from a family trust but has lived an intensely troubled life. He lost 
his second wife, Talitha, in 1971, to a heroin overdose and nearly destroyed 
himself with drugs. But during the last decade he has made a comeback and 
emerged as a major philanthropist. His largest donation to date is $63 million, 
given in 1985 to the National Gallery in London.

ART REVIEW; UPLIFTING VIEW FROM DOWN UNDER; CONTEMPORARY ART OF INDIGENOUS 
AUSSIES BRIDGES CULTURAL GAP WITH 'DREAMTIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today it's called the Pacific Asia Museum. It roosts in a wonderful Pasadena 
landmark building in Chinese Imperial Palace courtyard style. 
</P>
<P>
 But L.A. contemporary art buffs remember the place as the launching pad for 
our avant-garde back in the '60s, when it was the Pasadena Museum and its 
director was Walter Hopps. Hopps organized the first retrospective of Marcel 
Duchamp's art there and gave a series of exhibitions conferring institutional 
credence on everybody from Ed Kienholz to Joe Goode. Now the place is devoted 
to the arts of Asia and the Pacific Rim -- and if that appears a bit too 
conventional to vanguard votaries, they should pack up their bread, wine and 
cheese and make a pilgrimage to a current exhibition that Duchamp himself would 
have smiled upon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Its title is a mouthful. "The Evolving Dreamtime: Contemporary Art by 
Indigenous Australians From the Kelton Family Foundations Collection." Its 
curator is Kerry Smallwood, who presents some 150 paintings and artifacts by 
descendants of the original inhabitants of the great continent down under. It's 
the first part of the first large-scale exhibition to examine this work. The 
present group comes from Central and Southern regions. Next year the Northern 
section will appear at the museum. Pity there is no catalogue for this 
important show. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the pessimist within is alarmed. This isn't one of those 
all-to-frequent instances of well-meaning whites messing into a noble native 
art and turning it into tourist kitsch, is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Introductory galleries douse that fear, only to ignite another: that it's 
going to be a worthy, slightly dull, didactic show. There are a few works in 
boring English watercolor landscape style, but mostly the rooms have the flavor 
of a show in a museum of cultural history. Wall labels remind us of pertinent 
facts. Indigenous Australians represent the oldest continuous culture on the 
planet. They migrated to the island continent some 50,000 years ago from 
Southeast Asia. They were hunter-gatherers whose lore was transmitted down the 
generations by oral tradition and paintings executed most often in sand, on 
bodies or on wood. There were as many as 600 distinct tribal groups speaking as 
many as 300 languages at the time of the first western contact. There was 
considerable stylistic variation in the art of the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work looks like abstrac tion consisting of rough ovals radiating 
wavy lines executed in pointillist dots and rendered, of course, in earth 
tones. The effect is quite decorative but not bland. Dots make a basket-like 
texture. Right. Decorative abstract art. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. These pictures tell stories. The fact that we can't read them brings up 
an interesting question of just who is illiterate around here. Shapes and their 
placement function as hieroglyphs for those who can decipher them. They tell 
tales of the Australian aborigines' creation myth, the Dreamtime. They function 
as maps. They act as tablets of the law at ritual ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this is all very interesting but one feels more educated than moved. 
Something stirs within this work, a kind of hallucinogenic power, but it 
doesn't quite blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there is an unbridgeable cultural gap here. Maybe present-day inheritors 
of this art have lost touch with their roots. Mulling this over, the visitor 
crosses an open corridor, glimpses the museum's lovely courtyard and enters the 
main gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wow. Suddenly and finally it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a large composition by Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri. As dark and 
sumptuous as an imperial Chinese court painting, it is also as unexpected as an 
Abstract Expressionist masterpiece. Its title, "Yuutjutiyungu Ancestral Tales 
of Mt. Allen Sites," is mysterious and stately. It's easy to imagine artists 
like Richard Pousette-Dart or Lee Mullican or for that matter Jean Dubuffet 
admiring it and seeing something of themselves in it too. 
</P>
<P>
 From here on there is no question, this is an art exhibition. Clearly, many of 
these artists have been formally trained in the Western tradition. A few suffer 
from it, making bad knock-off of figurative styles. The best work adds fluency 
in the native tradition to mastery of the international mainstream of classic 
modernist abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Mansell's "The Firebringers" has an elegant psychedelic aura and a texture 
so rich it looks beaded. Emily Kame Kngwarreye's "Awelye (My Dreaming)" uses 
the foreign pictorial device of atmospheric rendering to transform her map-like 
native style into an great explosion of lyric color. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as there is more to Australia than kangaroos, there is more to this art 
than abstraction. Sally Morgan uses a pop-flavored folk style. Her "Terra 
Nullus" depicts a red mountain dotted with weeping black people on crucifixes, 
under a rainbow. It intends to protest injustice against aboriginal people but 
avoids mawkishness. Maybe a subtler sort of brief against inequity is embodied 
in Bronwyn Bancroft's "Spiritual Exposure." Its spooky green poltergeist figure 
and outsider style bespeak the fears of the imprisoned soul.

THEATER REVIEW; OUTER 'CYBERIA'; SAN FRANCISCO MIME TROUPE PERFORMS A MUSICAL 
COMIC BOOK ON RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Escape From Cyberia . . . A Virtual Odyssey," the big-hearted, cheerfully 
amateurish and generally endearing musical comic book on racism from the San 
Francisco Mime Troupe, arrived at Los Angeles Theatre Center on Thursday. If 
you want to see Buck Rimfire, the right-wing radio host who supports the "three 
strikes and you're dead" anti-crime law, go up against Sister Double Melanin, 
the "Afro-centric hate monger" who says "three strikes" equals genocide for 
black men -- you have only tonight and the Sunday matinee left to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for sticking up for white people!" says a call-in listener from Del 
Mar Vista to Buck's radio show, pleased with the host's support of Proposition 
187, which would take away most public benefits for illegal immigrants. "Before 
you know it," continues the caller, "we'll all be speaking Spanish! They'll 
rename our cities!" Buck is reassuring. "I'm sure you speak for millions of 
people," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the thousands of people who like to laugh at those millions, "Cyberia" is 
a swell place to be. On a ramshackle stage with trapdoors and a small 
turntable, the sets twirl by, as adorably cheap-looking as the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Barthol's rock songs, with titles like "My Life's a Crock" and "You're 
So Screwed," also have a delightful impromptu quality. This is clearly play 
time, even if the ideas at play are deadly serious.  
</P>
<P>
 The peripatetic Troupe has been wresting political issues straight from the 
day's headlines since 1959. Its home base is indeed San Francisco, but it has 
never practiced mime in the Marcel Marceau sense of the word. In 1987 the 
troupe won a special Tony Award for excellence in regional theater.  
</P>
<P>
 The spirited cast keeps popping up in surprising new roles, wearing some 
hilarious hair piece or prop, like an amply padded butt. Velina Brown is 
particularly good as Sister Double Melanin, a female Farrakhan who learns 
repentance, and as a seventh-grader who can't read the instructions on the ATM 
machine he would like to burgle.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with spirit, the troupe and its followers hold on to some of the naivete 
of its 1960s radical roots. "Escape From Cyberia" asks us to consider that a 
good kid who tries to protect a girl from being robbed and whose motives are 
misunderstood could end up a victim of the controversial "three strikes and 
you're out" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 While that's a possibility worth considering, especially since discussions of 
the law usually go hand in hand with hardened criminals, the show asks us to go 
even a step further. When a character energetically suggests that police stop 
arresting kids and go after the real criminals -- "the greedy corporations," 
the audience cheered. I hate greedy corporations as much as the next guy, but I 
couldn't bring myself to cheer for such a lame-brained concept.  
</P>
<P>
 In another subplot, two teen-agers have a meaningful relationship on the 
Internet, in the nameless, faceless, raceless universe that is cyberspace. 
Unbeknown to them, they have another relationship in real space: victim and 
would-be mugger. Once they find that out, the friendship is over, at least 
temporarily. Only in the cartoon universe of the Mime Troupe could these two 
friends be reunited as fully as they are here. Oh well, it will have to do 
until the real world gets funkier.

ORCHESTRA MUTED BY MEDIOCRITY

 Corigliano: Piano Concerto; Ticheli: Radiant Voices, Postcard. Carl St.Clair 
and the Pacific Symphony. Alain Lefevre, soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch International Classics 3-7250-2. In the first recording by Carl St.Clair 
and the Pacific Symphony, due in the stores next week, the orchestra is 
following a canny marketing strategy established years ago by the Pacific's 
founding conductor, Keith Clark: Record little-known music by American 
composers. The effort gets attention, merits respect if not reverence and 
encounters little if any competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and the orchestra recorded (on various labels) Copland's "Eight Poems of 
Emily Dickinson," Roy Harris' Symphony No. 6, Ives' Third Orchestral Set and 
Menotti's Violin Concerto. None was a familiar work. None had been recorded by 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair and Co. have recorded, for Koch International Classics, John 
Corigliano's Piano Concerto, with Alain Lefevre as the soloist, and two pieces 
by Pacific composer-in-residence Frank Ticheli: "Radiant Voices," commissioned 
in 1992 by the Pacific, and "Postcard," a concert-band piece from 1991 reworked 
for the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 None will be familiar to anyone except Pacific Symphony audiences who have 
heard all of them over the last few seasons. None is available on other 
recordings, although Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony reportedly will 
issue their version of the piano concerto with soloist Barry Douglas later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 None is likely to enter the standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as recordings go, the Koch sound is more spacious and less acidic than 
Pro Art's CD of Clark conducting works by Berlioz, Strauss and Respighi, 
recorded during the Pacific Symphony's first concerts at the then-new Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in October, 1986. That may be a tribute to the 
Koch engineers or to the evolution of CD technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The separation is clear, details are splendidly focused; the orchestra's 
strings sound better than they do in real life. Lefevre negotiates Corigliano's 
endless bravura passages admirably. St.Clair conducts with complete commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 But one wonders: Why all the effort in the service of such mediocre music? 
</P>
<P>
 Corigliano, of course, is much in the news. His Symphony No. 1 (the so-called 
"AIDS" Symphony) is impressive. His opera "The Ghosts of Versailles" (1991) was 
the first world premiere the Metropolitan Opera has given in a quarter-century 
and turned out to be the sleeper hit of the New York season. (The Met was 
caught by surprise. It had scheduled too few performances to accommodate the 
demand.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one wonders if interest in the opera will be sustained. Certainly the 
symphony does not hold up well after repeated listenings. 
</P>
<P>
 The piano concerto, composed in 1968, simply is a bloated, amorphous, numbing 
affair in which jazzy athleticism alternates with lush lyricism, echoing along 
the way such composers as Barber, Bartok, Copland, Prokofiev and Ravel, and 
evoking all the depths of Brian Easdale'sballet music for the film "The Red 
Shoes" (1948). 
</P>
<P>
 For the Pacific to pair Ticheli with Corigliano appears little more than 
self-promotion. There's plenty of underrecorded American music more deserving 
of the exposure.  
</P>
<P>
 The two composers do share some characteristics. They both write so-called 
accessible music that demands little audience attention and rewards it 
scantily. Both exploit vast orchestral resources that appear out of proportion 
to their ideas. They apply slabs of orchestral color to make grand gestures, 
but they are gestures of little personal expressivity. Corigliano labels the 
third movement of the concerto "Appassionato," but the passion one hears here 
is lukewarm at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD, made in February and March, features a cover photo of Corigliano, his 
hands on the shoulders of Lefevre and St.Clair. Presumably, this is an 
interpretation he fully sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the program notes for "Radiant Voices," a moody, noisy tone poem inspired 
by the Los Angeles riots of 1992, Ticheli mentions the initial five-note motif 
from which much of the work is derived. It is an unnecessary comment: The motif 
is repeated so often that the listener will have it memorized within half a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the composer manages transitions between the see-saw contrasting 
sections with skill, even if he doesn't create a persuasive sense of cohesion 
and development. 
</P>
<P>
 More concentrated is his alert six-minute "Postcard," a modest effort with an 
engaging fugal opening. It suggests a talent that was appealing before it 
succumbed to the grandiose possibilities latent in scoring for a full 
orchestra.

 Music to His Ears: Two days before the start of the Woodstock reunion, the 
father of '60s psychedelic guitarist Jimi Hendrix won a round in his battle to 
recover the rights to his son's musical legacy. A Seattle judge ruled Wednesday 
that James (Al) Hendrix has the right to control the licensing of his son's 
name, likeness and image -- except with regard to merchandise associated with 
Hendrix albums and exhibitions. Hendrix's father filed a multimillion-dollar 
fraud lawsuit 16 months ago against his former attorney and several 
corporations, alleging that the rights to the late rock star's catalogue were 
sold without his knowledge or consent. The trial to determine exactly who owns 
Hendrix's music is not expected to commence until June 5. MCA Music 
Entertainment just released its latest Jimi Hendrix collection, "Woodstock" -- 
which entered the nation's pop chart at No. 40 after selling almost 28,000 
copies last week in U.S. record stores. THE ARTS

 Music Director Dismissed: Just weeks before the opening of its new season, the 
Paris Opera on Friday fired its South Korean-born music director, Myung-Whun 
Chung, in a dispute over money and artistic freedom. Jean-Paul Cluzel, the 
opera's interim administrator, said no replacement had been lined up for the 
U.S.-trained Chung even though rehearsals were to begin Monday for Verdi's 
"Simon Boccanegra," to open this year's season on Sept. 19. The management 
attributed the dismissal to a dispute over the length of Chung's contract, 
saying that he had rejected all proposals. "Management is saddened that Mr. 
Chung, whose work with the orchestra and choirs is well known, did not want to 
pursue this work," it said in a statement. Chung, in an interview published in 
the French daily Le Monde on Thursday, said the dispute centered primarily on 
his freedom to select works and artists. Chung and management also acknowledged 
major differences over his pay and job security. TV & VIDEO

WELL-ROUNDED IN BLUES CIRCLES; JOE LOUIS WALKER'S 'YOUTH' HASN'T STOPPED HIM 
FROM MIXING WITH THE MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you get up past age 30 in rock 'n' roll, you're just about ready for 
discounted movie tickets and bus passes. Rock always has been a young person's 
game; a few gray hairs or extra inches around the waist can spell imminent 
irrelevance in the grand scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the reverse holds true in the blues. Such artists as John Lee 
Hooker, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush spent their prime years working in the relative 
obscurity of the so-called chitlin circuit, only to be trotted out as national 
treasures at an age when they ought to be enjoying a well-earned retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 At 43, Joe Louis Walker is considered an upstart, a young gun of the blues. 
But for all his acclaim in the music press for taking the music into new 
realms, his name remains familiar only to the hard-core blues aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk down the street and ask someone what they know about the blues, and 
who are they gonna say?" Walker -- who plays tonight at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano -- asked during a recent phone conversation from his home in 
San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're gonna say Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and if you're in England, 
they're gonna say Gary Moore. It's almost like you gotta be 70 years old like 
John Lee Hooker to get any real recognition, or if you get real lucky, you 
might find yourself in a situation like Robert Cray was in. But that was a lot 
of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker hopes to pick up some luck of his own via the release of "JLW," his 
second album for Verve Records after a stint with the Bay Area indie Hightone 
label, where Cray got his start. 
</P>
<P>
 "JLW" is a stellar effort, featuring Walker's speedy-but-tasteful, 
jazz-inflected guitar runs, fevered slide workouts, soulful singing and solid 
songwriting. It also features an all-star cast including Branford Marsalis, 
James Cotton, Angela Strehli and the Tower of Power horns -- artists Walker 
says he used out of friendship and musical respect, rather than any cynical, 
label-mandated attempt to cash in on their name value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of this album," Walker said. "I think it's got some good songs 
on it and I was fortunate to get a lot of people to play on it whom I'd played 
with before. It was like a family. It worked out real good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of family is nothing new to Walker, who grew up in the communal 
environment of the Haight-Ashbury district in the '50s and '60s. His 
southern-born parents played down-home blues around the house, and Walker 
cranked out covers of soul hits in a childhood band with his cousins. He has 
played blues professionally from the time he was a teen-ager and hooked into 
the burgeoning Haight rock scene in the late '60s, at least on a social level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really into the psychedelic thing. I didn't play the music," he 
said. "But in a way I was part of that scene because my bass player was Jerry 
Garcia's guitar tech, and I knew all the people in the Airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played at Marty Balin's club (the legendary Matrix), opening for all the 
blues acts that came through. I knew all those people and jammed with them. 
Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen I've been knowing since I was 19. So in a way, I 
could say yeah, I was a part of it, but not musically. Not that I didn't dig 
psychedelic music, but I just did something different, more or less stuck to 
the blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his influences was the Paul Butterfield Blues Band/Electric Flag guitar 
virtuoso Mike Bloomfield, with whom he roomed in the late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was a wonderful person, and he definitely helped me out, steering me in 
the right direction," Walker recalled. "Through Mike, I met Buddy Miles, and I 
met Jimi Hendrix through Buddy when I was about 21. I went to parties with him; 
Buddy asked me and another guy to take him around. Jimi used our rehearsal 
space, and one day he had a big jam session over there, but it was one of those 
days that I just couldn't get out of bed, and I never ended up playing with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walker also opened for a number of jazz acts in his younger days ("I was on a 
bill with Thelonius Monk when I was like 20 years old") and spent 1975 through 
1985 as a member of a gospel group, the Spiritual Corinthians. He says he has 
learned from everyone he has played with. In any case, by the time he made his 
own debut with "Cold Is the Night" in 1986, he was a well-rounded, eclectic 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is bound to rub off on you a little bit," he said. "I'm like a 
jack of all trades because of all the hanging out I did. I've spent a lot of 
time playing different things and I try to incorporate a little bit of all of 
it into what I do. I try to use what works for me and what works for a song. I 
put it all together and I come up with me."

HUNTINGTON BEACH ART CENTER'S OPENING IS STALLED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening of the Huntington Beach Art Center, postponed numerous times over 
the past three years, has been pushed back yet again because of a decision to 
replace the general contractor refurbishing the building the center is to 
occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city cultural services manager Michael Mudd, city officials and 
the Lewis Jorge Co. agreed to terminate their contract because, after the 
contractor had completed about 80% of the project, he wanted an additional 
$440,000 to address an unforeseen roof structure problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two estimates to get the same work done for 30% to 50% less," said 
Mudd, who now puts the center's opening date -- once slated for 1991 and most 
recently for May -- at early March. Five full-time employees will be hired to 
run the center and will start working there in December, Mudd said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, no work has been done on the center building in downtown 
Huntington Beach for about four months, and some artists lined up for the 
inaugural exhibition, already twice postponed, have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he continued, no private donors who contributed to the $1.3-million 
refurbishment have withdrawn their support. Mudd also noted that reconstruction 
projects often are delayed by structural complications discovered after work 
has started. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," he said, "but anyone who has done restoration work 
understands (such complications) and the extra time needed to get the work 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The private Huntington Beach Art Center Foundation has raised about $750,000 
toward the reconstruction. It hopes to drum up another $75,000 this weekend 
with its fifth annual benefit equestrian competition. The difference will be 
loaned by the city, Mudd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition, billed as the GTE "The Everything Pages" Summer Classic V, 
started Friday and will continue today and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 
the Huntington Central Park Equestrian Center. VIP tickets, which include lunch 
each day and reserved seats, are $75 to $125. Unreserved-seating admission is 
free. (714) 536-5258.

MUSIC REVIEW ; SALONEN CONDUCTS PROGRAM OF BEETHOVEN, SHOSTAKOVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acoustical variables, attendance figures and speculation concerning their 
causes, plus frequency of aeronautical intrusions -- these are the issues on 
which Hollywood Bowl regulars seem to focus more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen's second Los Angeles Philharmonic concert in his and the 
orchestra's four pre-European tour programs, Thursday night, raised other, more 
intriguing concerns, at least for one listener. 
</P>
<P>
 The less important data first: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1994 sound system seemed to be working, and to be behaving, efficiently 
and with good fidelity. If there was too much loudness -- e.g., a preponderance 
of forte and a lack of purposeful dynamic contrasts -- in this three-composer 
program, blame the conductor. He seemed to be encouraging this level of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 * For this agenda of music by Billy Childs (his nearly three-minute "Fanfare 
for the United Races of America"), Beethoven ("Consecration of the House" 
Overture and Fifth Symphony) and Shostakovich (First Piano Concerto), a crowd 
of 14,179 passed through the turnstiles, as counted by the management. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fewer than a handful of aerial passersby -- perhaps two, on the periphery of 
the skyscape -- arrived to distract one's concentration on this climatically 
clear and listener-friendly Thursday night at Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, one can report that the full and wonted impact of the two Beethoven 
works failed to materialize, despite playing from the orchestra of exceptional 
neatness and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Apparently, a lack of conductorial heat, urgency and focus. Tempos 
moved along, mechanical glitches were avoided. But that sense of continuity and 
inevitability that binds together genuinely integrated, deeply felt 
performances seldom appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Wit and mordancy did enter the proceedings at their mid-point, when pianist 
Alexander Toradze and trumpeter Thomas Stevens became the principals in 
Shostakovich's lovable Concerto No. 1. Each of the soloists brought emotional 
nuance and faceted humors to his part, tossing off the technical challenges 
without effort, connecting to each other and to the string orchestra and 
conductor. Thus, they made the work's detailed musical scenario pungent and 
mellow, poignant and brittle by turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs' bright, sometimes harmonically lugubrious fanfare, which opened the 
program, recalled the musical atmosphere of B-movies of the 1930s, a witty and 
gripping evocation that seems to set the Los Angeles native, 37 this year, 
apart from more stylized writers of his generation. More, please.

THEATER REVIEW; IN 'NUNSENSE II,' THE SPIRIT IS WILLING AND ABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trouble with most sequels is the lack of surprise. A clever idea -- 
whether it's an antebellum South that's gone with the wind, or a fund-raiser 
given by the Little Sisters of Hoboken to raise cash to bury the dead nuns 
resting in the convent's freezer -- can only pale when retread. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem with Dan Goggins' "Nunsense II The Second Coming. . . " at 
Fullerton Civic Light Opera's Theatre on the Green. What was fresh, campy and 
very funny the first time around, doesn't have much of anywhere to go except 
over old ground. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say there isn't a lot of fun during the Little Sisters' "Thank 
You Show" for all the theatergoers who supported the sterling primo opus. This 
time there's a talent scout in the audience and a contrived plot about an 
incorrigible Italian kid, now in the reformatory, who was kicked out of school 
by the Mother Superior, Sister Mary Regina. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the Franciscan nuns who are trying to steal back Sister Mary 
Amnesia and the fortune she won from Publisher's Clearing House, but they 
aren't who they seem (don't forget the Italian kid has connections). If you saw 
the first "Nunsense," that will all make sense to you, and there is a recap for 
newcomers to the wacky world Goggins has created. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two too many serious ballads for a romp like this, and only one of 
them doesn't seem out of place. There are too many gags Goggins really had to 
stretch for, and the Sisters don't otherwise have too much that's inventive to 
spring on their adoring audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What this production does have, however, is style. Director Rob Barron knows 
how to put on a show, and he does it with energy and a splashy sense of what 
pleases audiences. His staging almost makes the writing seem brand new. Barron 
never lets the tempos flag and keeps his Sisters bounding across the stage like 
greyhounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sisters are a joyful, cheery group. Mary-Pat Green is a deliciously varied 
Mother Superior, sometimes as hard as starch, sometimes caught up in her own 
covert giddiness, and Debbi Ebert as her No. 2, Sister Mary Hubert, is a 
perfect second banana. Her double takes are timed to a T. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Baretta is good as the eternally dancing novice, Sister Mary Leo, this 
time trying her best on roller skates. Laura Soltis is too pretty for the 
ignoble Sister Mary Amnesia but very funny as she reprises Amnesia's hysterical 
puppet act with hand-held Sister Mary Annette in the incongruous and raucous 
"The Country Nun." Baretta and Soltis both handle their vocals flawlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 But all in all, it's Jennifer Bryce's evening as Brooklyn's Sister Mary Robert 
Anne, streetwise and smart, funny and a little sad, like the young Giulietta 
Massina, particularly when she sings that one fitting and touching ballad, 
"Angeline," about a childhood friend from Brooklyn who used to be a nun too.

MIDDLE-GROUND MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A Squeeze Play Tags the Summer Box Office" (Aug. 2) mentions that this 
summer's films are either mega-hits grossing over $100 million or losers buried 
in red ink, leaving no real middle ground. This is attributed to the fact that 
there are too many films to choose from.This may be part of the reason but not 
all.  
</P>
<P>
 Even in hard economic times, people will still spend money for escapist 
entertainment. As money gets tighter, however, and with theater tickets getting 
more expensive, people are more likely to spend on what they consider a 
first-rate film with a proven track record, rather than risk it on a film with 
so-so reviews and a lackluster box-office performance. 
</P>
<P>
 How often do you now hear the question, "Is it worth seeing in the theater or 
should we wait for it to come out on video?" Which means: Is it worth spending 
$7.50 per person at a theater today, or just $3.50 for a home-video rental in a 
few months? 
</P>
<P>
 So, until the economy improves or movie tickets become cheaper, the middle 
ground will continue to dwindle.

'MY WAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed watching "Encore! The Three Tenors" immensely, but I should point 
out a fact about the song "My Way," which was dedicated to Frank Sinatra: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the music was written about 25 years ago by Frenchmen Jacques Revaux 
and Claude Francois, with words by Gillis Thibault and Francois, and English 
words by Paul Anka. (Francois, unfortunately, died more than a decade ago in a 
freaky bathtub accident when a hair dryer fell into the water.) The name of the 
song is "Comme d'Habitude," which simply translates into "As Usual."

BOZ SCAGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the "Boz Scaggs: Rock Takes a Snooze" review by Dennis Hunt (Aug. 8): 
</P>
<P>
 I had waited a long time to see Scaggs in concert. On Aug. 7, my wait 
ended.That voice that I have heard over the radio, on tapes, records and, yes, 
even ages ago on "The Midnight Special" has only gotten richer. The materials 
that Scaggs chose to perform, beginning with the title track of his new release 
"Some Change" to his encore pieces, "Lido" and "Dinah Flo," were great. The 
ballads that he chose to sing touched me the way that they do when I listen to 
them at home. His band and backup singers were exceptional. These were the 
songs that I had longed to hear live. I was not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening, at least for me, was a wonderful evening spent listening to a 
class act, not an aging rocker with a "Peter Pan" complex. Welcome back, Boz. 
Next time don't stay away so long.

KPFK DISMISSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the frequent guest hosts of "The Family Tree" and "Freedom Now" 
radio programs on KPFK-FM who was dismissed, I feel the need to clarify some 
issues revealed in Claudia Puig's article, "KPFK Drops Two Programs Accused of 
Using Hate Speech," (July 23): 
</P>
<P>
 None of the letters received by any of the programmers stated what specific 
action led to their being removed from the air. Contrary to statements by 
station manager Cliff Roberts, there was no due process and he spent no time at 
all "working" with programmers.

NEED A GOOD WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the article on Dan Gordon and what befell his script for the 
film "Wyatt Earp" ("Leave 'Wyatt Earp' Off His Tombstone," Aug. 5), I am left 
with two conclusions.One, that filmgoers lost out on what would have been an 
excellent or at least fascinating film. Two, that Lawrence Kasdan's overhaul of 
the script, however well-intentioned it may have been, was a fatal error. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while we're at it, here's a really radical idea. Get Gordon's script and 
make the film as he envisioned it. We're seriously overdue for a good Western.

GEORGE PUTNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a pleasure to hear it told "like it is"! I'm referring to the insightful 
and enjoyable interview with George Putnam, ("I Broadcast in My Spare Time," 
July 21). 
</P>
<P>
 I remember sitting (probably too close!) to our tiny Emerson TV and listening 
intently to the dulcet tones of newscasters such as Putnam and Baxter Ward.And 
now I really miss them. These guys were no-nonsense reporters . 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam is so right when he decries the million-dollar anchors. Can they 
remember the copy they'd just read? No! Did they write it? No! It is a shame 
that banter that masquerades as insight is simply more text on the 
TelePrompTer. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's have more articles and interviews with real television journalists. How 
'bout Ralph Story, Baxter Ward and Joseph Benti, to name a few.

KIMBA AND SIMBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To settle the simmering Kimba-Simba controversy ("A 'Kimba' Surprise for 
Disney," July 13), I have a suggestion.Why not resurrect and restore the 
classic "Kimba, the White Lion" episodes and air them with reasonable fanfare 
on, say, the Disney Channel? 
</P>
<P>
 Then everyone can decide whether Disney owes animator Osamu Tezuka appropriate 
screen acknowledgment. At the same time, Tezuka's groundbreaking series (and 
its equally engaging, rarely seen sequel, "Leo the Lion") can be exposed to a 
whole new generation of youngsters and animation buffs.

POP BEAT: GORY DETAILS SELL FOR ROCK'S UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent show at the Whisky by the Genitorturers, the band pretends to pull 
the innards out of a half-naked corpse. Although the group's music couldn't 
rock its way out of a paper bag, let alone a body bag, the crowd stands 
transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just one sample of the current escalation of bloody imagery in rock's 
underground. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * A graphic police photo of a suicide victim, his head severed by a train, 
adorns the cover of the Unsane's self-titled album. The trio's other records 
feature blood-drenched shots of a bathtub suicide scene and a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nine Inch Nails' "Happiness and Slavery" video features a man being 
methodically mutilated by a machine.  
</P>
<P>
 * Members of White Zombie and Danzig are among the artists represented in a 
set of collectors' cards depicting serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The group Marilyn Manson . . . well, the name says it all.  
</P>
<P>
 The lesson? Gore sells.  
</P>
<P>
 Although too subversive to push millions of albums, graphic record covers of 
autopsies and auto accidents and theatrical displays of carnage on stage appeal 
to a growing rock subculture of tattooed and pierced rubberneckers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are attracted to our album art because it's extreme," says Vincent 
Signorelli, drummer for the Unsane, a trio from New York that plays heavy, 
claustrophobic rock. "It's like when there's an accident outside, you always 
want to look to see if it's terrible or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Gen, the platinum blond dominatrix who fronts the Florida-based Genitorturers, 
says, "People come to our shows and either leave excited or disgusted or 
titillated, but everyone goes away feeling something." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's buying? If the audiences at recent shows by these bands are any 
indication, it's middle-class kids who are cut off from the reality of true 
horror. In quiet neighborhoods, where the atrocities of war or urban crime are 
not present, the fascination with gore grows. 
</P>
<P>
 Aficionados collect gruesome pictures, books and film footage like stamps. The 
immediate rush of watching death and mutilation in these controlled media 
seemingly makes it safe and somehow free of responsibility. It's wimpishly 
voyeuristic and detached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the stuff is aesthetically interesting and beautiful. Even if it's 
gory, it can work as a surreal graphic," says Stuart Swezey, owner of AMOK, an 
L.A. bookstore and publishing house that sells everything from autopsy videos 
to serial killer memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course gory rock 'n' roll imagery is nothing new. KISS used to spit fake 
blood on stage, Alice Cooper decapitated and hanged himself night after night, 
Lydia Lunch did ultra-sicko stuff in various Richard Kern movies, and bloody 
illustrations were standard for a whole slew of death-metal acts.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the age when documentary shows such as "Cops" and "911" have replaced 
"Dragnet," it takes reality (or extremely intense representations of reality) 
to get a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessarily that this stuff will warp the kids -- their parents 
survived comic books and early TV, and they may well come through this 
fascination to worry about their own children getting lost in some corrupting 
corner of the Internet.

 The real worry should be about the music. By going for this lowest common 
denominator, artists are in danger of forfeiting their creativity. These bands 
act as if they're going out on a limb, but they really couldn't be playing it 
more safe. If they want to take chances, why not do it in the music?

 Kennedy Compound: Rumors that the Dead Kennedy's record label Alternative 
Tentacles will re-release the group's "Frankenchrist" album -- with the 
original poster that led to the celebrated obscenity trial of singer Jello 
Biafra in 1986 -- are untrue, according to a label spokesman. But the poster 
featuring male genitalia by H.R. Giger (the artist best known for his sets in 
the movie "Alien") is available through mail order and with proof of age -- 
although dealers have been selling it as a discontinued collectors' item for 
the last eight years.

TV REVIEW; 'PARALLEL LIVES' DRAWS UNEVEN LINE BETWEEN FUN, BANALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From the sublime to the ridiculous . . . and the ridiculous has the edge in 
"Parallel Lives," a star-studded, partially improvised, "Big Chill"-type film 
Sunday on Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's "Chantilly Lace," producer, director and writer Linda Yellin 
gave well-known actresses the improvisational reins in a filmed confessional of 
feminine affirmation and bonding. Using the same technique, Yellin returns with 
several of the same actresses, plus male counterparts, making up a celebrity 
cast big enough for an Aaron Spelling disaster epic: Liza Minnelli, Gena 
Rowlands, Ben Gazzara, Ally Sheedy, Jack Klugman, Treat Williams, Dudley Moore 
and Robert Wagner, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the actors get to flex their improv muscles in a college 
fraternity-sorority reunion setting, fraught with soon-to-be exposed lust, 
resentment, desperation and rage, spiced with unexpected death and a police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching good actors do their thing is intermittently fun, and the naturalness 
of speech and interaction is a kick, but not the thin plot and trite characters 
with which the players are stuck. Even the improv grates as the actors too 
obviously enjoy their own cleverness. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the sleazy, anything-for-a-scoop reporter (James Belushi) reveal his 
sensitive side and win over the cynical political public-relations rep (JoBeth 
Williams)? Will the pushy gambler (Gazzara) show his vulnerability and charm 
the wealthy, cynical widow (Rowlands)? Will the honest senatorial candidate 
(Patricia Wettig) succumb to the inveterate womanizer (Treat Williams), then 
sacrifice her ethics to get elected? 
</P>
<P>
 Most genuine are Minnelli, who deepens her thankless role as the unhappy 
reunion organizer with touching subtlety, and Dudley Moore, low-key and likable 
as the imaginary friend of a daft rock star (Lindsay Crouse). 
</P>
<P>
 But genuineness is relative here. When the men develop an "Animal House" 
attitude, get drunk, moon the women and conduct a panty raid -- and when the 
women revert to candlelight confidences about sex, family and life choices -- 
it plays more like self-indulgence than a deeper response to the 
disillusionment of age and unfulfilled promise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Parallel Lives" airs at 8 p.m. Sunday on Showtime.

CAUSE TO REFLECT; MIRRORS CAN ENHANCE THE LIGHT AND SENSE OF SPACE AND BE USED 
TO DRAMATIC OR PHILOSOPHICAL EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mirrors have long been used in fiction for everything from telling the fairest 
in the land to providing a passageway to a world of talking caterpillars and 
Cheshire cats. In the average home, mirrors tend to be relegated to the 
bathroom or the back of a door. Their predominant use has been as a looking 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as interior designers and increasing numbers of homeowners know, there 
are far more uses for mirrors than merely checking one's looks. They can be 
used to correct design flaws, reflect outdoor scenery and -- in Eastern 
philosophy -- bring luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategically placed mirrors can visually expand the space in a room and bring 
in reflected light. The current trend is to use oversize mirrors for dramatic 
effect, according to Lynn Duncan, whose interior design firm is in Laguna 
Niguel. "I recently put a large mirror on the back wall of a dining room in a 
condo. It opened the room up and added volume to an otherwise small place." 
</P>
<P>
 Mirrors can be used with or without frames to enhance a decor. If the room's 
furnishings are traditional, Duncan recommends a high quality gold frame. For a 
contemporary home, a lacquer frame usually works best. 
</P>
<P>
 When placing a mirror, think about what it will reflect. "I had a client who 
wanted to put a large mirror on a back wall instead of taking advantage of 
their ocean view," Duncan said. "When I showed them how the mirror could 
reflect that view and bring the outside indoors, they decided to use the 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When deciding where to put a mirror, think of a mirror as artwork, the art 
being what it reflects," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorian Hunter, whose design firm is in Fullerton, also likes to use mirrors to 
make small rooms look larger. Redecorating a 25-year-old condo in Los Angeles, 
Hunter was faced with trying to add light and the appearance of space to a very 
small kitchen. "The kitchen was what they called a galley kitchen. To open up 
the space we put mirrors on the wall between the counters and the cabinets, and 
did the same thing on the wall above the cabinets to the ceiling to reflect the 
ceiling light. It did the trick, really brightening the kitchen, " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the use of a mirror is more philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient Chinese art of feng shui links the placement of objects to fate 
and good luck. According to this philosophy, each direction of the compass 
controls certain aspects of life. Proper placement of the orientation of your 
house and the arrangement of personal belongings and furnishings brings good 
luck or good feng shui. If things are not in the proper order, according to the 
philosophy, bad luck, poor health and poverty may result. 
</P>
<P>
 Feng shui literally means wind and water, representing the power of the 
environment to affect humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the philosophy has been growing in Southern California in the past 
decade, said Katherine Metz, owner of the Art of Placement in Los Angeles. She 
has been using the concepts of feng shui in her design business for about six 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 The use of mirrors is a major element of feng shui. Because most Western homes 
are not designed to the specifications of feng shui, mirrors are used to try 
and correct architectural flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, it is considered a misalignment to have an L-shaped house with a 
bedroom extending beyond the front door. "To get that room back into a 
transcendental state we can put up a mirror to draw the room back into the 
house," Metz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirrors are also used in feng shui to expand areas and draw in energy. Mirrors 
are also considered a symbol of water. A feng shui master may enter a house and 
find an area that symbolizes fire -- not necessarily a tangible element such as 
found in a kitchen or fireplace, but a sensation experienced by the master of 
potential bad luck. In those situations, a mirror will be placed nearby to "put 
out the fire" Metz said. "Feng shui deals with what is seen and unseen," she 
added, "things our Western mind hasn't been exposed to. But there is a growing 
interest in the feng shui. " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of mirrors -- whether used for practical or metaphysical reasons 
-- can vary from thick and solid to thin and wavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before purchasing a mirror, experts suggest standing back and make sure it has 
good clarity. There should not be any fuzziness or distortion. Also check for 
distortions by looking at it from different angles.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you use a large mirror you want to go to a good quality glass and mirror 
company, one that specializes in top quality mirrors. The ones you buy at 
discount stores may be rippled," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hemsley, owner of First Class Glass in Laguna Beach, said the only way 
to really know the quality of a mirror is to look at the back. "There's not a 
lot you can look for if the mirror is already framed. But if it is unframed, 
make sure the coating on the back covers the silver completely. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good mirror, the glass is at least one-quarter-inch thick and may have a 
pure silver coating or a combination of silver and copper or other reflective 
metals. It takes at least two coats of protective covering to ensure the 
quality of the reflection remains true, Hemsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proper care of a mirror is important to keep the reflective material from 
breaking down. John White, owner of Brea Glass, recommends careful treatment of 
a mirror during installation. Use clean, dry gloves when installing a mirror, 
making sure not to get any perspiration or installation chemicals on the 
mirror. It is also important not to let a mirror rest directly on the bottom of 
a frame where water and cleaning fluids can collect and damage the mirror, 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree any cleaners used on mirrors should not have ammonia, which can 
drip into the frame and eat away the reflective backing, Hemsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests using a foam glass cleaner without ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for keeping a mirror in good condition is the cost of replacement 
or restoration. "It's really not worth the cost to restore a mirror," White 
said. "And I don't know of that many people who still restore. Even if it's an 
antique cabinet, it's less costly to replace the mirror than try and restore 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, another reason to keep a mirror in good condition is that it is a 
focus of attention. And a reflection on your home.

ARTISANS; EACH SET OF HANDS COAXES CLAY OUT OF CERAMICS MOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It begins the same. A lump of clay, mixed with water. For ceramic artists, the 
challenge is to make that clay take form, whether it's a bowl, vase or 
functional object. Yet despite the fact that these artists start with the same 
basic material, the end result is often surprisingly different. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramics is one of the oldest and most enduring of art forms; pieces are among 
some of the earliest artifacts discovered. And despite advances in technology 
and quality of materials, many of the same ancient skills are needed to create 
modern pieces. "Throwing" a pot by guiding wet clay over a spinning wheel 
employs the same techniques used in ancient times. After the pot is thrown or 
designed, it is fired in a kiln and decorated as the artist chooses. 
Frequently, a piece may be fired several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The following artists, whose works are on exhibit through the end of August at 
the Sawdust Festival in Laguna Beach, consider ceramics their primary medium. 
Each uses different methods to achieve their distinctive looks. Rocket Fuel and 
More 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Schuppe of Laguna Beach grew up in a household filled with art and 
lots of craft projects. Her mother, who is also an artist, encouraged her 
daughter's creative interests by keeping their home well-stocked with paints, 
pencils, and other tools of the trade. Although trained as a painter, Schuppe 
always loved the "physicality" of ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I earned my master's of fine arts degree at Cal State Long Beach," she said. 
"While my education is very valuable, I think I've learned a great deal on my 
own by experimenting and trying new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuppe's work combines her love of ceramics with painting. Her fanciful 
creations include bowls, platters, oversize coffee mugs, teapots and tiles 
featuring brightly colored rockets, cherries and other fruit (reminiscent of 
styles of the '30s and '40s), and numerous references to one of America's 
favorite beverages: coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, she has created her pieces, working from her home studio and 
gathering ideas from customers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her most popular creations is a large coffee mug depicting a blasting 
rocket. The notation, "Rocket Fuel," is painted along the rim. The idea came 
from a customer request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several years ago, a woman stopped by my booth and asked if I'd paint the 
words rocket fuel on her coffee mug. She said that all her friends called her 
coffee 'rocket fuel' because she made it so strong," Schuppe said. "With the 
recent proliferation of coffee shops, those mugs are among my most popular 
items. And for some reason, the rocket fuel theme seems to delight people." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her creations, including her teapots, feature the fiery red rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 To create her pieces, Schuppe uses a low-fire technique so that the colors 
remain bright. At low-fire temperatures, the kiln is heated to about 1,850 
degrees, as opposed to high-fire temperatures where the heat can reach 2,400 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you fire ceramics at high heat levels, you lose the vivid colors. I 
think the brightness of my work is what attracts people," she said. In more 
recent years, she has made molds of some of the most frequently requested 
pieces so that she can create them more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with earthenware is a little like trying to throw peanut butter," she 
said. "It can be very time-consuming to get an exact, even fit. By making my 
own molds, I can slip-cast a piece and still achieve the look that I want. Also 
throwing clay is physically difficult, especially with large pieces that can 
get very heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the piece has been cast, it is fired and afterward Schuppe goes about 
painting one of her designs on it and fires it again. Then the piece is glazed 
and fired one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, by listening to those who enjoy her work and trusting her gut 
feelings, she has managed to support herself with her art. 
</P>
<P>
 Her oversize mugs run about $22, teapots are in the $90 range, and bowls and 
platters sell between $45 and $90. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't get rich doing what I do," she said. "But for me, this is a 
great life because while the work is challenging, it's also a lot of fun. I 
couldn't keep up with it if I didn't enjoy it." Combustible Finish 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie and Patti Kaplan, also of Laguna Beach, got their start in ceramic art 
almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, my background is in music," Patti said. "But in 1973 when my 
children were young, I decided to stop playing in my band. A neighbor convinced 
me to sign up for a ceramics class. It sounded like fun, so I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie, in the meantime, was working as a sculptor with no experience in 
ceramics. One day Patti decided to show him how to throw clay on a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me quite a while to learn how to do it, while Eddie was just a 
natural," she said. "It took him no time at all to learn how to throw pieces 
that were better than mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Eddie's sculpting gave way to ceramics. The Kaplans began looking 
for new ways to distinguish their pieces. That's when they discovered the 
Japanese art of Raku. 
</P>
<P>
 Raku is actually an old ceramic form that has recently regained popularity. 
Usually fired at a lower heat level, the piece is taken while still hot and 
placed in a barrel or container with combustible materials such as wood 
shavings, newspaper, plants and different grasses. Because the ceramic piece is 
still so hot, it ignites the combustible materials. Depending on what part of 
the ceramic surface touches the plants or paper, different patterns and color 
can emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaplans do, however, create intricate mosaic-looking designs in their 
pieces by applying tape to certain sections. This enables them to create 
different lines and patterns and to apply different colored glazes, often in 
shades of turquoise, rose, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taping is very time-intensive and then we have to remove it with a 
special scraper," said Patti. "If we scratch it, or the line is uneven, we 
won't sell it. It has to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the tape has been removed, the piece is fired again, melting the glaze so 
it adheres to the ceramic. The piece is then carefully removed from the burning 
kiln and placed in a barrel and "smoked." Upon removal from the barrel, it is 
cooled, cleaned and burnished. 
</P>
<P>
 While Eddie is primarily responsible for throwing the pieces, Patti adds the 
embellishments, which may include leather, semiprecious stones such as 
turquoise and amethyst, feathers and other natural objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Raku pieces with their precise designs are more labor-intensive and tend to 
cost more than other types of ceramics. A 22-inch platter, hand-painted with 
five different colors, is priced at $450. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that not everyone can afford these prices, the Kaplans also offer 
other pieces, including ceramic vases, bowls, jars and incense burners that 
have been airbrushed or glazed in more traditional methods so that costs can be 
kept down. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eddie's true love is Raku. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could do anything, it would be Raku," he said. "To me the fun is to 
create a piece and see how beautiful it looks. Sometimes I feel like I'm part 
chemist, trying to figure out what's going to work best. When I succeed, it 
makes me feel great." Fired in the Fire 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Jones of Laguna Beach was first introduced to ceramics through an art 
class at Laguna Beach High School. After graduating from UC Santa Barbara in 
1990 with degrees in both art and geography, he decided to see if he could sell 
some of his ceramic pieces. He started exhibiting at the Sawdust Festival in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the whole process," he said. "I enjoy taking clay and making it 
conform to a shape or a pattern. For me, that's very gratifying. Having the 
chance to exhibit with the Sawdust Festival artists whose work I admire has 
been very exciting. I can learn a great deal from them and it's helped me in my 
own work." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is among the artists who lost their work in the Laguna Beach fire last 
October. His entire studio burned to the ground and many of the ceramic pieces 
in progress were destroyed. Returning to his studio to assess the damage, he 
discovered that several of his pieces had been "naturally fired" during the 
blaze. His collection of "Laguna Fire" art is on display at the Sawdust 
Festival. Splattered with flashes of black, orange, red and purple, most of the 
"Laguna Fire Art" pieces are priced between $5 and $40. 
</P>
<P>
 "I estimate that I lost about 500 finished pieces in the fire," said Jones. 
"Then I found some of the pieces, buried under about two feet of ash and 
rubble. They're pretty fragile but interesting looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pieces were covered with glass and metal shards that actually adhered to 
the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many others lost even more than I did. I'm still able to produce my work and 
the fire art has attracted a bit of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was also very gratifying to see how this community stuck together. 
Everyone was helping each other out. We were borrowing other people's studios 
and kilns to try to replace what we had lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' primary pieces consist of contemporary, functional stoneware including 
pitchers, bowls, candlesticks, mugs and masks. Most cost between $8 and $25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually produce about 1,500 pieces a year to prepare for the Sawdust 
Festival," he said. "It's the only place where I exhibit my work." 
</P>
<P>
 While tending to favor solid, primary colors, he has recently begun 
experimenting with one-of-a-kind pieces that allow him more artistic 
expression, such as naturally firing pieces in bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a new kiln now and I'm working on some new ideas," he said. "I'm 
trying new techniques and experimenting to see what different kind of effects I 
can make."

EXHIBITS; '94 HOME SHOW HAS GADGETS GALORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California Home and Garden Show at the Anaheim Convention Center, 
today through Aug. 21, is celebrating its 40th year with the addition of new 
displays, a better-organized floor plan and a more interactive approach to some 
of the traditional show exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to feel like they are an active part of the show," said Pamela 
Heck, a spokeswoman for the event. "For instance, in the celebrity lifestyle 
rooms where we used to have the rooms roped off, we're having events that the 
public can be a part of, such as interacting with Engelbert Humperdinck during 
a (live) karaoke sing-along." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is a mixture of demonstrations and home-related products and 
exhibits. This year's roster of demonstrations includes talks on home repair, 
cooking, gardening, crafts and interior design. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Green Thumb Theater will include presentations by Jim Wilson of PBS' 
"Victory Garden" on Monday and Tuesday starting at 4:30 p.m. Other gardening 
topics include making the most of small yard space, outdoor crafts, composting 
and bonsai gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Better Living Theater will have daily demonstrations and workshops on 
home improvements. Subjects include furniture refinishing, repair and 
upholstery, adding a fireplace, and trends in paint color. For cooks, John 
Crean and Barbara Venezia of TV's "Home on the Range" will demonstrate their 
culinary talents on Aug. 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * New this year is the pet center with daily demonstrations on caring for a 
variety of pets. Today there will be talks on caring for rabbits. Dog training 
and pet therapy will be the topic on Sunday. A talk and demonstration on 
potbellied pigs will be featured Aug. 18, 19 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of a home built from straw, as was seen last year, a house made from 
a light-gauge steel frame will be featured. The frame is made of recycled steel 
and is termite-resistant, non-combustible and wind-resistant -- all factors 
appealing to fire-wary Southern Californians. A house of 1,664 square feet will 
be open during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors considering changing kitchen or bath appliances and accessories will 
have an opportunity to purchase new items at the kitchen and bath "garage sale" 
sponsored by the Easter Seal Society of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. There 
is a $5 admission separate from the main show that can be applied toward any 
purchase at the garage sale. All proceeds will benefit Easter Seals. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unique household items for sale at the show is a system for 
washing hands with the clean water from a toilet tank. The Zippy Rinse system 
saves water by using the clean water that fills a toilet tank to wash hands 
after a flush and recycling that gray water back into the toilet bowl. The 
concept is not new and is used in Japan and Australia and is available here. 
But unlike other systems which require replacing the existing tank lid with one 
that is modified into a sink and faucet, the Zippy system rests on top of 
existing lids or can be hung on a nearby wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken that concept and thrown an artistic flair into it," said Conrad 
Gonzales, one of the owners of the Zippy Rinse System. The system consists of a 
ceramic basin with a dolphin shaped faucet. A tube runs from the inside of the 
tank into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides saving water, it's a great way to get kids in the habit of washing 
their hands every time they use the bathroom," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 General admission to the Home and Garden Show is $7 for adults (ages 15 and 
older). Seniors (age 55 and older) are $5 ($3 on Aug. 15 and Aug. 16), juniors 
8 to 14 are $3 and children 7 and under are admitted free with a paid adult. 
Show hours are Monday through Friday 2 to 10 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
and Sundays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call (714) 978-8888 or 
(714) 708-1543.

 Q. We had beige carpet installed in our house three years ago, and since then 
we've noticed that the carpet has some black streaks in various spots where it 
meets the wall. A friend said that this was because of gaps in the construction 
where the wall meets the floor. Is that true, and what can prevent it? 
</P>
<P>
 B.F., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 A. This is a common phenomenon, says Mark Silverberg of New York Carpets in 
Anaheim. It can be caused by air circulating in and out of the house through 
small cracks at the base of the walls. When it's warm outside and cool inside, 
the heavier cool air pushes out through the cracks. At night, when the 
situation is reversed, cool air outside comes in. Because the carpet is butted 
up against the wall, it acts as a filter for this moving air. 
</P>
<P>
 With patience and a good spot cleaner, you can pull up some of these stains. 
Before you have carpet installed again, seal up any openings by applying a 
spray insulation where the walls meet the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Staining can also be caused when your carpet has become soaked during 
cleaning. If the water reaches the tack strip along the wall, it can cause rust 
stains in this area. To prevent this, you'll need to take care not to get the 
tack strip area too wet. 
</P>

 Q. We have some pine captain's chairs that are in need of refinishing, and 
while I'd like to do the refinishing myself, I'm not crazy about the messy job 
of stripping. Is dip stripping a good option for those who don't want to hand 
strip? 
</P>
<P>
 T.I., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. While dipping may give you the basic job of stripping away your old finish, 
hand stripping is still preferred, says Bob Espeland of Espeland Furniture and 
Antique Repair in Orange. Dipping often involves using water on the wood and 
letting it dry out, which can warp it. Water can also raise the grain and 
damage the furniture.  
</P>
<P>
 When stripping on your own, you can use a water-based stripping formula, but 
use an acetone-type solvent to rinse it down, because that dries immediately 
and doesn't soak into the wood. First apply the stripping formula with a rag 
and let the old finish bubble up, then scrape it off. Using a paint brush, 
apply the acetone rinse to clean the chairs, then lightly sand to prepare them 
for finishing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. Our two bathrooms have faux marble vanity tops that are ugly and outdated. 
I'd like to order new ones the same size in a better color, but I want to know 
how they're attached to the cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 L.G., Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 A. They're usually attached with a simple silicone adhesive, says Steve 
Johnson of Familian Pipe & Supply in Costa Mesa. Using a razor knife, try to 
get underneath and cut away the adhesive along the top as well as the splash 
shields. Remove the plumbing and the top should just pull off once the adhesive 
is cut away. When putting in your new top, be sure to sand away any leftover 
adhesive from the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I repainted the molding in my house with a semi-gloss enamel, and after it 
was done I found many brush bristles in the finish. Is this a sign my brush has 
had it? How do I get them out without redoing the job? 
</P>
<P>
 W.H., La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 A. Actually, loose bristles are often seen with new brushes, says Joe Ragsdale 
of Color Center Paint in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 There are often bristles that aren't held very well in the epoxy, and they're 
pulled out during painting. Many brush manufacturers recommend that you 
pre-wash your brush to get rid of any loose bristles. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to get rid of loose bristles in paint is to pull them off as soon 
as they come off on the surface you've painted. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, you'll need to lightly sand the area until they come off and 
repaint.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; OH, BABY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Through the eyes of a child, the world is a different place. A few of the 
items adults have created with infants and toddlers in mind Ceramic Imprints 
</P>
<P>
 No impression is more lasting than the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Pamela Cominetti, owner of Lasting Impressions by Pamela in Corona 
del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hand and foot imprints from babies as young as a day old, Cominetti 
creates porcelain keepsakes that can be displayed on a wall or shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the imprinted plate, Cominetti, who has a background in ceramics, 
presses the baby's hand and foot onto pre-rolled porcelain clay. The clay is 
then fired and glazed in one of her two studios, which are in San Diego and 
Corona del Mar.  
</P>
<P>
 The plate, about 5 1/2 inches in diameter, also has the baby's first and 
middle names on the front.  
</P>
<P>
 Cominetti got the idea for the plates while pregnant with her first child. 
When he was born, she made a footprint, then put it away for safe-keeping. 
After losing her job in sales with an employment agency about five years ago, 
she reassessed what she wanted to do with her career, and the plate idea came 
to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her business took off in earnest, Cominetti had given away many plates 
as gifts, so her work had already had exposure in Orange County. Three years 
ago, Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo offered her a contract to make the 
plates as thank-you gifts for the women who delivered babies at the hospital. 
So in addition to her studio customers, Cominetti and her staff make plates for 
all the babies born at Mission, "about 250 a month and climbing," she says. 
Cominetti gives each mother "bedside service," imprinting the babies when each 
is a day old. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, your child doesn't have to be a newborn; Cominetti makes plates for 
all ages. The prices of plates vary, but typically are about $30 to $35.  
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (714) 760-0909. Deluxe Throne 
</P>
<P>
 If you want your toddler to sit up and take notice during toilet training, the 
Sturbridge Yankee Workshop potty chair just might be what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of pine, the unfinished chair has an attached book rack to hold your 
child's favorite reading material. And an attached holder is just the place for 
junior's private stock of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 A removable plastic bowl is included, and the traditionally styled chair 
(about $55 plus shipping and handling) is paint-ready. It measures 20 inches 
wide by 11 inches deep by 21 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 To order or obtain a catalogue from Sturbridge, which is based in Portland, 
Me., call (800) 343-1144. Bathtub Safety 
</P>
<P>
 Bath time will turn into a baby elephant walk with these three products 
offered by That's Our Baby, a catalogue company started a little more than a 
year ago by Ismael and Maureen Anda of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Tubbly-Bubbly the elephant, splish-splashing in the tub will 
be good clean fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by Kelgar Inc. of Dallas, the Tubbly-Bubbly faucet protector (about 
$13) provides protection from injury and lures reluctant bathers into the tub 
with its bubble-bath dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 A further safeguard to bumps and bruises are the drain valve covers (about $7 
each) adorned with Tubbly-Bubbly's mug. They can also be used on walls, sliding 
glass doors and any place else in the house where protrusions could pose a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tub Temperature Mat (about $17) takes the guesswork out of getting the 
water just right. If the water is hot rather than warm, the words "Too Hot" 
will appear on the non-slip mat. The heat-sensitive bubbles turn blue when the 
water is a baby-comfortable temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 To order the Tubbly-Bubbly products or obtain a catalogue, call (800) 
400-2229.

REPAIRS; HOMEOWNERS TAP INTO ON-LINE RESOURCES FOR SCADS OF ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's the type of house that first-time buyers such as Jerome Vivona and 
Michelle O'Steen tend to choose: It's older than they are and needs new paint 
throughout, along with renovations of the bathroom and kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is tight, though, so the engaged couple decided to do much of the work 
themselves. But before they picked up a hammer or a paintbrush, they went 
straight to their personal computer, which they say has become their most 
useful tool for home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 When they need information about products, plans and services, or they just 
want to talk to people who have gone through projects they're wrestling with, 
they turn on their Compaq, log on to America Online and click into Homeowners 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of entries on electronic bulletin boards about cutting 
ceramic tile, choosing an architect or contractor, the latest on window 
replacements and dozens more relating to home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who send each other e-mail or place questions and comments on 
bulletin boards are neophyte do-it-yourselfers, professional contractors and 
all categories in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pros are not paid by the on-line services, although the 
contractors get free use of some premium services in exchange for being 
available at certain times of the day or week to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just feel like you always have some help," Vivona said. "There always is 
someone who has gone through what you are going through." 
</P>
<P>
 So far Vivona and O'Steen have found answers to questions about the types of 
paint that resist moisture, cover certain stains and clean easily. They've also 
obtained information about repairing kitchen cabinets and replacing 
countertops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a friend in the business who's willing to talk to you at any 
time of the day or night," Vivona said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a ringing endorsement brings a smile to Albert Clark, vice president of 
United Homeowners Assn., a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit lobbying group for 
the interests of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Since launching Homeowners Forum on AOL in early May, United Homeowners has 
averaged about 900 connections a day from on-line users, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as an idea to boost the association's membership has turned into a 
huge feeding trough for homeowners starved for information and discussions 
about how to keep their homes in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other big-time players in the on-line information competition, 
GEnie, Prodigy and CompuServe, have offerings similar to the United Homeowners 
forums on America Online. And each reports that usage regarding home renovation 
and repair has grown consistently in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 All that networking by remodelers has not escaped the attention of publishers 
eager to sell information to the on-line companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Handyman, a monthly do-it-yourself magazine published by a division 
of Reader's Digest Assn., formed a partnership in January with CompuServe to 
offer the expertise of its contributing editors, some of whom are professional 
contractors, and its library of information and building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be a nice combination of serving a need and a fun thing," said 
Ken Collier, an associate editor at the Family Handyman and the magazine's 
chief liaison with CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hachette Filipacchi, publisher of Home Magazine, has linked up with America 
Online to offer home-building plans that can be retrieved electronically by 
homeowners with PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eustace L. Greaves, a Brooklyn insurance broker, goes on-line to find 
information for clients who don't have a PC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prudential broker recently tapped into a CompuServe data bank for detailed 
plans to build a back yard deck, then gave the plans to a client. 
</P>
<P>
 Greaves uses his PC to publish a free newsletter for clients, and he often 
includes information he has obtained on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard and Judy Saydah bought a 70-year-old Dutch Colonial a year ago. The 
couple have spent many hours ripping out walls, tearing down paneling, pulling 
up carpets and laying tile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't quantify how much money I've saved by going on-line, but it has cut 
way down on the aggravation I would have had to go through if I didn't go 
on-line," Gerard said. 
</P>
<P>
 While replacing wallboard he discovered a Rube Goldberg-style plumbing 
arrangement that needed immediate attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got on-line, described what I was faced with, and within hours I had all 
kinds of responses on Prodigy," said Saydah, a commercial photographer whose 
do-it-yourself ability has grown steadily during the past year. "There is a 
camaraderie out there. It's the guy from Texas, whom you've never met, getting 
on-line with a guy from Jersey to offer the benefit of his experience in the 
same kind of problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "regular guy who is not a professional remodeler," Saydah has 
come to rely as heavily on his PC as he has on anything in his toolbox. Going 
on-line has become a necessity because the couple, who bought the house in a 
foreclosure auction, couldn't afford to pay a contractor for all the work that 
was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivona and O'Steen, both in their 20s, also had little hands-on experience 
with repairs. He is a cast member of "Guys and Dolls," playing on Broadway. She 
begins a stint with the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw all this information, and decided that if we could get help at any 
time of the day or night, we should try it," Vivona said. "It kind of becomes 
addicting." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just the people asking the questions and looking for ideas who 
get hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 In Allentown, Pa., Bruce Arnold has spent 22 years running his businesses -- 
one specializes in ceiling repairs, renovations and restoration, the other in 
fence installation. Nearly every day he logs on to Prodigy's Home Repair 
bulletin board to offer free advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent e-mail correspondence, he said answering questions "recharges the 
cranium" after hours at home dealing with record-keeping and other business 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that providing advice to homeowners is a way to "repay all the people 
who have trusted me and placed their most prized possession -- their home -- 
into my hands without knowing for sure if the completed project would be a 
thing of beauty or their worst nightmare come true." 
</P>
<P>
 For all of the apparent popularity of the bulletin boards, there is much 
potential audience growth. Of the estimated 25 million U.S. households with 
personal computers, only one-fifth are using an on-line service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of traffic on-line, but we're not hugely popular yet," said Mac 
MacLachlan, a manager of GEnie's Home Improvement Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in this business really is yet. A lot of people don't know about us. I 
don't think it has hit the public's mind yet. But it keeps growing, and people 
will find out."

APPLIANCES; TIPS TO KEEP AIR CONDITIONER HUMMING HAPPILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An air conditioner not only cools but also removes moisture, filters dirt and 
dust, and replaces stale air with fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 An air conditioner works on the principle that a liquid refrigerant absorbs 
heat (cools the room) when it expands into a gas, then gives off heat (to the 
outdoors) when it is again compressed into a liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Room air conditioners are labeled with an Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). When 
buying a new room unit, select one with an EER of 9 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips to ensure cost-efficient operation of a room air 
conditioner: 
</P>
<P>
 * Install the unit away from exterior doors to prevent drafts and 
cross-ventilation that will warm the cooled air. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put it in a window that receives little or no direct sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seal or weatherstrip all gaps around the air conditioner and around exterior 
doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure there are no obstructions, such as drapes or chairs, in front of 
the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct the vents upward to direct cool air to the upper part of the room. 
Cool air drifts down naturally because it is heavier than warm air. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you live in a high-pollution area, have a serviceman give the unit a 
chemical or steam cleaning at least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean or replace the filter monthly. To remove it, follow directions in the 
owner's manual. On many models, it is attached to the inside of the grille. 
Wash a reusable filter in detergent and water, then rinse and squeeze the 
excess water between newspapers and reinstall. Replace torn filters and 
disposable ones made of fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 * With the filter out, vacuum all accessible surfaces. If the aluminum 
evaporator fins are bent, gently straighten them with a plastic spatula. The 
fins are sharp. Be careful not to cut yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also clean the grille, using a soft cloth, mild soap and warm water. Don't 
use waxes or cleaners. Keep insect sprays away; solvents may corrode the 
grille. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some trouble-shooting tips: 
</P>
<P>
 Does not run: Check the outlet with a working lamp. If it does not light, 
replace the fuse or reset the circuit breaker in your home's central service 
panel. Do not plug any other appliance into the same circuit as the air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan runs but unit does not cool: Condenser fins on the outside of the unit may 
be clogged with dust. Vacuum them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unit cools poorly: Seal air gaps between the unit and the window, and between 
window sashes. Wash or replace a filter that is clogged with dust. Straighten 
bent evaporator fins. Check the ventilator door that lets in fresh air; it may 
be stuck in an open position. 
</P>
<P>
 Excessive noise: Tighten screws on trim or exterior panels. Secure window 
mounting supports. If the window rattles, insert wooden wedges or pieces of 
folded cardboard between the window and the window jamb. 
</P>
<P>
 Unit frosts up: Do not use the unit when the outdoor temperature is below 70 
degrees. Also check for a clogged filter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture drips into room: Tilt the cabinet toward the outdoors by a reading of 
a quarter bubble on a spirit level. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad odor: If there is a musty odor, use a wire to unclog the drain hole in the 
base pan. An oil or tobacco smell means the evaporator fins need to be 
vacuumed.

GARDENING; KNOW WHEN TO HARVEST VEGETABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's not much sense in growing vegetables if you do not harvest them at the 
right time. 
</P>
<P>
 No one needs to be told when to pick a tomato, but how do you know when to 
pick an eggplant? Or a cucumber, especially one that is puffed out at one end 
and skinny at the other? 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables that are grown for their shoots, leaves or roots generally taste 
best when they are young and succulent. If left to grow too long, shoots of 
asparagus and leaves of lettuce, chard, spinach and mustard become tough in 
texture and harsh in flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring-sown carrot, beet and radish roots can be pulled from the ground 
anytime they are big enough to eat. To get the most out of midsummer sowings of 
root crops, though, leave them in the ground to grow full size to eat through 
autumn and winter. Spring sowings become coarse and woody if left too long in 
the ground, but midsummer sowings grow slowly enough in autumn so that the 
roots stay succulent. (Potatoes are an exception; they are tasty young or old.) 
</P>
<P>
 Leafy vegetables that form heads -- Boston and iceberg lettuces, cabbage and 
Brussels sprouts, for example -- need to be left in the ground at least until 
their heads form. Gently squeeze the developing heads with your hands. They are 
ready when they feel firm, except for the Boston lettuces, which taste best 
when the heads are still slightly loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables that are, botanically, fruits are a bit trickier to harvest than 
those with edible roots, shoots or leaves. (Botanically, a fruit is a matured 
ovary, which means that fruits usually have seeds. Tomatoes, botanically, are 
fruits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some vegetable-fruits are harvested when immature, which is before their seeds 
are hard and ripe. In this category are summer squash, okra and beans, all of 
which are ready to eat as soon as the fruits are big enough to eat. You even 
can eat small squashes while they still have flowers attached. Peas are ready 
for harvest just as soon as they have filled out their pods. Snow peas, though, 
are ready when the peas just barely bulge within their flat pods. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppers, although often eaten green and underripe, become sweet, juicy and red 
or yellow (or purple or chocolate on some varieties) when thoroughly ripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant, cucumbers and corn are ready for harvest when they have reached full 
size, but before their seeds mature. Pick eggplants while their skins are still 
glossy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick cucumbers just as soon as their wrinkly skins puff out. What about those 
that are swollen at one end and skinny at the other end? These humorous-looking 
cukes result from fluctuating soil moisture or incomplete pollination. Take 
your choice: Pick when the skinny end is ready and the fat end is overripe, or 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter squashes are ripe when their skins are tough enough to resist 
indentation with a fingernail. There is no rush to harvest ripe winter 
squashes, because the fruits will store for months at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unopened flowers are the edible parts of broccoli and cauliflower, and this is 
how they should be picked -- before the flowers begin to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest vegetable to harvest is the onion. This vegetable is edible at any 
stage of growth, from the young tender shoots that push out of the soil in 
spring to the bulbs maturing beneath the flopped over, yellowing leaves.

DECORATING; TRADITIONAL QUILT PATTERNS SURFACING IN LOW, HIGH PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early American patchwork quilts were made of necessity from scraps of cloth. 
Then patchwork was elevated to an art as wall hangings. Now, century-old 
patchwork designs are being translated onto modern countertops, walls and 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quilt patterns are graphically interesting, and they mix well with so many 
periods of furnishings," Lili Lihn says, noting that there are more than 4,000 
documented patterns to work from. 
</P>
<P>
 Lihn, a consultant in New York, came up with an idea for a kitchen island 
countertop with traditional patchwork patterns at the corners. The counter is 
made of Avonite, an acrylic solid-surfacing material. The patchwork patterns, 
in black and almond on a white ground, include the nine bells and the fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lihn's work was intricate with expensive round cuts, simpler and less 
expensive patterns of squares and triangles could be equally effective on any 
solid surfacing material. Since most materials come in a wide range of colors, 
the variety of effects is almost infinite. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of a good pattern, Lihn says, is a mix of light, medium and dark 
colors. As with quilts, the most dramatic effects come with simple shapes, 
interesting color contrasts and pattern repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossville Ceramics of Crossville, Tenn., designs traditional American 
quilting patterns in porcelain tile for floors and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patchwork motifs are warm and friendly," says Barbara Schirmeister of New 
York, a design consultant who originated the patchwork idea for Crossville. 
Working through a local distributor, a homeowner can have a border or a 
complete floor made by Crossville from one of 17 American quilt patterns and 33 
color choices. Or the client may order a custom pattern, including an original 
patchwork design if the pattern is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dougherty, Crossville's vice president of sales and marketing, says 
patchwork tile patterns are being used in kitchens, family rooms and entryways. 
Prices range from $20 to $25 a square foot and $12 to $15 a running foot for a 
six-inch-wide border. A 3-by-5-foot "rug" might cost $300 using only straight 
cuts. As with the Avonite countertop, round cuts are significantly more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Schirmeister says an "area rug" set within a solid-color tile floor is highly 
effective. Patterned porcelain tiles can also be used as a center motif on a 
kitchen counter or as a border on a wall or floor. More unusual is a patchwork 
border around a fireplace or a center motif cut into a butcher block 
countertop. 
</P>
<P>
 Color can drastically affect the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "A monochromatic scheme is more subdued, great for a bathroom," Schirmeister 
says. "The same pattern in an entryway with three bold colors or with two 
highly contrasting colors such as red and white would be more dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple geometric patterns such as the star, log cabin and diamond quilt 
patterns, translate best for floor and counter. Others, such as the wedding 
ring and Sunbonnet Sue, can be used but are more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's Color Passion vinyl sheet flooring, available in 30 solid colors, 
can be worked by professional installers into many quilt patterns, says Thomas 
Hills Cook, the company's interior designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchwork has even spread to commercial settings. Interior designer Barbara 
Lazaroff used Italian ceramic tiles for patchwork floor patterns at Wolfgang 
Puck cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazaroff says she was looking for a pattern that wasn't too commercial and 
appealed to a broad spectrum of customers. She says patchwork quilts are an 
indigenous art form in the United States so they represent "roots" for many 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they are very comforting," she says, "like mashed potatoes and ice 
cream." 
</P>

LANDSCAPING; REAP BETTER ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nicest thing about energy-efficient landscaping is that it pays off year 
after year. 
</P>
<P>
 So if your home's energy bills seem high, check the landscaping to see if 
different plants or positions will help. 
</P>
<P>
 It should -- in winter, in summer and the in-between months. 
</P>
<P>
 Start now by considering the cooling comfort of a shady spot on a hot day. 
Trees can be used in much the same way to strategically shade a home from the 
most intense sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, in winter, the sun -- if not blocked by landscaping -- will supply 
free solar heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciduous trees are ideal for energy-efficient landscaping because they 
provide shade during the warmest months but allow the sun to reach and warm the 
house in winter, cutting heating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Arizona study some years ago reported that exterior shading 
was seven times more effective than interior cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, by horticulturists William Miller and Charles Sacamano, found that 
an outside wall in full sun transmits three times the heat of a shaded wall to 
the interior of a structure. It said an unshaded roof adds to the interior 
twice the heat of a shaded one. 
</P>
<P>
 A dense tree canopy was estimated to screen out at least 80% of the full-sun 
radiation and reduce the maximum high temperatures inside a typical house by 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar context, the Salt River Project, a major supplier of electricity 
in Arizona, advised customers that, after they mature, three trees planted on 
the west and southwest sides of a house can save $50 to $100 in summer-cooling 
costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Few areas of California receive as much sunshine as Arizona, but the basic 
premise will be correct for any climate. 
</P>
<P>
 In setting out landscaping plants, be sure to consider how shadows move 
throughout the year. While the sun always travels on an east-west arc, the arc 
varies as the sun moves from the southern sky in winter to the northern sky in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 About June 21, the summer solstice, the sun reaches its highest point. The sun 
is lowest about Dec. 21, the winter solstice. As days lengthen and seasons 
change, so do the shadow directions and lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Arizona study found that at noon in southern Arizona, a 
40-foot tree will cast a 58-foot shadow at the winter solstice on Dec. 21, a 
25-foot shadow at the spring and fall equinox (March 21 and Sept. 22) and a 
six-foot shadow at the summer solstice (June 21). 
</P>
<P>
 Heat or cooling will also be lost or gained through the home's building 
materials. Insulation will help, and sealing cracks around doors and windows is 
essential. But there always will be some conduction through the building, no 
matter how good the insulation and sealing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why properly placed plants are important in reducing the differences in 
inner-outer wall surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants also can contribute to energy conservation and living comfort by 
directing the airflow around a home. Windbreaks should be planted perpendicular 
to wind direction to reduce the wind's effect. Channel cooling breezes by 
creating an opening at appropriate places in the windbreak planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good strategy is to shade the outside air-conditioning unit. 
Well-placed small trees or evergreen shrubs will aid its cooling capacity and 
cut costs. Be sure not to block the discharge area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the idea of shading walls with vines sounds appealing, be sure to determine 
first if they can cause physical deterioration of the wall or become invasive 
to the house.

PRINTS CHARMING GIVE ROOM A HAPPY ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The print room is sort of an 18th-Century version of a vacation photo album. 
As an expert-level decoupage project, it's more labor intensive than an album. 
But from an artistic standpoint, it's far more interesting. And with today's 
quality color copiers, it doesn't have to be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The print room is just what it says it is: works on paper, such as engravings 
in paper frames, pasted onto the walls of a small room. 
</P>
<P>
 Print rooms were popular among English upper classes in the 18th and 19th 
centuries as a byproduct of their grand tours of Italy and France. Travelers 
would buy prints of famous places visited and hang them in a small room as a 
memento. Some sought professional help; others installed their own. London 
printers catered to the trade by selling sheets of paper frames and ornaments 
that could be cut out and glued around the prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Print rooms are believed to have been popular with early American immigrants, 
too. The evidence is a newspaper advertisement of 1784 in which a Philadelphia 
decorator offers to create print rooms and to "superintend the business of 
hanging rooms," according to Catherine Lynn, author of "Wallpaper in America," 
published by Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 "As practiced in the 18th Century, putting up a print room was a laborious 
process," author Donna Lang says. "I can't imagine anyone today being willing 
to sacrifice fine engravings. But the idea is too good not to be revived." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in her book, "Decorating With Paper" (Clarkson Potter, $24), she 
suggests using color laser prints of original artwork. Copy shops can reproduce 
print sizes up to 11 by 17 inches and can enlarge or reduce the image. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers & Co. in New York, through designers, sells paper borders and friezes 
that can be used for frames. Additionally, there's a $54 "print room sheet" of 
decorative paper ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, walls were glazed to create an antique surface before the prints 
were adhered. Hanging textured wallpaper is an easier way to create a suitable 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get tired of the look, you can strip the wallpaper," Lang says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Davis, a decoupage specialist in New York City, designed several print 
rooms as magazine projects and now sells print room kits for $55. One kit 
features 18th- and 19th-Century botanical illustrations and another has scenes 
of chinoiserie drawn from "The Ladies Amusement," a book published in England 
in 1762. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' kits include prints, frames, garlands, swags and rosettes plus 
instructions, adhesives and preservatives. There are enough materials to fill a 
6-foot by 8-foot surface lavishly or a larger area more sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The prints can be applied to any painted surface. In lieu of a print room, 
Davis suggests using the decorative technique in a small powder room, dressing 
room, bath or foyer. It also can be used on a headboard, table or folding 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even simpler than pasting up prints is to buy print room wallpaper. Fashon's 
Framed Botanical wallpaper, about $20 a roll, imitates a print room with 
botanical illustrations. Other companies such as Brunschwig & Fils also offer 
print room looks. However, wallpaper removes one of the main charms of the look 
-- its personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of the print room is that it is unique," Lang says, "totally 
original and very personal." 
</P>

USE PAPER AND GLUE TO GET THE HANG OF IT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Creating a print room wall can be a satisfying project for anyone with 
patience and some crafts experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success depends on having a variety of sizes and shapes," Dee Davis, a 
decoupage specialist, says."If you simply repeat the same size picture and 
frame, it is boring. Also, you need to have unequal empty spaces so that the 
effect is balanced but not too balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 When pasting prints onto a dark wall, paint the back of each print white so 
the dark wall won't show through and make the image look dirty, Davis says. For 
an aged look, photocopy old prints onto ivory or cream paper. If the print is 
on white paper, lightly sponge it with cold black coffee or tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Use the floor to work out placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to move the items around on the floor and to get the measurements 
right," says Donna Lang, author of "Decorating With Paper" (Clarkson Potter, 
$24). 
</P>
<P>
 For accurate placement on the wall, start with a non-oily removable adhesive. 
Once the prints are arranged, attach them with an adhesive that dries clear, 
such as white craft glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove excess glue with a damp sponge and use a smoother, a flat implement 
sold in wall-covering and hardware stores, to eliminate bubbles. If you want 
the look to last, seal the wall with latex polyurethane brushed on in light 
coats. Omit the sealer if you want easy removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wall color should complement the images," Lang says. "Choose a soft green 
or soft blue behind botanicals, or gray for black-and-white engravings, for a 
subtle effect. Place black-and-white illustrations on a red wall for a dramatic 
effect."

HORDES HOT-FOOT IT TO THE BEACH; WEATHER: IT'S COOLER ON PACKED SHORES, BUT 
EVEN OCEAN IS WARM. IT STILL BEATS INLAND AREAS, SUFFERING RECORD-HIGH 
TEMPERATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A second day of record-breaking temperatures and high humidity sent thousands 
of sweltering Orange County residents to the slightly cooler ocean Friday for 
an early start on what is likely to be a big beach weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Triple-digit temperatures were recorded in Anaheim, 102; Santa Ana, 100; El 
Toro, 101, and Fullerton, 100. Santa Ana's previous record for the date was 98, 
set in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 At the coast, cooler temperatures in the air nearly matched that of the water. 
From Huntington Beach to the San Clemente Pier, the air temperature hovered 
around 78 degrees, while in Laguna Beach the temperatures nosed into the 
mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the surf temperature Friday was an unseasonably high 72 to 73 degrees. 
Waves of two to four feet are forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the warmer ocean temperature is directly related to the heat wave, 
according to Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically there's no marine layer. That's why things are so toasty," he said. 
"The warm waters are not allowing a sufficient marine layer to build to keep 
things cool. " 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, about 30,000 people went to the shore, up from a typical 
Friday summer crowd of 20,000, according to lifeguard Lt. Mark Klosterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are just down to cool off," Klosterman said, "and most found 
their way to the water. It's what we call a palm-tree, Popsicle day: so 
pleasant you want to sit beneath a palm tree with a Popsicle." 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it here?" said Newport Beach lifeguard Lt. Eric Bauer. "Hot today, hot 
tomorrow and hot the next day. It's just plain hot!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach was extremely crowded for a weekday, Bauer said: about 
85,000, compared to the usual 40,000 to 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the high temperatures and humidity, everyone is playing hooky and 
ditching work and all that stuff to come here."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's muggy and it's hot," said Seal Beach Lt. Steve Cushman, looking forward 
to the increased crowds drawn by the heat and the Miller Lite Pro Beach 
Volleyball tournament, which began Friday and runs through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are behaving themselves," Cushman said. "I think it's so hot, people 
don't want to move around so much, and if they do, it's for the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Brack, the meteorologist, said there is little relief in sight for Orange 
County over the weekend. He predicted partly cloudy and muggy weather with a 
slight chance of thundershowers, mostly in the afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably remain fairly humid because of all the tropical moisture 
from Hurricane Ileana," now near the southern tip of Baja, Brack said.  
</P>
<P>
 The highs today are expected to range from the mid-70s at the beaches to the 
100s inland. The lows should range from the mid-60s to the lower 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having some unusually warm low temperatures," Brack noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles also had a record high temperature of 104 degrees Friday, while 
warm tropical air caused heavy thunderstorms, lightning, brush fires and a rare 
tornado warning in rugged portions of Riverside County, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning touched off a 480-acre fire in the sparsely populated Cactus Valley 
area near Hemet, at one point threatening about a dozen homes and a camp 
attended by about 150 children, said Bonnie O'Connell, a spokeswoman for the 
Riverside County Fire Department. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, those homes were no longer threatened, O'Connell said. A 
second fire, about a mile away, consumed about an acre, and a smaller fire 
believed caused by downed power lines destroyed a mobile home in the back yard 
of a house in southeast Hemet, O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of fires going on . . . small fires caused by the downed 
lines and lightning strikes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rains and isolated flooding damaged several houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A funnel cloud was reported at one point, though apparently it did not touch 
down, the National Weather Service said. A tornado warning was in effect 
through 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high temperatures included 104 in Los Angeles, 110 in Monrovia, 109 in 
San Gabriel, 107 in Woodland Hills and Van Nuys, 106 in Burbank, 105 in 
Montebello, 104 in Pasadena and 100 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Baruffaldi attributed the continuing heat to a high pressure system to the 
east, which is blocking normal air flows and allowing warm air to move up from 
the south and southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's preventing the usual cooler air from . . . coming off the ocean," he 
said. "Instead, we're having tropical air . . . which is warm to begin with. 
Since we're staying warm overnight, it doesn't take long for us to heat up and 
reach these record highs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms were expected to continue for several days in mountainous inland 
areas, although there was no threat of tornadoes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer David Ferrell contributed to his report.

STEPS TO RECOVERY; BALLET LESSONS MAY HELP GIRL STRICKEN BY STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-year-old Gabriela Cerda has dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer one day. 
</P>
<P>
 But last May the Huntington Beach girl suffered a devastating stroke after 
surgery that repaired a hole in her heart. She was unable to feed herself, walk 
or even sit up on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just three months after the stroke, "Gaby" is not only walking, she's 
beginning to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl has started taking lessons at the Imperial Russian Ballet 
School in Tustin. Although she still walks with a limp because of partial 
paralysis on her left side, and her speech has not returned to normal, she has 
made remarkable progress so far, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly a miracle," said Sophia Cerda, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerda said doctors at Children's Hospital of Orange County originally 
estimated that Gaby would have to stay there for three months after the stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than three weeks, however, Gaby had improved to the point where she 
was transferred to an in-patient physical therapy program at Tustin 
Rehabilitation Hospital. She was released a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very hard shock, initially," according to the mother, who said the 
stroke affected both sides of Gaby's brain. "Now we feel very, very happy 
because every day we see the progress, the little changes that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Wilfred T. Escober, a neurologist at Tustin Rehabilitation Hospital, 
described Gaby as a fun and friendly patient. Escober does not know if Gaby 
will make a complete recovery, but "she's going to make a lot more 
improvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa McLune, a physical therapist who worked with Gaby, said that studying 
ballet should help the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful for her," McLune said of the dance lessons. "I think 
it's also another way to express herself." 
</P>
<P>
 As Gaby practiced some basic dance moves at the ballet school Friday, tears 
welled up in the eyes of her father, Victor Cerda, 29. He recalled that after 
the stroke, Gaby could not even hold up her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just like a little baby, no coordination at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also watching the dance lesson was M. Rosario Brown, Gaby's teacher at Head 
Start Preschool in Huntington Beach. She described Gaby as a "very happy, very 
verbal" child who never missed a day of school until the stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a lovely girl," Brown said. "I want Gabriela back in my class. I 
requested her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet instructor Anna Vazquez said Gaby did "pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to help her a lot in her strength, flexibility and posture," 
Vazquez said. "And that's going to give her a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby was invited to the dance school after Nancy Fontaine, activities director 
at Tustin Rehabilitation Hospital, contacted the school's ballet principal, 
Maria Taggart. Fontaine had learned of Gaby's wish to become a dancer while 
helping the little girl create a journal about her medical progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggart offered to let Gaby take lessons at the school for as long as she 
likes. Taggart also predicted that Gaby will become "a very good dancer" one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a wonderful attention span because she's been able to overcome so 
much," Taggart said. "The one thing Gabriela has is enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping she stays with me a long time," Taggart added. "She's really quite 
a sweetheart."

FAMALARO EXTRADITION EFFORT BEGINS; COURTS: JUDGE SIGNS PAPERS AND FORWARDS 
THEM TO GOV. WILSON'S OFFICE. HE IS EXPECTED TO TAKE ACTION NEXT WEEK IN EFFORT 
TO BRING HUBER SLAYING SUSPECT TO TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA.

 Gov. Pete Wilson's office received extradition papers Friday that would force 
Arizona murder suspect John J. Famalaro to return to California for trial in 
one of Orange County's most notorious missing person cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson confirmed Friday that on 
Wednesday she signed papers that would move the former Lake Forest house 
painter from the Prescott, Ariz., jail where he has been held since last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested after Arizona authorities found the body of Denise 
Huber, a Newport Beach waitress, inside a freezer in the driveway of his 
country club home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should get things rolling," Anderson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The extradition documents were shipped Thursday to the governor's office. 
Wilson spokesman Kevin Herglotz confirmed Friday that the governor's legal 
staff has begun reviewing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everything is in order, the governor is expected to take action next 
week," Herglotz said. "He will process it just as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said the extradition papers 
detail evidence linking Famalaro to the crime and supporting his office's 
extradition request. The items include a photograph of the suspect, 
fingerprints, laboratory test results, a brief summary of the case and other 
evidence, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, is accused of kidnaping and murdering Huber, then 23, in 1991 
and carting around her nude, handcuffed body in a running freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect refused to waive extradition after his arrest last month in 
Arizona's Yavapai County. A hearing there is set for Aug. 29.  
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's defense attorneys in Orange County and Arizona could not be reached 
for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Huber, a UC Irvine graduate, vanished June 3, 1991, after her car had a 
blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway as she headed home from a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and local police launched a nationwide search for her. But Huber's 
whereabouts remained a mystery until Arizona law enforcement officers found her 
frozen body locked in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway 
of Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber died from nearly a dozen blows to the head; results of an autopsy and 
forensic tests may reveal whether she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Huber was abducted and taken to a Laguna Hills storage 
facility where Famalaro was living at the time. Authorities believe she was 
murdered there and possibly kept in an upright freezer before Famalaro 
purchased a chest-high freezer just a few days after her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said he does not expect the extradition request to speed up the hearing 
scheduled for later this month. Conley noted that the documents must still be 
forwarded to Arizona Gov. Fife Symington, a process that could take several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget this could all end tomorrow if he just waives extradition," 
Conley said. "We're just being prepared for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that although his office is moving as quickly as possible, 
his case will not suffer if it takes longer than expected to bring Famalaro 
back to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, if everything goes smoothly, it could take a month," Conley said. 
"But it's not a problem at all if it goes as much as three months." 
</P>
<P>
 A Yavapai County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman, Laurie Berra, said Friday 
that the orders issued in Orange County were required in preparation for the 
extradition hearing later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no doubt he is going back there," Berra said. "I wouldn't be 
surprised if he dropped the challenge before the hearing. It's pretty much 
known that he and his attorneys needed to buy a little more time to get things 
organized.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's all right because he's been upstairs (in the Yavapai County Jail) just 
hanging out and being very quiet."

CRIME BILL'S DEFEAT A BLOW TO LOCAL POLICE; BUDGETS: MANY AGENCIES WERE 
ANTICIPATING AN INFUSION OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT SIX 
YEARS FROM CLINTON'S LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In defeating President Clinton's crime bill, Congress added another quick and 
painful thump to cash-strapped local governments, and officials said they were 
surprised and angered by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars -- perhaps 
as much as several billion dollars -- over the next six years to state and 
local governments seeking to stem the tide of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no agency had factored crime bill money into its current budget, many 
were looking forward to an infusion of funds next year. Police, courts and 
jails would have been the primary beneficiaries of the bill's myriad provisions 
and programs. But agencies as varied as school districts, battered women's 
shelters, sports leagues for at-risk youths, and Boys and Girls Clubs would 
also have received new funding under the bill's crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill included funding for an estimated 240 additional police officers in 
Orange County, plus the chance for various crime prevention programs to apply 
for grants.  
</P>
<P>
 A disappointed Garden Grove Police Chief Stanley L. Knee said Friday that his 
city could have gained funding for 15 to 20 new officers, all of whom would 
have been put directly on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Literally, you would have seen more officers on the street and a decrease in 
response time to priority crime," Knee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in cities that were not expected to receive new officers from the crime 
bill, reaction was one of disappointment and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of being held hostage by the political process," said Huntington 
Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, who expected his city might have 
received extra money for officer training. "We need to get those resources on 
the streets, and we need the federal government to give us the resources 
necessary to police the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Chief Steven Staveley said his department wasn't expecting any 
new officers from the crime bill, but he too was upset by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unconscionable for the Congress to play politics when people are 
suffering in the communities," Staveley said. "It's another aggravation is what 
it is. . . . Those guys need to get their act together and do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior and Municipal court officials had also been eyeing the 
crime bill for a potential grant to help set up a courtroom that would deal 
exclusively with narcotic cases, otherwise known as a drug court. A key goal of 
the drug court program is to save money by preventing repeat narcotic offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Presiding Judge James L. Smith said he's not sure 
what affect the lack of crime bill funds would have on the plan, but he said 
the bill's defeat won't help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one alternative that would have been available to us that is not 
now available to us," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department figured it was entitled to about $50 million 
from the bill to add hundreds of officers to the force, fund more overtime pay 
for officers and pay for new police equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a slap in the face to everything we have tried to do to turn this 
city around," Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big losers include the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said that over the 
next six years California would have received about $1 billion to help pay for 
its prison construction program. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would have provided an additional $700 million over the next 
six years to house state prisoners who are illegal immigrants. Further, the 
bill would have authorized the hiring of 4,000 new Border Patrol agents over 
six years, some of whom would have been stationed along the California-Mexico 
border, said Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Washington watchers cautioned that much of the money that so many in 
California had been counting on may have been illusory from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tajima, a federal legislation analyst with the Los Angeles County chief 
administrative office, said that authorizing $33.2 billion in crime funds is 
one thing. But getting Congress to allocate the money is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a law passed by Congress in 1986 authorized federal funds to 
help pay the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants who committed felonies, 
an issue of tremendous import to California. But Congress has yet to 
appropriate funds for that program, Tajima said, and it is unclear what level 
of funding would ever have been available under the Clinton crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 And cumbersome rules and regulations may have kept many local agencies from 
ever receiving any funds, Tajima said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bill's major provisions, the $8.9-billion community policing 
program, requires local agencies to match federal funds on a minimum 75% 
federal to 25% local split. Communities that are willing to increase their 
share of the cost above 25% would be first in line to receive the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajima and others also noted that even if the funds were appropriated, the 
federal government would have to write new regulations, field applications, 
review the requests and then disburse the funds. That process, at best, could 
run well into next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police officials estimated their department could have qualified for 
80 new officers, but the funding requirements were troubling, Sgt. Bob Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, it's a tremendous project and undertaking," he said. "Certainly, 
it would be advantageous to a city such as Santa Ana, but I just don't know 
about the total monies we'd have to expend to obtain those 80 officers. There 
are still a lot of questions unanswered and uncertainties we face. We'll have 
to watch and see what happens the next time around." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, local youth organizations said they were eager to compete for 
some of the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just get tough on crime once it occurs . . . you have to prevent 
crime," said Danny Hernandez, executive director of the Hollenbeck Youth Center 
and founder of the Inner City Games. "We felt that we were going to get some of 
that money because groups like ours are in the trenches every day."

ACTIVISTS TAKING THEIR CASE TO SCHOOL BOARD VOTERS; POLITICS: OVERALL, 192 
PEOPLE INTEND TO SEEK ELECTION NOV. 8 IN 30 DISTRICTS. MANY WILL PRESENT 
SPECIAL-INTEREST ISSUES TO ELECTORATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Volatile issues that have dominated local headlines for the past year likely 
will remain at the top of campaign agendas in school board elections this fall, 
as many activists in those issues have placed their names on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ocean View School District, leaders of both sides of a fiery debate 
over the mainstreaming of disabled students have entered the ring. The leader 
of a recall movement in the Anaheim Union High School District is now running 
for the board. And in Saddleback Valley Unified, four of the 10 candidates are 
veterans of a contentious battle over the Mission Viejo High School mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 192 people filed papers with the Orange County Registrar of Voters by 
Friday's 5 p.m. deadline, making them eligible for the Nov. 8 election in 30 
different school districts. Because incumbents chose not to run for reelection 
in nine of the districts, the deadline has been extended until Wednesday at 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hottest races in the county are sure to be those in Ocean View and 
Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View, a K-8 district in Huntington Beach with less than 9,000 students, 
garnered national attention this spring when district officials went to court 
to oust a disabled 6-year-old from his mainstream kindergarten class, 
contending he was dangerous and disruptive. A judge eventually sent the boy, 
Jimmy Peters, back to class, where he was met by a flurry of protest by his 
classmates' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the roster of eight candidates for the three seats available on the school 
board include: Jimmy's father, an outspoken advocate for the full inclusion of 
special-needs students in regular classrooms; a parent who helped lead the 
opposition to Jimmy's return to the class; a woman who has worked closely with 
Peters on special-education issues; and a special-education teacher from 
another district. 
</P>
<P>
 And more people could join the fray before Wednesday's extended deadline 
because only one incumbent is running again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying that full inclusion is for every special-ed child is just as bad as 
saying that it's inappropriate for every child," said candidate Pam Walker, a 
mother of two who protested Jimmy's presence this spring. "I don't think that 
there's a cookie-cutter approach for inclusion. It should be looked at on an 
individual basis to see where it can benefit the child." 
</P>
<P>
 But on the campaign trail, Walker will face Peters and Karen Koelzer, two of 
the county's most active special-education advocates. The pair has worked 
together often in Ocean View and other local districts, filing dozens of 
requests for legal actions and hearings on behalf of various children. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Koelzer and Peters -- who tried in vain to get appointed to the school 
board when there was a vacancy last fall -- said in interviews Friday night 
that special education is a priority, but not their only concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got some real strong feelings other than special education," Peters 
said. "I feel that there should be more parental community involvement. I feel 
that the teachers are overworked and underpaid. I feel administrators are 
underworked and overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there should be a computer in every classroom rather than a fax 
machine in every principal's office," he said. "Fifty thousand dollars can 
provide a lot of textbooks and do a lot of things for children as opposed to 
providing legal services to fight little Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 Another crowded race comes in a growing South Orange County district, where 
two seats are up for grabs on Saddleback's fractured board, which has struggled 
over the past two years with a stubborn 3-2 split on most key votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two minority members, who are not up for reelection until 1996, often have 
aligned themselves with conservative Christian causes, and at least one of the 
10 candidates expressed sympathy for their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Susan Krumpotich, a Laguna Hills mother of two, said she agrees with 
the minority members in their opposition to the California Learning Assessment 
System, but splits with them on the issue of school prayer, which she does not 
support. Still, Krumpotich said her main concerns are emphasizing basic skills 
and keeping "New Age religion and Mother Earth-worship" out of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Saddleback field are four women who were leaders in the debate 
over the devil mascot at Mission Viejo High, which dates back seven years and 
was resolved this year with a student vote that led to the selection of a 
friendly-faced devil icon. 
</P>
<P>
 Arleen Brown, Sandie Gonzales, Kathy Kirlin and Pamela S. Rush all advocated 
the students' right to choose their own mascot, and were among those who pushed 
a lawsuit contending that the removal of the original devil mascot -- which 
Christian activists opposed -- violated the students' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see parental control returned," said Gonzales, who has two children 
in Saddleback schools and six more who were graduated from the district. "It 
has been said to me that the best way to get things done in Saddleback Valley 
is to work behind the scenes, behind closed doors. That doesn't work for me. As 
a parent, I have every right to know what the Board of Trustees know. As a 
trustee, I would make sure that the people who elected me know what I know. No 
secrets, no closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Another advocate of increased local control is Treva Brown, who led a failed 
effort to remove the novels "Ordinary People" and "The Great Santini" from the 
high-school reading list in Anaheim, then spearheaded an unsuccessful recall 
campaign against the trustees who rejected her first request. Now Brown is 
among nine people on the ballot -- including incumbents she tried to oust -- 
seeking three seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the books to be the main issue . . . when I saw the way that I 
was treated as a parent simply because I wanted to become involved, I thought, 
'This has got to change,' " Brown said. "I just think that parents should be 
better represented. (The trustees) just seem to be acting like tin Gods. No 
matter what a parent says, they're just going to do what they're going to do no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Although key issues have yet to be defined in many of the other races, several 
candidates in various districts said they were prompted to run because of their 
opposition to CLAS, the state's new standardized test which has generated 
massive protest over its approach, content, and implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate even listed himself on the ballot as Herb (No-CLAS) Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what we're trying to do is find out statistically how the schools are 
doing, there must be a less expensive way," Bill Goodwin, a civil engineer and 
candidate in Saddleback Valley, said of the test that cost the state about $26 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerryn L. Coffman, one of eight people vying for three seats in the Fountain 
Valley School District, also complained about CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents were not even informed of these tests, I don't think that is right," 
she said. "I think that you should be able to decided whether you want your 
child to participate or not, not to find out later." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen candidates gathered at the Registrar of Voters headquarters 
as the deadline approached Friday, eager to get the first glimpse of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As the list came cranking off the computer, Coast Community College District 
Trustee Sherry L. Baum let out a massive sigh as she saw she was among 18 
incumbents who face no opposition this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider this such an honor," said Baum, who was first elected in 1985 
after four years on a high school district board. "I feel like it's a kiss from 
God. I had always dreamed of the day I would be unopposed, be validated . . . 
and now it happened."

CITYSCAPES / AARON CURTISS: AT CITYWALK, THE REAL CITY INTRUDES ON THE 'FAKE 
ONE'; 'THIS IS MORE LIKE A TOWN. IT'S WHAT LOS ANGELES SHOULD HAVE BEEN YEARS 
AGO.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The sign is discreet, its wording polite, but its message clear. All the 
things your mother taught you are spelled out literally in black and white. 
Don't stare. Don't yell. Don't make fun of the way others speak, act or even 
pray. 
</P>
<P>
 Except this is not your mother's house. The rules adorn the sparkling gateway 
to Universal CityWalk, the privately owned urban streetscape in Universal City 
that is part theme park, part shopping mall, part town square. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk's code of conduct and its dutiful enforcement have helped the 
promenade earn a reputation -- whether deserved or not -- as a place to sample 
the pleasures of the city without the aftertaste of urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
 But last weekend reality intervened and the order of this shining city on a 
hill was disrupted by a group of kids who got into a fistfight outside the 
movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The tussle lasted about four minutes. No one was seriously hurt. Most 
pedestrians along the neon-accented walk saw nothing. It was the kind of thing 
that happens almost every day in almost every neighborhood, the kind of thing 
no one notices. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, it happened on CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 And folks noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, it was a sign that no place is safe. Others smugly noted that the 
ersatz city of glitz cannot ignore the real city around it. People will be 
people no matter how many rules, no matter how many shiny badges. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, say urban planning gurus, it was all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it opened last year, CityWalk inspired the laurels and the venom 
of urbanists, planners and architects. It was vilified as a surrogate for urban 
life, an Orwellian vision for the city. It was praised as the salvation of 
public space. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, its creators say, it was never intended as anything beyond a place 
to spend a few bucks and have a good time watching the parade that is Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sorts of places are rare in Los Angeles anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Los Angeles is not a real city," said Irish tourist Dominic Cogan as 
he watched his 2-year-old son Eanna dart in and out of the water jets in 
CityWalk's center court fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, turning to look down CityWalk's gently curving promenade, "is 
more like a town. It's what Los Angeles should have been years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in fact, a jumble of what Los Angeles actually was years ago. A bit of 
Hollywood here. A piece of Westwood there. A splash of Broadway here. It is, in 
a way, the Los Angeles of television -- recorded and dismembered and then 
edited back together into a fantasy world where Koreatown is next to Van Nuys 
and Griffith Park is somewhere between Torrance and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of vibrant, active landscape Angelenos have refused to let 
happen in their real world. If we build public places, the public might 
actually come. And they might bring their problems with them. And then, well, 
there goes the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Inc., the company that owns Universal Studios and CityWalk, built it 
anyway and people came. Apparently, the fake city seemed more real than the 
real city because they came in numbers no one expected: 10 million walked 
through the quarter-mile street in its first year, according to company 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, roughly 9,999,900 parked their cars, followed the rules and went 
home a few dollars poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little about CityWalk's restaurants or trinket shops that is 
inherently unique. The glowing fixtures and flashy buildings stay the same time 
after time, but the ever-changing ebb and flow of people is as fluid as a lava 
lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon and evening, the street was bustling with an eclectic 
mix of tourists and locals, a rare mix of young and old. Outdoor cafes brimmed 
with laughter and conversation. Never mind that a turkey sandwich and a Diet 
Pepsi cost $8.06. 
</P>
<P>
 A ring of empty strollers surrounded the center fountain, their pint-size 
occupants frolicking in the water under the constant gaze of a uniformed 
security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A glass of spilled milk in the center court was cleaned up within three 
minutes. People said "excuse me" and they smiled with real smiles. Most had not 
even heard about last weekend's fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had shrugged it off for what it was -- kids acting like punks. That 
kids act that way does not surprise the people who run CityWalk. There have 
been other fistfights on CityWalk and there will no doubt be more. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't guarantee any place to be safe and secure," said Larry Spungin, 
head of MCA Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a ghastly thing from a design point of view," said architect and 
urban designer Rex Lotery. "It has nothing to do with the city. It doesn't have 
anywhere near the richness of mix of what you'd find in a real city. It has the 
most obvious kind of commercialism, things that are really absolutely 
money-related." 
</P>
<P>
 Right on the money, said Spungin. Although CityWalk has become a whipping boy 
in design and architecture circles, it was never intended as a model of modern 
urban living. It was to be just another way to separate people from their cash. 
</P>
<P>
 A mall that doesn't look like a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban designer Doug Suisman tried to hate it for that. "All of my training and 
instincts led me to oppose CityWalk's basic premise," Suisman said. "Then when 
I got there I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. People were having a 
genuinely good time. They didn't seem like media-bombarded zombies." 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the media bombarded viewers and readers with reports of the 
CityWalk fight -- something that genuinely surprised Spungin and his 
colleagues. As he said, anytime you get people together, they'll act like 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, because it happened in this "bastion of artificiality," one architect 
mused, the fight somehow seemed more significant -- more real, if you will.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; $612,000 BEQUEATHED TO POLICE DOGS UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people like cats. Others birds. Yet others fish. 
</P>
<P>
 For LaVerne Wheeler, it was dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Balboa resident, who died in 1991, has bequeathed $612,000 to the Santa 
Ana Police Department for the purpose of purchasing police dogs, Julius Aarons, 
her attorney, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guide Dogs of America in Sylmar, which trains dogs for the blind, also was one 
of several beneficiaries presented with checks last week by the executive of 
Wheeler's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this has been a real surprise," said John Pettitt of the Sylmar 
organization. "We're going to buy a couple new vans and fix our buildings up. 
We've got four buildings, but some are in bad shape. One needs a new air 
conditioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Many may think it is odd that the antique dealer, who died at the age of 79, 
decided to give a chunk of her inheritance away to dogs, but Aarons said "she 
knew what she was doing" when she wrote her will. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't just give to dogs, she gave to people too," said Aarons, who was 
also Wheeler's friend. "She wasn't some crazy person standing on the corner 
giving out dollar bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler ended up giving $2.1 million to different charitable organizations, 
Aarons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler did not have any children, but she has two brothers in Northern 
California, who settled out of probate court, winning $25,000 each, after 
challenging the will, Aarons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other organizations that benefited from Wheeler's generosity included 
Greenpeace, an environmental group based in Washington, and a shelter for 
abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the Santa Ana Police Department media affairs division, to determine 
how the money would be spent, were not returned. TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY WILL PROTEST CARGO FLIGHT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach city officials are gearing up to protest an environmental impact 
report, commissioned by Orange County, that would lay the groundwork for 
allowing cargo flights at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The freight companies that want the flights -- United Parcel Service and 
Federal Express -- have argued that one flight each a day is reasonable. 
Opponents say that would open the door to gutting a hard-won settlement 
agreement in a lawsuit over noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1985 settlement agreement and a 1990 county Access Plan, no more 
than 73 noise-regulated aircraft may depart from the airport each day. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those are allotted to passenger carriers, in part because of a 
provision in the Access Plan giving preference to aircraft with 75 or more 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, UPS sought approval to run one flight daily from John Wayne 
Airport to its sorting hub in Louisville, Ky. While the county's environmental 
study on that request was in progress, Federal Express made a similar 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 The project under study would extend seat preference provisions to include 
cargo aircraft with a capacity of 55,000 pounds or more. It also includes a 
review of the UPS ground operations plan and reduction of the passenger 
aircraft limit by at least one flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The report evaluates the possibilities of shifting two, four or six 
noise-controlled passenger flights to cargo flights at John Wayne Airport. But 
that could threaten the legal settlement if passenger airlines chose to sue to 
get their flights back, Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had proposed the alternative of adding two noise-controlled flights 
for cargo carriers and routing them through the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station if the Federal Aviation Administration would allow it. That plan was 
rejected as infeasible because of federal prohibitions on commercial use at the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burnham said he believes the ban only applies to passenger carriers, not 
freighters. He added that it would probably be the best alternative for Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the analysis of El Toro should have been more extensive and 
that it shouldn't have been written off so quickly," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Newport Beach officials fear that allowing any cargo flights at John 
Wayne Airport would open a Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham's letter asks the county for a 30-day extension on the environmental 
impact report comment period so that the city may expand its argument. HOLLY J.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DONATIONS SOUGHT FOR SCHOOL THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This city's school board has endorsed building an amphitheater at Thurston 
Middle School and accepted a matching grant of $25,000 to help pay for the 
project, Supt. Paul M. Possemato said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board accepted it with a great deal of gratitude, frankly," Possemato 
said Thursday of the donation from the family of community activist Michael 
Pinto. The planned outdoor theater may eventually be named "the Pinto Family 
Amphitheater or something along those lines," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 While the campaign to raise the matching $25,000 is officially underway, it 
really began even before Laguna Beach Unified School Board meeting Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after word of the proposed amphitheater became public, 
Possemato said checks totaling $1,100 were received. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to test the ground in the area to make sure it is sturdy 
enough to hold the theater, Possemato said. The amphitheater would be built as 
part of a larger project to reconstruct classrooms that burned in the October 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is the idea of City Councilman Wayne L. Peterson, who suggested 
the amphitheater be built on an unused patch of ground behind the new 
classrooms and pitched in the first $100. If built in conjunction with the 
other project, Peterson determined the theater could be constructed for 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents wishing to donate to the project can send money to School Power 
Endowment Fund, Amphitheater, P.O. Box 19, Laguna Beach, CA 92652. LESLIE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved the reconstruction of a section of 
historic Los Rios Street, but the money for the work is not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's action this week calls for about $186,000 worth of work to 
reconstruct 1,800 feet of Los Rios Street and install new drains, according to 
city engineering officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners also approved closing a narrow L-shaped intersection between 
Mission and Los Rios streets to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tomlinson, the city's planning director, said the road improvements 
probably won't be made for a few years. He said the city has money to pay only 
for design work. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, which must give final approval, is scheduled to consider the 
project Sept. 20.JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; VANDALIZED CLEANUP BOAT TO BE REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Harbor will get a new cleanup boat because vandals took the old one on 
a joy ride that left it damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boat basically was destroyed," Harbor Inspector Wes Armand said."It was 
actually banging around on the pilings under the pier. Whoever took the boat 
ended up running the boat aground." 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel is an open, 18-foot aluminum skiff the city has used since 1984 to 
keep the harbor waters clean. It made rounds of the bay's 32 miles of shoreline 
twice daily and its operators answered radio calls to pick up floating debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aluminum, Styrofoam cups, candy wrappers, residue from boat maintenance, if 
it floats, it ends up in the water," Marine Safety Lt. Jim Turner said. "They 
skim up film and debris. If it's on the surface, they've had to pick it up 
sometime, someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are at a loss to explain why anyone would take the boat. But Armand 
said "the key was in a location where someone had to know a little bit more 
than the general public to get (it)." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was done when vandals, under cover of darkness and fog early the 
morning of June 25, stole the boat from the Balboa Yacht basin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Marine Department report, some people fishing from Newport Pier 
called police to report hearing the boat's engine on the water. By the time 
they saw the boat, it was under the pier, "submerged and breaking up," 
according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other witnesses told marine officers that "four wet people ran past them 
through the B Street parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Armand said the new $9,700 boat, which the City Council approved purchasing, 
should be in service within three weeks.HOLLY WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOLS OFFICIAL SEEKS HEARING DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An administrator in the Orange Unified School District who stands accused of 
tolerating sexual harassment in her office has asked a court to force the 
district into taking action in her case or dropping the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle filed legal documents this week in Orange 
County Superior Court to order the district to set a hearing date so the issue 
could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelle is one of three administrators who were accused of sexual harassment 
by the Board of Education last year. A hearing for one of the administrators is 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelle's lawyer, Dale Gronemeier of Pasadena, said he filed the documents on 
behalf of Capelle to protect her right to a speedy hearing. "The charges were 
filed in December and despite repeated demands to proceed, they haven't 
appointed a hearing officer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District trustees voted to demote Capelle and Transportation Director Howard 
Mason in December, 1993, when the allegations of sexual harassment were made 
public. They fired former Deputy Supt. Richard L. Donoghue, who was accused of 
touching employees, using sexually offensive language and distributing lewd 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 All three cases are were appealed and the administrators filed a $20-million 
suit against the district contending defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court is expected to hear Capelle's petition Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelle was unavailable for comment and the district's attorney, Spencer E. 
Covert, did not return telephone calls. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; NAVAL BASE MAY CUT FIRE ENGINE, 5 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some firefighters at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station said a proposal to 
reduce the size of the base's Fire Department could compromise safety. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of Navy officials is scheduled to arrive in Seal Beach next week to 
help determine whether Fire Department staffing should be reduced from two fire 
engines to one. Such a cut would force the layoffs of five of the department's 
20 firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Montoya, one of the firefighters scheduled for layoff, said the 
proposed cutbacks would reduce the department's ability to respond to 
emergencies at the 5,000-acre base where munitions are stored, repaired and 
transported on and off Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Having one fire engine would restrict the department's ability to help with 
mutual aid calls in neighboring cities and would prevent firefighters from 
responding to more than one call at a time on the sprawling base, Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of reducing fire personnel surfaced more than a year ago when the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Command conducted a survey of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a complex formula that considered fire risk, the kinds of weapons stored 
at the base and other factors, the engineering command concluded that the Fire 
Department could be reduced to one engine without jeopardizing safety, said 
Richard Williamson, base public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation was passed along to weapons station Cmdr. Joel Steadley, 
who will make the final decision on the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadley then asked base Fire Chief L.J. Bach to respond to the engineering 
command report. Bach prepared a report that advised Steadley against making the 
cuts until more studies are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach said in an interview this week that a major disaster like an earthquake 
could leave the base isolated for several days, making the Fire Department 
responsible for responding to all emergencies. He noted that the 
Newport-Inglewood fault runs through the base. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that several buildings on the base do not have fire sprinklers. 
Another potential hazard is the former Rockwell/NASA buildings once used to 
build moon rockets. These structures have open bays that would allow flames and 
smoke to spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fire engines would be helpful in responding to emergencies at the Anaheim 
Bay piers because one engine could be used to pump sea water, Bach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having one engine also would limit his department's ability to handle 
emergencies off the base that involve trains and trucks carrying Navy 
munitions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Bach's report, Steadley asked for the Naval Facilities Engineering 
Command to conduct a second study of the Fire Department. That study will begin 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson and Bach said there is a good chance the command might make a 
different recommendation this time around because inspectors now use a more 
specific criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The new criteria takes into account the amount of water pressure from fire 
hydrants and whether major buildings have fire sprinklers, Williamson said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; BUSINESSES LOSE BID TO PUT UP SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of several businesses in the Savi Ranch commercial area were denied 
permission to display temporary signs to direct customers to their 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Maniscalco, who owns a tire store on Savi Ranch Parkway, said customers 
can't find his store because there are no signs on the major streets leading 
into the commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to install signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco had asked the City Council to relax the city's strict sign code and 
allow him to place signs on Yorba Linda Boulevard and Savi Ranch Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the City Council approved a plan to add the phrase "auto service 
center" to several existing signs in the Savi Ranch area, but denied business 
owners permission to put up their own signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally against our sign code," said Pat Haley, community development 
director. "As soon as we authorize (a variance) for (Maniscalco) every other 
business will want to put up temporary signs. That's totally contrary to the 
code." 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco and other business owners say their businesses will suffer unless 
they are allowed to put up signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are hurting real bad," Maniscalco said. "If I can't tell people 
'I'm here,' I'll be out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also denied for now a request to allow auto-related businesses to 
advertise on the city-owned electronic Auto Plaza sign that is visible from the 
Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley said the city has a contract with the one auto dealer located in the 
auto plaza that limits who may advertise on the sign. Caltrans also has a say 
in advertisers because the sign is visible from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not untangled the legal agreements regarding the sign," Haley said. 
"We are working on it and when we have figured them out, we will go to Caltrans 
to see if we can use the sign (for other advertising)." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Spectators Willis and Stella McComas,20-year Huntington Beach residents who 
watched jumping events Friday, were impressed with the riders and their horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've been here to watch the jumpers," Stella McComas 
said. "It's a real thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the event has moved to the park, adjacent to the 
equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've refurbished the disc golf course into basically one of the finest show 
grounds in Southern California," said Tom Gallagher, production event 
coordinator. "This is a beautiful atmosphere -- the ambience, the trees, the 
tents -- and no dust." Gallagher said the event has attracted the best horses 
and riders in the sport to compete for prizes in excess of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said there are more than 300 horse and rider teams -- 100 more 
competitors than last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Riders and trainers agreed that holding jumping events on the grass heightens 
the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitor Valerie Parr of Santa Ana, one of the top amateur riders in 
Southern California, said that the grass arena and the prize money are the main 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Parr will be among about 30 competitors in today's $10,000 First Interstate 
Bank Junior/Amateur Owner Jumper Classic, riding her horse, "Last Laff." 
</P>
<P>
 Competitions are from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days, with opening ceremonies at 
noon. Sunday's highlights are the high jump competition and the "Let's Make A 
Deal" jumpers, starting at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by the Huntington Beach Art Center Foundation, Central 
Park Equestrian Center, the city, and GTE Directories Corp. The park is off 
Golden West Street, between Talbert and Ellis avenues, next to the equestrian 
center. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; QUADRIPLEGIC AWAITS HOME OVERHAUL OK

 Darleen Dano has not seen her home of 27 years since a car accident in January 
broke her spine and permanently disabled her. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her family are claiming that her homeowners association is stalling 
the approval of structural changes that would allow her to move back into her 
townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months of operations, counseling and rehabilitation have prepared her 
for life as a quadriplegic. Her release from St. Jude Medical Center in 
Fullerton is scheduled for Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Dano will be forced to stay at the hospital or a nursing home, however, if she 
is not able to modify her two-story home in Highland Greens, a 375-house 
development off Beach Boulevard at Cameron Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative brought informal drawings of the proposed changes to the July 13 
meeting of the homeowners association, and was told the family would receive a 
response in three days, Dano said. 
</P>
<P>
 But time has passed, and no one from the association's office has returned 
numerous calls on Dano's behalf, according to Dano and her case worker, Nancy 
Ekberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been instructed by corporate counsel to say, 'No comment,' " said 
Mark Winsberg, property manager for Highland Greens Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Powers, the attorney with Fiore, Nordberg Walker & Racobs who is 
representing the association, sent the same message through her secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The predicament is wearing, said Dano, a 59-year-old grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very stressful in my situation because I'm having enough problems 
dealing with my conditions without having to worry about this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ekberg, a case worker with Resource Opportunities in Costa Mesa, said timing 
is crucial because the contractors need at least two weeks to make 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise, this lady's going to a nursing home," Ekberg added. 
</P>
<P>
 The association apparently sent a registered letter to Dano at her home, but 
nobody has been home to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dano's former son-in-law, Brian Bridgford , said a board member called him and 
read him the letter. The association apparently wants to see professional 
drawings and samples in place of the informal plans Bridgford had 
presented.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY WINS APPROVAL OF 'PIER PLAZA' PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city received final approval to transform the beachfront into an 
attractive gateway to the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission Thursday approved the city's plans for the 
$3.4-million "Pier Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to build a plaza area next to the pier with a new boardwalk, a 
public amphitheater, a lawn area, restrooms and showers, a concession building, 
bicycle parking and redesigned public parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ugly entry to the city's No. 1 monument," said Ron Hagan, community 
services director. But with the plaza improvements, including palm trees, 
colored concrete and benches, "it will be a grand entryway onto the pier." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission officials recommended that the boardwalk be a maximum of 17 
feet to minimize encroachment onto the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the city originally requested a 27-foot-wide boardwalk to 
accommodate foot and bike traffic and emergency vehicles. But plans have been 
scaled down to a 24-foot path. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-foot path was approved, but the actual encroachment onto the sand is 
limited to 21 feet, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan, along with police, fire and lifeguard officers, told the Coastal 
Commission that a wider path is needed for emergency vehicle access as well as 
to separate bicyclists and skaters from pedestrians to reduce accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is the main issue," said Thomas F. Poe, division chief and fire 
marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who is a member of the Coastal Commission, 
called the decision a "good compromise because it will certainly reduce the 
loss of sand, but provide for public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson added that she is pleased the project is finally becoming a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bernard, a board member of Huntington Beach Tomorrow, said the citizens' 
group favors a 17-foot-wide path to limit encroachment onto the sand. "We need 
to preserve the sandy beach area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the next step is for the City Council to approve drawings, plans 
and specifications to put together a bid package by next spring. Next summer, a 
contractor is expected to be selected with construction beginning in the fall 
of 1995, he said. Completion is planned for mid-summer of 1996. DEBRA CANO

QUAKE DOUBLES USE OF TRAINS, SURVEY FINDS; TRANSIT: MANY OF THE NEW RIDERS CITE 
DAMAGED FREEWAYS AS THEIR REASON FOR TAKING METROLINK. BUT WHITE MALE 
PROFESSIONALS ARE STILL MOST FREQUENT USERS. 
</P>

 Southern California's commuter trains carry twice as many passengers now as 
before the Northridge earthquake, and the average rider is a well-heeled white 
male professional from the suburbs, according to results of a survey released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women and minority group riders increased only slightly, if at 
all, in the past year, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the Metrolink system's 15,500 daily riders began taking the 
periwinkle and white trains after the January quake. Many of those new 
customers -- one-sixth of the current passengers -- identified quake damage to 
the freeways as the reason they ride Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink passengers overall -- the majority of whom receive subsidies from 
their employers to take the train -- continue to report high satisfaction with 
the 2-year-old train service, although some complain of high fares, delays and 
poor connections at their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results, based on a Metrolink poll of 4,527 riders in June, show 
little change in the typical passenger profile since a similar study last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some official attempts to diversify ridership, the trains still 
attract affluent white-collar workers -- mostly male executives and managers -- 
from households with an average annual income of $64,450. More than half (55%) 
receive subsidies from their employers to ride the trains. The subsidies 
average $58 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The socioeconomic status of Metrolink customers continues to stand in stark 
contrast to that of the region's bus users, who are overwhelmingly members of 
ethnic minority groups with household incomes of less than $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That disparity was recently brought into the debate over the decision to raise 
bus fares for the first time in six years. Metrolink officials slashed fares 
for several months as an earthquake-relief measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveyed riders gave Metrolink high marks for service, personal safety and 
professional courtesy from staff. They said they are under less stress because 
they no longer have to drive to work. Three out of five passengers surveyed had 
commuted alone by automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 75% of riders -- even those who live within five miles of their 
stations -- drive alone to the train station, which means they "cold start" 
their cars each workday morning. Cold starts are the single biggest contributor 
to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which Metrolink officials said has a margin of error of less than 
2 percentage points, found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly half of all passengers began using the system after the January 
earthquake. About 48% of these new customers identified the temblor as their 
reason for turning to the trains. They account for one-sixth of the current 
ridership. On the Santa Clarita line, three out of four passengers traced their 
ridership to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 52% of riders are men -- the same proportion as last year -- while 48% of 
passengers are women, up from 45%. (In last year's survey, 3% of respondents 
did not identify themselves as male or female.) 
</P>
<P>
 * As was the case last year, whites make up two-thirds of those who ride the 
trains. The proportion is even higher along some routes, such as the Ventura 
line and the recently opened Orange County line (80% for both) and the Santa 
Clarita line (74%). 
</P>
<P>
 * The percentage of African Americans using Metrolink rose to 9.4% this year 
from 7% last year. Latinos registered a tiny rise, from 13% to 13.1%. Asian 
American ridership dropped from 13% to 9.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average household income of $64,450 exceeds last year's figure by more 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three out of five riders formerly drove alone to work every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average age of riders is 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most frequent complaint is that schedules are inflexible or service is 
infrequent. Riders also complain of delays, seating problems and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Still, 61% believe the Metrolink to be a better overall value than their 
former way of getting to work.

TWO DRIVERS HURT IN CRASH AT INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two drivers were critically injured Friday in a three-car collision at the 
intersection of Dale Avenue and Ball Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Louis O'Keefe, 33, of Garden Grove and Albena Phillipina Bosch, 58, of 
Stanton were reported in critical condition late Friday at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A third driver, Viora Tira, 42, of Anaheim was treated for moderate injuries 
to her legs at West Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that shortly after 7 a.m., O'Keefe failed to stop at a 
red light at Ball Road and was struck by Tira's car, traveling south on Dale. 
The impact knocked O'Keefe's car into Bosch's. 
</P>
<P>
 No citations were issued and the investigation is continuing, police said.

JUDGE ORDERS TESTING OF 3 TEEN-AGE KILLERS; CRIME: REPORTS WILL DETERMINE 
WHETHER SLAYERS OF STUART A. TAY RECEIVE LIFE IN PRISON OR LESSER SENTENCES IN 
THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY. 
</P>

<P>
 A judge on Friday ordered three teen-agers to undergo diagnostic testing at 
the California Youth Authority before they are sentenced for their roles in the 
1992 New Year's Eve murder of honor student Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary will use the reports to 
determine whether the teen-agers should be sentenced as adults -- and possibly 
face life in prison -- or as teen-agers, in which case they could be released 
when they turn 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The three teen-agers, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Kirn Kim, 18, and 
Mun Bong Kang, 18, both of Fullerton, were among five youths who killed Tay 
because they believed he was going to double-cross them in a planned robbery of 
a computer parts dealer. The robbery never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life in prison, while Acosta and 
Kang face maximum terms of life in prison with no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, 17, was beaten with baseball bats and a sledgehammer before his 
assailants forced him to drink rubbing alcohol and taped his nose and mouth 
shut. He was then placed in a shallow grave in a Buena Park back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Robert Chan, 19, a onetime candidate for class valedictorian at 
Sunny Hills High School, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for 
orchestrating the murder that involved four other teen-age accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth teen-ager, Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton admitted his role in the 
slaying and agreed to be the prosecution's chief witness against his former 
friends. In exchange, the Orange County district attorney's office prosecuted 
him as a juvenile, meaning Choe will be released from the California Youth 
Authority when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The case gained nationwide attention as an example of juvenile violence and 
was especially shocking because most of the defendants were college-bound 
students who came from supportive homes.

ANAHEIM CANDIDATES REAP BIG-DONOR GIFTS; POLITICS: DISNEY CO. OFFICIALS, ANGELS 
OWNER GENE AUTRY AND THE HEAD OF A FIRM WITH AN EXCLUSIVE TRASH-HAULING 
CONTRACT ARE AMONG THE CONTRIBUTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California Angels owner Gene Autry, who stopped making municipal campaign 
contributions in 1992, has resumed writing checks to City Council candidates, 
according to financial disclosure records reviewed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also endowing the campaigns of aspiring council members are Walt Disney Co. 
officials who want to expand Disneyland, a trash mogul who recently was awarded 
an exclusive waste disposal contract, and other companies that do business with 
local government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where council and mayoral candidates spent more than $700,000 in the 
last election, sizable campaign treasuries are seen as pivotal in capturing two 
council spots and the mayor's seat. So far, 20 candidates have taken out 
nomination papers for the council slots, and two candidates -- incumbent Tom 
Daly and retired businessman Curtis A. Stickler -- have filed to run for mayor. 
The filing deadline for council candidates is Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball businessman Autry has contributed $1,000 each to two council 
challengers -- Anaheim business owner Paul V. Bostwick and mortgage broker and 
former city planning commissioner Bob Zemel, according to campaign finance 
records. That is the maximum a candidate can receive from an individual source 
under a new city campaign-financing ordinance passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry has declined to comment on the political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Autry halted a longstanding practice of contributing to local 
politicians, explaining publicly that because of the recession he simply did 
not have enough money. But city officials viewed the drying up of funds as a 
measure of Autry's resentment over a decade-long legal dispute with the city 
over commercial development in the parking lot in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring Angels officials began making overtures to city officials that 
they were dissatisfied with the aging Anaheim Stadium, which they share with 
the Rams football team. Angels officials have told city officials they want a 
baseball-only stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceeding Autry's political donation totals was William C. Taormina, head of 
Taormina Industries, Inc., finance records show. The company, which has held 
disposal contracts with the city since 1948, recently won an exclusive 15-year 
franchise for solid waste disposal in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But contributions to local politicians are nothing new for Taormina. Since 
1984, the business executive has pumped more than $75,000 into local election 
campaigns -- more than any other contributor in that same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, Taormina has divided $3,275 among nine office-seekers, 
according to finance records. Taormina made $500 donations to six challengers: 
Keith Brian Olesen, Leonard Lahtinen, Paul Bostwick, Bob Zemel, Sharon Ericson 
and Loretta Sanchez Brixey. Also on the donation list was: Phyllis Boydston and 
Mayor Tom Daly, who both each received $250, and incumbent Frank Feldhaus, who 
got $225, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 30-year business relationship with the city, Southland LifeFleet, Inc., 
a private ambulance company, also contributed to candidates. The company's 
$1,950 in donations follow a city Fire Department announcement that it is 
considering taking over city ambulance services. The city Fire Department is 
still evaluating such a prospect, but is expected to make an announcement 
within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past six months, the ambulance company has given $500 to Daly, Zemel 
and Leonard Lahtinen, and another $450 to Feldhaus. (The Southland LifeFleet 
was recently purchased by CareLine Inc.) 
</P>
<P>
 Planning a $3-billion Disneyland resort in Anaheim, Disney officials have also 
lined up to help out candidates financially. Disneyland's director of 
development Douglas M. Moreland and Ron Dominguez, a company vice president, 
contributed $250 each to Daly and $225 each to Feldhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large campaign contributors, records show, are golf companies that may 
be vying for a possible contract if the city decides to privatize its two 
municipal courses. Daly's campaign coffers grew by $1,250 from two golf firms. 
Feldhaus picked up $1,125 from three different golf companies. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim firm that was previously rejected in a bid to open a facility in 
the western part of the city last year also made substantial political 
contributions. Pick Your Part Auto Wrecking presented a total of $1,475 in 
donations to four candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Finances records show the firm contributed $500 to Lahtinen, $475 to Feldhaus, 
and $250 each to Daly and Zemel.

MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATH OF EX-GIRLFRIEND'S YOUNG SON; COURTS: JUDGE RULES 
THAT EVIDENCE SHOWS BRIAN LAUDENBACK COULD HAVE CAUSED THE CHILD'S INTERNAL 
INJURIES AND BLEEDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old man was bound over for trial Friday on charges that he killed 
his ex-girlfriend's 22-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing, Municipal Judge Craig Edward Robison found that 
prosecutors presented sufficient evidence showing that Brian Laudenback of 
Newport Beach could have inflicted enough force on Tyler Jaeger, causing the 
toddler to bleed to death from internal injuries. Laudenback is scheduled to be 
arraigned in Superior Court on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Laudenback inflicted some sort of trauma on the boy 
on March 25 while he was baby-sitting Tyler for the child's mother, Karey 
Jaeger, who was away at work. Photographs of Tyler after his death, with deep 
bruises on his face and buttock, were introduced as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Aruna Singhania, who performed the autopsy, testified that the child's 
brain, abdomen and buttock had hemorrhaged. The autopsy also showed two 
fractures in his skull, two broken ribs and cuts to his liver and pancreas, 
Singhania said. Many of the injuries occurred within hours of Tyler's death, 
she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback's attorney, Public Defender Sharon L. Petrosino, implied during the 
hearing that Tyler died of injuries he suffered from a fall March 18. On that 
day, the child was taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian for treatment 
of a large bump on his head, which turned out to be a fractured skull. 
Laudenback, who was also baby-sitting Tyler then, told Jaeger and hospital 
officials that the toddler hurt himself when he fell off a picnic table in the 
patio. Officials said the injuries were consistent with a tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Singhania testified that Tyler's numerous injuries simply could not have been 
caused by a fall from a table, which was two to three feet off the ground. 
Also, she said, hospital records showed that he had one skull fracture from 
that fall as opposed to the two at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Laudenback, in a series of interviews with police, 
said Tyler had been sick on the morning of March 25, vomiting twice. Later that 
day, he found the boy on his back, his hands jerking and his eyes half-closed. 
He then unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate the child, he told police. 
Tyler was taken to Hoag Hospital, but doctors could not revive the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback also told police he had spanked the boy the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrosino, however, said her client might have inadvertently hurt Tyler when 
he attempted to give him cardiopulmonary resuscitation. "What we are saying is 
that Brian's action did not result in the intentional killing of this child," 
Petrosino said.

RICHARD (DICK) ABRAMS; LOCKHEED EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard (Dick) Abrams, a 14-year Lockheed employee who served as flight test 
director for the company's top secret "Skunk Works" facility in Palmdale, has 
died. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams, a resident of Los Angeles' Cheviot Hills area, died Thursday at a 
Washington, D.C., hospital of what Lockheed described only as a brief illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Abrams joined the then Burbank-based Skunk Works -- Lockheed's 
Advanced Development Co. -- as a senior engineer. From 1989 to 1991, he served 
as flight test program manager for Lockheed's YF-22 fighter plane, supervising 
test flights of the aircraft in the Antelope Valley at Edwards Air Force Base 
and the company's Palmdale facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams was appointed flight test director for the Skunk Works in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In April of this year, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
awarded him its Chanute Flight Test Award in recognition of his work in flight 
testing the F-117 Stealth Fighter and the YF-22A Advanced Tactical Fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his tenure at Lockheed, Abrams worked at the Federal Aviation 
Administration and at Rockwell International's B-1 division. He also spent a 
decade with the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his professional affiliations, Abrams was a member of the Society of 
Flight Test Engineers, the Flight Test Historical Foundation and the American 
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In addition, he authored the book 
"Corsair at War." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Abrams received a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He later received a master's degree in systems 
management from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams is survived by his wife, Rochelle (Shelly) Abrams; his mother, Gertrude 
Abrams; and a sister, Barbara Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. at Hillside Memorial Park, 
6001 Centinela Ave., Los Angeles.

MAN DROWNS WHEN CAUGHT IN RIPTIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 48-year-old man from Anchorage, Alaska, drowned in the ocean off the Dana 
Point jetty Friday while swimming with his two sons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name has not been released, and his 18- and 15-year-old sons 
were swimming off the breakwater when they were caught by a riptide about 3 
p.m., according to Sheriff's Lt. William Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident heard the two sons calling for help and dialed 911. A launch was 
sent from the Dana Point Harbor Patrol to the area, 30 yards off the jetty, 
Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies pulled all three swimmers from the ocean and gave the father 
emergency treatment on board. He was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in San 
Clemente, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dangerous place to be swimming, if that's in fact what they were 
doing, said Sgt. J.R. Wilson, of the Sheriff's Harbor Patrol. "The breakwater 
can get pretty treacherous."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed for the American Cancer Society's new information center 
at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will provide the public with information on cancer and was created 
by the Orange County Regional Cancer Center and the Orange County west district 
of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Mizuno, district manager of the American Cancer Society, said that people 
of all ages and occupations who have an interest in improving the quality of 
other people's lives are encouraged to volunteer. She added that volunteering 
"provides a sense of pride from knowing that you are enriching the lives of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will provide informational services to cancer patients, their 
families and friends. They will also help people choose appropriate literature 
and answer telephone requests for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to open the center Sept. 22. An open house will be held Sept. 
27. Volunteers are now being trained to provide information over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested volunteers can call Mizuno at (714) 751-0441 for more information.

JOGGING HIS MEMORY; MARATHONER'S WRONG TURN TAKES HIM ON ALL-NIGHT RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mood for a long, hard run, Michael Alexander, a marathoner visiting 
from Trinidad and Tobago, made a wrong turn on his way back from a track in 
Burbank on Thursday evening, and ended up running a good part of the night 
trying to find his way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen hours -- and nearly the distance of a marathon -- later, after 
Alexander's sister had reported him missing, the 25-year-old flagged down a Los 
Angeles police patrol car Friday morning, about 1 1/2 miles from his sister's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little embarrassed, but OK," said Alexander, who is on his first trip 
to the United States. "I'll never forget L.A. after this." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the runner's memories will be his accidental jog on the Ventura Freeway 
at nightfall, and, a few hours later, a collect phone call to one of his 
relatives in Tobago who passed on Alexander's predicament to his sister in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, after spending a good part of the day napping, Alexander was in 
good spirits. But he wasn't ready to take any more unaccompanied runs, even if 
his sister Angela Alexander would let him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the longest run he's been on in the U.S., literally speaking," she 
said, her brother smiling sheepishly. "What happens is that he concentrates so 
deeply when he runs that he forgets everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For four consecutive years, Alexander has won the Trinidad and Tobago 
Marathon, his time for the 26-mile event hovering near two hours and 20 
minutes, a few minutes slower than world-class runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's less-than-excellent adventure began about 7:30 Thursday night 
after he waited for the weather to cool down so he could go on a training run. 
Usually, he runs with a partner or walks the route in advance to get a feel for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, he did neither, and soon became disoriented in the San 
Fernando Valley's look-alike topography. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem, Alexander said, was that he did not know it is illegal to 
run on freeways -- which he did for about four miles between Sherman Oaks and 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just like a normal street," he said. "Yes, I did hear some 
cars honking, but I didn't pay much attention." 
</P>
<P>
 As the sky continued to darken however, Alexander realized he was lost for 
good -- or at least for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he told police cruising past in their car that he was disoriented, 
"but they didn't seem to care." Then, he got misdirected by a store clerk he 
happened upon. "He told me to go left when I was supposed to go straight," 
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money, and unable to remember the address or telephone number of his 
sister's apartment on Moorpark Street, Alexander jogged on, fruitlessly 
searching for familiar landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Alexander decided to call home collect. His home in Tobago, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister there phoned his sister in Sherman Oaks to tell her Alexander was 
safe. Unfortunately, Alexander had no idea where he was -- and still doesn't. 
When asked Friday about his circuitous route, he still was unable to say where 
he had been. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it got dark, everything changed," he said. "I couldn't recognize 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, after running, then walking for a while, the marathon man 
came to Moorpark Park, where he spent the hours until daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to sleep," the 5 foot 9, 115 pounder said. "I didn't feel it 
was safe. And by that time, there wasn't much point." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his sister was having her own sleepless night. "I couldn't sleep a 
wink until I knew he was OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 a.m. Friday, an LAPD car patrolling the park finally found him, and 
police called his sister to come and pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his all-night odyssey, Alexander unintentionally proved his own 
philosophy of the marathon: that it isn't the fastest runner who wins, but the 
one who perseveres. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted in a Trinidad newspaper article earlier this year, he said, "The 
marathon race is never won by the quickest athlete if that athlete is not going 
to endure to the bitter end and always keep trying to do better and better. . . 
. The prize comes to those who endureth to the end."

ROBERTI GETS WARM, BIPARTISAN FAREWELL; POLITICS: THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS 
LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES PRAISE THE OUTGOING SENATOR AND HELP PAY HIS CAMPAIGN 
DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The twilight of a man's career is not a time to hold grudges -- not even in 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
 So with state Sen. David A. Roberti only weeks from retirement after a 
quarter-century in the Legislature, his opponents laid down their rhetoric, 
dusted off their sentimentality and joined his supporters Thursday night at a 
dinner to honor the Van Nuys Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare goodwill gathering over chilled cucumber dill soup and tournedos of 
beef, Gov. Pete Wilson and top legislative leaders put aside ideological 
bickering to share a microphone and a spotlight to praise the former Senate 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 guests turned out at a Radisson hotel ballroom for a "This Is Your 
Life" fete that longtime Capitol observers declared historic for bridging the 
partisan gap. 
</P>
<P>
 People brought jokes, stories, memories, skits and gifts, as they would to any 
retirement party. But since this is an election year, the gifts took the form 
of legal tender. The 55-year-old Roberti got a hand, from Democrats and 
Republicans alike, in paying off nearly $200,000 in leftover campaign bills 
that had forced him to mortgage his Tudor-style Los Feliz home and borrow from 
his aging father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a touch of political history for the most ranking Republicans in 
California -- and especially the governor -- to lend their names to help retire 
a Democrat's campaign debt," said Robert Forsyth, a former Roberti spokesman 
who now works in public relations. "At one time or another, David has fought 
viciously against them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was payback time for the private, portly politician who retained a 
record-breaking 13-year hold on the Senate leadership in part by raising and 
doling out contributions to loyal Democrats. The event raised $90,000 to help 
pay off the debt, incurred in Roberti's failed bid for state treasurer last 
June and an earlier recall attempt in the San Fernando Valley that was led by 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 That Wilson would consent to headline Roberti's farewell fund-raiser came as 
little surprise to anyone who recalled that the two started their careers as 
elected officials together in 1966. That year, as the Vietnam War dominated the 
news and sideburns set the fashion standard, both became rookie assemblymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met him, I thought this was a shy -- almost painfully shy -- young 
man," Wilson told the crowd. "Obviously he was intelligent. But I had no idea 
he would flower as he has. And I had no idea I would feel personal affection 
for him, which I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation abounded over the future plans of Roberti, who in December will 
become the first career politician to be ejected from the Legislature by 
voter-approved term limits. Although he has kept mum about his range of 
options, Roberti says a judgeship might be too structured and he has been 
talking to law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 As Senate president pro tem until earlier this year, Roberti became known for 
his skill in stitching together a united front among Democrats and preventing 
it from unraveling in times of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he did so occasionally by exacting political revenge -- 
stripping committee chairmanships and withholding endorsements -- was recalled 
Thursday night, with humorous digs, as no more than business as usual in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 If the evening's entertainment was worth the $500 price of admission, the 
credit must go to four women state senators who performed imitation rap songs 
as the Dames Under the Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), Teresa Hughes 
(D-Inglewood) and Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) donned backwards baseball 
caps, sunglasses and street attire to sing: "David talked the right thing. 
David did the right thing. Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man. Oooooo, Ahaah." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Gretchen Wyler, a 15-year supporter of Roberti's animal-rights 
efforts, belted out "Hello, David" to the tune of "Hello, Dolly" and "Dave" to 
the melody of "Mame." Senate staffers sang "Thanks for the Memories" and Sen. 
Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) recited a poem he penned for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight white doves said to represent freedom and transition into a new 
life were released from an outdoor gazebo, one for each year Roberti 
represented Los Angeles in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Roberti was remembered fondly for his appeal to colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. Among the 30 or so lawmakers praising him were Senate 
President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy 
of Fresno, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Assembly 
Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti was also toasted by a parade of lobbyists. One after another, they 
took turns at a microphone to herald the lawmaker for his "wise counsel" and 
his accessibility. They told stories about working closely with him on 
legislation over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 One cracked a joke about senators and felons that fell flat with an audience 
still stinging from the Senate's latest political-corruption conviction. 
Another paid tribute to Roberti for championing an assault-weapons ban, saying 
he was speaking "on behalf of the rights of many future victims." 
</P>
<P>
 And many used the occasion to work the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like every political event, there's a lot of schmoozing going on," observed 
Forsyth. "At every table, they are probably talking a little bit about David 
Roberti and a lot about their own political interests."

REALITY INTRUDES UPON A POLITE URBAN ESCAPE; PLANNING: DESPITE ULTRA-CORRECT 
CODE OF CONDUCT, FISTFIGHT BRINGS THE OUTSIDE WORLD INTO CITYWALK'S SPARKLING 
STREETSCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sign is discreet, its wording polite, but its message clear. All the 
things your mother taught you are spelled out literally in black and white. 
Don't stare. Don't yell. Don't make fun of the way others speak, act or even 
pray. 
</P>
<P>
 Except this is not your mother's house. The rules adorn the sparkling gateway 
to Universal CityWalk, the privately owned urban streetscape in Universal City 
that is part theme park, part shopping mall, part town square. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk's code of conduct and its dutiful enforcement have helped the 
promenade earn a reputation -- whether deserved or not -- as a place to sample 
the pleasures of the city without the aftertaste of urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
 But last weekend reality intervened and the order of this shining city on the 
hill was disrupted by a group of kids who got into a fistfight outside the 
movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The tussle lasted about four minutes. No one was seriously hurt. Most 
pedestrians along the neon-accented walk saw nothing. It was the kind of thing 
that happens almost every day in almost every neighborhood, the kind of thing 
no one notices. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, it happened on CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 And folks noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, it was a sign that no place is safe. Others smugly noted that the 
ersatz city of glitz cannot ignore the real city around it. People will be 
people no matter how many rules, no matter how many shiny badges. Perhaps, say 
urban planning gurus, it was all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it opened last year, CityWalk inspired the laurels and the venom 
of urbanists, planners and architects. It was vilified as a surrogate for urban 
life, an Orwellian vision for the city. It was praised as the salvation of 
public space. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, its creators say, it was never intended as anything beyond a place 
to spend a few bucks and have a good time watching the parade that is Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sorts of places are rare in Los Angeles anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Los Angeles is not a real city," said Irish tourist Dominic Cogan as 
he watched 2-year-old son Eanna dart in and out of the water jets in CityWalk's 
center court fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, turning to look down CityWalk's gently curving promenade, "is 
more like a town. It's what Los Angeles should have been years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in fact, a jumble of what Los Angeles actually was years ago. A bit of 
Hollywood here. A piece of Westwood there. A splash of Broadway here. It is, in 
a way, the Los Angeles of television -- recorded and dismembered and then 
edited back together into a fantasy world where Koreatown is next to Van Nuys 
and Griffith Park somewhere between Torrance and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of vibrant, active landscape Angelenos have refused to let 
happen in their real world. If we build public places, the public might 
actually come. And they might bring their problems with them. And then, well, 
there goes the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Inc., the company that owns Universal Studios and CityWalk, built it 
anyway and people came. Apparently, the fake city seemed more real than the 
real city because they came in numbers no one expected: 10 million walked 
through the quarter-mile street in its first year, according to company 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, roughly 9,999,900 parked their cars, followed the rules and went 
home a few dollars poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little about CityWalk's restaurants or trinket shops that is 
inherently unique. The glowing fixtures and flashy buildings stay the same time 
after time, but the ever-changing ebb and flow of people is as fluid as a lava 
lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon and evening, the street was bustling with an odd mix of 
tourists and locals, an even odder mix of young and old. Outdoor cafes brimmed 
with laughter and conversation. Never mind that a turkey sandwich and a Diet 
Pepsi cost $8.06. 
</P>
<P>
 A ring of empty strollers surrounded the center fountain, their pint-sized 
occupants frolicking in the water under the constant gaze of a uniformed 
security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A glass of milk spilled in the center court was cleaned up within three 
minutes. People said "excuse me" and they smiled with real smiles. Most had not 
even heard about last weekend's fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had shrugged it off for what it was -- kids acting like punks. That 
kids will do that does not surprise the people who run CityWalk. There have 
been other fistfights at CityWalk and there will no doubt be more. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't guarantee any place to be safe and secure," said Larry Spungin, 
head of MCA Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a ghastly thing from a design point of view," said architect and 
urban designer Rex Lotery. "It has nothing to do with the city. It doesn't have 
anywhere near the richness of mix of what you'd find in a real city. It has the 
most obvious kind of commercialism, things that are really absolutely money 
related." 
</P>
<P>
 Right on the money, said Spungin. Although CityWalk has become a cause celebre 
in design and architecture circles, it was never intended as a model of modern 
urban living. It was to be just another way to separate people from their cash. 
</P>
<P>
 A mall that doesn't look like a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban designer Doug Suisman tried to hate it for that. "All of my training and 
instincts led me to oppose CityWalk's basic premise," Suisman said. "Then when 
I got there I was surprised at how much I enjoyed. People were having a 
genuinely good time. They didn't seem like media-bombarded zombies." 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the media bombarded viewers and readers with reports of the 
CityWalk fight -- something that genuinely surprised Spungin and his 
colleagues. As he said, anytime you get people together, they will act like 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, because it happened in this "bastion of artificiality," one architect 
mused, the fight somehow seemed more significant -- more real, if you will.

MAN RESCUED FROM DEEP SHAFT DIES IN HOSPITAL; CONSTRUCTION: DETAILS OF THE 
BUILDING INSPECTOR'S INJURIES HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED. HE WENT INTO CARDIAC 
ARREST AT VALENCIA SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A building inspector who was wedged into a 66-foot shaft for nearly four hours 
at a Valencia construction site earlier this week has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Lozoya, 32, of Downey died at 7:15 p.m. Thursday at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital, where he had been in critical condition since the accident 
two days earlier. Details of his injuries have not been released, at the 
request of his family, but Lozoya went into cardiac arrest as he was pulled out 
of the hole by rescuers and had to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozoya, a contract employee with the city of Santa Clarita, fell into a shaft 
on Tuesday at 23948 Via Onda, where two homes had been demolished following the 
Northridge earthquake. The openings were to be filled with concrete and steel 
reinforcements for seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic scene captured live by the media, rescuers painstakingly lowered 
themselves into the 2 1/2-foot-wide hole, finally successfully pulling Lozoya 
out in a harness after he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, workers gathered at the construction site to discuss Lozoya's 
death. They described the Downey resident as likable and energetic, saying he 
often spoke of building his own home near the coast south of Los Angeles, 
according to project manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt terrible," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some employees indicated they are uncomfortable working near where 
Lozoya was injured, none have asked to leave the job site, Miller said. The day 
of the accident, witnesses said Lozoya had removed the plywood covering from 
the opening of the pit, but it remains unclear whether he accidentally stepped 
into the hole or whether the ground surrounding the opening collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't anybody's fault," said Bob Howard, a carpenter who saw Lozoya fall 
in the hole. "It was just a stupid accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozoya was employed by Anaheim-based Willdan and Associates, one of several 
building-inspection firms the city of Santa Clarita hired to help with 
thousands of structural reviews necessary after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only time in Santa Clarita's seven-year history that a 
subcontracted employee has been killed on the job, according to Deputy City 
Manager Jeff Kolin. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, this is the first for a city employee or a contract service 
provider," said Kolin. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction at the accident site is continuing because Cal/OSHA -- which is 
investigating the accident -- does not believe an "imminent hazard" exists to 
workers, said agency spokesman John Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA investigators arrived on the site during the rescue efforts and have 
been interviewing co-workers and witnesses about the incident, Duncan said, but 
have yet to reach any conclusions.

 "We have an investigation under way," Duncan said. "It's probably going to 
take a little longer, about a week." 
</P>
<P>
 It was members of an Urban Search and Rescue team from Redondo Beach who 
rescued Lozoya from the shaft, to the applause of co-workers and other 
onlookers. But it had taken hours, during which time Lozoya had his legs pinned 
under him and complained of back pains. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, rescuers dangling from a rope had been lowered into the hole to 
try to slip a harness around Lozoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts were made to keep Lozoya alive and comfortable, including pumping 
oxygen down to him and supplying him with Gatorade. But it was not until he 
lost consciousness, causing his body to relax, that rescuers were able to lift 
him from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy by the Los Angeles County coroner's office is expected to be 
conducted on Lozoya today or Sunday.

HEALTH CREWS ABANDONING THEIR CARS IN JOB PROTEST; LABOR: UNION MEMBERS BICYCLE 
OR WALK TO THEIR INSPECTION SITES. THEY SEEK PAY HIKE AND HIGHER MILEAGE 
REIMBURSEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 300 Los Angeles County health inspectors have taken to bicycling and 
walking to local restaurants, markets and other assignments in a contract 
dispute that has brought health inspections to a near-standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 A union official said the county has suspended about 12 inspectors since the 
protest began Wednesday. The inspectors, who have been without a new contract 
for nearly two years, are seeking a cost-of-living increase and higher mileage 
reimbursements for their personal cars, which they normally use for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began, about 320 inspectors in the county Department of 
Health Services' environmental health unit have pedaled bikes, ridden Metrolink 
trains and hoofed it to assignments throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not any little wildcat action," said Jim Somers, a negotiator with the 
Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental Health Specialists, the union which 
represents inspectors. "Only about 5% of the inspections are being done." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those suspended Friday was Chris Gerfen, an inspector in the Pacoima 
branch on Van Nuys Boulevard, who has been bicycling since Wednesday to his 
West San Fernando Valley assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, it took me two hours to ride my bike from here to the Fallbrook 
Fashion Mall," said Gerfen, whose inspection rate fell from about 14 to three 
inspections a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the suspension, Gerfen hopped back on the bike again Friday. "I'm 
going to continue my duty to protect the public," he said. "They just can't use 
my car anymore. They have not been bargaining in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Marcus, director of labor relations for the county Chief Administrative 
Office, defended the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has ordered them to do their work, they are refusing to, and 
that's insubordination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health inspectors do everything from investigate food poisoning complaints at 
restaurants and markets to examine apartments for cockroach and rodent 
infestations, sometimes leading to criminal charges or business closures. They 
also evaluate sewage plans to see if they meet health code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although health license fees that fund the department have increased by 40% 
since 1991, inspectors have not received a mileage increase in 13 years or a 
cost-of-living increase for the past three years, Somers said. The inspectors' 
contract expired Oct. 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old contract, inspectors have been using their personal vehicles to 
travel to inspection sites and are then reimbursed by the county at 25 cents a 
mile, which they argued is too low, and does not cover expenses like flat tires 
and other routine repair and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somers also argued that the county is illegally diverting money from his 
department to other county departments, saying that is the greatest source of 
anger among inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is very specific," he said. "The money we collect (from health 
license fees) is supposed to be spent on inspecting restaurants, markets, 
things like that. It cannot be spent on clinics and hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court over 
the issue. The suit names Department of Health Services chief Robert Gates, 
county Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed and the five county supervisors 
as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Union accountants claim that $14 million in health license fees was siphoned 
from the Department's Environmental Health Section last year. The section, 
which employs about 350 health inspectors, funds itself through the health 
license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the county is transferring those funds to the general fund to 
support other programs that aren't as profitable," said union attorney Sylvia 
E. Kellison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past three years, the department's overall inspection rates have 
been down as much as 30%, Somers said. Critical inspections such as those of 
restaurants, which are supposed to be done four times a year, are down to less 
than twice a year, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1993 and 1994, Somers said, the county raised health license fees 25%, 
although inspectors received no raises or cost-of-living hikes. The cost for 
inspecting an average food market went up from $380 to $472 while apartment 
building inspections increased from $267 to $331, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody being charged a health license permit is being overcharged," Somers 
said. "The health department has found a way to take this legal framework and 
abuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials were unavailable for comment Friday on the job action or rate 
hikes. Marcus would not comment on the rate hikes, except to say they did not 
entitle workers to a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, these guys are scraping around and looking to be 
an exception to all county employees who have, in various manners, not received 
pay increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have said the job action will last indefinitely. The two sides 
have not met at the bargaining table since June and, Somers said, "It's going 
to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerfen said he hopes it won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody calls in and complains and it takes me half a day to get there on 
a bike, it may be food poisoning," he said. "It may jeopardize somebody's 
health."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; MALIBU GRAND PRIX SITE NEARS END OF ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Malibu Grand Prix, where kids rode miniature race cars and businessmen slapped 
pinball machines on their lunch hour for more than 20 years, closes for good 
Sunday after losing its lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe that!" said Andrew Caspary of Hidden Hills, after finishing 
his last go-cart ride. "It's terrible. I always look forward to coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Malibu Grand Prix Corp., which runs 30 amusement centers across 
the country, said this week the company lost its lease on the Northridge site. 
The six-acre property has been purchased by Toyota, which plans to turn it into 
a dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge operation opened in 1974, one of the first three in the chain 
to be built. "It's always been a successful location for us, and we regret 
having to leave that facility and leave that area of the Valley," said William 
Patterson, executive vice president for the Malibu Grand Prix Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 When Todd Lang and Niall Stewart, who work at the nearby State Farm Insurance 
Co. offices, heard the news, friends offered their condolences via computer 
messages. The pair came down to the amusement center on an early lunch break 
Friday, just to play their favorite games one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-workers had run air-hockey tournaments they described as perfect midday 
stress relievers. The "Indiana Jones" pinball game was a favorite of Lang. On 
Friday, Stewart was trying out the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" pinball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our wives are going to be upset because we're going to have to take out our 
frustrations at home," said Stewart. "My office always knows where they can 
find me at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the kids, youngsters under the age of 14 were probably most sorry to see 
the Malibu Grand Prix close. It means they will never graduate from the 
30-mile-an-hour go-carts to the higher-powered cars, which also run on the 
half-mile track behind the arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting for so long," said 11-year-old Conrad Wilder of Northridge. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A driver's license, or at least a training certificate from track organizers, 
is required to get into the faster cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exhilarating," said Wilder's mother, Jill Wood, 31, describing the ride 
in the race cars. She says she has been coming to the amusement center since 
she was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse at Valley College, Wood has found Malibu Grand Prix to be an easy 
place to meet her friends who have children. Anywhere else "won't be as much 
fun as this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Ashley of Hidden Hills had planned to have a birthday party for her 
son, Micky, at Malibu Grand Prix on Monday when he turned 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she called to make a reservation, she found out the track would be 
closed by then. So, she rescheduled it for Friday. Although her son and his 
friends were having fun, they showed their disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been here three times before," said Micky. "Now it's closing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should close it down," added Michael Hurst, 10, one of 
Micky's friends. "It's fun." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; $25,000 REWARD OFFER OKD IN HIT-AND-RUN

<P>
 Hoping to apprehend the driver who struck and killed an elderly woman, the Los 
Angeles City Council approved Friday a $25,000 reward for information leading 
to the motorist's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward was proposed by Councilman Joel Wachs at the request of police and 
the family of the victim, 80-year-old Selma Labovitz of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that killing an innocent 80-year-old woman, especially one as 
dear and beloved as Selma Labovitz, is a tragedy by any account," Wachs said at 
a press conference near the site of the July 5 killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Labovitz was walking back to her car from the 99 Cents Only Store on Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard in North Hollywood when a beige or tan Chevy Nova sped through 
the parking lot, hitting her and throwing her into the air, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Labovitz, her husband, was on the other side of the car and witnessed the 
car drive away after it struck his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was very energetic," he said at the press conference. "She did a lot 
of things for other people and it's a tragedy to lose her." 
</P>
<P>
 People with information are asked to call the Los Angeles Police Department's 
San Fernando Valley traffic detectives at (818) 756-8391. HUGO MARTIN

<P>
 A two-foot pothole on the Golden State Freeway in Sylmar prompted the closure 
of two lanes and a nearby freeway interchange Friday, triggering a daylong 
traffic jam, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Road repair crews rushed to fill and fix the two-foot hole which developed 
about 10 a.m. Friday on the southbound Golden State Freeway near the San 
Fernando Road exit, said Pat Reid of the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lanes of traffic as well as the interchange between the southbound Golden 
State Freeway and the eastbound Foothill Freeway reopened about 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The pothole apparently developed at the site of a temporary patch applied to 
the freeway's surface, which was damaged during the Northridge quake. JULIE

<P>
 The first lady of Armenia, Lucia Ter-Petrossian, will be the guest of honor 
Monday at a luncheon at the Ararat Home of Los Angeles in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian asked that the event be organized to thank members of the local 
Armenian community who contributed money and goods after the devastating 1988 
earthquake in Armenia, said Bob Shamlian, a trustee of the Ararat home, which 
caters mostly to Armenian retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian and her husband, Levon Ter-Petrossian, president of the 
Armenian republic, are touring the United States in an effort to raise money 
for food and fuel for their landlocked country. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamlian said Armenia has suffered badly since neighboring Azerbaijan cut off 
road and train access in a dispute with one of its provinces that is heavily 
Armenian and is trying to break away. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian factories are shut down "because there's no electricity in the 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamlian said proceeds from the $20-a-head luncheon will be used to train 
nurses in Armenia. JACK CHEEVERS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY FOUNDER PAVLEY TO LEAVE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fran Pavley, the only founding member still on the Agoura Hills City Council, 
said Friday she will not run for reelection when her current term expires in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley, who helped establish the city in 1982, said she will simply be ready 
to move on after spending 20 to 30 hours per week at the largely volunteer job 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've accomplished most of what I set out to do, and it's time to say, 
'enough,' " Pavley said. "When I first became a council member, my children 
were little kids of 3 and 5. Now one is off to college and the other is in high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Her disclosure comes as a group of anti-tax advocates is petitioning for a 
recall of the entire City Council over a recently approved tax on the use of 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley said she made her decision not to run again during last year's 
election, long before the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The volatile nature of Agoura Hills politics, though, has taken its toll on 
Pavley, who often is a lightning rod for dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do get tired of a small group of vocal people who really don't contribute 
to the best interests of the community taking so much of my time," Pavley said. 
"I somehow seem to get the credit or the blame for many decisions that are 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley counts among her major accomplishments as a council member the approval 
of tough ordinances protecting hillsides and oak trees and the construction of 
four new parks since the city incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley said she expects to become president of the Los Angeles County chapter 
of the League of California Cities, representing 88 municipalities, starting 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizer Barbara Murphy called Pavley's disclosure "wonderful news," 
but said there are no plans to exclude her from the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think she's accomplished some positive things," Murphy said. "But 
I think she's lost touch with the need to represent the majority of people in 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 First-term Councilman Ed Corridori, who owns Copy-Rite Printing in Agoura 
Hills, called the criticism "undeserved." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of finest public servants any city could expect to have," Corridori 
said. "She's given so much of her time and gone way beyond what anyone could 
expect of a council member." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; JEWISH YOUTH GAMES MIX CULTURE, SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Stephanie Shapiro, a 14-year-old swimmer from Chatsworth, an upcoming swim 
meet promises to be not only an athletic experience, but a religious one. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie is one of 129 young athletes from Los Angeles, and 2,500 from the 
United States and five other countries, who will meet in Cleveland on Sunday 
for the Jewish Community Center North American Maccabi Youth Games. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the unique features of the competition, an Olympic-style amateur event 
held every two years, is that athletes are housed in the homes of Jewish host 
families living in the Cleveland area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie said she is looking forward to learning more about traditional 
Jewish customs from her host family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family that I'm staying with keeps kosher, so I'll learn what that's 
like," said Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1982, the four-day competition will feature 14 sports, 
including gymnastics, running, wrestling and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as the athleticism of the event, said games co-chairman 
Richard Landis, is the opportunity for Jewish youths, age 13 to 16, to meet 
other young Jews, learn about culture and build self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get the opportunity to learn a lot about each other and I think they 
learn that they have a lot in common, whether they're from California or 
Pennsylvania or Ohio or Mexico," Landis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley athletes said the process of making friends began even before their 
plane left Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the boys soccer team participated in a training camp in Agoura this 
month to get used to playing with each other. Soccer players doubled and 
tripled up at the Agoura players' homes for the workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had practice a couple times a day and went out at night," said team 
captain Brian Landun, 16, of Agoura, "so we bonded both socially and 
athletically. These guys have become like my best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, just 13 hours before their flight to Cleveland, the boys 
and girls softball teams squared off for a practice game in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams brought home gold medals last year. In fact, according to Jerry 
Bobrow, head of the Los Angeles delegation, the Los Angeles team won more than 
100 medals at the last games -- more than the second- and third-place finishers 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The games trace their roots to 1895, when German and Austrian Jews living in 
Constantinople started the first all-Jewish gymnastics club after being 
excluded by the Aryan-only policies of the German gymnastics societies there. 
</P>
<P>
 The first World Maccabiah Games, for mainly adult athletes, were held in 
Palestine in 1932, and have been held in Israel since 1950. Since the youth 
games were established in Memphis in 1982, they have been held in Detroit, 
Toronto, Chicago and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited," said Rachel Mullin, 15, the catcher for the girls softball 
team, on the eve of her departure. "I hope it's as good as it was two years 
ago." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; 7 INJURED IN HEAD-ON CRASH AT INTERSECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven people were injured and two firefighters suffered from heat exhaustion 
following a head-on collision in Agoura Hills on Friday that left one woman 
trapped in her car for hours before rescue workers could free her.  
</P>
<P>
 Three girls, ages 4, 9 and 12, were among those injured in the 10:25 a.m. 
crash at the intersection of Kanan and Agoura roads, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was the children's mother, Monique Schmidt, 36, of Agoura Hills, 
who suffered the most serious injuries after she became trapped in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers struggled for more than two hours to free Schmidt, whose foot 
was stuck in the frame of her red Volvo, using heavy tools to disassemble the 
car around her, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was airlifted in critical condition to a Los Angeles hospital about 12:30 
p.m. with internal injuries, a fractured leg and an injured foot, said 
Battalion Chief Glenn Mutch of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the longest rescues I've been on," said Donald Pratt, a 
paramedic who helped rescue Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt's daughters and three teen-age boys riding in the other car also were 
taken to hospitals. They were treated for minor to moderate injuries, including 
cuts and broken bones.

 The accident apparently happened when Schmidt attempted to cross the 
intersection and was struck by a car driven by a 17-year-old Moorpark youth who 
allegedly ran a red light, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says it was a green light, but witnesses contradict his statement," said 
Sgt. Mary Olson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said an investigation is under way and no decision has been made on 
whether to charge the youth. The two other youths in his car reportedly are 16 
and 17. None of the youths' names were released because they are minors. JULIE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; MAN HITS HYDRANT, DIES IN FLOODED CAR

 Like a bizarre tale out of the Twilight Zone, authorities announced Friday 
they have yet to determine whether a Granada Hills man drowned in his own car 
after it plowed over a fire hydrant, triggering a storm of water that flooded 
his convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the accident was Robert E. McDonald Jr., 30, who was found sitting 
in his Volkswagen at the intersection of Devonshire Street and Melvin Avenue 
about 3 a.m. Thursday with water up to his chest and gallons more pounding down 
on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be moving, but actually the force of the water was making him 
bob," said John Mellen, a Los Angeles Times delivery-truck driver who tried to 
rescue McDonald. "There was just an incredible amount of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials had not determined an official cause of death Friday, nor 
had police determined a cause for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Mann of the Valley traffic division, said 
McDonald was apparently driving his convertible Volkswagen with the top down 
east on Devonshire. For an unknown reason, he ran off the road and collided 
with a curb, fire hydrant and lamp post before being stopped by a block wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire hydrant was sheared off at the ground, causing a powerful gush of 
water to shoot into the air, filling McDonald's car, Mellen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellen was en route to North Hollywood to deliver newspapers when he spotted 
water shooting from the ground and tail lights shining through. He said he 
drove slowly past the strange scene, but backed up and left his truck when he 
realized there was someone sitting in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a decision to go in and try and get him out," Mellen said. "I was just 
getting soaked. I tried to lift him out, but he was too heavy." Another 
motorist stopped to help and together the two men managed to pull McDonald from 
the car. They then took turns trying to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
on him without success. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellen said firefighters and police who later arrived at the scene told him 
McDonald may have drowned in the water pouring into his car, since he suffered 
no obvious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said initial autopsy results failed to 
determine a cause of death. He said his office is awaiting toxicology test 
results and that more tests maybe performed to determine whether McDonald 
drowned. JULIE TAMAKI

CORONER TO SEEK OUTSIDE HELP EXAMINING BODIES AT STORAGE SITE; AUTOPSIES: IN A 
RARE MOVE, A FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST WILL BE HIRED TO HELP IDENTIFY THREE 
DECOMPOSED CORPSES AND DETERMINE IF THEY WERE MURDERED. 
</P>

 Because autopsies on three decomposed bodies found in a Northridge storage 
facility were inconclusive, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Friday 
it would take the rare step of hiring an outside forensic anthropologist to 
identify them and determine if -- and how -- they were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the case was of the highest priority, the coroner's office dispatched 
three separate forensic experts to independently examine the bodies Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are eager to learn the identities of the corpses of two men and a 
woman, so they can talk to friends and relatives who may be able to provide 
clues to the identity of whoever left them sealed in two steamer trunks and a 
cardboard box inside the storage room. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsies conducted Friday supported police contentions that the bodies 
had been decaying for at least a year inside the locked storage unit on 
Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But forensic experts offered some hope that there was enough of the fingers 
left to obtain at least partial fingerprints, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman 
for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dental work also was found and will be scrutinized, Carrier said. Because the 
lab work on teeth and fingerprints will take at least several weeks, Carrier 
said the coroner's office plans to bring in a forensic anthropologist as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Such specialists mix forensics, anthropology and detective work. From a single 
thigh bone, for instance, they can often determine a dead person's sex, race, 
height, approximate age and time of death, and sometimes even how they lived 
and died. Their work can be critical in sending police off on the trail of a 
serial killer, or in convincing them that they can close their murder books on 
people who died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic anthropologists have been used in several high-profile cases 
worldwide, from a 1990s revisitation of the 1947 Black Dahlia murder in Los 
Angeles to the efforts to identify those killed in a 1981 wartime massacre at 
El Mozote in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said the county has used several of them in the past, but that it had 
not yet been decided which one to hire on this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities have been investigating the case as three homicides, some 
sources close to the investigation speculated Friday that there may be other 
possibilities for the mystery that has stymied police and forensic experts 
since the three corpses were discovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the theories: The three people may have died of natural causes before 
someone left them in the U-Haul Company storage unit so they could ultimately 
be shipped elsewhere for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 But officially, authorities have said they are operating under the assumption 
the three people were murdered, in part because efforts by police to track the 
person who rented the room for the past several years have proved fruitless, 
because the renter gave false identification to U-Haul employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives "are still investigating it as a homicide, but they are 
trying to track down where the boxes came from," said Officer Sandra Castello, 
an LAPD spokeswoman. "Perhaps that way they can get some clues as to who these 
people are and what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of those interesting cases where we have to wait and see as it 
unravels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were first discovered by a man who bought the contents of the 
abandoned storage unit at an auction. The buyer, Ed Zaharoff, called police to 
say he had smelled a bad odor coming from one of two steamer trunks in the 
room, and authorities ultimately discovered three bodies, each in its own 
container tightly wrapped with plastic and duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Friday that the renter had been using the unit for at least 
several years. Zaharoff said he found shriveled room deodorizers and mothballs 
in the unit, presumably placed there to mask the stench of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff also said he found three guns in the cluttered rental unit, including 
two .22-caliber rifles and a chrome-plated .38 revolver. He described the guns 
as new and looking untouched.

ELDERLY WOMAN RAPED, ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prowler broke into the home of a sleeping 76-year-old woman Friday, raped 
her and stole money she had left out, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sexual assault was the motive, because it looks like the person entered 
just with that intent," said Detective Mike Coffey of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's North Hollywood Division."If anything, the taking of the property 
might have been an afterthought." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, alone in a first-floor apartment in the 5000 block of Tujunga 
Avenue, was awakened by the rapist about 5:15 a.m., Coffey said. Her screams 
summoned the building manager and other neighbors, who helped her call 
authorities, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the man probably entered through a window left open in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that people should be aware of and try to make themselves as 
secure as possible at night," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no similar attacks in the area, police said.

SCRABBLE TOURNAMENT HAS FANS SPELLBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gwendolyn Bishop has spent much of this summer with her head buried in a 
dictionary, trying to memorize the spelling of 100,000 words. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of other word mavens, the 72-year-old Eagle Rock resident has 
been cramming for the 1994 National Scrabble Championship being held at the 
Universal City Hilton today through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop has a special interest in the event: She is defending her title as 
having the highest score for seniors in the intermediate division of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure don't want to give that up," she said Friday as she made final 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the dedication of those who get endless thrills from a game in which 
the object is to out-spell one's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spend years and years studying," said John Williams Jr., executive 
director of the National Scrabble Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current event, about 400 contestants will play 27 rounds for a top 
prize of $15,000, said Williams, one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, in which players use seven letters to spell words and score as many 
points as possible, has steadily grown in popularity over the years. It is now 
played in about 30 million American homes, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole Scrabble culture," he said. "There are about 25,000 
tournament players worldwide, and we have about 9,000 ranked tournament players 
in the U.S. and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say the event will attract contestants from 35 states and six 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition will feature Scrabble superstars such as Tom Adams, a 
13-year-old boy wonder from St. Paul, Minn., who is favored to win his division 
at this year's championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing is Mark Landsberg, a Los Angeles inventor who holds the record 
for the highest total score for a single tournament game, an impressive 770 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be enormous pressure on all the contestants, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need to have your wits about you," he said. "There are a lot 
people in this who have the entire dictionary memorized."

VALLEY MURDER SUSPECT ARRESTED IN TENNESSEE; CRIME: KEVIN HILL OF PACOIMA IS 
SAID TO HAVE SHOT A MAN WHO ACCIDENTALLY BUMPED INTO HIM AT A PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A hard-core gang member, wanted for the fatal shooting of a Canoga Park man 
who accidentally bumped into him at a party, has been arrested in Tennessee, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Germaine Hill, wanted by the Los Angeles Police Department on suspicion 
of murder and suspected of involvement in another homicide, was arrested in 
Memphis on Thursday by members of a multi-agency fugitive task force, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have him in custody, but that's all I can say," said Detective Frank 
Taylor of the Shelby County (Tenn.) sheriff's office. Authorities said Hill was 
arrested by the Memphis-area Fugitive Task Force, which includes investigators 
from the city of Memphis, Shelby County and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill waived extradition on Friday, and detectives from the LAPD's Foothill 
Division said they would go to Tennessee next week to escort Hill back to the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who police say shot 23-year-old Wesley Williams in an unprovoked attack 
in June, could be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole 
if he is convicted of murder, said LAPD homicide Detective Rick Plows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a hard-core Pacoima . . . gang member," said Plows. "He is a danger to 
the community, and I'm glad he has been apprehended." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill detectives tracked Hill to Memphis through tips and other means, then 
forwarded his photographs, fingerprints and other identification to the task 
force, Plows said. "We just heard he was in the area and got a name of a person 
he might have been staying with."  
</P>
<P>
 Williams was found in a puddle of blood about 11 p.m. June 12 in the 11560 
block of Wheeler Street in Lake View Terrace. Police obtained the warrant for 
Hill's arrest 11 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred during a party on the same block where Williams' 
relatives were holding a party, police said. Williams had returned to Lake View 
Terrace to attend the family party after spending 10 years living near Downtown 
Los Angeles and in Canoga Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending that party, Williams went down the street to the second party 
because he knew the hosts and wanted to see them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the second party progressed, fights broke out in the back yard and 
Williams, trying to avoid the trouble, walked around the side of the house 
intending to leave, police said. At that time, investigators believe, Williams 
accidentally bumped into Hill and the two men exchanged words. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who knew Williams, followed him into the front yard and began shooting 
at him, firing many times, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams died at Pacifica Industrial Medical Center in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill also was among several men arrested for their alleged involvement in a 
gang-related slaying in January, but prosecutors declined to file 
accessory-to-murder charges against him in that case, despite statements by 
witnesses placing him at the scene, Plows said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was their opinion that they did not have enough to file murder charges 
against him at that time, although there were eyewitnesses that saw him 
involved in a fight preceding the shooting," Plows said. "It's a legal 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in that case could not be reached for comment. The actual gunman 
in that case, Sean Collins, was sentenced to 33 years to life in prison on 
Wednesday for killing Kervin Bailey, Plows said.SHOOTINGS

USE OF METROLINK HAS DOUBLED SINCE QUAKE; COMMUTE: SURVEY FINDS THAT TYPICAL 
RIDER REMAINS WHITE MALE PROFESSIONAL. WOMEN AND MINORITIES SHOW ONLY SLIGHT 
GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's commuter trains carry twice as many passengers now as 
before the Northridge earthquake, and the average rider is a well-heeled white 
male professional from the suburbs, according to results of a survey released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of female and minority group riders climbed only slightly, if at 
all, in the past year, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the Metrolink system's 15,500 daily riders began taking the 
periwinkle-and-white trains after the January quake. Many of those new 
customers -- one-sixth of the current passengers -- identified quake damage to 
the freeways as the reason why they now ride Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink passengers overall -- the majority of whom receive subsidies from 
their employers to take the train -- continue to report high satisfaction with 
the 2-year-old train service, although some complain of high prices, delays and 
poor connections at their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results, based on a Metrolink poll of 4,527 riders in June, show 
little change in the typical passenger profile from a similar study last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some official attempts to diversify ridership, the trains still 
attract affluent white-collar workers, mostly male executives and managers, 
from households with an average annual income of $64,450. More than half (55%) 
receive subsidies from their employers to ride the trains, on average $58 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The socioeconomic status of Metrolink customers continues to stand in stark 
contrast to that of the region's bus users, who are overwhelmingly members of 
ethnic minority groups and from households that earn less than $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That disparity was brought into the debate recently over the decision to raise 
bus fares for the first time in six years, even as Metrolink officials slashed 
fares for several months as an earthquake-relief measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders gave Metrolink high marks in the survey for service, personal safety 
and professional courtesy from staff, and say their stress levels are lower 
because they do not have to drive to work. Three out of five passengers 
surveyed used to be solo drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But 75% of riders -- even those who live within five miles of their stations 
-- drive alone to the train station, which means they "cold start" their cars 
each workday morning anyway, and cold starts are the single biggest contributor 
to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which Metrolink officials said has a margin of error of less than 
2%, found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly half of all passengers began using the system after the January 
earthquake. About 48% of these new customers identified the temblor as the 
reason for turning to the trains, accounting for one-sixth of the current total 
ridership. On the Santa Clarita line alone, three out of every four passengers 
trace their ridership to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty-two percent of riders are men, the same proportion as last year. 
However, 48% of passengers are women, up from 45%. (Three percent of 
respondents in last year's survey did not answer the question.) 
</P>
<P>
 * As with last year, whites make up two-thirds of those who board the trains. 
The proportion is even higher along some routes, such as the Ventura line and 
the recently opened Orange County line (80% for both) and the Santa Clarita 
line (74%). 
</P>
<P>
 * The percentage of African Americans who use Metrolink increased from 7% last 
year to 9.4% this year. Latinos registered a tiny rise, from 13% to 13.1%. 
Asian American ridership dropped from 13% to 9.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average household income of $64,450 exceeds last year's figure by more 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three out of five riders formerly drove alone to work every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average rider is 41 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most frequent complaint is that schedules are too inflexible or 
infrequent. Riders also complain of delays, seating problems and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Still, 61% believe the Metrolink to be a better overall value than their 
former commute mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials acknowledge that the high approval rating is to be 
expected for their survey, since most respondents are people already sold on 
Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're preaching to the choir, that's true," said Ray Shea, Metrolink 
marketing manager. "They're on board because they like it." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said his staff would examine ways to attract new riders and to find out 
whether trial users in recent promotional programs stayed with the trains. 
Metrolink will also continue to advertise in Spanish media. Metolink Profile A 
survey of 4,527 Metrolink passengers in June shows that the average rider 
remains a white male professional with a household income of $64,450. However, 
the number of female passengers has climbed slightly from last year, as has the 
number of minorities riding the trains. Employers subsidize the trip for 55% of 
all riders, offering an average of $57.59 monthly. Ethnicity Other: 1% Asian:

ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; SYBERT BLASTS BEILENSON'S POLITICAL 
DIGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GOP congressional challenger Richard Sybert on Friday accused U.S. Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills) of waging a disgraceful reelection 
campaign aimed at digging up political dirt on Sybert rather than debating him 
squarely on public policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompting these angry remarks was Sybert's discovery that a private 
researcher, using the state Public Records Act, recently obtained an inch-thick 
file of phone and travel records related to Sybert's former work as director of 
Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Planning and Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming he has nothing to hide, Sybert, who is running against Beilenson in 
the 24th Congressional District, held a news conference to release these same 
records to the media. Among the documents were travel expense claims for about 
$12,500 that Sybert had submitted over the nearly three-year period he served 
as director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frankly offended at this," Sybert said. "They're spending money to root 
around in my garbage, and Beilenson is not even man enough to do it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Jonas, who made the request for the records, refused Friday to disclose 
the name of his employer or client. But later, Craig Miller, Beilenson's 
political consultant, confirmed that Jonas was employed by the state Democratic 
Party to research the public records of GOP candidates, including Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this shows is that Tony Beilenson, despite his brave facade, is 
running scared," Sybert said. "He dodges debates and digs in my garbage. I find 
it instructive that they did not ask for any of the policy papers issued by the 
planning office when I was there."  
</P>
<P>
 Sybert recently accused Beilenson of refusing to debate him. In fact, 
Beilenson promised to debate Sybert but only after the congressional recess in 
mid-October. Earlier debates would be pointless because voters won't focus on 
the election until the final weeks, Beilenson has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller called Sybert's reaction to the public records request "paranoid and 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert "should expect to be held accountable for his activities while in 
public office," Miller said. "It is quite routine for officials to have their 
records examined. . . . It sounds to me like he must have something to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the Democratic party actually contracted with Jonas to do the 
"opposition research" on Sybert, and that the party decided what records to 
seek. Finance statements show that Beilenson received "in-kind research" 
assistance from the Democratic Party valued at $3,750. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he had not had time to review the Sybert documents to determine if 
they contained signs of spending irregularities. "I honestly don't know what 
they contain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert got the tip-off about the public records request from his former 
colleagues in the Office of Planning and Research. "Rich was talking on the 
phone to my deputy, Phil Romero, and I told him to tell Rich that we had gotten 
the request," Lee Grissom, the office's current chief, said in an interview 
Friday. Grissom said Sybert did not try to influence his handling of the 
request, although he acknowledged that Sybert had called him at home to discuss 
what would be disclosed.

YOUTH GROUPS AWARDED QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Realizing the emotional aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake could last 
for some time, the United Way has donated $100,000 to several youth 
organizations to help kids cope with the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we were hearing was that the damage went beyond the 
buildings," said George Bahamonde, regional vice president for the North 
Angeles Region United Way."Even at this late date, the damage was still 
lingering with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, local United Way officials said colleagues in 
Dade County, Fla., warned them to expect the emotional effects of the quake to 
last for years. The Florida officials said they were still seeing the effects 
of Hurricane Andrew, which struck that state in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 grant is the last of $1.5 million in earthquake donations given 
to the United Way since January. It was distributed Thursday to eight youth 
organizations, including three chapters of the Boys and Girls Club in the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys, as well as in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recipients include the Campfire Boys and Girls Los Angeles Council, the 
Woodcraft Rangers, the Verdugo Hills Boy Scouts, the San Fernando Valley Girl 
Scouts and the YWCA of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole objective is to help kids normalize their lives and put the 
earthquake behind them," said Bahamonde. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups can use the money for peer-counseling sessions, field trips or 
other activities to help relieve the emotional stress still lingering from the 
earthquake.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; ANGELS ABOUND AS THE SPIRITUAL GUARDIANS ENJOY NEW 
POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angels -- whether cherubic, winged and haloed, or personal guardians, divine 
messengers or emissaries of the dark side -- are making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Books on angels are enjoying spirited sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just fly out of here," said Leora McFarthing, manager of Barnes & Noble 
Bookstore in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Tickle, religion editor of Publisher's Weekly, thought the tide of 
angel books had crested some 18 months ago. Books on angels had placed 12th and 
14th on the general religious best-seller list for 1993, and a reissue of Billy 
Graham's "Angels" is currently 13th on an evangelical market best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
 "But from last May through February next year, we are going to see 35 new 
titles come out," said Tickle, whose office is in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" focused on angels. 
</P>
<P>
 And that night, instead of watching the KCET special "In Search of Angels," 55 
people showed up for a panel discussion on angels and demons in Northridge 
sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council. The crowd matched the 
previous high for attendance in the council's series of open forums on faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to account for the resurgence of interest in angels and other 
spiritual subjects, religious analysts have cited social troubles, saying they 
generate hope for aid from otherworldly sources, and a surprising increase in 
the social acceptability of talk about spiritual matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The interfaith discussion Thursday night at Northridge Seventh-day Adventist 
Church, the host church for this session, may have been representative of a 
growing curiosity about angels in a predominantly secular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderated by the Rev. Jeff Utter, a Congregational pastor and instructor in 
Cal State Northridge's religious studies department, the panel included a 
Catholic priest and a Mormon representative who affirmed their churches' 
beliefs in angels and, on the other side, a Unitarian Universalist and a Zen 
Buddhist, whose traditions do not talk of angels but who were personally open 
to discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 When audience members were asked how many "had had something to do with an 
angel" in their lives, 15 raised their hands. About the same number raised 
their hands when asked if they had ever had a brush with evil of a supernatural 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in the crowd asked the panel: "Why are people more comfortable talking 
about these things than they were, say, five or 10 years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Atkinson, California public affairs representative for the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormons are formally known, said he 
believed that people were increasingly polarized toward either good or evil 
directions in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are becoming more good are reaching into the depths of their soul 
and examining what it is they really believe," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can sophisticate yourself out of the ability to feel the presence of 
angels," he said. "I believe angels come as messengers of God with specific 
purposes. I have known people who have been blessed with that kind of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Andrew Diviney, a Jesuit priest residing at Our Lady of Lourdes Church 
in Northridge, said there is a discernible yearning for the transcendent among 
people today. 
</P>
<P>
 Diviney also sees the increase in angel popularity as a cyclical phenomenon as 
a new generation revisits a venerable Christian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for Roman Catholic beliefs, angels are in, demons are in. We ask angels 
for protection against demons," the priest said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the skeptical but sympathetic side, Deryck True, president of the Studio 
City Unitarian Universalist Church, said that his creedless denomination "is a 
standard bearer for liberal religion." True said that he believes that 
everything that happens is a natural phenomenon, but added that debates about 
justice, good, evil and spiritual traditions are healthy for society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy to get mired in routine, paying bills, going to work," he said. 
"I applaud those who deal with what our lives mean and think about what we are 
supposed to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Angels are a traditional part of the world religions born in the Middle East 
-- Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- but are not prevalent in 
Eastern religions. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Jakunin Fuld, a psychologist and practicing Buddhist with the Zen Center 
of Los Angeles, said that the Buddhist tradition does not speak of angels and 
only occasionally of demons. The offspring of a mother who was Unitarian and a 
non-religious Jewish father, Fuld said that at this point her life she is "more 
interested in religion than psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion has an enormous gift to give people," she said. "I feel an upsurge 
of religious feeling today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The panel moderator, Jeff Utter, offered no comments of his own during the 
discussion, which ranged beyond angels and demons to popular accounts of 
near-death experiences and questions about doctrinal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the forum ended, however, Utter, who earned a joint doctorate at 
Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary in New York, said in an 
interview that he is very interested in accounts by people who say they have 
been abducted by space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Utter, pastor of the Congregational Church of Chatsworth, cited especially the 
books "Human Encounters with Aliens," by John Mack, a professor of psychiatry 
at Harvard Medical School, and "Angels and Aliens," by Keith Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is something unprecedented happening here that has a spiritual 
dimension," Utter said.

A SCHOOL WHERE EAST MEETS WEST; EDUCATION: DEGREE PROGRAMS RANGE FROM BUDDHIST 
STUDIES TO GERONTOLOGY AT COLORADO'S NAROPA INSTITUTE, FOUNDED BY A TIBETAN 
SCHOLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1974, an exiled Tibetan scholar invited dozens of artists and spiritual 
leaders to the Colorado foothills to create a new kind of university, blending 
both Eastern and Western traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Naropa Institute has 750 students studying everything from Buddhism 
to African drumming to t'ai chi ch'uan. The school offers 16 bachelor's and 
master's programs, including Buddhist studies, contemplative psychology, 
environmental studies and gerontology. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after Nalanda, an ancient Indian university that emphasized the 
merging of intellect and intuition, the private school continues to attract 
renowned Eastern scholars and Western artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the Fourth of July weekend, the Naropa Institute marked its 20th 
anniversary with a tribute to poet Allen Ginsberg, an emeritus director and 
co-founder of Naropa's Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists attending this year's event included Anne Waldman, Lawrence 
Ferlinghetti, Marianne Faithfull, Ken Kesey, Gary Snyder, Philip Glass, and 
Meredith Monk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg, who now teaches at Brooklyn College, remembers the early days of the 
Naropa Institute as "energetic and outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about institutionalizing that American bohemia and Tibetan Buddhism, 
the crazy wisdom, not fenced in," Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naropa was founded by Oxford-educated Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and fueled, in 
part, by the fascination with Eastern religions in America among Beat 
Generation poets and their counterculture peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lineage through the poets such as Gary Snyder, and certainly Jack 
Kerouac raved about Buddhism in some of his writings, so it was very much in 
the air for me," said Anne Waldman, director of the writing and poetics 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first session, Rinpoche announced Naropa would be a 100-year project, 
"where East meets West and sparks can fly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the other people that were around him at that time viewed it as, 'OK, 
we'll do it for the summer and see what happens,' " said President John Cobb. 
"Then 2,500 people showed up and they realized they had something going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics was founded by Ginsberg and 
Waldman the next year. The name was a conundrum, said Waldman, on the school's 
lack of a building at that time and the spectral presence of its namesake, 
writer Jack Kerouac, who had long since died. 
</P>
<P>
 "So disembodied in the sense that people were no longer here and teaching in 
their bodies but there was a sense of this alive lineage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In those first years, "Allen and I were rooming together . . . and we stayed 
up all night designing our academy of the future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an international school and we would have poetic chairs . . . the 
Emily Dickinson school of silent scribbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have a chair of Arabic poetry but we'd fill it with a young Israeli 
poet. You know, some idea of really getting the world together." 
</P>
<P>
 The writing program has since been franchised, with a sister school in Vienna, 
Die Schule fur Dichtung, with regular exchanges of both faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman recalls those early years, when a handful of loyal students met in 
classrooms without heat at a school without accreditation. The school was 
accredited in 1986 by the North-Central Assn. of Colleges and Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Naropa faculty members are still paid less than at other schools, and most 
have outside work. Waldman says other struggles included the lack of fax 
machines, parking spaces and desks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of the faculty who work here do so out of inspiration, vision, and 
real commitment to this fledgling project, and you have to see it that way," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman says the rewards include teaching in a tight community of thinkers and 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "A student coming in who expects, 'I pay my money, I'm here and this is what 
I'm going to get' -- that's completely shattered from Day One," she said. 
"They're going to see our suffering, going to see our heartbreak, the despair 
that goes with being a creator." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Eastern thought permeates the Naropa atmosphere, Waldman says students 
aren't pressured to convert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naropa itself has cut ties with the church so to speak, so it's basically a 
secular school with a contemplative backdrop," Waldman said. "Students aren't 
coming here to be Buddhist." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of degree students has doubled in the past four years and Cobb, a 
former Boulder lawyer, says the desired peak is 1,000 students by the year 
2000. Both the writing and psychology departments capped enrollment for the 
first time in the school's history. Two-thirds of its students come from 
outside Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is largely tuition-dependent, but has been helped by federal money 
and anonymous endowments. And a recent Gap clothing chain ad featuring Ginsberg 
has created new scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Naropa's new library is named after Ginsberg and includes audio- and videotape 
archives of poetry readings, as well as rare Eastern holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg is in residence all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the tradition of Buddhist structure, the lineage of one generation 
passing their wisdom to the next, the relation between the teacher and the 
student is very strong," Ginsberg said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AIDS GROUP FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST RADIO HOST; 
LANCASTER: CATALYST FOUNDATION ALLEGES HERB NERO'S ON-AIR REMARKS 'CLEARLY 
CROSSED THE LINE OF HUMAN DECENCY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An AIDS education and support group has filed a complaint with federal 
authorities, alleging that a Lancaster radio talk show host made offensive and 
obscene comments to a local resident during a live broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference on Friday, members of the Lancaster-based Catalyst 
Foundation for AIDS Awareness and Care displayed an Aug. 3 complaint letter the 
group sent to the Federal Communications Commission. The complaint alleges that 
remarks made by KHJ-AM radio host Herb Nero "clearly crossed the line of human 
decency." 
</P>
<P>
 Physician Susan F. Lawrence, who founded Catalyst, said that on July 29 Brian 
Maxey, the organization's vice president, was engaged in a heated on-air 
discussion with Nero, which culminated in Maxey calling Nero a derogatory name. 
 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lawrence, Nero replied with a demeaning term for homosexuals, 
then said, "I hope you die of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged that the radio host was reacting to being called a nasty 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, this does not justify wishing death from a horrible illness on 
another human being," Lawrence said. "We are asking the FCC to investigate this 
situation and make a determination as to whether wishing death by a terrible 
disease to a caller on the air constitutes indecent and obscene programming." 
</P>
<P>
 Catalyst members, who appeared Friday with supporters from gay organizations 
and AIDS support groups from Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, also 
charged that Nero spread misinformation and promoted hatred in connection with 
the Antelope Valley Gay Pride festival, held last month in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Vierra, program director at KHJ, said the conservative talk show host 
does not remember uttering all of the remarks described in Catalyst's 
complaint, and the program was not taped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sat down and talked to him about what may have been a better way to 
handle things," Vierra said, adding that Nero apologized during his next show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vierra said the FCC complaint is not justified. "The tone of Herb's show 
and his comments may have been tasteless and may have been offensive to some 
people, but they certainly weren't obscene." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Diamond, an attorney with the FCC's enforcement division in Washington, 
D.C., said Friday that the Catalyst group's complaint had not yet been 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the FCC does not address whether a broadcaster's comments are 
factual, only whether they violate the rules against airing obscene or indecent 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say a lot of ugly things on the air," Diamond said. "Not all of them 
are violations of the law. They may not be nice, but they may not be illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC complaint was not the first time the Catalyst group has challenged an 
Antelope Valley business on AIDS-related issues. Last year, the group 
complained to state officials about a Lancaster mortuary owner who refused to 
handle the funerals of people who died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar prompted the funeral director to reverse his policy. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Catalyst organized a march in support of Antelope Valley Gay 
Pride festival after some local residents vowed to picket the event. Only a 
handful of picketers actually showed up for the event.

 Operators of the Agua Dulce Air Park plan to show off a new communications 
system Sunday that will turn this local airstrip into an emergency information 
center during a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The open house, which begins at 11 a.m., will include a ham radio 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham radio operators plan to contact others across the country and have them 
make telephone calls to friends and relatives of Agua Dulce residents. 
Organizers say this would be useful if local telephone lines were damaged. 
</P>

 Organizers say they bought the special equipment after receiving a 
loud-and-clear message from the Northridge earthquake that communications are 
important in the wake of a disaster. The purchase is part of an effort to 
update the tiny airport's 15-year-old disaster plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just a demonstration of our ham radio facilities," said Vic 
Crowe, a member of the Agua Dulce Airport Assn. "We can anticipate in the event 
of a disaster, people wanting to contact friends out of state if they are 
without phone lines." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny airstrip with its dirt runway was undamaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. Yet those trying to coordinate activities in the days after the 
quake realized they would not have known what to do had telephone lines been 
broken.  
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they also are updating emergency preparations, such as 
making a list of pilots' addresses, fuel and passenger capacity of planes 
stored there and the location of on-site emergency generators. A list is also 
being compiled with the names and addresses of elderly and disabled Agua Dulce 
residents who might need special attention after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also seeking arrangements to have a bulldozer on hand to repair 
possible damage to the air park's dirt runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The air park's role after a catastrophe is the latest topic in a long-running 
debate here among residents, pilots and government officials. Each group has 
different ideas for the future of the 25-year-old air park, which is up for 
sale by its private owner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials would like a general aviation facility in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, but many residents want the air park to either shut down 
or to remain a small facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots say purchase by the county would keep the airport from being closed and 
the land developed. But those living nearby fear county ownership would bring 
more planes, traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, the strip transported five law enforcement 
officers from Santa Clarita to San Fernando and Santa Monica. Several insurance 
adjusters also used the strip to travel into the San Fernando Valley. Utility 
company representatives arrived by aircraft to check oil and telephone lines, 
and private pilots gained access to family and friends difficult to reach 
because of damaged freeways.

IT'S ALL GREEK TO U.S.; BASKETBALL: RUSSIA FALLS, 111-94, AND GREECE PROMISES 
TO REST ITS THREE TOP PLAYERS AGAINST AMERICANS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 America meets Greece today in the World Championship semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tune in and watch the splash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks played their best three players sparingly during Friday's 81-55 
loss to Croatia and promised to do the same thing against the United States, 
which dropped Russia, 111-94, in the second game before 27,083 in Skydome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks are resting for the next day they think they have a chance to win, 
Sunday's (presumed) bronze medal game against the Russia-Croatia loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior, often called tanking, would be scandalous in the United States 
but is commonplace in international play, which is why the Greeks happily 
admitted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are very hard fighters," said Greek Coach Makos Dendrinos. "The 
players and the public saw before the tournament started that the final would 
be between Croatia and the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a more realistic goal on Sunday (the bronze medal) that we are trying 
to achieve. We are going to enjoy (today's) game and we'll be giving everything 
we have on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 That will be a welcome relief. Meanwhile, no one is getting upset. FIBA head 
Boris Stankovic, asked about it, said, laughing: "It's not first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did it bother the U.S. players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just playing the percentages," said Kevin Johnson, laughing. "Those 
Greeks are shrewd. They've got Plato, Socrates, all those guys. They know what 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans actually had to play for a while to put away the pesky Russians, 
on whom they had vowed revenge for those Olympic defeats in 1972 and 1988, and 
whatever else they could tack on to the bill of indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when your little brother comes home beaten up," said Reggie Miller 
before the game, referring to Russia's recent victory over U.S. collegians in 
the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you smack him for getting beaten up. Then you go find the guy who beat 
him up and you beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans smacked the Russians on Friday but for a while, the Russians 
smacked them back. The guards, Sergei Barazevich and Sergei Babkov, are NBA 
prospects as is small forward Mikhail Mikhailov. Barazevich kept breaking down 
the defense with spins and drives, the Russians moved the ball beautifully and 
at halftime, the United States was only up, 52-44. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians were within 56-51 with 3:06 gone in the second half but then the 
roof fell in on them in the shape of Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal scored 11 points 
in a 20-6 run and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 With 9:15 left, Russian Coach Sergei Belov pulled his three best players but 
the game was already over.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been easy to play second-rank players but we respect the 
audience," said Belov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were by far the smartest team we played," said Joe Dumars. "I 
enjoyed playing this game because they make you play pure basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 In a reversal of form, the U.S. players conducted themselves like gentlemen. 
They stopped looking for an opponent to glare at after dunks and bellowing to 
the skies in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coach) Don Nelson made it a special point," said Kevin Johnson. "We don't 
want to disrespect people. If that had been how it was misconstrued, everybody 
took it on themselves to tone it down a little bit."

MARTINEZ JOINS UPSET VICTIMS; TENNIS: TOP-SEEDED PLAYER AND WIMBLEDON CHAMPION 
IS BEATEN BY AMY FRAZIER IN STRAIGHT SETS; NOVOTNA, GARRISON-JACKSON ALSO BOW 
OUT.

<P>
 Now who's left in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Martina Navratilova on the sidelines Friday was top-seeded Conchita 
Martinez, who was upset by Amy Frazier in the quarterfinals before 3,500 at the 
Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier will play Sabine Appelmans of Belgium in today's semifinal, after 
Appelmans upset fourth-seeded Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 4-6, 
6-4, further depleting the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-seeded Julie Halard of France, the highest seeded player left, and Ann 
Grossman will play in the other semifinal. Halard beat Patrica Hy, 3-6, 6-2, 
6-4, and Grossman defeated fifth-seeded Zina Garrison-Jackson, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 
6-2, in a 2-hour 36-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing Kimiko Date, Lindsay Davenport, Mary Pierce, Natalia Zvereva, 
Gabriela Sabatini and Lori McNeil, all of whom dropped out before the 
tournament because of injuries, the event lost its  
</P>
<P>
 marquee players to unheralded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova was ousted in the third round Thursday by Grossman. Perhaps even 
more surprising, however, was Frazier's victory over Martinez, the Wimbledon 
champion ranked third in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, from Barcelona, improved her baseline game this year as well as her 
fortitude. She became the first Spanish woman to win Wimbledon, defeating 
Navratilova in an emotional three-set final last month. By doing so, Martinez 
helped dispel the idea that Spanish players are nothing but clay-court 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 And after routing Elena Likhvotseva in the third round Thursday night, 6-0, 
6-0, Martinez seemed likely to cruise into Sunday's L.A. final. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impeccable game of Thursday was missing Friday and Martinez was 
vulnerable against Frazier, 21, of Rochester Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked 26th, Frazier has had a modicum of success. She reached the 
quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 1992, but has been unable to find the 
consistency to crack the top 10 rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Frazier spent six months struggling with health problems. She did 
not come back strong. This summer, she lost in the first rounds of the French 
Open and Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Those humbling experiences, among others, have quelled her emotions. Instead 
of exulting, Frazier said of her victory, "This is (simply) one match." 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be a breakthrough, but it was the biggest victory of her season. 
After taking a 3-0 lead in the second set with two breaks, Frazier faced a 
stiff challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Using her loopy topspin strokes to mix up the attack, Martinez won four 
consecutive games for a 4-3 lead. But Frazier served well to hold, and then did 
not falter. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would pull it out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not about to happen. The players held serve to force a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Martinez had little fight when it counted most. She fell behind, 5-0, 
when she mis-hit a forehand, hit a drop shot wide, a deep backhand wide, 
another backhand into the net and a forehand long after Frazier's nice service 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to appreciate (her play)," Martinez said. "She played 
unbelievable. She was pushing me. I was all the time on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Martinez saw something special in her opponent's game, Frazier was not 
quite sure how she did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier does know that if she wants to become a force on the women's tour, she 
must improve her serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs quite a bit of work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova once said of Frazier: "She hits the ball hard, so you really have 
to be ready for her. If she served better, she'd be really dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that ever happens remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, 19-11 this year, lost to Martinez in the third round of the 
Australian Open, 6-3, 6-0. But Friday she was able to pressure Martinez into 
uncharacteristic errors by playing patiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I try to hit a winner too early," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier tried to jump-start a career early by skipping college. She had seven 
national singles titles to her credit as a high school junior. During those 
days on the junior circuit in the Midwest, Frazier got to know Grossman, from 
Grove City, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until 1991 and '92 that Frazier gained some attention by reaching 
the fourth round at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has to be satisfied with defeating someone of Martinez's 
caliber even in a minor tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And enjoy it as well.

MORNING BRIEFING: STRUGGLING JORDAN WORTH PRICE OF ADMISSION IN FAN GIMMICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On television, on posters, just about anywhere you look, Michael Jordan has 
been marketed (and marketed and marketed) for his triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Memphis Chicks figured, why not market his mediocrity? 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicks, who in their last home game Monday play Jordan's Birmingham 
Barons, have announced that Jordan's batting average at the start of play will 
determine the price of general admission tickets that day. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jordan is hitting .195, tickets will be $1.95. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has been made of Michael Jordan and his batting average," said Chick 
President David Hersh. "This is a way for us to have some fun with it and 
hopefully the fans will benefit from the lower price." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jordan: General admission tickets at Memphis' Tim McCarver Stadium are 
regularly $5, and Jordan's batting average as of Thursday was .191. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement that just might fire up Jordan's competitive instincts, Chick 
spokesman Mark McClellan said he figures the price will be $1.90 by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: The run-and-shoot Houston Oilers added former Ram Pat Carter last 
off-season and plan to play him as their first regular tight end in five years. 
Who last caught a pass for the Oilers as a tight end in the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
 How'd they do that?If any team was going to feel the effects of the NFL salary 
cap, shouldn't it have been the San Francisco 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
 That's apparently what a lot of other clubs are wondering about the 
perennially high-paying team that found ways to sign high-profile free agents 
Ken Norton, Richard Dent and Rickey Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been accused by half the league already," owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. 
said. "Some are trying to find out how we're cheating." 
</P>
<P>
 One way the 49ers maneuvered under the cap was to load up the contracts with 
incentives for this season, which, if reached, will count against the 49ers' 
1995 salary structure, sending it well beyond cap limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say it has made DeBartolo a bit proud of himself and his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said it before and will continue to say it," DeBartolo said. "We have 
the best organization in football. Teams that win and are competitive have a 
certain aura about them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Joe DiMaggio hit 47 home runs in 1937 but that wasn't his 
rookie season, as Morning Briefing reported in Friday's editions. DiMaggio's 
rookie season was 1936. He hit 29 homers that year. 
</P>
<P>
 When you explain it . . . The Philadelphia Inquirer's Jayson Stark figured 
that one team that might be looking forward to a long strike would be the 
Seattle Mariners, who have been on a long trip because of problems with the 
Kingdome ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong, says Mariner outfielder Jay Buhner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way," Buhner told Stark, "I've got a chance to lose a 
million bucks if we strike. So you tell me if it's good or bad. Somehow, I 
think I could suck it up for a couple of more months for a million bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bob Morosko, in 1989. 
</P>

Richard Ravitch's responses to baseball players' questions: "He just brings out 
a story. He's like Aesop, but there's no moral." TIM KAWAKAMI

FREDRICKSON HITS GROUND LEARNING; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER ROOKIE LINEBACKER 
ENDURES WHIRLWIND START AS HE ADJUSTS TO PLAYING MIDDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life has been a blur for Rob Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
 When the summer began, he was home in Michigan, waiting to sign his first pro 
contract with the Raiders, who had made him a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 When negotiations stalled, Fredrickson, unable to sit still, came out to 
California and moved in with his agent, Bruce Allen, in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine days, a contract agreement was reached and Fredrickson moved to 
training camp at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But after only five days, he was on his way to Barcelona for an exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then back to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 On to Dallas for another exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Back again to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Fredrickson is in Pittsburgh, where the unbeaten Raiders (2-0) will 
play the Steelers (0-1) tonight at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a whirlwind itinerary might exhaust the most secure veteran. For a young 
rookie trying to not only learn the pro game, but also a new position -- he has 
been moved from outside linebacker into the middle -- this living out of a 
suitcase only adds to the uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if Fredrickson can relax once he gets on the field. That's where 
things really blur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot happening in there," said Raider Coach Art Shell of the middle 
linebacker position. "There's a lot of traffic in there. You have a tackle 
coming at you. You have a guard coming at you. You've got the center coming at 
you. You've got the tight end coming at you. And sometimes, they'll bring the 
wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson, competing with second-year man Greg Biekert for the starting 
position, desperately wants to get a passing grade in his summer cram course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the pressure," Fredrickson admitted. "I want to live up to 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also feels the difference now that he is no longer an outside 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had maybe a half-second to a second more to analyze the play 
(on the outside)," he said. "In the middle, you've got to go now or you're 
going to be out of position to make the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it's been happening to me a lot the first couple of games. I've got 
to stop thinking and start reacting. I'm just now starting to get the grasp of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first game, I was nervous and all over the place, out of control, 
overrunning plays. I've got to settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is the time to learn for players like Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Crucial for the Raiders is the development of a running game to supplement 
their explosive passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 They have shown they can throw deep with the best of them. They began with a 
75-yard touchdown pass on their first play of their first game and have filled 
the sky with footballs ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this activity in the air has left them with little opportunity to 
smooth out their operations on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have gained only 254 yards rushing in their two games. The most 
yardage by any individual back is 32 by Harvey Williams in the opener against 
the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the Raider quarterbacks to spend more time handing off tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Raiders are on defense, look for Fredrickson. He'll be the guy in 
the middle, trying to clear up the blur in his vision. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Chester McGlockton and wide receiver Alexander Wright are 
questionable for tonight's game. McGlockton is still nursing the bruised leg he 
suffered last week against the Dallas Cowboys. Wright has missed both 
exhibition games because of an injured calf muscle. Coach Art Shell doesn't 
like the idea of either testing their sore legs on the artificial turf at Three 
Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third exhibition between these two clubs, but the first in nearly 
two decades. The Steelers won, 20-6, in Pittsburgh in 1970, and the Raiders 
evened the series with a 24-21 victory at Berkeley in 1975. . . . The Steelers 
lost their exhibition opener last week to the Miami Dolphins, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steeler to watch is wide receiver Charles Johnson, the team's first-round 
draft choice. He caught four passes last week for 77 yards and a touchdown. . . 
. Running back Barry Foster, who missed the final seven games of last season 
because of an ankle injury, will make his first appearance of the exhibition 
season tonight.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; CARDINALS SIGN NO. 1 MILLER, 
MARSHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals Friday signed linebacker Jamir Miller, the last 
first-round draft choice to sign, and added veteran linebacker Wilber Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the No. 10 selection overall out of UCLA, was the lone Cardinal 
holdout after second-round pick Chuck Levy reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, played under Buddy Ryan with the 
Chicago Bears in 1984-88 and with the Houston Oilers last season, but was 
hampered by a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, a veteran of the Bears' 1985 Super Bowl champion team and the 1991 
Washington Redskins' championship team, reportedly was paid $1.5 million last 
season plus a $1.4 million signing bonus. The Arizona Republic said Friday that 
Marshall was expected to get $300,000 to $500,000 plus incentives from the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller signed a four-year deal worth between $4 million and $5 million, 
according to the suburban Tribune Newspapers and the Phoenix Gazette. He 
reportedly got a bonus of more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana, making his his first start of the exhibition season, led the 
Kansas City Chiefs on two scoring drives while completing 11 of 20 passes for 
118 yards in the first half of a 17-14 victory over the Washington Redskins at 
RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Bono played an equally error-free second half, and helped put the Chiefs 
ahead with a 42-yard touchdown pass to Donnell Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young completed seven of 10 passes for 74 yards in a quarter of play, 
including his first exhibition touchdown pass, as the San Francisco 49ers 
defeated the Denver Broncos, 20-3, at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway was held to three completions in nine attempts for 23 yards and 
Richard Dent and Ken Norton, two of San Francisco's defensive free-agent 
acquisitions, both turned in strong efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff George passed for two touchdowns and Bobby Hebert, in his first 
appearance since underdoing elbow surgery in February, engineered two field 
goal drives as the Atlanta Falcons beat the Buffalo Bills, 27-7, at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Leonard Russell, released by the New England Patriots in a 
contract dispute, agreed to a contract with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell was in attendance Friday night at the Broncos' exhibition game against 
the 49ers at San Francisco. He strengthens a backfield that already includes 
Rod Bernstine, Glyn Milburn and Robert Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
 Nose tackle Greg Kragen turned down an offer to return to the Broncos, saying 
he was willing to take less money but was uncomfortable as a backup.

 Jill McGill moved closer to her second consecutive U.S. Women's Amateur title 
by rallying for a 1-up victory over 1994 NCAA champion Emilee Klein on Friday 
at Hot Springs, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really am happy just to make it back to the finals," said McGill, whose 
outlook might have been tempered by the golfer waiting for her in today's 
36-hole championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Ward shot a six-under-par 30 on the front nine en route to a 7-and-5 
rout of Andrea Baxter at The Homestead resort. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill, who recently completed her college career at USC, is familiar with 
Ward, a rising senior at Arizona State who finished second in this year's NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a super player," McGill said, shaking her head. "It'll be a tough 
match."

 Isao Aoki, Jim Albus, Graham Marsh and Jimmy Powell shot six-under-par 66s to 
share a one-stroke lead in the $650,000 Senior PGA First of America tournament 
at Ada, Mich. Larry Mowry, Tom Wargo and Dave Stockton were tied for fifth at 
67. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki's round included an eagle on the 534-yard, par-five No. 7. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Janice Gibson, never a winner or even a leader in nine years as a pro, shot a 
six-under-par 66 for her lowest round ever and a one-stroke lead in the first 
round of the Children's Medical Center LPGA tournament at Beavercreek, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, 33, had missed the cut in her last three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dibos of Peru was second at 67, with Jill Briles-Hinton, Barb Thomas 
and Rosie Jones another stroke back.

NEWSWIRE: TORRENCE EASILY WINS TITLE IN 200 METERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gwen Torrence ran the fastest time in the world this year in the women's 200 
meters at the Pan Africa-USA dual meet at Duke University's Wallace Wade 
Stadium in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrence's time of 21.85 seconds broke the stadium record of 22.28 set by 1984 
Olympic gold medalist Valerie Brisco in 1987 and the meet record of 23.06 set 
by Alice Annum of Ghana in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrence was in front quickly and was never threatened, defeating runner-up 
Dannette Young by six meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Mutola of Mozambique, the 1993 world champion in the women's 800 meters, 
also broke stadium and meet records in extending her two-year winning streak to 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading throughout, Mutola was timed in 1:58.15 in beating five-time U.S. 
champion Joetta Clark by three meters. The previous stadium record was 1:59.11 
by Suzy Favor in 1990 and the old meet record was 2:01.60 by Madeline 
Manning-Jackson in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the overwhelming favorite in the women's 100 hurdles, 
struggled to win in 13.12, barely ahead of Nicole Ramalalanirina of Africa 
(13.14) and Olympic silver medalist LaVonna Martin-Floreal (13.15). 
</P>
<P>
 Meet records were set by Frankie Fredericks of Namibia in the men's 200 
(:20.23) and Maicel Malone in the women's 400 (50.71). In the long jump, Mike 
Powell -- bothered by sore hamstrings and a tender left heel -- won with a leap 
of 26 feet 3 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 It was announced that Gail Devers, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist in the 100 
meters and American record holder in the 100-meter hurdles, will sit out the 
remainder of the track and field season because of a left hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't get well until a couple of weeks ago just after her last training 
bouts," said Devers' coach, Bob Kersee. "She is not up to par where I wanted 
her, so I just decided to back her off for the rest of the season and have her 
concentrate on getting totally healthy and being prepared for 1995."

 Defending champion Michael Chang advanced to the semifinals of the $1.72 
million ATP Championship the same way he did last year, beating Jason 
Stoltenberg in Friday's quarterfinals, 6-1, 3-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a different Jason Stoltenberg than last year," Chang said of the 
Australian, who has been the hottest player on the men's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been playing well this summer. If he keeps it up, he's going to be a 
dangerous player," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But again this year, Stoltenberg could not overcome Chang's dogged 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the sort of player you've got to beat. He is not going to beat 
himself," Stoltenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's semifinals, Chang will face David Wheaton, who upset seventh-seeded 
Jim Courier, 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Michael Stich of Germany beat Alex O'Brien, 6-2, 6-4, and will 
play Stefan Edberg of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg lost the first set to Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 5-7, won the second, 
6-4, and then advanced to the semifinals when Mansdorf had to retire because of 
a pulled muscle in his right calf. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury occurred midway through the first set, and Mansdorf had the calf 
wrapped. He aggravated the injury later in the set but played on, winning 
points with slashing returns that prevented Edberg from hitting to his crippled 
backhand, before finally deciding he was unable to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed he was struggling, but I couldn't move him around because I 
couldn't keep the ball on the court," Edberg said.

PGA CHAMPIONSHIP / DAILY REPORT; PALMER'S 20-FOOT PUTT GOES IN, BUT HE'S OUT -- 
FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer made his last, long walk up the 18th fairway at his 37th and 
final PGA Championship, the one major he never won and never will. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, 64, shot a 74 and missed the cut with a 36-hole total of 153. But he 
finished with a flourish, rolling in a 20-foot putt on the last hole for par. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best putt of the day," Palmer said. "It was my only made putt." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after playing in his last U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club, not 
far from his hometown of Latrobe, Pa., Palmer closed the book on the PGA. It 
remains the only major title he never won. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer finished second in three PGAs, the last time in 1970 when Dave Stockton 
won at Southern Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be fitting that I ended it here," Palmer said. "It is over. If I 
thought I had a game that could win the PGA Championship, I would be back to 
play, but this is an appropriate time to give it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer intends to continue to play in the Masters and might play in the 
British Open next year at St. Andrews, where he played his first British Open 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be the last for that, too," Palmer said. "If my game is in any 
kind of shape at all, I will go back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Nick Price's five-stroke lead after 36 holes is a PGA 
Championship record. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous mark was four shots, by Tommy Aaron in 1967, Gil Morgan in 1976, 
Tom Watson in 1978 and Greg Norman in 1986. None of them won. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalism and majors don't mix, according to Corey Pavin. No American golfer 
has won a major this year but it doesn't make any difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all here playing individual golf," he added. "Where we're from, it 
doesn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear it out there on the golf course that they want a U.S. player to win 
and I hope it's this U.S. player that wins, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly shot his second 73 and missed the cut by a shot with his 146. He 
didn't miss what Nick Price has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just thinks he can make everything," Daly said. "He isn't seeing any trees 
and he doesn't see any part of the green except the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Paul Azinger missed the cut by four strokes. He followed 
his opening 75 with a 74, after a start of birdie, double-bogey, double-bogey.

BULLFROGS BEAT CALGARY WITH 3 SHOOTOUT GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs broke a four-game losing streak with an 8-7 shootout victory 
over Calgary in a Roller Hockey International game in front of 1,684 Friday at 
Max Bell Centre in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 7-7, at the end of regulation and the Bullfrogs scored 
three times and Rad'z none in the shootout.Brad McCaughey scored the clinching 
goal in the shootout for the Bullfrogs (13-7-1). Calgary is 11-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs, the league's defending champions, move into second place with 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was pressure on both teams in regards to their finish in the 
standings," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. "It was good for us because the 
game went back and forth, which is typical of a playoff game. It was a great 
motivator." 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 3-3, at the half, and, 5-5, entering the fourth quarter. 
Calgary scored early in the quarter. But the Bullfrogs came back to tie on a 
goal from Bobby McKillop. Anaheim capitalized on a two-man advantage to take a 
7-6 lead on a goal by Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary tied the score with about 45 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 McKillop had three goals, for Anaheim, which ends the regular season with a 
game Sunday at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really big win for us," McKillop said. "All week we really worked 
hard and got back that fighting spirit. Now we have that fear of losing in us, 
but we really thrive on winning. Our goal from Day 1 was to win the 
championship for Anaheim, and if we do, nobody will remember this little 
slide."

SHUNNED BY NCAA, CEMAN FOUND GOOD GAME ON BEACH; VOLLEYBALL: WHEN STANFORD 
DIDN'T GO TO TOURNAMENT, SETTER STARTED MAKING MONEY ON TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in May, the selection committee for the NCAA volleyball Final Four 
snubbed Stanford's at-large bid and sent a bitter Canyon Ceman packing for the 
pro beach volleyball tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Ceman is pulling upsets at major beach tournaments and 
getting paychecks to play a sport he digs. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was he so bitter as he sat in the media tent Friday at the $100,000 
Miller Lite Open? Just bring up his senior season as Stanford's starting 
setter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's well after the fact, but Ceman still lobbies for the Cardinal's entry to 
the NCAA tournament. UCLA earned an automatic berth by winning the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation tournament, but Stanford, the runner-up, didn't 
receive the conference's traditional at-large bid despite being ranked third 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, an at-large bid went to the tournament's host team, Indiana 
Purdue-Ft. Wayne, which was ranked much lower. And to make matters worse, 
top-ranked UCLA lost in the final to Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't hear much about this, but yeah, I'm still bitter about not getting 
invited," Ceman said. "Penn State wouldn't have won if we would have been 
there, I guarantee it. It was bull, plain and simple. A political impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Geez Canyon, lighten up a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Life isn't so bad in the world of big-time volleyball. Good pay, plenty of 
sun, free grub in the players' tent and, well, the scenery at courtside isn't 
pretty decent too. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Ceman gets to play against the top beach players around -- Karch Kiraly, 
Kent Steffes, Randy Stoklos, Adam Johnson, Mike Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as everyone is finding out, Ceman has proved he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 He and new partner Dan Vrebalovich of Culver City, seeded 11th, upset 
sixth-seeded Scott Ayakatubby and Brent Frohoff, 15-4, in the second round 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 They advanced to today's quarterfinals against 14th-seeded Brian Gatzke and 
Jeff Rogers, who surprised third-seeded Adam Johnson and Randy Stoklos, 14-11, 
in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 After the match, Ceman was more than a little surprised by how easily he and 
Vrebalovich handled veteran players such as Frohoff and Ayakatubby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have never predicted this," Ceman said. "We knew we would be in it, 
but we never thought it would be such a blowout. We were just serving well and 
hitting the back line." 
</P>

 Vrebalovich and Ceman are playing only their second tournament together, 
coming off a ninth-place finish last weekend at Santa Cruz. Ceman had played on 
the tour for two years as an amateur with David Swatik, a former Manhattan 
Beach Mira Costa High teammate, but the two split up two weeks ago after a 
25th-place finish at Belmar, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "David and I played well together at the beginning of the season," Ceman said. 
"But for some reason, we just hadn't done well the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played with Al Janc for a tournament in Puerto Rico earlier. Then, after 
Belmar, Dan called me and I would have been a fool not to jump at the chance to 
play with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Swatik teamed with tour veteran John Hanley, but the dropped into the losers' 
bracket on the first day at Seal Beach. Ceman, who was courtside at some of 
Swatik's matches, added that their split might be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll play together in the future," Ceman said. "I think this was a 
good move for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Swatik and Ceman, who led Mira Costa High to a three-game sweep of Edison in 
the 1990 Southern Section finals, burst on the pro beach scene in 1992 at the 
prestigious Manhattan Beach Open. They finished 17th, respectable for 
newcomers, but caught the attention of the volleyball world by pushing 
top-rated Kiraly and Steffes in an early match. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 5,000 fans poured out of downtown Manhattan Beach that afternoon, 
circling the court as Swatik and Ceman tied it, 9-9, before Steffes and Kiraly 
scored the final six points to win, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a day," Ceman remembers. "Everyone I've ever known was down there that 
day cheering for us. I remember when it was 9-9, I was like 'Whoa, what's going 
on here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Ceman no longer swallows hard when he gets in a close match. 
Too many poundings in the losers' bracket has taught him that. 
</P>
<P>
 He played as an amateur only to gain experience, turning down $4,000 in prize 
money because accepting it would have been an NCAA violation and probably cost 
him his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 His college career now over, Ceman doesn't have an NCAA championship ring but 
he does find a paycheck in his mailbox every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bank had called me and told me I could have my prize money directly 
deposited to my account," he said. "But I said no. I wanted to see that check 
every week. It's nice to make some money doing something you would be doing 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 After the beach season ends in September, Ceman will be playing for little 
more than a stipend -- trying out with the U.S. national team in San Diego in 
November. Competition for roster spots will be tough, especially at the setter 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give it a try," he said. "I think I can hang."

O.C. COUPLE PULL TRASH ON TELEMARKETING FIRM; INQUIRY: NEWPORT DUO DUG THROUGH 
GARBAGE BINS TO COMPILE INFORMATION. FINDINGS LED TO THE PROBE OF BROADCAST 
HOLDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bonnie Morrison describes herself as a homemaker and a churchgoer. 
</P>
<P>
 She and husband Mitchell, a financial marketing executive, live with their two 
children in a rambling ranch-style home in the Dover Shores section of Newport 
Beach, where houses routinely sell for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Bonnie Morrison is not a person one would expect to be pawing 
through garbage bins at night. But for three weeks last spring, that's just 
what she did. Those nocturnal exploits capped more than a year of private 
detective work by the couple and resulted in an ongoing state and local 
investigation of a suspected telemarketing boiler room operation that raised 
more than $5 million from investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Broadcast Holdings Inc., is owned by a man with a previous state 
securities fraud conviction. Affiliated with it was an Irvine lawyer who has 
been involved in increasingly bitter litigation with the Morrisons -- former 
business and social partners -- for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morrisons weren't among the investors in Broadcast Holdings. Their quest 
stemmed from their business dispute with attorney Arthur A. Graves III. While 
trying to dig up dirt on Graves, the couple stumbled onto the telemarketing 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials freely admit that if the Morrisons hadn't become 
citizen detectives -- and especially if Bonnie Morrison, 39, hadn't hitched her 
5-foot-2 frame over the edge of a garbage bin a dozen times in March to early 
April -- there would be no investigation of Broadcast Holdings and its 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when budget cuts and escalating violence have made white-collar 
crime investigations a luxury in most police agencies, law enforcement 
officials say the do-it-yourself approach is often the only way an aggrieved 
party can get a case opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many of these cases out there, we could never get to all of 
them" without citizens' help, said Barbara Babcock, an agent with the FBI's 
securities fraud unit in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Morrison, though thrilled with the work that Newport Beach Police Sgt. 
Albert Fisher has done on the case subsequently, puts it a bit more harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system was allowing us to be raped" in the dispute with Graves, she said. 
"Everyone we approached was reluctant to do anything. We sent information to 
the state attorney general, the Federal Communications Commission, the 
(California) Department of Corporations, the FBI. . . . They didn't deny that 
something bad was going on, but they all said they didn't have the manpower or 
were busy with other, bigger cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Graves could not be reached for comment. Through a public relations agent, he 
denied any wrongdoing and said that the Morrisons are in a personal vendetta 
because of a business dispute with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morrisons said they discovered as they investigated Graves' business 
dealings that he had ties to Broadcast Holdings. But they didn't pursue that 
link immediately. On their way home from church one Sunday in March, Bonnie 
Morrison said she happened to glance at a brick office building on Red Hill 
Avenue in Costa Mesa and spotted a sign for the offices of Broadcast Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something just told me, ' Look in the trash,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bag of paperwork and lunch leftovers that she pulled from the bin that 
afternoon "told me right away that something was wrong," Bonnie Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Bonnie Morrison found that day was a telemarketing script that 
Broadcast Holdings gave its salespeople. A notation on one page, she recalls, 
cautioned, "Never let the customer take control of the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she began making midnight visits to the garbage bin on Red Hill 
Avenue. "We had to go late at night," she said, "so we'd get there after the 
janitors had done their work and dumped the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband or a neighbor would always accompany her and keep watch in the 
parking lot, she said. She did the digging herself, she said, because her 
42-year-old husband, a muscular six-footer, "has had seven knee surgeries and 
has a bad back." Besides, she said, "he's too big to get into a Dumpster. I'm 
more agile." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Fisher said he met Morrison one morning in March when she walked into his 
office with a handful of Broadcast Holdings paperwork. Some of it had been 
pieced together by Morrison and obviously had been run through an office 
shredder previously, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she did was absolutely essential to this case," said Fisher, now a 
patrol supervisor with the Newport Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast Holdings was involved in selling investors -- many of them retired 
-- a stake in what its sales agents represented as a series of wireless 
cable-TV networks. Wireless systems work like regular cable but are less 
expensive to install because the operator doesn't have to string wires to each 
customer's house. 
</P>
<P>
 There are legitimate wireless cable operators, but state and local law 
enforcement officials say that the field has become a fertile one for scamsters 
who sell shares in nonexistent systems based on promises of huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, bolstered by opinions from fraud specialists in the state Department 
of Commerce that Broadcast Holdings was involved in illegal activity, Fisher 
used the information Bonnie Morrison had culled from the trash to get a search 
warrant. On May 25, police raided Broadcast Holdings' Costa Mesa office and 
seized records of what officials maintain was a boiler room operation that was 
raising millions of dollars peddling illegal, unregistered investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast Holdings has since moved to Laguna Hills. Its owner, Greg Moeller, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said Moeller is "well known" to the Newport Beach police and that he 
has a previous securities fraud conviction in California.  
</P>
<P>
 The case grew out of Morrison's disenchantment with the way that attorney 
Graves, who has offices in Irvine and Century City, did business. A lengthy 
list of allegations against Graves has been forwarded by Morrison to the State 
Bar of California. A bar official said the association cannot comment unless a 
complaint results in formal charges against a member by the Bar's committee on 
discipline. Graves has not been charged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison, however, said bar officials have told him they are investigating his 
complaints and are also looking at Graves' involvement with Broadcast Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the public relations spokesman, Graves issued a statement Friday 
acknowledging that he is general managing partner of a company called Broadcast 
Acquisitions, which has bought stakes in three prospective wireless cable 
systems from Moeller's company. Graves' statement said that he has assisted 
Broadcast Associates' efforts to sell partnership interests but has no 
affiliation with Moeller or his company, Broadcast Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never participated in any illegal activities," the statement said. The 
Morrisons, it continued, have made "false statements" and are "trying to 
destroy my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morrisons' differences with Graves date to 1991, when Mitchell Morrison 
set up shop as a private financial consultant. He met Graves through a business 
acquaintance, he said, and was soon doing consulting work for the attorney, 
whose practice included helping private businesses find investment capital. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1991, however, Morrison no longer was comfortable working with 
Graves, he said, and sought to end their relationship. Early in 1992, Graves 
filed a lawsuit against Morrison alleging that the consultant owed him $14,000. 
He won a $10,000 judgment and later filed a second suit seeking to attach a 
business bank account in which Morrison had funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That, the Morrisons said, is what set them off. "We tried to walk away, and he 
wouldn't let us. He became vindictive," Bonnie Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple began investigating Graves' business activities and compiled a 
thick dossier that resulted in their complaint to the bar association. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morrisons said that their two-year struggle with Graves has drained their 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 In February this year, Graves filed a libel and slander lawsuit against the 
couple. Since then the Morrisons have filed for personal bankruptcy, which in 
effect canceled the $10,000 judgment that they owed to Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has been a nightmare,' Bonnie Morrison said, "and it could 
have been over a long time ago if people had listened when we first started 
complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Police agencies do the best they can with limited resources to devote to 
complicated civil fraud cases, Fisher said. But he adds, in an indirect 
acknowledgment of the inadequacy of the system, "If we had more Mrs. Morrisons, 
we'd have a lot more prosecutions."

CONTINENTAL SETS OFF NEW ROUND OF AIR FARE CUTS; TICKET PRICES SLASHED AS LOW 
AS $318 ROUND TRIP TO EAST COAST; OTHER CARRIERS PLAN TO MATCH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continental Airlines launched a fall air fare sale Friday that slashed airline 
ticket prices from from Orange County to Newark to as low as $318 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Major carriers, including American and USAir, said they will match the fare 
reductions of up to 60%, but only on competitive routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare cuts come despite one of the healthiest summers in recent years for 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to continue this momentum into the fall season," explained Don 
Valentine, senior vice president of Houston-based Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental operates 14 flights a day from Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
The previous round-trip fare on its direct flight to Newark was $458. Other 
round-trip ticket prices on direct flights from Orange County include $278 to 
Houston, which was previously $368; and $78 to Tucson, Ariz., previously $98. 
</P>
<P>
 While fall discounting has become an annual ritual, travel industry 
specialists say they are surprised at how fast and furious the competing offers 
have been launched this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic drops off like mad after Labor Day, and carriers are trying to 
bolster their traffic, so they offer these fares," said Lee Howard, an airline 
economics consultant in Washington. And now that many of the carriers have 
reduced their overall costs -- Continental, for instance, won concessions 
through bankruptcy proceedings -- the airlines stand a greater chance of still 
being profitable despite price cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Nulty, president of the Associated Travel Management chain based in Santa 
Ana, said consumers are becoming so accustomed to the fare cuts that they won't 
buy tickets without one. He compared it to a close-out sale at a store that 
seemingly goes on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Burns, owner of Santa Monica Travel, said that a few consumers called to 
make reservations Friday in response to Continental's offer. Though the number 
of discount seats are being limited, she said customers found a ready supply of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets, which must be purchased by Aug. 26, are good for travel from Aug. 
27 on domestic routes and beginning Sept. 5 on international flights. Travel 
must be completed by Dec. 10. The cuts don't include travel on Nov. 23, 27 and 
28. A Friday or Saturday night stay is required; domestic tickets are 
non-refundable but international tickets are refundable. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale comes about two weeks after a round of ticket price reductions was 
initiated by American Airlines, which offered discounts up to 40%. American 
spokesman Tim Smith said Friday that travelers who have already bought tickets 
can try to book at their new, lower rate for a standard $35 fee.

JAPAN'S SURPLUS WITH U.S. SOARS BY A BLOATED 20%; TRADE: THE JULY FIGURE 
REVIVES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN -- OR WHETHER -- THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE FIGURE 
WILL COME DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 20% in July to its 
second-highest level ever, the Finance Ministry said Friday, raising questions 
anew about when -- or whether -- the politically sensitive surplus will 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5.63-billion bilateral surplus -- almost half of Japan's $12.3-billion 
global surplus for July -- was fueled by strong American demand for Japanese 
automobiles, machinery and semiconductors, Finance Ministry spokesman Fumio 
Tomori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the global surplus increased a modest 4% in July, it surprised many 
analysts because of earlier forecasts of a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Barker, an analyst at Baring Securities Ltd., said the jump in the 
global surplus was "disappointing" because preliminary figures for the first 20 
days of July had indicated that the monthly surplus would fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In yen terms, the global figure is showing a declining trend, but this has 
been more than offset in dollar terms by the strong rise in the Japanese 
currency. The value of the dollar averaged 99.53 yen in July, compared to 108 
yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dollar has recovered from its record low of 96.60 yen set in 
mid-July, closing Friday in Tokyo at 100.30, Japan's continuing surpluses could 
lead to renewed dollar weakness. The dollar closed trading in New York on 
Friday at 100.15 yen, down from 100.23. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be still working on pretty big surpluses through to the end 
of the year," DB Capital Markets (Asia) Ltd. analyst Kenneth Courtis said. 
"Surpluses may have already peaked, but they aren't going to come down 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "J-curve" effect of a strong yen inflating the dollar value of 
exports will continue to apply as long as the dollar stays at about 100 yen, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The J-curve effect assumes an eventual fall in the volume of Japan's exports 
as they become less price-competitive, but some economists said Japan's exports 
could remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese products will continue to be bought by U.S. and Asian users even at 
higher prices, as their quality is still in demand," Bank of Tokyo economist 
Yoichi Nakagawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued high or rising surpluses could also lead to greater pressure from 
the U.S. government on Japan to boost imports more rapidly through overall 
economic stimulus and specific market-opening measures. Washington has 
threatened to impose sanctions unless agreements are reached by Sept. 30 in 
bilateral trade talks covering automobiles and auto parts, insurance and 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japan recorded increased exports in July, there was also strong 
growth in the import of semiconductors, as well as aircraft and office 
equipment. Imports of lumber and oil fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Feldman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., said the reported 
drop in oil imports casts doubt on the accuracy of the monthly statistics in 
reflecting real trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall imports have been running about 15% higher this year than last year, 
and "all of a sudden in July there was a mere 8% increase," Feldman said. "It 
appears that oil imports were down 3%." 
</P>
<P>
 A drop in oil imports is especially unbelievable because of signs that an 
economic recovery is getting under way, he said. "Perhaps some paperwork just 
got done late, or something like that. . . . It just doesn't make any sense. It 
has to be a reporting blip." 
</P>
<P>
 The view that any slowdown in import growth is only temporary was bolstered by 
a separate report released Friday by the Economic Planning Agency stating that 
a recovery in private consumption is gaining strength. Signs of renewed 
corporate capital spending are also emerging, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall assessment, in the agency's monthly report, was that the economy 
"is gently emerging from its prior sluggish state." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency stopped short of declaring that the long-awaited recovery is under 
way.

RISE IN PRICES, INVENTORIES HINT AT SLOWDOWN, ANALYSTS SAY; ECONOMY: BUT 
EXPERTS EXPECT THE FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO FEND OFF FUTURE INFLATION 
PRESSURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3% last month and unsold goods continued to 
pile up on store shelves, the government said Friday, but analysts said the 
reports will not keep the Federal Reserve Board from raising interest rates 
again next week to further cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said the modest rise in its consumer price index was 
fueled by big jumps in the prices of gasoline and coffee. In the first seven 
months of this year, consumer prices rose at a 2.7% annual rate -- an exact 
match to last year's increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said that business inventories rose 0.4% in 
July -- the third straight monthly advance -- as manufacturers churned out more 
goods than consumers wanted to buy or retailers could sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, analysts said, the two reports show that inflation remains under 
control and that the economy is slowing. Stocks rallied and bond yields fell on 
the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly 17.81 points and 
the yield on the newly auctioned benchmark 30-year bond falling to 7.50% from 
7.56% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But most economists agreed that the Fed will probably still raise interest 
rates when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday, 
hoping to squelch the inflationary pressures that some board members believe 
are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's job is to worry about inflation several months down the road, not 
what inflation is doing today," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for Los 
Angeles-based First Interstate Bank. "And the fact is, some inflationary 
pressures seem to be building up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts have become increasingly concerned about rising energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPI report said a 3.5% jump in the price of gasoline pushed the typical 
American's overall energy costs up 1.8% in July, the biggest increase in nearly 
a year. Higher energy prices, coupled with a 0.5% hike in the cost of food, 
easily offset the 0.4% decline in the cost of new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say energy prices could go higher in the months ahead, especially if 
an oil workers strike in Nigeria continues to crimp supply and the economic 
recovery in Europe raises demand. 
</P>
<P>
 When the volatile cost of energy and food is excluded, the "core" rate of 
inflation rose a tinier 0.2% last month. But with prices on the producer level 
already rising fast -- the Labor Department said Thursday that wholesale prices 
surged 0.5% in July, the biggest increase in more than a year -- inflation 
could make a comeback if the Fed doesn't raise rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's concerns about inflation are real, even if we don't see high 
inflation today," said Cynthia Latta, senior economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Latta said the Fed will probably raise its federal funds rate by one-quarter 
of a point when it meets next week, to 4.5%, but that a half-point increase is 
still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some level of increase is inevitable. Now it's just a matter of how large it 
is going to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.4% rise in business inventories was another sign that the Fed's four 
rate hikes earlier this year have already put the brakes on the nation's 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers began cutting back on their spending about the same time that the 
Fed hiked rates for the first time last February. But manufacturers kept their 
plants operating at full speed, causing their warehouses to fill up and 
retailers' shelves to overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a third report released Friday indicated that consumers may be 
feeling a bit more upbeat about their economic future. The University of 
Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index for August stood at 
92.6, up from 89 in July. Consumer Price Index

OFF THE TICKER: JOE CAMEL VS. THE MARLBORO MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the country, Joe Camel is apparently bursting through billboards 
advertising his biggest rival, the Marlboro Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Camel peers over an image of a cowboy on horseback and holds out a pack of 
Camel Lights. The tag line reads: "Genuine Taste, Never Boring." 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. thought the time was right to go after Marlboro 
smokers, said Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the fiscal second quarter, Marlboro had 28.8% of the estimated 
$48-billion U.S. cigarette market. Camel had about 3.8% of the market.

RALPHS, YUCAIPA IN TALKS; MERGER WOULD CREATE SOUTHLAND'S BIGGEST GROCERY CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In a deal that would create Southern California's largest supermarket chain, 
the owner of Alpha Beta and several other chains is close to reaching an 
agreement to acquire the 121-year-old Ralphs Grocery Co. for $2.5 billion, 
according to sources close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa Cos., which also owns the Food 4 Less, Boys and Viva chains, would 
obtain controlling interest in Ralphs from DeBartolo Corp., an Ohio-based real 
estate development firm. Negotiators hope to reach a tentative agreement within 
10 working days. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined company would be called Ralphs Grocery Co. and an undetermined 
number of Alpha Beta stores would be converted to Ralphs outlets. However, some 
Ralphs stores might also be converted to operate under the Food 4 Less 
warehouse store format. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some stores in overlapping areas can be expected to close and 
jobs may be eliminated, sources said. The companies would consider sales 
performance and location in making those determinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Any deal is likely to face scrutiny on antitrust grounds, given that the 
merger would create a vast chain controlling 27% of the hotly competitive 
Southern California market. The current leader is Vons with 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 A top executive at a competing chain immediately took aim at the proposed 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how the attorney general would approve of this," said the 
executive, who did not want to be identified. "The takeover clearly limits 
competition. If all you have is Ralphs and an Alpha Beta (in a neighborhood), 
don't you think they are going to raise their prices as high as they can?" 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the proposed new mega-chain noted that the combined company 
would be able to reduce its costs by consolidating administrative and other 
support services, and -- with increased buying power -- would also be able 
negotiate better prices from vendors. "There would be a direct benefit to 
consumers in Southern California," insisted a Food 4 Less executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs, based in Compton, has 167 stores, all in Southern California. Yucaipa 
-- headquartered in Los Angeles and parent of the La Habra-based corporation 
known as Food 4 Less Supermarkets -- has 130 Alpha Beta, 24 Boys, 15 Viva and 
29 Food 4 Less warehouse stores in the Southland.  
</P>
<P>
 Two investors -- Yucaipa Chairman Ronald Burkle and Mark Resnick -- have 
controlling interest in Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two companies operate throughout Southern California, Ralphs has a 
stronger Los Angeles County presence while Food 4 Less Supermarkets is more 
concentrated in Orange County. In the city of Los Angeles, Ralphs has a large 
number of stores on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, and Food 4 
Less Supermarkets stores are concentrated largely in south and South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed deal is completed, Burkle would also become chairman of the 
combined supermarket company. Food 4 Less Supermarkets President George 
Golleher would become vice-chairman. Ralphs Chief Executive Byron Allumbaugh 
would become chief executive, and Ralphs President Al Marasca would be 
president.  
</P>
<P>
 Burkle, Allumbaugh and representatives of DeBartolo could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said DeBartolo would receive about $500 million in cash and $1 billion 
in financing notes. Yucaipa would also assume about $1 billion of Ralphs debt, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a tentative agreement is reached this month, a final agreement would 
probably be concluded in November, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if recent history is any guide, the antitrust concerns may not be limited 
to worried competitors. In the past, some local supermarket chains have been 
forced to either abandon or pare down merger plans in the face of opposition of 
state and federal antitrust officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, for example, the then-parent of Alpha Beta -- American Stores -- and 
Lucky stores gave up trying to merge the two chains after encountering stiff 
opposition from the California attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with the state, American Stores sold 145 Alpha Beta stores 
in Southern California to Yucaipa Cos. for $248 million in 1991. American was 
permitted to merge most of its Alpha Beta and Lucky stores in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, a merger between Ralphs and Yucaipa would certainly meet 
with government scrutiny, said consumer advocates and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Alpha Betas would be converted to Ralphs and those stores would upgrade 
the product offering, the (display) presentation and the prices," said Jonathan 
Ziegler, an analyst at Salomon Bros. in New York. "When you consolidate any 
market it usually leads to some price stabilization because there is a less of 
a need to be aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Yucaipa has already consulted with the office of California Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren. A Food 4 Less source maintained that a 27% share does not 
constitute overwhelming dominance of the market and predicted the proposal 
would clear any antitrust hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, senior economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, forecast hotter price competition among the major players in the region 
-- Vons, Lucky and the new Ralphs -- but said smaller operators like Smith's 
Food & Drug and Albertson's will have more trouble competing in such a new 
environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups also voiced warnings. The proposed new chain "might be able to 
price competitors out of business," said Michael Heffer, a senior staff member 
of Consumer Action, a nonprofit consumer education group based in San 
Francisco. "In the long run, it's bad news for consumers when you reduce 
competition." Creating a Giant 
</P>
<P>
 If Yucaipa, which owns Food 4 Less, Alpha Beta, Viva and Boys markets, 
acquires Ralphs, it will create the dominate supermarket chain in the 
Southland. Market share based on 1993 sales:

COUNTY PENSION FUND WINS BID FOR RITZ-CARLTON; INVESTMENT: SOURCES SAY THE 
EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ASSN. OFFERED UP TO $45 MILLION FOR THE LANDMARK PASADENA 
HOTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Assn., the state's fourth-largest 
public pension fund, made the winning bid for the landmark Ritz-Carlton, 
Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, sources close to the deal confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that the winning bid of 
between $40 million and $45 million came from investors led by the 
Pasadena-based $14.3-billion pension fund that covers 80,000 county employees 
and 40,000 retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal appears to end uncertainty over the venerable hotel's future, which 
has been up in the air since it was taken over in May by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 
Ltd. of Japan after U.S. investors defaulted on a $100-million loan to renovate 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also raises questions about the propriety of a public pension fund 
owning a hotel, though other pension funds have acquired hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Lowe Enterprises, a Brentwood real estate development and 
management firm, announced that it had made the winning bid for the hotel on 
behalf of a public pension fund that it declined to identify. On Friday, 
officials at the bank, the hotel and Lowe declined to comment on details of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning bid followed a 60-day offering period by Secured Capital Inc., the 
bank's financial advisers, that drew more than 10 bids, the sources said. An 
official at Secured Capital also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Richter, chief executive of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement 
Assn., or LACERA, said the pension fund has not had any hotel investments. She 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A local landmark for more than 85 years, the Ritz-Carlton has played host to 
movie stars, politicians and star-studded galas, such as TV producer Harry 
Thomason's 1992 surprise birthday party, whose guest list included a 
sax-playing Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The 383-room hotel, formerly the Huntington Sheraton, was completely rebuilt 
after being declared seismically unsafe in 1985. It reopened in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the hotel's occupancy rate has risen to about 82% from 71% in 1993 
and 63% in 1992, said spokeswoman Judy Rowcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel's owners, including several local investors, defaulted on a loan 
to Dai-Ichi Kangyo after failing to renegotiate terms, and ownership ceded to a 
trust on behalf of the bank, said Thomas Tellefsen, one of the former owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the hotel's future has been uncertain. Over the last year, the 
hotel has been set for auction only to be hastily withdrawn at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellefsen said his group retains ownership of several cottages on the hotel 
property, as well as an adjacent shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions were divided on the wisdom of a public employees pension plan 
investing in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd question the propriety of using (pension) money to buy a hotel," said Jim 
Gutierrez, staff director of Local 660 of the Service Employees International 
Union, the county's largest labor union, representing 40,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Columbus, Ohio, Robert McLaughlin, an investment officer with the Ohio 
Public Employees Retirement System, said his fund had invested profitably in 
hotel properties around the country, including the L'Auberge Del Mar Resort & 
Spa near San Diego, which the fund bought from Dai-Ichi Kangyo for $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to buy things nobody else wants," he said. "That's how we make money. 
Junkyards make money, but museums don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Harmon, a vice president with Dai-Ichi Kangyo, said he and other 
principals in the deal were to meet Monday to formalize the deal, which is 
expected to close by Sept. 29.

 Novell Names Frankenberg Board Chairman: The computer networking company named 
President and Chief Executive Robert Frankenberg to replace founder Raymond 
Noorda.Noorda, who will remain as a board member, said Novell was in good hands 
with Frankenberg. Frankenberg joined Novell in April, after months of 
speculation about who would succeed Noorda. Frankenberg previously headed 
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s personal information products group and was credited with 
turning around the company's personal computer division. Frankenberg, who was 
elected chairman at a board meeting, said he plans to build on the vision that 
Noorda established. Exactly what new direction Novell might take, however, 
remains unclear.

 California SunCare Accused of Price-Fixing: The Department of Justice's 
antitrust division and the Los Angeles-based manufacturer agreed to a consent 
decree that will prohibit the company from setting a minimum resale price for 
its indoor tanning products.The Justice Department alleged that California 
SunCare set a floor price below which its distributors could not sell its 
products. But Richard Spencer, an attorney for California SunCare, denied the 
charge, saying the company agreed to the settlement -- under which the company 
does not admit wrongdoing -- to head off a lengthy and expensive court battle. 
"The company was entitled to, and even under the consent decree can, suggest 
minimum prices," Spencer said. The settlement must be approved by the court.

UNITRIN PLANS BUYBACK TO THWART BID; MERGERS: MOVE INDICATES INSURER WILL TAKE 
A TOUGH STANCE AGAINST HOSTILE SUITOR AMERICAN GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unitrin Inc. said Friday that its board has authorized the repurchase up to 
19.3% of its outstanding common stock, building its defense against American 
General Corp.'s unfriendly $2.6-billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based insurance company said it may repurchase up to 10 million of 
its 51.8 million common shares outstanding, using general corporate funds or 
bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Unitrin's buyback signals its determination to mount a stiff 
response to American General's bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unitrin is clearly digging in their heels. They clearly don't want to be 
acquired," Conning & Co. analyst Paul Goulekas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball now has bounced back into American General's court," Branche 
Research analyst Robert Branche said.  
</P>
<P>
 The insurer said it believes its stock is undervalued and that the buyback 
will tend to increase the value of the remaining shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization will also provide Unitrin shareholders more liquidity in 
light of the unsettled market conditions that followed American General's 
unsolicited offer, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyback follows Unitrin's adoption last week of a shareholder rights plan 
after American General's disclosure of its $50.375-a-share bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin stock closed Friday at $48.50, down 50 cents on Nasdaq. American 
General closed up 25 cents at $28.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its offer 
is open through Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 American General had no immediate comment on Unitrin's buyback plan. The home 
service life insurance and consumer finance company has said it would be 
willing to consider a higher price after further investigation and 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulekas said the situation appeared to be at a standoff. "It's going to 
remain fairly protracted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin said its board may consider other steps to further enhance stockholder 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said such steps might include an acquisition. Acquiring a property 
and casualty company would make Unitrin less attractive to American General, 
Goulekas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin said none of its directors plan to sell shares during the repurchase 
program. They own about 23% of the company's common stock, including 
unexercised options. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Unitrin's largest shareholder, Dr. Henry Singleton, said he was 
opposed to American General's bid, which the company rejected last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton, a company director, owns roughly 14% of Unitrin stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fayez Sarofim, another director who opposes the bid, beneficially owns about 
7% of the company, Unitrin said. About 60% of Sarofim's shares are held on 
behalf of clients of his investment advisory firm. He does not personally 
exercise his right to vote or dispose of such shares, Unitrin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robinson-Humphrey analyst David Lewis: "We believe that it will be 
somewhat of a long shot for American General to get this consummated."

 Andersen Disciplined for S&L Flop: Arthur Andersen & Co. was ordered to pay 
$1.7 million, perform 10,000 hours of community service and train its auditing 
staff better after settling charges that the giant accounting firm was grossly 
negligent in its audit of Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., the California Board of 
Accountancy said.Lincoln failed in April, 1989, at what federal officials said 
at the time was a cost to taxpayers of $2.6 billion. Large sums of money were 
looted from the institution by its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. The settlement 
ends a longstanding legal battle between Andersen and the state board. The 
accounting firm admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION NEWS RALLIES BONDS; DOW ADDS 17 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bond market finally got some good news on inflation, spurring a modest 
rally Friday as traders braced for the Federal Reserve Board's policy meeting 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks staged a more convincing rally, as takeover speculation helped power 
the Dow industrials up 17.81 points to 3,768.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields declined broadly after the government reported that July consumer 
prices rose 0.3%, which was within expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, yields had rocketed on the July wholesale inflation report, which 
had come in higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year Treasury note yield, which jumped from 7.30% on Wednesday to 7.36% 
on Thursday, fell back to 7.29% on Friday. Two weeks ago the yield was at 
7.10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The seesawing of interest rates Thursday and Friday didn't change many 
traders' minds about the likely outcome of next Tuesday's Fed meeting. The 
central bank is widely expected to boost short-term rates again in an attempt 
to further slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term T-bill yields were mostly unchanged on Friday, even as longer-term 
yields eased. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, research chief at Argus Research, said Friday's consumer 
inflation report might sway the Fed to limit its rate hike to a quarter-point 
instead of a half-point. 
</P>
<P>
 But many other market players are convinced the Fed will use a half-point 
increase to show it is serious about restraining inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, renewed rate increases in Europe this week, by the Swedish and Italian 
central banks, could encourage the Fed to go with a half-point rate hike to 
keep the dollar from heading into a new downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Europe Friday, bond yields continued to rise, responding to the Swedish 
and Italian boost in short rates on Thursday. The yield on the 10-year German 
government bond hit 7.23% Friday, highest since June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 European rate worries pummeled stocks on the Continent for a second day. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX stock index dropped 30.60 points or 1.4% to 2,124.68. In 
Paris, the CAC index sank 31.98 points to 2,006.95. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, however, stocks got a late lift with the U.S. market rally, and the 
FTSE-100 index added 4.1 points to 3,142.30. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, many investors appeared to be resigned to another Fed rate 
boost but were finding reasons to buy stocks anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was "further evidence that the market has unhinged stock prices from 
interest rates," said analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, on moderate volume. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks rose 3.41 points to 
731.61, bringing its gain for the week to 1.8%. In contrast, the Dow inched up 
21.69 points or 0.6% for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks, which had led the Nasdaq market's comeback this week, lost 
some steam on Friday, but other market sectors picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights:

 Micron Technology Files Petition Against South Korea: Micron's petition, filed 
with the U.S. Trade Representative, charged that South Korean semiconductor 
companies compete unfairly with U.S. chip makers, according to Electronic 
Buyers' News.Micron said in the petition that the South Korean government 
subsidizes its semiconductor companies, which gives the companies an unfair 
advantage in the U.S. market, the trade magazine said. "The combined effect of 
these programs has been to turn the Korean semiconductor industry into a 
formidable export machine," Micron said in the petition. Korean computer chip 
companies account for 28% of all dynamic random access memory chips worldwide, 
with the United States being the largest market.

JUDGE FREEZES ACCOUNTS OF TELEMARKETER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge in Iowa froze bank accounts of an Orange County telemarketer this week 
after state officials there used a telephone sting to build a case against the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iowa attorney general's office filed suit in Polk County District Court on 
Thursday contending that solicitors misled Iowans who paid the company 
thousands of dollars on a promise of receiving valuable prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge immediately issued an order freezing the company's accounts at four 
California banks, prohibiting its representatives from contacting Iowans and 
prohibiting the removal or destruction of any of the company's business 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants in the suit are MB Promotions Inc. of Buena Park, which does 
business as Clean Earth Industries; and Michele Brunmier, president of MB 
Promotions and president and owner of Clean Earth Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunmier was ordered to appear at an Aug. 26 hearing in Polk County District 
Court by Judge J.W. Jordan, who issued Thursday's temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Bonnie Campbell said Clean Earth targeted elderly Iowans and told 
them they would receive valuable prizes if they would send the company money 
for products such as air purifiers, cosmetics and cleaning supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence was collected through a sting operation set up after a Waukee bank 
told the attorney general's office in October, 1993, that a customer, Rita 
Hierstein, 80, was a repeated victim of telemarketing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 She was given a new, unlisted telephone number, and her old number was 
channeled to the attorney general's consumer protection division, which 
recorded the telemarketing calls. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit from investigator Barbara A. White, Clean Earth 
called the number six times between March 11 and March 21, and solicitors made 
their pitches to consumer protection employees posing as Hierstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that Clean Earth told consumers they were celebrities and 
had reached the "super grand finals" in the award promotion. It further alleges 
the company told consumers that, in return for buying products, they could 
choose two of five prizes: $15,000, $2,500, eight ounces of gold, a JFK coin 
cachet and a 35mm camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "The existence of the undercover telephone sting tapes allows us to prove 
beyond question that these allegedly false and misleading statements were in 
fact made by company solicitors," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes show that the pitches from solicitors "deviate routinely and 
markedly" from telemarketing scripts the company filed with California 
regulators, the suit alleges.

BANK OF NEWPORT SEIZED; ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSFERRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As it predicted earlier this month, Bank of Newport was seized Friday by state 
and federal regulators and its accounts turned over to San Francisco-based 
Union Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Newport's five offices, two in Newport Beach and one each in Costa 
Mesa, Laguna Niguel and Encino, will reopen Monday as Union Bank branches, and 
depositors will automatically become Union Bank account holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Banking Department closed Bank of Newport after determining that its 
officials were unable to raise its capital to regulatory minimums. The bank 
announced last week that its capital had fallen below the acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank had about $160 million in deposits, including $150 million in 19,000 
fully insured accounts of $100,000 or less. About $10 million in accounts that 
exceeded the federal insurance maximum will not be assumed by Union Bank, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Account holders with uninsured deposits must apply for payment to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., which said it will pay out 50% of the funds pending 
final disposition of the bank's assets.

FIELDSTONE GAINS $140 MILLION IN LOANS TO BUILD 800 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach home builder Fieldstone Co. said Friday that it has obtained 
$140 million in bank loans to build more than 800 homes in Rancho Santa 
Margarita during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks are getting a lot more interested in doing business with home builders 
these days," said Frank Foster, Fieldstone's regional manager."This financing 
is unique because it's pretty large, and it's for projects we plan to do down 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, builders secure financing for home construction phase by phase. The 
Fieldstone arrangement, by contrast, is for both current and future building, 
Foster said. The deal is notable too because banks have been hesitant to lend 
to developers in recent years because of the real estate downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone plans to build 250 to 300 homes a year in Rancho Santa Margarita, a 
5,000-acre planned community, with money borrowed from Bank of America, First 
Interstate Bank and Continental Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone is already building 130 homes in The Vistas, a Rancho Santa 
Margarita development that opened in 1992. At completion, it will include 1,800 
homes.

STATE CLAIMS WASTE-HAULING FIRM RAN FACILITY WITHOUT A PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office has filed a lawsuit against a Huntington 
Beach hazardous-waste hauling company alleging that it operated a medical waste 
transfer station in Bakersfield without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental Systems operated the transfer station from January, 
1991, to April, 1993, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Ellen Batzel disputed the allegations made in the lawsuit, 
saying that Security Environmental has all the proper licenses and intends to 
show them to the state immediately. She called the lawsuit "spurious" and 
denied that Security Environmental has ever operated without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's suit, filed on behalf of the state director of health services, 
asks the court to assess damages of $10,000 against Security Environmental for 
operating without a permit, and another $10,000 for every day that the transfer 
site was open.

UNITRIN OKS REPURCHASE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unitrin Inc. said Friday its board has authorized the insurance company to 
repurchase up to 19.3% of its outstanding common stock, in a defense against 
American General Corp.'s unfriendly $2.6-billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based company said it may repurchase up to 10 million of its 51.8 
million common shares outstanding, using general corporate funds or bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization will provide Unitrin shareholders more liquidity in light of 
the unsettled market conditions that followed American General's unsolicited 
offer, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also said its stock is undervalued, and that the expanded repurchase 
program will tend to increase the value of the shares that remain outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin said none of its directors plan to sell shares during the repurchase 
program. They own about 23% of the company's common stock, including 
unexercised options. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Unitrin's largest shareholder, Dr. Henry Singleton, said he was 
opposed to American General's bid, which the company had rejected last month. 
Unitrin has also adopted a stockholder rights plan to frustrate the bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton, a company director, owns roughly 14% of Unitrin stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fayez Sarofim, another director who opposes the American General bid, 
beneficially owns about 7% of the company, Unitrin said. About 60% of Sarofim's 
shares are held on behalf of clients of his investment advisory firm. He does 
not personally exercise his right to vote or dispose of such shares, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin said its board may consider other steps to further enhance stockholder 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin said any merger or combination with a stockholder or its affiliates 
with stakes exceeding 15% in the company requires approval by a majority of its 
directors or a favorable vote of at least 75% of the company's outstanding 
stock.

HEALTH PLAN SUBSIDIES CARRY MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR PRICE; LEGISLATION: RIVAL 
MITCHELL, DOLE BILLS AGREE U.S. MUST HELP LOWER-INCOME WORKING AMERICANS BUY 
INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the heated rhetoric and conflicting claims, the two leading health care 
bills now under debate in the Senate, one offered by Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and the other by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), share a 
major point of agreement -- multibillion-dollar government payments to help 
lower-income working Americans buy health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising as it may seem in the current political climate, the two plans 
represent bipartisan support for a significant new extension of federal 
responsibility for health care. Since the mid-1960s, Washington has accepted 
the burden of insuring retirees and the very poor. The Dole and Mitchell bills 
embrace an additional principle -- that the government has an obligation to 
help at least some working Americans with the cost of buying insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bills differ on the amount of the subsidy they would grant to working 
Americans, as distinct from those living in poverty. Indeed, the difference is 
quite large: Mitchell's subsidy plan would cost more than $100 billion per 
year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Dole's would cost about $30 
billion annually, according to a study by the Lewin-VHI health consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, while Mitchell would provide money only to lower-income working 
families -- a predominantly Democratic group -- a large chunk of Dole's 
proposed subsidies would flow in the form of tax benefits, primarily to 
upper-income, more Republican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But either the Dole or the Mitchell proposals, or a similar subsidy plan in 
the House Democratic bill proposed by Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) could, if enacted into law, quickly become one of the federal 
government's largest entitlement spending plans -- a program that would send 
checks to tens of millions of American families. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while Dole would spend much less than Mitchell, the GOP leader's 
$30 billion in subsidies is significantly larger than the approximately $20 
billion a year that the federal government now spends on Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children, the nation's chief welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag on any health insurance subsidy inevitably will be large. 
Government analysts estimate that comprehensive insurance for a family of four 
costs in the neighborhood of $6,000 per year. That bill is largely invisible to 
workers whose employers pay most of their premiums, but it comes to about 13% 
of the total income of the average family of four, and 40% of the income of 
families at the federal poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 What brings Dole and Mitchell, publicly so antagonistic, so close together on 
the overarching principle of subsidies is a basic fact. To reach the goal of 
reducing the number of Americans who lack insurance, the government has only 
two possible options: It can force people to act or it can entice them to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the Clinton Administration hoped to avoid adding heavily to federal 
spending, so it proposed force, in the form of an employer mandate -- a legal 
requirement that all companies provide insurance to all workers. But with 
Republicans opposed to such a mandate and many Democrats shying away from it, 
members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle have turned to 
enticements as the path of lesser political resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision translates into multibillion-dollar federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dole and Mitchell subsidy plans are similar enough that some senators, 
perhaps more optimistic than realistic, see the nugget of a potential 
agreement. Others warn that more conservative Republicans might desert Dole if 
they ever thought his bill stood a real chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gramm probably has 20 votes against anything," said one senior White House 
official, referring to Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), a leading conservative and 
potential Dole rival for his party's presidential nomination in 1996. Gramm has 
put considerable pressure on Dole not to move too close to the Democrats on 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real challenge facing both the Dole and Mitchell formulas is not so 
much partisan maneuvering as the very real problems in designing and 
administering the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, first, the issue of how to pay for them. Mitchell, Dole and Gephardt 
would finance their plans in part with money currently being spent on Medicaid, 
the government program that covers the poor. That is theoretically feasible 
because under their plans many of the poor would buy private insurance, using 
subsidies, rather than get Medicaid help. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, all the plans would offset some of the cost of subsidies by reducing 
Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. Mitchell and Gephardt would also 
raise some taxes, including a 45-cents-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office, in an analysis released Tuesday, estimated 
that Mitchell's bill, overall, would reduce the federal deficit slightly over 
the next 10 years. The budget office has not completed an analysis of either 
Dole's bill or Gephardt's. Both the Dole and Mitchell bills include "circuit 
breaker" provisions that automatically would reduce most subsidies if Medicaid 
and Medicare savings fell short, although the workability of those provisions 
remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 A second problem with subsidies is that "nothing else stands still," as Alice 
Rivlin, the budget expert who is now director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, put it. Once the government adopts a subsidy plan, if 
the law does not require companies to pay for insurance, at least some will 
begin to drop coverage for workers, thereby making them eligible for subsidies, 
Rivlin noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if the subsidies are generous enough, some workers might be better 
off if their employers did drop coverage. Should that happen, "the cost can 
start escalating," Rivlin said. On the other hand, if the subsidies are kept 
small, they will not succeed in making insurance affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that dynamic, all cost estimates for subsidy programs involve a 
fair amount of guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the danger of creating "perverse incentives" that discourage 
people from working at all. Conservatives often argue that marginal income tax 
rates of 35% or more discourage upper-income Americans from making productive 
investments by reducing their potential gains. Liberal policy analysts point 
out that, in effect, low-income workers face much higher marginal tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a family of four at the poverty line -- about $15,000 per year 
-- now loses roughly 56 cents of every additional dollar it earns because of 
reductions in the earned-income tax credit for working families, along with 
higher state income taxes and reductions in food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of four earning $18,500 faces a marginal tax rate of 72%. Add on 
health insurance subsidies that rapidly phase out as income goes above the 
poverty line and low-income working families could face the dilemma of losing 
almost every additional penny they earn if their incomes go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can end up with some very high marginal rates," said David A. Super of 
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal organization that has 
analyzed the impact of health reform plans on the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 A final problem involves administration. Some agency will have to determine 
who is eligible for the subsidies, disburse the checks, examine income data to 
check for fraud, and so on. Both Dole and Mitchell would leave that job to the 
states -- a task that many state governments are almost certainly not up to at 
this point. 
</P>
<P>
 In drafting a subsidy plan, members of Congress also face several major policy 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is whether Congress should target spending only on the very poor or 
expand subsidies to help working families with income above the poverty line.  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats object that Dole's bill, by concentrating almost exclusively on the 
poor and near-poor, would leave low-income working families in the lurch. A 
family of four with income of $25,000, for example, would receive no subsidy 
under Dole's bill. So buying a comprehensive insurance package would cost that 
family almost one quarter of its annual income.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many working people will need a subsidy to afford health care coverage," 
Mitchell said as he opened the Senate debate. "High costs are driving ordinary 
Americans to choices that no civilized society should tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole argues that the issue is affordability. "It's a question of whether or 
not you have the money," Dole said in introducing his bill Tuesday. "Somebody 
has to pay for this sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leader, however, is somewhat more generous with another, more 
prosperous -- and more Republican -- group. Under Dole's bill, taxpayers would 
be able to deduct from their taxable incomes the full cost of the premiums they 
pay if they buy their own insurance, either because they are self-employed or 
because their employers do not provide coverage. The deduction would be phased 
in over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax deductions, by nature, provide more benefit to upper-income recipients 
because they pay higher tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's plan does not include that tax deduction but it does provide 
considerably more generous subsidies for lower-income working families, part of 
the traditional Democratic base. Indeed, Mitchell's plan includes three 
separate and overlapping subsidy plans -- a potential problem that the 
Congressional Budget Office has warned may be unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic subsidy in Mitchell's plan would provide help to families earning up 
to about $36,000 -- 2.4 times the poverty line. A second subsidy would provide 
money to families with children through age 18 and to pregnant women. It would 
go to those with family incomes up to three times the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 A third subsidy would go to help families when a worker becomes unemployed. 
Under that plan, the subsidy essentially would focus on the person's monthly 
income, allowing people to get help while unemployed even if earlier in the 
year, while working, they already had earned too much money to be eligible for 
the regular subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those problems and uncertainties, some form of major subsidy scheme 
appears all but inevitable as a part of any health reform plan that emerges 
from Congress. The reason: Most of the uninsured lack insurance not because 
they do not want it or because they have some problem that prevents them from 
getting it, but because they cannot afford it.LEGISLATION

EX-BANKER GETS 10 YEARS IN DRUG MONEY SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ and LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that highlights the complicity of white-collar bankers in the 
murderous cocaine trade, a former officer of a swank American Express 
subsidiary was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for laundering the 
immense profits of a top Mexican drug lord. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1990 and 1993, Antonio Giraldi was one of the rising stars at American 
Express Bank International's boutique-like headquarters on the penthouse floor 
of the Rodeo Collection in Beverly Hills, where he extended generous lines of 
credit to an exclusive group of foreign millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 But his top client, who purported to be an influential Mexican rancher, was in 
fact a henchman for Juan Garcia Abrego, one of the mostwanted fugitives in the 
United States and Mexico. And the $30-million portfolio that Giraldi handled 
for him was not built on petroleum and auto parts investments, but on Abrego's 
ruthless cocaine empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case demonstrates how necessary it is for a large international drug 
organization to have the aid of a banker if it wants to flourish," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Novak, who prosecuted the case in southern Texas, 
where the investigation began. "Sometimes you can do a little more damage with 
a pen than with a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Giraldi's crimes -- a federal jury found that he repeatedly lied on 
bank documents to conceal the source of his client's wealth -- were all on 
paper. But the results were no less devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express' international banking division has been stuck with nearly 
$19 million in bad loans, which went into default after federal authorities 
seized the cartel's assets. Abrego, whose gunslinging gang has been linked to 
high-level Mexican officials, was given the means to legitimately purchase a 
Blockbuster video franchise in Houston and finance the development of a luxury 
country club in Harlingen, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see it because it's not readily apparent, but tainted money is 
like a disease -- a cancer that just kind of spreads out," said a veteran Drug 
Enforcement Administration official in Los Angeles who has investigated 
numerous money-laundering cases. "It goes far beyond business. It gives drug 
dealers a voice in communities and local politics. It corrupts the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldi, 38, who is from a prominent South American banking family and holds a 
master's degree in international studies from Georgetown University, has 
insisted that he had no reason to suspect his client of illegal dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Christopher Milner, contended that Giraldi is the victim of a 
power struggle between zealous law enforcement authorities and the American 
banking industry. "He ended up being a scapegoat, a whipping boy, paying the 
price for the sins of the industry, as opposed to his own," Milner told U.S. 
District Judge Filemon Vela. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldi, who is free on $700,000 bail pending his appeal on the 10 
money-laundering and seven fraud-related convictions, said: "I hate drugs and 
what they do to people." 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced Friday along with his former assistant at American Express 
Bank, Maria Lourdes Reategui, 46, who was found guilty of conspiracy to launder 
funds and other violations of federal banking law. Reategui, who said she was 
raised in Colombia by nuns, received a 3 1/2-year term and was expected to 
surrender to authorities Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal, which raises questions about how much a bank should know about 
its clients, has been expensive and embarrassing for American Express Bank, a 
subsidiary of the giant American Express Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials, who paid attorney fees for Giraldi and Reategui, initially 
determined that neither employee was responsible for any wrongdoing. But after 
the trial ended in June with multiple convictions, the bank cut off all legal 
assistance. Authorities have hinted that they may try to hold the bank 
criminally liable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the bank has begun to close three of its five international 
offices in the United States, including the posh Beverly Hills branch where 
Giraldi once worked. American Express officials insist that the move is for 
streamlining only, not a reaction to potential losses from the unpaid loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that this case underscores the need for extreme vigilance," said 
Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman at the New York headquarters of American Express 
Bank, which earned $104 million last year. "But we at American Express Bank 
believe that we do, indeed, have a very strong program of compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The case against the two American Express bankers followed a complex and 
circuitous trail that authorities uncovered five years ago at the McAllen 
border crossing in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that U.S. Customs officials saw a stream of couriers from a 
Mexican money-changing house as they headed to a Texas bank with satchels 
stuffed full of $100 bills. Undercover agents spent two years feeding cash into 
the exchange houses to see if the money was being laundered. 
</P>
<P>
 When authorities busted the ring in 1992, they were surprised to discover that 
the Texas bank account where the cash was being deposited was backed by a 
$1-million letter of credit -- issued by the Beverly Hills branch of American 
Express Bank International. The letter of credit, in turn, was backed by the 
holdings of a Cayman Islands company, which authorities traced to Ricardo 
Aguirre Villagomez -- a gas station manager who is suspected of being the top 
money launderer for Abrego's powerful Matamoros cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when investigators focused their attention on Giraldi, who had handled 
Aguirre's finances since 1989, first at the Banker's Trust Co. in New York and 
then at American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 During the monthlong trial, prosecutors accused Giraldi of repeatedly 
violating U.S. banking laws by lying to regulators about how he met Aguirre and 
about how Aguirre amassed his wealth. Although those lapses may seem minor, 
authorities say, they opened the door for more than $30 million in drug profits 
to flow into the U.S. banking system. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, also named in the indictment, is believed to have faked his own death 
and gone into hiding.

BALLPLAYERS AND OWNERS TO MEET WITH MEDIATOR; STRIKE: BOTH SIDES STRESS 
DIFFERENCES, APPEAR PESSIMISTIC THE DISPUTE CAN BE QUICKLY RESOLVED BY FEDERAL 
ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On Day 1 of the strike by major league baseball players Friday, negotiators 
for the players and owners agreed to federal mediation in their stalemated 
collective bargaining talks. Neither side seemed optimistic, however, that 
their dispute could be easily resolved by outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing we have said or done during (these negotiations) has seemed to matter 
to the owners, so I don't know what impact a mediator will have," said Don 
Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. "All I can 
say at this point is that I don't think any harm will come from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners negotiator Richard Ravitch agreed, but added: "We have been asking the 
union a simple question. . . . 'Either in absolute dollar amount or by 
percentage of revenue, how much do you want to play ball?' They don't respond. 
We can't get an answer. Maybe a mediator can, but I think it will be a tough 
task." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch and Fehr had both been saying that their ideological differences over 
the economic state of the industry and the attempt by the owners to install a 
salary cap as a centerpiece of a new compensation system were so deep that they 
didn't think mediation could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we misunderstand what the other side is saying," Fehr said. 
"It's that we don't even have the conceptual framework within which we can 
negotiate a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary of labor (Robert B. Reich) and (the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service) has been calling regularly and tracking the situation for 
several months. We're at the point where it won't hurt to have someone else 
participate, but it's not something we requested." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Fehr nor Ravitch, who also said he hopes to meet with Reich next week, 
was certain when the mediation would begin. Both were hopeful they could set up 
separate meetings over the weekend, but nothing had been scheduled as of late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both said it was unlikely they would hold another negotiating session until 
they had met with the mediator, who can only urge a settlement, not enforce 
one. Federal mediation almost ensures that negotiations will continue on a 
regular basis, although it served no value during baseball's 50-day strike in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 On other fronts Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Acting baseball commissioner Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, sent 
a fax and spoke by conference call to the 28 clubs reaffirming a previous 
request to let Ravitch serve as the only spokesman on the negotiations. Selig's 
action came in response to a barrage of critical comments by some owners on 
Thursday that questioned and seemed to undermine Ravitch's position and the 
owners' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, for example, said the salary cap should 
be a negotiable issue, and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said 
owners should be allowed to join Ravitch at the bargaining table and that 
Ravitch's ongoing attempt to sell the salary cap as a method of improving the 
competitive balance "didn't wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources told The Times that owners will be fined for speaking up, 
Selig insisted: "This isn't a gag order. Other people will still have the 
freedom to do things locally, but Dick and myself will speak on the national 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said it is impossible to think all 28 owners will ever agree with 
everything he does but not one has suggested he modify their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was no progress during a two-hour negotiating session between lawyers 
for both sides. The union asked for the meeting, Fehr said, because it wanted a 
more meaningful response to revenue-sharing ideas proposed to the owners last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to what Ravitch believes is a competitive and industry threatening 
disparity in revenue between the clubs, owners in the bigger markets have 
agreed to increase the amount of revenue they share with the smaller markets, 
but only if the union accepts a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The union claims a salary cap would transfer millions of dollars from the 
players to the owners and would force the players to repay the bigger markets 
for their generosity to the smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The union gave the owners three concepts, all formulated with the help of 
outside economists and devoid of a salary cap: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the number of franchises immediately and provide teams in the 
struggling markets with a larger share of the expansion fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Share local broadcasting revenue -- only national TV revenue and a small 
percentage of cable revenue are now shared -- among all clubs based on the size 
of their market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide "stopgap" relief by increasing the amount of ticket money going to 
visiting teams in the National League from 5% to 20%; eliminating what the 
union called baseball's "tax" on pay-cable revenue; and creating a short-term 
subsidy pool to help the allegedly troubled teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said he thanked the union for its suggestions but that the owners had 
negotiated revenue-sharing concepts and formulas for 12 to 14 months before 
resolving it in combination with the salary cap and that their internal rules 
"were not a suitable subject for collective bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to denigrate the union ideas, but all they're doing in the final 
analysis is moving money around and redistributing unprofitability. It's not a 
matter for a union to bargain how an employer distributes its revenue among its 
partners. 
</P>

 "We have to know what it's going to cost to play ball," Ravitch said, his 
voice rising. "A union whose members average $1.2 million in salary is now on 
strike. We keep asking, 'How much more money do you want?' and we never get an 
answer. Until we do, there can't be any bargaining and certainly no progress. 
It's a shame. Tens of thousands of people connected to the game are going to 
lose their job over this strike, and I would remind everyone that our proposal 
guarantees the union the same $1 billion (for compensation) that the players 
now receive with the possibility of much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, whose goal is to maintain the current system, said he hasn't responded 
to the question of how much the players want "because it's up to the free 
market to determine how much they should receive. That's the way the Western 
economies work, but it's not good enough for baseball."

IN LONELY EUREKA, GOLD BUT NO GLITTER; NEVADA: MINING AND RANCHING OFFER A 
TOUGH LIFE, BUT RESIDENTS TREASURE TOWN'S OLD-TIME VIRTUES. 
</P>

<P>
 Plunk in the middle of a state that is reeling from an assault by outsiders, 
the sublime strength and spirit of Nevada is preserved and nurtured here, a 
proud little town of several hundred residents, straddling the loneliest 
highway in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearest McDonald's and K mart are 120 miles away in Elko, and it's a 
77-mile drive to the nearest lawyer, doctor or pharmacy, in Ely. For major 
hospitalization, Eureka's residents trek to Reno, 240 miles to the west, or 
Salt Lake City, 320 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gold is here, and cattle and alfalfa, and enough work for everyone 
who's willing to put on a pair of heavy gloves. People such as 63-year-old Witz 
Bailey, ranching 17 hours a day in the same treeless valley where his 
grandfather settled in the 1860s. And 42-year-old Greg Tibbs, drilling 12 hours 
a night for gold in the same hills where silver and lead were mined 120 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Eureka, where the population waffles between 500 and 800, depending 
on the latest gold-mining operation, where dogs walk down the middle of Main 
Street, where the biggest social event in town is the Christmas dinner party at 
the 1880 opera house, and where the 1879 courthouse -- with its original 
pressed-tin ceiling -- is maintained not as some tourist trap but because it's 
the only courtroom in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same street where 125 saloons and a handful of brothels once served 
a boom town of 9,000 dreamers and diggers, drunks and die-hards, today's 
laborers still lubricate their bodies with too many beers and whiskeys, and 
fetch rides home from the local sheriff to their modern-day work camps -- 
mobile home parks and RV lots. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the heart of the "Other Nevada," a phrase coined by Nevada author 
Robert Laxalt to describe the immense expanse of land where the sparse 
population is rough and tumble and has no use for the glitz and ritz of teeming 
Las Vegas and Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eureka is part of the fastest-growing state in the nation -- its 
environment, its economy, its very essence in a tumult created mainly by 
transplanted Californians -- the town stands as testimony to the old pioneering 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains untouched by the influx of outsiders seeking to redefine the 
state's storied lifestyle. Old Nevada values are sanctified here and you'd best 
not tinker with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Lloyd, who was the local district attorney before retiring 24 years ago, 
says: "We're the Nevada that the casinos have passed up. We're the Nevada of 
mining, and of people caring for each other instead of inflicting themselves on 
one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka's resistance to outside influences bodes well for the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The real Nevada, Laxalt says, is "disappearing so darn fast. But Eureka, it's 
still pure, and if you lose it, you've lost the identity of Nevada." 
</P>
<P>
 State Archivist Guy Rocha embraces a romantic view of Eureka: 
</P>
<P>
 "Eureka captures the symbol of individualism and freedom, a closeness to the 
land, a sense of what Nevada was -- but isn't much, anymore. . . . It's a 
sanctuary against this swell of humanity that is spilling over into Nevada and 
consuming it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Eureka is stable. It's the most representative of the 'Other Nevada,' the 
places off the beaten path." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, Eureka is too far off the beaten path, and so it has established its 
own population equilibrium. Although the state's population has increased 50% 
over the last decade, no one anticipates waves of Californians reaching here. 
There's little reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the biggest complaint we have in town is that we can't seem to keep 
a doctor here," said Eureka native Leroy Etchetaray, a county commissioner. 
"They'll come, but their wives can't seem to handle it, so they leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the high school principal drives every other weekend to Reno -- to visit 
his wife, who does not want to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Eureka was a challenge from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first residents were five prospectors who discovered silver in 1864. 
Within six years, more than 1,000 mining claims peppered the land, but the 
early mountain men were frustrated in extracting the treasure, stubbornly 
encased in junk ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to innovation, mining companies engineered revolutionary smelters with 
an insatiable appetite for charcoal to fire giant furnaces, melting the raw ore 
and refining the silver and lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1879 -- as Eureka's population swelled to 9,000 -- the town's 16 smelters 
were consuming 175,000 pounds of charcoal a day; within 50 miles of Eureka, 
elevation 6,500 feet, the hills were scalped of all pinyon pine, dwarf cedar 
and mountain mahogany. 
</P>
<P>
 A mineralogist noted at the time that "heavy black clouds of dense smoke from 
the furnaces, heavily laden and strongly scented with the fumes of lead, 
arsenic and other volatile elements of the ores, are constantly rolling over 
the town, depositing soot, scales and black dust, so that it resembles very 
much one of the manufacturing towns in the coal regions of Pennsylvania." 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka became known as the "Pittsburgh of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides foul air, life's miseries were compounded by harsh winters, the 
paucity of fresh food, fires and floods. But the townsfolk were a hardy stock 
-- miners from Europe, the British Isles and Mexico, as well as 2,000 Chinese 
who worked as domestics or laying train track. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1890, the price of silver had fallen, new boom towns were forming 
elsewhere in Nevada, and the local hills were considered depleted -- a mistaken 
notion that was righted only in the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka's population plummeted to close to 1,000 at the turn of the century, 
but the town never was given to ghosts. For the next six decades, the town 
sustained itself as a farming community; Basque sheepherders worked the 
pastureland, and cattle ranching became the primary commerce. Occasional gold 
strikes created spurts of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1960s, new gold extracting technology sparked a resurgence of 
mining in the northern end of Eureka County, 80 miles away. Mining companies 
found it financially feasible to chemically leach microscopic bits of gold from 
the earth. It was profitable -- even if the earth yielded only 0.1 ounces or 
less of gold per ton of mined ore -- and the newest boom was on. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold breathed new life into Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, two of the largest gold-mining operations in the United States are in 
northern Eureka County; although the miners live in Elko, the state's newest 
boom town, which is closer, and spend their payroll checks there, it is Eureka 
County that is reaping the easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Eureka County will get $3.1 million in gold tax revenue -- paltry 
compared to the more than $1.5 billion in gold that is mined annually, but 
still a windfall for a county with a population of about 2,200 residents spread 
out over an area twice the size of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, of county government revenues of about $13 million, nearly half is 
generated by the gold mining industry, through gold tax, property tax and sales 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 So the county is flush with money; it spent more than $2 million to renovate 
the old opera house, enclosed the community pool, improved roads and water 
systems, built an airstrip, developed a fairgrounds, installed a 911 emergency 
phone system, modernized the Sheriff's Department and is considering a 
nine-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, the county has $14 million in cash reserves -- an amount 
that exceeds its annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Eureka schools have benefited from the gold bonanza, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka County High School teachers are the best paid in the state, with 
salaries ranging from $32,500 to $58,000; each year, the school picks up the 
$25,000 tab for sending the junior class -- about 20 students -- to Washington 
for a week, and the $15,000 tab for sending the Future Farmers of America club 
-- about 20 members -- to the national FFA convention in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130 students in grades seven through 12 share 52 IBM computers that are 
linked to the Internet; the school's wrestling and baseball teams are the state 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 With enviable teacher-student ratios, scholarship excels. Two years ago, each 
of the 18 seniors went to a four-year college; last year, 25 of the graduates 
went to college, one went to the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the other two 
joined the military. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the town is completing a new, $4-million grade school for its 120 
youngsters -- paid for in cash.  
</P>
<P>
 Such luxury stands in stark contrast to the situation 250 miles south in 
school-starved Las Vegas, where voters are being asked to approve $905 million 
in bonds to build 110 new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all about gold," said Michael Rebaleati, the county auditor, sitting in 
an office adorned with hunting prints. "But we're very aware that gold is 
cyclical. It's on our minds every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He regularly checks the price of gold on the world market to forecast the 
town's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be careful what we build because we're going to have to maintain 
it, and we know that things can go bust. In fact, they absolutely will go bust, 
sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Atlas Mining Co. of Denver is reassessing its current open-pit gold 
mining operation just outside Eureka and has laid off some of its 85 workers. 
But Homestake Mining Co. of San Francisco has sunk exploratory drills on the 
town's edge and has hinted strongly that there is enough microscopic gold in 
its hills -- previously depleted of silver and lead -- to warrant a full-scale 
mining operation in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Vera Beaumann is helping prepare the town for a no-gold future. As 
director of the town's economic development commission, she wants to recruit a 
large-scale dairy operation to Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already sending our hay to California dairies," she said. "We'd like to 
just bring California's dairies here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, any business would be welcomed here; given Eureka's minimalist 
attitude toward government, there are no county zoning laws, so anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaumann also wants to promote Eureka more aggressively as a tourist 
destination, even though it lacks a national chain motel. "Our convention 
center (the opera house) can accommodate meetings of up to 250 or 300 people," 
she said, "but we've got no place for them to spend the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka's visitors eschew the big Reno-to-Salt-Lake-City interstate to the 
north in favor of the two-lane U.S. 50 as it cuts across central Nevada's open 
rangeland. The expanse offers glimpses of deer and wild horses, but is free of 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the paucity of services, the highway was christened "the Loneliest Road 
in America" in a 1986 Life magazine photo spread. It advised motorists to 
exercise "survival skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But the travelers are rewarded: state historians say Eureka is the 
best-preserved old mining town in Nevada. Some local accommodations -- 
including a restored parsonage house -- date back more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 So today, Eureka bills itself as the loneliest town on the loneliest highway; 
adding to the promotion, some European tour books have miscast Eureka as a 
"ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 It's anything but. Lights at the local gas station flicker on at 4 in the 
morning so early risers can fill their Thermos jugs with coffee and grab a 
fried breakfast sandwich. And at night, the four bars in town will stay open as 
long as elbows are bending. 
</P>
<P>
 Early imbibers don't have to fret, either. Melba Prina, 70, arrives at the Owl 
Club before the bartender, entering through the adjoining coffee shop, and 
pours her own Canadian Mist-and-water highballs. She leaves a straw on the cash 
register for each drink she makes, and when the bartender shows up in 
midmorning, Melba makes good. 
</P>
<P>
 Such honesty permeates the town, where crime is as rare as a traffic jam. For 
one six-month stretch, one bar owner didn't even lock the door when he left at 
night. The last murder occurred in 1988. The town's one bank has never been 
robbed, as far as anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 And kids don't dare get into mischief.  
</P>
<P>
 Undersheriff Pete Bigrigg said: "It's a great place to raise kids, because if 
they get into something, you'll find out before they're half-finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Gaherty, 18, agreed. "This town's too small. Everyone here knows what 
you're gonna do before you even do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Stelly, 35, arrived here last year from Las Vegas to seek refuge from 
a crumbling marriage and said she has few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them? "I wish there was a bit more sophistication, a place where I could 
wear a pretty dress." When she wore a frilly blouse, dress and heels for the 
Christmas dinner at the opera house, she was horrified to see that "dressy" 
meant fringed denim skirts and Western blouses. She fled home to dress down. 
</P>
<P>
 Witz Bailey, the rancher, says there are probably easier places to make a 
living than here, where he has mortgaged the ranch to pay the fees so his 
cattle can run on Bureau of Land Management land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I've looked over the fence a couple of times," he said. "But if you can 
ride a good horse and have a good dog, life here is good." The Loneliest Town 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at Eureka, Nev., nicknamed The Loneliest Town on the Loneliest 
Road in America.

SIMPSON JUDGE WON'T LET MEDIA SEE VICTIMS' PHOTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strongly criticizing coverage in the O.J. Simpson case, Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito on Friday rejected media requests to view photographs of the 
murder victims -- which he said would "inevitably lead to graphic, 
sensationalistic, lurid and prurient descriptions" that would influence 
potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, meanwhile, spent the day recuperating from a Thursday morning 
hospital procedure in which swollen lymph nodes were removed from under his 
arms. Robert L. Shapiro, the football star's lead attorney, said after meeting 
with his client that Simpson is nervously awaiting test results that will 
reveal whether the swelling was caused by cancer or by one of many less serious 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 In his order, Ito allowed reporters to view other photographs of the crime 
scene, and he released one transcript from a closed-door session during last 
month's preliminary hearing. According to that transcript, attorneys on July 8 
discussed phone records regarding the time of a call to Nicole Brown Simpson, 
but they could not agree on when that call was placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The time of the call could prove important because it is the last time that 
she was known to be alive. Prosecutors contend that she and Ronald Lyle Goldman 
were killed sometime before 10:30 p.m. on June 12, and a witness testified that 
he found her dog wandering the neighborhood about 10:35 p.m. Simpson's 
attorneys maintain that the killings could have occurred later, about 11 p.m., 
while he was home preparing to leave for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito's order allowed the release of the five-page transcript, the 
thrust of his action was to limit coverage that, by most accounts, has exceeded 
that of any other murder investigation in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the news media accounts have been factual," Ito said in his order. 
"However, there are glaring examples of rank rumor and speculation, prurient 
sensationalism and outright fabrication that are the result of competitive 
commercial journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also sharply criticized the electronic news media for using microphones in 
court to eavesdrop on a conversation between Simpson and Shapiro, which Ito 
said "violated the sanctity of the attorney/client relationship." He added that 
he would "not hesitate to completely terminate in-court media coverage" if a 
similar violation occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the extent of the media coverage, Ito said allowing reporters access to 
the photographs of the victims before the trial would create "a substantial 
probability, and in this case a virtual certainty, that the defendant's right 
to a fair trial would be similarly prejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later about his order, Ito said he had sought to balance the "legitimate 
interests" of the media with the "sensibilities of the victims' families." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem I have to worry about is the jury pool," he said. "I don't think 
the L.A. Times, the New York Times or CNN or the New Orleans Times-Picayune . . 
. would show (the pictures of the victims' bodies). But others would." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said the order was "consistent with what we thought the ruling would 
be and with the legal arguments we made in court." In fact, the media request 
for access to photographs and transcripts was opposed by prosecutors and 
defense attorneys, a rare point of agreement in the contentious case. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts generally commended Ito's attempt to contain the coverage of the 
case, even as they warned that it will be difficult to control media discussion 
in the face of such enormous public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ito's trying to do the right thing," said Harland W. Braun, a noted 
criminal defense attorney who represented Officer Theodore J. Briseno in the 
federal civil rights trial of the officers who beat Rodney G. King. "These 
cases are extremely difficult, and the main problem he's got is trying to 
reconcile having a fair jury trial with the 1st Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's struggle is not a new one: In an era of intense media competition and 
the emergence of tabloid television shows -- with their splashy, 
sensationalistic approach to news coverage -- judges often are forced to 
grapple with the need to shield prospective jurors from information that could 
skew their verdicts and at the same time protect the public's right to observe 
judicial proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the federal King trial, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies urged lawyers 
not to discuss certain matters outside his courtroom. While jury selection was 
under way, he also imposed a gag order on Braun, in part to bar the outspoken 
attorney from publicly impugning the motives of prosecutors in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies was only partially successful. While lawyers generally heeded Davies' 
admonitions, Braun fought back against the gag order, and the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals quickly overturned it. In the wake of the appellate court 
ruling, Braun voluntarily stopped commenting on issues regarding the probable 
composition of the jury, but he quickly resumed his attacks on prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same concerns were raised surrounding the trial of four young men 
accused of attacking Reginald O. Denny and others during the opening hours of 
the Los Angeles riots. In that case, Superior Court Judge John W. Ouderkirk 
refrained from imposing gag orders but held a number of sessions behind closed 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy," Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson said of the effort to 
control information in such high-profile cases. "Even though judges have gone 
before you, every case is different." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem with attempting to keep prospective jurors from hearing 
prejudicial information, Levenson added, is that judges only can control the 
attorneys who appear before them and the evidence that flows through the 
courtroom. They are virtually powerless to stop other leaks or to keep news 
organizations from inaccurately reporting developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a near-impossible task to silence the public speculation in this case," 
Levenson said of the Simpson investigation. "You can silence the attorneys and 
still have information coming out from other sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Cammack, a Southwestern University law professor, agreed, adding that 
judges nonetheless often strive to protect their pool of potential jurors from 
the taint of news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some feeling on the part of the judge, some sense of responsibility 
that he needs to do what he can to prevent the jury pool from being polluted," 
Cammack said. "The trouble is, he hasn't got the resources to effectively 
contain all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 In his order, Ito also allowed reporters to view seven photographs introduced 
during the preliminary hearing. The judge set a Friday morning viewing time, 
and reporters from around the country lined up for a chance to be led, three at 
a time, to a table where the photographs were displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 A bailiff oversaw the viewing to ensure that no photographs were taken, and 
Ito himself observed the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters scribbled notes as they examined the pictures, which included 
photographs of a bloodstained envelope, a blue watch cap and a brown glove 
found near the bodies of the victims. A glove matching the one discovered at 
the scene was found at Simpson's Brentwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the photographs displayed Friday showed bloody shoe prints near 
the scene of the murders and depicted Goldman's Union Bank card and driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the photographs do not show the bodies of either victim, blood 
surrounds the murder scene. The edges of the white sheets covering the bodies 
are stained with blood as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the request from media organizations, Ito declined to release several 
transcripts of closed-door sessions during the preliminary hearing. One meeting 
involved witness security, Ito said, adding that two other sessions involved 
defense attorneys and the judge without prosecutors present. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the other transcripts involved the contents of a bulky Manila envelope 
displayed briefly in court during the preliminary hearing. Since the envelope's 
brief public appearance, its contents have been the object of widespread 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he will rule next week on a prosecution request to examine the 
envelope. In his order Friday, he declined to release the transcripts of the 
sessions at which the envelope was discussed, at least until he decides on the 
prosecution motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito released his order in written form Friday, so no court hearing was held. 
As a result, Simpson, recovering from the surgery, was not present for the 
release of the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with his client in jail, Shapiro said Simpson hoped to receive 
biopsy results this weekend. Swollen lymph nodes can signal the presence of 
cancer but also can point to less serious ailments such as allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very, very nervous," Shapiro said. "He hasn't seen his kids, and now 
there are these medical tests looming. That's bothering him." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Simpson also was troubled by the flurry of false reports that 
accompanied his early-morning trip to the hospital. Although Shapiro credited 
major newspapers with correctly reporting the details of the procedure, other 
news organizations speculated on a host of other possible problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got him terribly frustrated," Shapiro said. "Where's the credibility 
in these reports?" Ruling on Publicity 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a portion of Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's order issued Friday 
in the O.J. Simpson case, in which the judge talked about the impact of 
publicity: 
</P>
<P>
 "The arguments of all counsel concede the unprecedented news media interest 
and coverage in this case to the extent that the acting secretary of state has 
requested this court to stand in recess on Election Day to allow the democratic 
electoral process to go forward without the distraction of news media coverage 
of the trial in this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of the supermarket tabloid newspapers has carried the Simpson case as 
the cover story for the past month. Each of the tabloid television programs has 
featured the Simpson case on a regular basis for over a month.  
</P>

 "The all pervasive and invasive news media coverage has exceeded that of

U.S., NORTH KOREA REACH NUCLEAR PACT; FOREIGN POLICY: PYONGYANG PLEDGES NOT TO 
PURSUE ARMS PROGRAM; WASHINGTON AGREES TO HELP UPDATE REACTORS. BOTH MOVE TO

 North Korea pledged early today to stop trying to obtain nuclear weapons, an 
agreement that apparently defuses the most dangerous foreign policy crisis 
facing the Clinton Administration and its allies in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the United States agreed to help North Korea modernize its 
nuclear power facilities, the parties said in a joint statement issued in 
Geneva. The two nations also agreed in principle to establish diplomatic 
missions in each other's capitals for the first time since the internationally 
isolated, Communist-ruled state was established after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, announced at the end of talks that lasted well past midnight, 
provided a welcome victory for President Clinton one day after he suffered 
stunning defeats in Congress on crime and health care legislation. Some details 
of the accord, however, were left to later negotiations, scheduled to begin 
Sept. 23 in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely important because it's one of those foreign policy 
achievements that takes a lot of work and effort and, in the context of this 
kind of changing world, is very significant, particularly when you are dealing 
with a country like North Korea," White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta 
said in a telephone interview. "I think this is a real breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 The protracted dispute with North Korea had been cited by critics of the White 
House as further evidence of disarray in the Administration's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the crisis is over. But it (the agreement) certainly represents 
a significant step in trying to improve relations," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Foreign Ministry today hailed the Geneva statement as a move 
toward "final resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is definitely progress," said William Clark, a State Department expert on 
Asia during the George Bush Administration and now a scholar at the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "It was never going to be a 
quick fix with the North. . . . What they have done here is put the U.S. offer 
on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 According to news agency reports from Geneva, North Korea pledged to implement 
the joint declaration with South Korea on making the Korean peninsula free of 
nuclear weapons. The Pyongyang government also promised to remain a party to 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an international accord designed to stem 
the spread of nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said that, if North Korea keeps its word, those steps would end its 
nuclear weapons program. The North-South pact bans both nuclear arms and the 
fuel-reprocessing facilities that produce weapons-grade plutonium. Under the 
non-proliferation treaty, North Korea's nuclear power plants would be subject 
to international inspection. But North Korea did not agree to unlimited 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Washington said it will give Pyongyang "assurances against the 
threat or use of nuclear weapons by the United States." America also agreed to 
help North Korea modernize its electricity-generating facilities with 
light-water nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reactors are far more efficient than the graphite-moderated equipment 
that North Korea now uses. Light-water reactors also produce far less 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, chief delegate to the Geneva 
talks that began Aug. 5, said he is confident the United States can get 
together an international consortium to provide the necessary technology and 
funding for the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactor modernization program, however, will take at least a decade to 
complete, so North Korea will continue to use its existing facilities well into 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint statement said that more negotiations will be required to determine 
the disposition of about 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods now corroding in a 
cooling pond north of Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crisis was touched off in May when North Korea removed the rods 
from its Yongbyon nuclear plant in defiance of International Atomic Energy 
Agency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The rods contain enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons. The United 
States wants to ship them to a third country, but North Korea has not agreed to 
that step. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea said it will take measures to stabilize the rods to delay the risk 
of them giving off radiation and agreed to permit international inspectors to 
supervise the work. Pyongyang previously had argued that it must begin 
reprocessing the rods by the end of August or they would start to give off 
harmful radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The two countries agreed in principle to establish liaison offices in 
Pyongyang and Washington to provide representation, a step that stops short of 
full diplomatic relations. But their statement said that further negotiations 
will be required to work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the liaison office agreement was included as a gesture to Kim Jong 
Il, North Korea's new leader. It gives Kim -- who took over after the death 
last month of his father, Kim Il Sung -- a measure of international legitimacy 
that the elder Kim never achieved during almost half a century of power. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also said the two nations will "reduce barriers to trade and 
investment as a move toward full normalization of political and economic 
relations" -- measures that would ease North Korea's isolation. 
</P>

NEW GENERATION OF FANS FLOCKS TO WOODSTOCK '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Twenty-five years after the concert that was like no other, the sons and 
daughters of the Woodstock Generation swarmed over 800 acres of dusty fields in 
Upstate New York on Friday, seeking to carve their own niche in the nation's 
popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 By the thousands, they descended on the Winston Farm to sway under the sun and 
stars, build tent villages and cheer a mix of musicians spanning three decades 
of rock history. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 90,000, overwhelmingly young and ready to party but also including 
veterans of the first Woodstock, surged into the Saugerties site by nightfall, 
raising the hopes of concert producers who spent $30 million to put on a 
profitable weekend of music, merchandising and memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters predicted that the crowd would swell to over 200,000 by the end of 
the weekend. By late afternoon, the field was filled with an ocean of fans that 
seemed to stretch from the stage to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The throng arrived in campers and cars, school buses and motorcycles, and 
staked out space amid a multihued garden of earthly designs. There were crudely 
fashioned tepees and a high-tech "interactive village," hot air balloons and a 
digital newspaper facility. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day progressed, the crowd loosened. Some swabbed themselves in mud and 
stormed up to the stage, parting the crowd as they ran. Others, even musicians 
on stage, stripped naked. And wafting from the fields, in spite of prohibitions 
against narcotics, came the pungent aroma of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the sprawl stood a psychedelic rainbow-colored Volkswagen van, a '60s 
automotive icon that attracted hundreds of fans posing for snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gods are smiling on us, man," said the van's long-haired owned, Rob "the 
Chicken," 26, of Orlando, Fla., who sat blissed-out in a tie-dyed shirt as 
teen-agers marveled at the relic from the Woodstock era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weird colors, the fluorescent stuff, it's just like from the 60s," said 
Bill Lewin, 24, who drove in with friends from New Jersey. "It's worth all the 
hassle to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 purists gathered Friday at the shrine of the original Woodstock, 
the former farm of Max Yasgur in Bethel, N.Y., about 60 miles from here, where 
an estimated 500,000 fans peacefully camped for three days in 1969. They 
decried the commercialism of the bigger festival, its tight security and its 
high cost -- $135 a ticket, compared to $18 a ticket 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's manufactured," said Bob Zeller, 42. "It will never capture the spirit of 
this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenters, electricians and sound engineers were hastily assembling a small 
stage for a rival concert, though it was very much a David and Goliath effort. 
The hope was to attract a smattering of original Woodstock performers. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager named Jill, who giggled and said she did not want to give her last 
name because her parents did not know she was in Bethel, said she regarded the 
massive Saugerties festival as "the total opposite of what Woodstock was 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had lived back then," Jill added. "We don't have anything cool now." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the first notes roared out from the Saugerties stage over brightly 
colored tents and meadows hopefully rendered mosquito-proof, generational 
comparisons to the Woodstock Music Festival of 1969 abounded.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are producing this thing in a fish bowl," lamented John Roberts, a 
principal financier of the first concert and who is one of three Woodstock '94 
producers. "The last time was stealth. This time there wasn't a meeting we had, 
a strategy session we didn't read about somewhere in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Woodstock Nation took shape under the restrictions of state laws 
regulating mass gatherings that were passed after the 1969 concert caused 
health and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic control plan rivaled a telephone book in thickness. Metal 
detectors were installed at the entrances to the concert on the Winston Farm. 
The budget was $30 million. Vendors laid in 100,000 bagels, 120,000 quarts of 
orange juice, 2 million gallons of water and 234,750 hot dogs. By the time the 
last rock fan departs on Monday, 700 yellow shuttle buses are predicted to make 
32,000 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were reminders of the original concert. There was the occasional 
nudity. Some gate-crashers suffered scratches climbing over the 10-foot chain 
link fence. Low gray clouds threatened rain. Despite the metal detectors and 
bag searches, and a massive security force who wore colored T-shirts 
proclaiming "peace patrol," liquor and dope were evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on how tough they want to be," said Chris Urello, 21, of 
Norwich, Conn. "Some searches are pretty tough and some people don't even put 
their hands in the bags. And if they're girls and they're pretty, they really 
get it easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the section of cyclone fence Urello guarded, a quintet of German 
university students sat cross legged in a makeshift tent city and passed around 
a fat marijuana cigarette. The students said they smuggled in a small cache 
hidden in a contraceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come to Woodstock, you have to smoke, yes?" said Thorsten Granden, 25, a 
deeply tanned business manager, as he listened to the succession of bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock '94 at Saugerties began with a series of local bands, ranging in 
tone from aggressive alternative rock to country music. The played on the 
massive stage where performers ranging from Woodstock alumni Joe Cocker and 
Crosby Stills & Nash will join contemporary favorites today and Sunday such as 
Metallica, Nine Inch Nails and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in entertaining the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expensive, but it's a blast. Everyone around here is so peaceful," said 
Jamie Cronkwright, 19, from Rochester, N.Y. who drove to the site with his 
friend, Greg Vasilovski, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the young bands playing Friday said they were uneasy with the 
current festival's commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great to be here and have this opportunity for our music to be heard 
by so many people, but I don't like all the marketing and merchandising and 
tight security," said Swayzak, 24, a member of the Goats, an alternative rap 
group from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later on stage, another contemporary group, Blues Traveler, 
brought the crowd alive by saluting the most famous musical moment of the first 
Woodstock. John Popper did a harmonica solo of the "The Star-Spangled Banner" 
that recalled the dramatic shading of the late guitarist Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
 John Scher, president of PolyGram Diversified Ventures, the international 
entertainment conglomerate that is the primary backer of Woodstock '94, said 
75,000 people were already in place when the first notes sounded shortly after 
11 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 In strongest terms, he sought to blunt all the criticism of commercialism. 
Scher said he was "sick and tired" of all the "unfair" media attacks on 
Woodstock '94 and charged the media have taken some "cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Woodstock in every sense of the word," he insisted.

CLINTON ATTACKS CONGRESS, VOWS NEW CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Friday assailed Congress for rejecting his crime bill as 
Administration officials and congressional leaders scrambled to resuscitate one 
of the cornerstones of the Administration's legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before a group of uniformed police officers here, an apparently 
frustrated Clinton said: "We did not get you a crime bill yesterday. But we're 
going to get you a crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "To all the police officers in this country who walk out there for us every 
day," Clinton vowed, his voice hoarse, "Washington cannot walk away from you." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Washington, shellshocked Administration officials and congressional 
Democratic leaders huddled in tense strategy sessions looking for ways to 
revive the $33.2-billion legislation, which suffered a stunning 15-vote defeat 
in a procedural vote Thursday in the House. In Democratic ranks, the atmosphere 
teetered "somewhere between defiance and despair," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Democrats Friday failed to reach consensus on the basic choice ahead: 
whether to change the bill in the hope of attracting more votes -- or simply to 
make a second run at passing the measure rejected Thursday. While the White 
House and Senate Democrats clearly preferred the second strategy, congressional 
and Administration sources said that House Democratic leaders were uncertain 
they could change the eight votes needed to pass the bill as it is.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, our preference would be to have them bring the bill back up for a 
vote and support the elements that are part of it," White House Chief of Staff 
Leon E. Panetta said in an interview Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But speaking to reporters Friday morning, House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) pointedly refused to predict that the House could simply push 
through the bill on a second try. "We're going to stay and get a crime bill 
done," he said. "(But) I don't know exactly what the bill would look like that 
could pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive crime bill devoted nearly $9 billion for hiring police officers, 
$6.5 billion for prison construction, $1.8 billion to reimburse states for the 
costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants and nearly $8 billion for a variety 
of crime "prevention" programs. It also would expand the death penalty for more 
than 50 additional federal crimes and it would ban 19 types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the crime bill has always involved an intricate balancing act between 
left and right, Democratic leaders acknowledged that their salvage operation 
has little room to maneuver. If the bill is revised, said one senior House 
Democratic leadership aide, the most prominent options are either to modify the 
assault weapons ban or strip it from the bill entirely, allowing a separate 
up-or-down vote on the controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But either of those steps are fraught with political peril, aides 
acknowledged. A slight modification in the ban would probably be insufficient 
to satisfy the National Rifle Assn. -- and thus might fail to win over enough 
of the ban's opponents to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the assault ban probably would bring back substantial numbers of 
conservative Democrats and several Democrats pressed forcefully for that option 
at the closed-door meetings Friday. Arguing that not only the presidency but 
Democratic control of the House could be jeopardized in November if no crime 
bill is passed, they pressed for "substantial" changes in the ban to ensure 
that the leadership has more than enough votes to win a new vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Administration officials believe, diluting the assault weapons ban would 
constitute a major political defeat for Clinton, who had campaigned furiously 
for the measure when it passed the House by two votes in May. And dropping the 
ban could erode support on the left -- particularly among the 28 Democratic 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who voted for the bill despite 
disappointment over abandonment of a provision to make it easier for prisoners 
on Death Row to challenge their sentences as racially biased. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the interview, Panetta left open some hint of openness: "We don't 
want to see the assault weapon just stripped from the bill. . . . Are there 
modifications? I guess we would have to see what those might be." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, one House Democratic aide said, cutting the legislation's nearly $8 
billion in prevention money to attract Republicans who labeled such spending as 
"pork" could also prompt an exodus from the bill on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Even narrow changes held out the threat of major disputes. Both the 
Administration and Democratic leaders had spoken of possibly stripping from the 
bill a $10-million grant to establish a criminal justice institute at Lamar 
University in the district of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.). Republicans had ridiculed the money as symbolic of what they termed 
bloated spending in the bill. But Friday, the powerful Brooks angrily reacted 
to that suggestion: "Hell no. You out of your mind? Just because it's in 
Beaumont doesn't mean it's a bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Democrats decide to amend the bill, it would be difficult procedurally. 
House leaders could incorporate a resolution revising the bill into the rule 
permitting it to be considered on the floor. But one senior Administration 
official said that is impractical because any changes approved in that manner 
would be subject to amendment in the Senate -- which would effectively reopen 
the entire crime bill for debate on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The other option for changing the bill is to return it to the House-Senate 
conference committee. But both Brooks and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) 
strongly opposed that idea Friday. "I have no intention of going back to 
conference for a simple reason," Biden said. "I know no way of getting out of 
conference once we go to conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with those calculations, senior officials in both the White House and 
Justice Department said that the Administration's clear preference was to avoid 
major changes in the legislation. Instead, they said, the President would turn 
up the public pressure in the hope that a wave of public outrage would propel 
the measure through the House on a second vote. In the search for votes, 
Administration officials and congressional leaders were hoping for small gains 
with three groups:  
</P>
<P>
 * The 10 Democratic members of the Black Caucus who voted no on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The two or three moderate Democrats who indicated privately that they might 
have supported Clinton if the bill had a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 19 Republicans who backed both the assault weapons ban and the overall 
crime bill in the House this spring but voted against the procedural measure 
Thursday. Included are Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Long Beach) and Mike Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, those defecting Republicans said that they opposed the 
measure because they considered it stuffed with wasteful spending on social 
programs like "midnight basketball" leagues. But the Justice Department 
compiled figures showing that the final legislation contained $800 million less 
in social spending than the earlier House version that those Republicans had 
backed in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, congressional aides said Friday there were no signs yet of members 
recanting their opposition to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, some signs that Republicans were uneasy about being 
blamed by Clinton for derailing action on an issue that tops most surveys of 
public concern. White House sources said that House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) called Panetta at 7:30 a.m. Friday to seek an opportunity to discuss 
the bill. Later in the day Gingrich, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
and four other party leaders wrote Clinton requesting a meeting to negotiate 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta rebuffed the request, criticizing Republicans who switched from 
earlier support of the legislation to opposition Thursday and calling on the 
GOP leaders to work directly with congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began his lobbying effort before several hundred members of the 
National Assn. of Police Organizations, which represents 160,000 police 
officers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old Washington game -- stick it to ordinary Americans," Clinton 
said, sounding at times more weary than angry. "But the time has come for those 
of you to say that the only way for Congress to make their seats safe is to 
make the rest of America safer." 
</P>

POLITICS; A REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST IN GUATEMALAN ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD ORLEBAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man whose human rights record helped make Guatemala an international pariah 
a decade ago has emerged as the central figure in Sunday's congressional 
elections here. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a Christian fundamentalist who grabbed power 
in a 1982 coup and is accused by human rights groups of ordering thousands of 
political killings, is expected to win a seat easily in the 80-member Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing group founded by Rios Montt -- the Guatemalan Republican Front, 
known as the FRG -- is leading the polls, slightly ahead of the Partido de 
Avanzada Nacional, also on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections were called to purge the legislature of its notoriously corrupt 
members after President Ramiro de Leon Carpio failed to muster enough political 
support to force an earlier congressional housecleaning last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of Rios Montt has alarmed human rights groups, grass-roots 
organizations and intellectuals, who remember with terror the repression 
carried out during his 18-month rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guatemala City, union members and political dissidents were rounded up and 
summarily executed or "disappeared" during Rios Montt's regime, while in the 
countryside his security forces razed hundreds of Mayan villages as part of a 
"scorched-earth" campaign seeking to destroy the support base of leftist 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rios Montt offers a more moderate image. His campaign jingles are an 
adapted version of American rock band Santana's "Oye Como Va" and a song by 
Panamanian rapper El General. 
</P>
<P>
 But this has not impressed opponents such as rights activist Nineth 
Montenegro, whose first husband, Fernando, was "disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is morally unacceptable that people who are so stained with blood 
should be able to run for public office," she said. "This is a step backward 
for the Guatemalan political system." 
</P>
<P>
 Montenegro said she plans to present a list of 15,000 named victims who were 
either killed or "disappeared" by the security forces during Rios Montt's 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rios Montt is also remembered for keeping the streets clean of common 
crime. His campaign, which emphasizes honesty and a tough stand on law and 
order, has struck a chord with many Guatemalans who feel besieged by criminal 
violence and are sickened by seemingly endemic institutional corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time somebody's car gets stolen, a girl gets raped or a bus gets held 
up, that's another vote for Rios Montt," said veteran Congressman Jorge Skinner 
Klee, who is running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that two mass graves are being exhumed with the remains of civilian 
victims of the security forces acting during Rios Montt's regime does not seem 
to have had any effect on the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The general's advisers admit that this is the beginning of a campaign for 
presidential elections in November, 1995. Rios Montt was barred from running 
for president in 1990 when the country's Constitutional Court disqualified him 
because he had served as a de facto head of state. 
</P>
<P>
 But if his party does extremely well, there will be pressure to cancel the 
earlier ban. "If the FRG wins a landslide, obviously it will strengthen his 
chances," said political analyst Gustavo Porras. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon's government, which has already begun to lobby prospective deputies, 
is hoping that the new Congress will be more receptive than its predecessor to 
what is expected to be a heavy legislative load. 
</P>
<P>
 The government wants to sign a peace agreement with left-wing guerrillas to 
end a 33-year civil war by the end of this year. Any treaty will include 
numerous commitments on political and social reforms that will require 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new deputies will only serve until January, 1996, they will be 
responsible for improving the abysmal reputation for venality and personal 
advancement that their colleagues currently enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a last chance," Skinner Klee said. "If we don't make this work, we'll 
have to shoot it out."

HISTORY; 82 YEARS AFTER SINKING, TITANIC STILL IN SPOTLIGHT; UPCOMING EXHIBIT 
APPALLS SOME BRITONS, WHO SEE 'GRAVE ROBBERY.' BUT THE MUSEUM CITES ARTIFACTS' 
IMPORTANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The controversial loss of the Titanic has fascinated generations of Britons 
and Americans: The "unsinkable" luxury liner with its famous passengers sank on 
its maiden voyage in 1912 after ramming an iceberg in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversial aspects of the sinking of the world's largest ship, sailing from 
Southampton, England, to New York, have often been recounted; more than 1,500 
lives were lost and the actions of senior officers were criticized. The ship 
had lifeboats for only half the 2,228 passengers and crew and did not reduce 
speed or alter its course despite repeated iceberg warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Britain's National Maritime Museum is preparing a major exhibition called 
"The Wreck of the Titanic," and it has generated controversy too. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, scheduled to open Oct. 4, will include a porthole, a chandelier, 
a champagne bottle with its contents intact, crystal, traveler's checks, 
statuettes, bracelets, a shaving brush and a leather cigarette case -- complete 
with cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the Titanic's victims and others argue that the relics recovered 
by U.S. and French salvagers in 1987 and 1993 should have been left with the 
wreck and that it is ghoulish to hold an exhibition of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Smith, great-nephew of the Titanic's captain, Edward J. Smith, who went 
down with the ship, said the exhibition of 150 items is "nothing short of grave 
robbery. The dead should be allowed to rest in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 And the British Titanic Society says that the exhibition is "insensitive" and 
is "compounding an already emotive issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "We object to the fact that it's being used for commercial gain," said Titanic 
Society Vice President Bob Pryor. "If they have to do this, they should gather 
the items into one place as a memorial to those who still lie buried in the 
wreckage." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titanic was located, resting more than two miles deep, by a 
French-American expedition with deep-diving submersibles in 1985. Since then 
about 2,600 artifacts have been removed fromthe ship, which rests in at least 
two sections. 
</P>
<P>
 George Tulloch, the chairman of the salvage company, RMS Titanic Inc., said it 
agreed not to sell any of the relics and would keep them together for public 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 If company projections of the number of visitors who wish to see the relics 
are correct, RMS Titanic stands to make a large profit from the exhibition, 
which will tour the world for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Columnist Bernard Levin of the Times of London joined the critics recently, 
asking, "How can we allow trinket hunters to plunder the watery grave of the 
Titanic and put their booty on show?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Adm. Lord Lewin, chairman of the museum trustees, countered, "The ethical 
aspects were considered very carefully . . . , and certain principles were 
established: that the artifacts should always be kept together as a collection 
and never sold, that the collection will always be available for public display 
and that the aim should be to establish a permanent museum that would be a 
Titanic memorial." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen Deuchar, the museum's head of exhibitions, added, "The slice of 
life represented by Titanic's passengers and crew, from every social class and 
more than 20 countries, renders the ship a unique time capsule with immense 
historical significance. The artifacts on display will also bring to life, in a 
unique way, Titanic's brief but legendary history." 
</P>
<P>
 Millvina Dean was 9 weeks old when her mother bundled her into a lifeboat, 
leaving her father behind on the Titanic. She says she has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was against bringing the artifacts up in the first place," she said. "I 
didn't want anything to be touched, because I thought my father was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once they had brought them up from the seabed, there was nothing anyone 
could do about it, and I thought people might as well see the things as a part 
of history." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maritime Museum is in Greenwich, on the River Thames.

3 HELD IN UKRAINE; PLANE WITH MATERIEL FOR BALKANS SEIZED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group trying to smuggle more than four tons of ammunition to the former 
Yugoslav federation was arrested by Ukrainian authorities who seized their 
plane and cargo, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, two Ukrainians and a Pole, were charged Tuesday with attempting to 
break the U.N. embargo on the sale of weapons to the former Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons were destined for Croatia, a Security Ministry official said on 
condition of anonymity. The Croatian Embassy refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects in the smuggling case face charges of "attempting to 
illegally transport through Ukraine's borders over 200,000 cartridges . . . to 
a zone of armed conflict in Yugoslavia," the Security Ministry said. If 
convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, whose names were withheld, claimed they were intermediaries for the 
Kenyan armed forces, said Anatoli Sakhno, spokesman for the national security 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb troops besieging the Bosnian capital 
seized a heavy cannon Friday from a U.N. storage depot but returned it at the 
demand of U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops noticed that a 105-millimeter howitzer and some 
ammunition were missing from a depot they were guarding in Krivoglavci, about 
three miles northwest of Sarajevo, U.N. spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the peacekeepers demanded the cannon's return, the Serbs brought a 
smaller 76-millimeter gun and no ammunition, Holloway said. The U.N. troops 
insisted on the original gun and ammunition, and the rebels finally returned 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Serbs took back the smaller howitzer. Its presence violated a 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization-enforced ban on heavy weapons in a 12.5-mile 
zone around Sarajevo.

ITALY OFFICIAL'S REMARK ANGERS JEWISH GROUPS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewish groups in Italy and abroad demanded Friday that Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi denounce a Cabinet minister for suggesting "the New York Jewish 
lobby" was behind the plunging lira. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Minister Clemente Mastella later apologized, but the World Jewish 
Congress said it would complain to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi has been criticized, particularly in Western Europe, for including 
the National Alliance in his 3-month-old conservative coalition. The party was 
formed about a year ago by members of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement 
who renounced their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap began Thursday after the Bank of Italy unexpectedly raised the 
discount rate to halt the lira's slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastella suggested the currency's decline was part of a plot against the 
government.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CONFLICTING APPROACHES TO ENDING BALKANS WAR FORGE ODD ALLIANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a case of strange bedfellows, the United States and Serbia are now both at 
work trying to bring peace to the Balkans by eliminating the Bosnian Serbs' 
huge military advantage over their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In an even stranger collaboration, Britain and the United Nations seem to be 
trying to save the rebels from that fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has already cut off fuel and weaponry to 
his former allies, and President Clinton vowed Thursday to push to exempt the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government from a U.N. arms embargo if the Bosnian Serbs 
have not accepted a peace plan by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory, say Western diplomats, is that if the Bosnian Serbs can no longer 
fight with the confidence of a heavy weapons advantage and a reliable supply of 
ammunition, they will be vulnerable to government counterattacks and presumably 
more willing to give up some captured land in return for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as international efforts to force the Bosnian Serbs to comply 
appeared in sync, the U.N. Protection Force headquartered in this Croatian 
capital has weighed in to ease rebel fears of a comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
has warned the Sarajevo government that it might face punitive air strikes if 
it takes advantage of the Bosnian Serbs' isolation by trying to recover 
territory seized by the rebels over the past 28 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilian bureaucracy of the U.N. mission is also acting to ease Bosnian 
Serb concerns that the international community is taking sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission spokesman Michael Williams said any move to lift the arms embargo 
would compel a withdrawal of U.N. forces, which would unleash "disastrous" 
consequences for civilians in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 With no protective cordon of peacekeepers between Bosnian Serb heavy weapons 
and poorly defended enclaves such as Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa, the rebels 
could unleash a fierce artillery assault against the last Muslims in eastern 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that lifting of the arms embargo would be designed to help one party 
and be aimed at another party, that would make it quite difficult for (the U.N. 
force) to remain in Bosnia," Williams said, adding that contingency plans for a 
pullout were being speeded up in the wake of Clinton's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of a pullout has exposed yet another rift within the international 
community over Bosnia, this time between the military peacekeepers on the 
ground and the diplomatic peacemakers at work on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the international community, via the (U.N.) Security Council or 
NATO, is finally on the verge of pressuring the Bosnian Serbs hard, (the U.N. 
force) comes up with something to balance things out," a senior Western 
diplomat observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government leaders welcomed Clinton's call to arm them, even if the 
peacekeepers leave as a result. But Muslim civilians, especially those in the 
Serbian-encircled eastern enclaves, probably fear they would be overrun by the 
rebels before weapons could reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has repeatedly insisted the 20,000 U.N. troops deployed in Bosnia would 
be targets of angry Bosnian Serb retaliation if the arms embargo is lifted.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources within the U.N. hierarchy and the diplomatic community say Rose places 
a higher priority on getting British forces out of the dangerous peacekeeping 
mission than he does on securing a settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing through a peace plan also appears a secondary goal at U.N. 
headquarters, where Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has likewise 
observed publicly that the Balkans mission may have to be scrapped for security 
reasons, no matter what the outcome of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace plan drafted by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and 
Germany would divide Bosnia roughly in half, giving 49% to the Bosnian Serb 
insurgents who now occupy more than 70%, and the slightly larger part to a 
federation of Croats, Muslims and Bosnian Serb proponents of integration. 
</P>
<P>
 Federation officials have accepted the plan as the most the outside world is 
willing to ensure them, while rebels loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist Radovan 
Karadzic have steadfastly refused to give up any territory in exchange for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's spurning of the peace plan has angered Milosevic, whose own country 
and Montenegro, the junior partner in the rump Yugoslavia, are staggering under 
the stiff economic sanctions imposed for instigating the Bosnian conflict. In 
an effort to get sanctions relief, Milosevic has joined the effort to force 
Karadzic to agree to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the peace proposal was being drafted, Western officials raised the 
prospect of North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombings if either side rejected 
their formula for division. But Russia is reluctant to target traditional Slav 
allies, and Britain and France fear any use of force against the Serbs will 
expose their peacekeepers to retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force "suffers from the Stockholm syndrome," the senior Western 
diplomat commented, referring to the psychological phenomenon of hostages who 
grow to sympathize with their captors. "They are surrounded by the Serbs. They 
know the Serbs could kill them. So who do they side with? The Sarajevo 
government that is in the same boat? No. They side with the Serbs because they 
don't want to upset the side that would kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from troop-contributing countries acknowledge the dilemma but excuse 
its consequences for the peace plan as the price for protecting the lives of 
their soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the fault of (the U.N. force) that the world cannot make peace in 
the Balkans," said an envoy from one country with troops in Bosnia. "They have 
been sent into the middle of a raging war and told to keep still until the 
outside world decides what to do about it. They are a human shield against the 
spread of the conflict, and an ineffectual one at that."BOSNIA HERZ

<P>
 The United Nations conceded Friday that it has failed in its campaign to coax 
significant numbers of 900,000 Rwandan refugees out of the squalid camps here 
and get them moving home. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the United Nations and leaders of the Western nations found 
themselves bitterly criticized by one private relief agency for not doing more 
to help ease the suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goma is becoming the new Gaza Strip. Even if a lot more refugees start 
returning home, I'm afraid we're going to have vast numbers of them staying 
here for a very long time," said Panos Moumtsis, spokesman for the Office of 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Moumtsis hesitated to guess how long the refugees might stay -- whether it 
would be months, years or a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the first of the refugees began to stream here out of Rwanda. 
Within four days, they had turned themselves into the greatest, fastest-moving 
tide of refugees in modern times. Ever since, the United Nations has maintained 
that the only real hope for these impoverished people is repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, relief coordinators have established food stops, hospitals and 
bus transportation along the roads back into Rwanda. The United Nations has 
repeatedly spread the word here and around the world that refugees will be safe 
when they go home. Religious and community leaders from the camps have been 
escorted by the United Nations back into Rwanda to see for themselves. A radio 
station was established to broadcast testimonials from returning refugees to 
tell those in the camps that they would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the campaign has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 5,000 people a day cross the border back into Rwanda from Zaire. The 
remainder have dug in to battle disease, hunger and awful, Stone Age living 
conditions rather than face the rebel army that has taken control of their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen people so determined not to go back," Moumtsis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relief workers said the repatriation campaign was another waste of energy 
by the United Nations and was an attempt to sweep Rwanda's deep ethnic 
divisions under the rug. "If the U.N. doesn't learn from this, God help the 
next poor souls of the world who need help," said John O'Shea of the Irish 
relief agency GOAL, which has been active here from the beginning of the 
refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Using bitter profanities, O'Shea said the United Nations has failed to meet 
the refugees' needs and has made no serious effort to make them feel safe going 
home. He said only a large campaign with the priority of a global military 
operation could handle a crisis this large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think, if this were a war, our people would have the supplies they 
need to fight it?" he demanded. "Frankly, the leaders of the international 
community are hoping that the people who will go home are the television 
cameras, and the sooner the better. Then this will be over as far as they're 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions in the refugee camps radiating out of Goma remained miserable in 
the extreme as the Rwandans began their second month here. The United Nations 
said only 60% of the needed quantities of food were reaching refugees and only 
half the amount of plastic sheeting needed to build the most primitive kinds of 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll from disease continued at an estimated 500 per day. The United 
Nations said it had counted 27,000 bodies so far, many left rotting in the sun. 
Some private groups have estimated that the death toll could be almost three 
times that great. Because of a suspected outbreak of deadly typhus, soap -- to 
improve hygiene and combat disease-spreading lice -- is given highest priority 
in relief shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Kinshasa, Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo acknowledged that 
Zairian troops, sent here to help with the crisis created by more than 1 
million Rwandan refugees, "got the situation out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zairian soldiers have been robbing and harassing Rwandan refugees, 
Zairians and aid workers, according to a number of reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "In view of what happened, the first decision is that troops responsible for 
that situation must be arrested and brought to court," he told Radio Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 And more immediately, between 1.2 million and 2 million Rwandans remain 
huddled in the southwestern quarter of their country, where the French military 
maintains a safety zone. But the French are pulling out, and relief agencies 
say another stampede into Zaire is quite possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, there are only the barest of advance preparations under way in the 
Zaire border town of Bukavu, about 70 miles south of Goma. U.N. officials said 
that, with continuing supply shortages for the refugees in Goma, there is 
little that can be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 A bitter O'Shea could only shout out the frustration of those who cannot seem 
to make headway against the despair. "This is the worst aid screw-up in the 
history of the world! The world is saying to these people, you're black, you're 
Rwandans, you're not of strategic importance, don't call us, we'll call you."

 Volcanic activity near Rwandan refugee camps raised concern among aid 
officials Friday that hundreds of thousands who fled civil war may be forced to 
flee again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nyirangongo volcano, a few miles from the Kibumba camp, has been giving 
off a red glow, indicating the presence of a lava lake in the crater. An 
eruption of that volcano killed 1,000 people in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nyamuragira volcano, 20 miles north of Goma, has produced a lava flow out 
of its southwest flank, a volcano expert at the U.S. Geological Survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 An eruption of Nyirangongo would force the evacuation of both the Kibumba and 
Katale camps, which contain two-thirds of the 900,000 refugees in the area, a 
U.N. spokesman said.

 In another furor over Japan's World War II deeds, a Japanese Cabinet minister 
said Friday that this nation did not intend to wage a war of aggression and 
that its policies led to Asia's independence and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shin Sakurai, Environmental Agency chief, retracted his statement as 
"inappropriate" hours later at an emergency news conference after the South 
Korean government lodged a vehement protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakurai, who made his statement just days before the 49th anniversary of the 
end of World War II, said he agreed with Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama that Japan's wartime deeds caused "unbearable sorrow" to Asian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental chief is a member of the conservative Liberal Democratic 
Party, which jointly rules with the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor underscored Japan's continuing inability to come to terms with its 
wartime role and the fundamental tension between the two coalition partners 
over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists have long urged that Japan make a forthright apology and offer 
more war reparations. But the Liberal Democrats have balked at further action, 
saying the matter of compensation has long been settled under various treaties. 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicians still refuse to acknowledge Japan's wartime deeds. Earlier 
this year, former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denied that the Rape of 
Nanking -- in which scholars say between 200,000 and 300,000 people were killed 
in what is now Nanjing, China -- ever occurred. He later apologized but was 
forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the war's 50th anniversary approaches next year, Japan is aiming to 
settle the issue once and for all. The government is planning to contribute $10 
billion over 10 years to establish a private "peace fund" to compensate Asian 
women forced into sexual slavery and other victims of Japan's military 
aggression, the Asahi Shimbun reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Friday, Sakurai said it was only after soldiers went to the 
front that they were seized by an "unusual psychological condition" that caused 
them to "give other people a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that, because of Japan's efforts, Asian nations were liberalized, 
educated and given infrastructure that laid the groundwork for their rapid 
postwar economic growth.

U.N. REPORT CITES ATROCITIES BY CAMBODIAN ARMY

<P>
 A confidential U.N. report accuses senior Cambodian army officers of raping, 
murdering and cannibalizing civilians detained in secret centers, a Cambodian 
newspaper said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said senior military officials responsible for these atrocities 
were not disciplined but were promoted to higher ranks, the English-language 
Phnom Penh Post, a reliable independent biweekly, said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the U.N. Center for Human Rights here refused to comment 
on the article except to say that the agency's report, dated May 10, was 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. report documented the activities of the S-91 intelligence unit, which 
operates in the northwest, and blamed it for 35 executions since August, 1993, 
at Cheu Kmao, a secret detention facility. At least 18 others were killed 
before then, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the victims died, the executioners "ripped open" their abdomens to 
extract their livers, then they fried or grilled them and ate them, the paper 
said. Many Cambodians believe eating the liver of a brave enemy will transfer 
the dead's courage to the person who eats it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two government investigations followed up on the U.N. report but reached 
conflicting conclusions about the army's involvement.

JAPAN SHOULD TAKE WIDER MILITARY ROLE, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan should abandon its passive, homeland-only defense policy of the past 
four decades and actively join and support U.S.- and U.N.-led efforts to 
resolve regional conflicts around the world, an advisory panel to the prime 
minister recommended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sitting at home, as it did during the Cold War, and "preparing for 
attacks on Japan's territory" that are increasingly unlikely to occur, the 
country's Self-Defense Forces should make participation in U.N. peacekeeping 
operations "a major duty," the Advisory Group on Defense Issues said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation's security concerns are worldwide," the panel declared. 
</P>
<P>
 It also recommended that the government expand peacekeeping operations from 
strictly non-military missions to include operations involving infantry units 
in which the Japanese would bear arms "to a certain extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Established in February by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to draw up 
a post-Cold War defense strategy, the panel urged a far more active approach to 
international security than has been advocated by Socialist Prime Minister 
Tomiichi Murayama or either of the other leaders of his tripartite coalition.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, as a government report supported by the Japan Defense Agency, the 
recommendations promised to serve as the focus of debate over a new defense 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama said the report contained recommendations he did not agree with and 
said only that he would use the report "as a reference" in setting defense 
policy. In his first news conference as prime minister last month, he ruled out 
peacekeeping missions in which Japanese troops would bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama also astonished the nation by scrapping his Socialist Party's 
four-decade insistence that Japanese armed forces were unconstitutional. But he 
quickly pledged to work for disarmament and imposed a severe 0.9% cap on the 
increase in the defense budget for next year. Defense spending now amounts to 
$46.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that "international cooperation centering on the United States 
provides a realistic basis of a post-Cold War security system," the defense 
panel said active Japanese participation in overseas peacekeeping would 
encourage the United States to continue providing leadership for such 
multinational missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also endorsed an increase in payments to support U.S. troops 
stationed in Japan, acceptance of an American proposal to jointly develop an 
antiballistic missile system for Japan and the signing of a North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization-style agreement that would enable Japan for the first time 
to provide logistic support, supplies and services to U.S. troops here. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, if a conflict broke out on the Korean peninsula, Japan would be 
legally unable to support American troops fighting there. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group recommended cuts in the number of fighter aircraft, tanks 
and anti-submarine warfare ships the country maintains. But more spending was 
recommended for sophisticated new weapons and intelligence-gathering equipment, 
including satellites, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
 From Japan's defeat in World War II until Parliament enacted an international 
peacekeeping law in 1992, Japanese troops had been banned from overseas 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Japan has dispatched small bands of noncombat peacekeeping forces to 
Cambodia and Mozambique and is now studying whether to send troops on a 
humanitarian mission to Rwanda.

U.S. RECALLS SKIRTS IMPORTED FROM INDIA; RETAIL: CONSUMER SAFETY BOARD SAYS THE 
TWO-LAYER RAYON GARMENT IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. MORE THAN 250,000 HAVE BEEN 
DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Announcing the nation's biggest ever retail recall, federal officials Friday 
warned that two-layer chiffon "broomstick" skirts imported from India should 
not be worn because they are highly flammable. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter million of the skirts, which are part of the summer and 
autumn lines of more than 20 labels, have been distributed to hundreds of 
retailers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that this is such a dangerous item is not just that it burns but 
that it burns at such a fast rate," said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the federal 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, which ordered the recall. The skirts will 
burn faster than a newspaper, if ignited, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately we found these dangerous two-layer rayon skirts in time," she 
added, noting that no injuries have been reported, although the skirts have 
been imported from India for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The skirts are long and billowy with tiny pleats, made of rayon or 
rayon/cotton blend, have an elastic or drawstring waistband and sometimes have 
bells on the hem. The top layer is sheer and the lower layer is gauze-like. 
They have been priced between $6 and $80 at large chain stores and small 
boutiques nationwide. The reason the skirts are so flammable is that the fabric 
is so sheer, not because it is made of rayon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wear this skirt," Brown stressed. "Take it back to the place you bought 
it." Three hundred retailers are cooperating with the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mosher, a spokesman for Cost Plus World Market, an Oakland-based retailer 
with 40 stores in Western states, said the chain had removed all the dangerous 
skirts two weeks ago. So far, no customers have attempted to return any of the 
skirts, he said, but refunds will be made with no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosher said Cost Plus, which is also one of the importers of the skirts, is 
doing everything possible to comply with the recall and it has taken a scarf 
made of similar material off its shelves, even though it was not ordered to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is extremely happy that no one has been hurt," Mosher said. "The 
company will make sure it never gets into this situation with a dangerous piece 
of clothing again." 
</P>
<P>
 The skirts were recalled based on the Flammable Fabrics Act, which was passed 
in 1953. Manufacturers and importers are responsible for seeing that their 
products comply with the law, which specifies how long an item of clothing must 
take to burn to be considered safe for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission became suspicious that the skirts might be dangerous when a 
textile expert, who does not want to be named, called Patricia Fairall, a 
compliance officer at the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many ways the skirts can be ignited, Brown said. "A cigarette could 
drop on them, or cigarette ash could set this on fire. A lighter. Brushing near 
a campfire. Brushing against a stove." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The commission named 18 of the stores where the skirts have been sold: 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham & Strauss Basement, Ames Ladies Wear, Annie Sez, Bealls Outlet Stores, 
Burlington Coat Factory, Cost Plus, Dayton's, Filene's Basement, Gantos, 
Hudson's, Jean Nicole, Loehmann's, Marianne, Marshalls, Marshall Field's, One 
Price, Ross and T.J. Maxx. 
</P>
<P>
 The brand labels involved include: 
</P>
<P>
 2 Kool Look, Ann Simone, Carla Freeman, Casual Designs by RAVIA, Exclusif, 
Fbi, Founded 1976 D II K by K.V.M., Giallo Napoli, Gold Star, LaGebi, Masone 
II, Minti Mode, Papillon, Phool, Renuka, Short Circuit, Steed Import Inc., Vile 
Parle, Xessorium and Zero Zero. 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the 22 importers of the skirts are complying with the recall. 
The commission is still negotiating with the others. The U.S. Customs Service 
has been instructed to prevent any more of the skirts from entering the 
country.

BREYER VOWS TO BOOST PUBLIC'S TRUST IN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer pledged Friday to work to enhance the 
public's trust in the nation's justice system "for it is the very foundation of 
the rule of law." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, guest of honor at a White House ceremony, repeated the constitutional 
oath he took at Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's vacation cottage Aug. 3 -- 
the day Breyer officially became a justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that earlier action, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton referred to 
Breyer in welcoming remarks as "judge-soon-to-be-justice." 
</P>
<P>
 After Justice Antonin Scalia, the senior high court member in town, 
administered the oath, Breyer told those assembled he would do his best to meet 
"this awesome responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "A court is not a bureaucracy and a judge is not a bureaucrat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady apologized for her absent husband, whom she said had looked 
forward to congratulating Breyer in person. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton traveled to Minnesota to thump for a revival of the crime 
bill blocked by the House on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady explained that the President's absence from Breyer's ceremony 
was due to "unexpected and unfortunate circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, saying he did not want to sound partisan, did some of 
his own imploring for a better way to deal with "the problem of violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Still wrapping up his duties as chief judge of the Boston-based U.S. 1st 
Circuit Court of Appeals, Breyer this week worked out of Justice David H. 
Souter's offices in the Supreme Court's Capitol Hill building. Souter is back 
home in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in a transitional mode, mostly administrative things," court spokeswoman 
Toni House said of Breyer. "He won't really get moved in until Sept. 1 or 
shortly thereafter." The court's 1994-95 term begins Oct. 3, but the nine 
justices will meet in conference the previous week to prepare for that start. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Breyer's tasks: hiring law clerks and a second secretary, getting his 
chambers furnished and finding a place to live.

2 ACCUSED OF FORMING TEAMS OF SHOPLIFTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men have been charged with organizing teams of shoplifters who stole 
millions of dollars worth of medicine, beauty aids and other products in a 
region from Ohio to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items were repackaged and sold back to the stores they were stolen 
from, according to an indictment issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert James Dorn, 45, of Bellaire, Ohio, and David Lee Misencik, 51, of 
Wellsburg, W. Va., were jailed in lieu of $10,000 bond each. They each face up 
to 55 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines if convicted.

COURT DELAYS ADMITTANCE OF FEMALE CADET AT CITADEL; EDUCATION: JUDGES GRANT 
MILITARY SCHOOL'S REQUEST TO BLOCK FIRST WOMAN FROM CORPS WHILE AN APPEAL IS 
CONSIDERED. SHE IS 'NOT GIVING UP.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Shannon Faulkner was saying goodby to friends Friday, 
getting ready to move 200 miles from home to the fortress-like campus of The 
Citadel, South Carolina's state-supported military academy, when a federal 
appeals court scotched her plans to become the school's first female cadet next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised, to say the least," said Robert Black, one of Faulkner's 
attorneys during her yearlong fight to gain full admittance to the school. "I 
thought we had it this time." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge C. Weston Houck last month ruled that the school's 
policy banning females was unconstitutional, and ordered The Citadel to 
immediately accept Faulkner into the corps of cadets. But a three-judge panel 
of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday agreed with a request from 
the school to delay the order while the higher court considers an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The school had argued that Faulkner's admission would fundamentally alter the 
152-year-old school. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining that its all-male policy is not unconstitutional, lawyers for The 
Citadel nevertheless requested that the school be given a year to develop and 
implement an alternative off-campus program for women rather than be forced to 
become co-educational.  
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had been scheduled to report to campus Monday, where she was to 
receive the same buzz haircut given to all cadets. She would have been given a 
room in the school infirmary, away from the barracks where male cadets reside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here she is, going to school in two days, all packed up, with all of her 
school supplies ready," said Sue Coe, one of Faulkner's attorneys. "It's really 
a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Coe said the 4th Circuit was exercising "an abundance of caution" in granting 
the delay and expressed confidence that Faulkner eventually would be admitted.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said they would expedite the case and planned to hear arguments 
during the court's December term. Coe said a request had been entered for an 
emergency hearing, but no date had been set. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Dawes Cooke Jr., a lawyer for The Citadel, said the school's appeal had 
argued that immediate admittance was not of paramount importance since the 
school's policies allow students to enroll in the corps of cadets up until 
their junior year. Faulkner, a sophomore, currently is allowed to attend day 
classes at the school under a court order but cannot participate in military 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that Faulkner's recent requests for special consideration -- such 
as avoiding having her head shaved -- proved that admitting a woman would 
change the institution. Houck ruled last Wednesday that he would not interfere 
with the school policy concerning haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In their ruling Friday, the judges essentially agreed with The Citadel that 
Faulkner did not need to be admitted to the corps of cadets while the case is 
still under appeal. Instead, she will continue to attend day classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who called Friday afternoon to tell Faulkner the news, said she was 
"disappointed but not at all discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had been outside saying goodby to friends when he called. "She walked 
into the house and I hit her with the bad news," said the Charleston attorney. 
"She said, 'I'm not giving up.' She's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner's mother, Sandy, told the Associated Press her daughter would have no 
immediate comment about the appellate court decision but was taking the news in 
stride. "She's fine. She's having lunch with a friend right now on the patio," 
she said from their home in Powdersville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-page order granting the stay was issued by Judges Paul V. Niemeyer and 
Clyde Hamilton without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Kenneth K. Hall dissented, saying "by all rights, Ms. Faulkner should be 
preparing to enter her second full year of military instruction and training as 
a full-fledged member of the corps of cadets." 
</P>
<P>
 "South Carolina stubbornly maintains that a system, proved by the nation's 
service academies to work, is unworkable. Meanwhile, as Faulkner views the 
drill field from afar, the state continues to deny its daughters the education 
that is rightfully theirs under the Constitution of the United States. That 
such a situation could be tolerated in the 19th Century is not surprising, but 
we are about to embark on the 21st," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had first applied for admittance to The Citadel -- and was accepted 
-- in 1993. The school revoked its acceptance of her application when it 
learned she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel is one of only two state-supported military schools in the country 
that do not admit women. The other school, Virginia Military Institute, has 
agreed to set up a separate program for women at another college. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at The Citadel indicated they likely would pursue a similar 
off-campus program for women. They had asked Houck to delay Faulkner's 
admittance until next year to give them time to set up such a program, but he 
ordered her to be admitted immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge gave them until next year to devise an acceptable plan to admit 
other qualified women applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Citadel's defense is to stall long enough until they get rid of 
(Faulkner) or she'll go away," said Black. The ruling by the court on Friday 
"is the kind of action they're delighted to see."

CLINIC SLAYING SUSPECT CHARGED UNDER FEDERAL LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sending a message that the government will use its full powers to combat 
abortion clinic violence, a federal grand jury indicted Paul J. Hill, accused 
killer of a doctor and his escort in Pensacola, Fla., on federal charges of 
violating the new federal clinic access law. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, who has contended that killing abortion providers is justifiable 
homicide, already faces double premeditated murder charges in Florida for the 
July 29 slayings and could be sentenced to death if he is convicted. If a jury 
finds him guilty under the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances law, Hill could 
be sentenced to life without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a "strong federal interest against violence," Deval Patrick, assistant 
U.S. attorney general for civil rights, said in announcing the indictment in 
Pensacola: "The violence must end." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, said that she 
was "relieved" by the U.S. action "because at last there will be a major 
federal investigation into the murders and whether or not there was a 
conspiracy. It's extremely important that the federal government take full 
responsibility for a nationwide investigation into anti-abortion terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources familiar with the investigation of a special federal task 
force into the possibility of a conspiracy in the Pensacola clinic murders said 
that no evidence has been developed to date that others were involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Patrick declined comment on that aspect of the case, noting only that the 
investigation into the existence of a nationwide conspiracy "is continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was charged Friday with three counts of violating the federal clinic 
access law in the slayings of Dr. John B. Britton and his escort, James H. 
Barrett, and the wounding of Barrett's wife, June G. Barrett, outside the 
Ladies Center Clinic in Pensacola. He also was charged with using a firearm -- 
a 12-gauge shotgun -- in connection with a crime of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually the Justice Department does not pursue federal civil rights charges 
when there is parallel state action against a suspect and there is no doubt 
about the vigor and thoroughness of the local investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patrick noted: "This indictment should serve notice that the newly enacted 
clinic access law is a powerful tool that will be used to combat violence aimed 
at reproductive health services." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said Florida "Gov. Lawton Chiles and state officials asked that a 
federal prosecution be brought against Hill in addition to the state murder 
charges and we have done so. This demonstrates our mutual resolve to deter this 
kind of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department announcement brushed aside any double-jeopardy concerns 
by citing "the legal principle that Hill's conduct was an offense against both 
the United States and the people of Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Hill are the second criminal case brought under the clinic 
access law, which President Clinton signed on May 26. In June, six persons in 
Milwaukee were charged with violating the act. That case is yet to be tried.

CLINTON TEAM MOUNTS BLITZ TO SALVAGE HEALTH REFORM; INSURANCE: CABINET 
OFFICIALS STREAM TO CAPITOL HILL IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO RESCUE THE FLOUNDERING 
LEGISLATION.

<P>
 Clinton Administration Cabinet officials blitzed Capitol Hill Friday in an 
urgent effort to rescue floundering health care reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the House Democratic leadership having chosen to delay action on health 
care indefinitely, the Senate -- which is divided along partisan lines -- 
plodded deliberately through a fourth day of floor debate on its version of 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is far short of assembling majorities in either house of 
Congress for its plans to provide universal health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Cabinet secretaries and other high-ranking members of the Clinton team 
huddled with the President for a morning breakfast then headed to Capitol Hill 
for closed-door meetings with wavering Democratic members of Congress, who are 
refusing to support the blueprints of the party's own leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering an upbeat view, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala 
said the Cabinet was "riled up and enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 "The test of this Administration is not whether we're going to trip every once 
in a while but whether we're going to get up, brush ourselves off and get out 
there and keep working," she said after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood among Democrats in Congress was much more somber. In the House, 
there seems scant chance of success for the proposal put together by Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). It would require all firms to provide 
insurance for their workers, with the companies picking up 80% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 House leaders said Friday that they will turn their attention to other issues 
before taking up health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no magic date here," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), 
deepening the gloomy assessment he offered Thursday when he announced that the 
debate scheduled for next week had been scrapped.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take it up when it's ready to be brought up," Foley told 
reporters, leaving open prospects for continued delay that might kill the 
bill's chances in this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Small business fiercely opposes the employer mandate contained in the Gephardt 
proposal. Hoping to disarm this opposition, Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) devised a plan calling for voluntary expansion of insurance 
protection to bring coverage to 95% of all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 If this voluntary effort does not work, a mandate would take effect in the 
year 2002 in states where coverage did not reach the 95% goal. The delayed 
mandate would require companies to contribute at least 50% of the cost of 
insurance, less burdensome to business than the Gephardt formula. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all Republicans and a significant number of dissenting Democrats seem 
unalterably opposed to any government requirement that employers provide health 
insurance, whether the mandate takes effect immediately or is held in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate continued its debate Friday but members clearly had been shaken by 
the developments in the House -- the double blow of the delay on health care 
and the unexpected defeat of the President's crime bill on a procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate has entered the extremely frightened zone," said one senior 
Democratic aide. "What they're doing out there today now is faking it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the aide said that Mitchell continues to make alterations in his bill 
to try to win votes, one senator at a time. Most of those changes, he said, are 
additions to the benefits package that have been demanded by various 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As floor debate continued Friday, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) offered 
the first formal amendment to the bill, a proposal requiring all health 
insurance policies sold after July, 1995, to include prenatal care for pregnant 
women and immunizations and check-ups for children. 
</P>
<P>
 No significant test votes seem likely in the Senate until next week.

ALTMAN APPEARS TO BE CLOSE TO RESIGNING; WHITEWATER: DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY 
APPARENTLY MET WITH HIS BOSS TO DISCUSS LEAVING. HE NO LONGER HAS THE SUPPORT 
OF KEY SENATE DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, facing unrelenting congressional 
criticism after his testimony at recent Whitewater hearings, has met privately 
with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to discuss his resignation, 
Administration sources said Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen has told Altman that the decision on whether to resign is his to make, 
the sources said, but they suggested that Altman's departure now seems all but 
certain. Administration officials said they doubt that Altman will quit over 
the weekend, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman was the central Administration witness in the Whitewater hearings 
before Senate and House panels and he has been heavily criticized by both 
Republican and Democratic senators. He was quizzed at the hearings about 
allegations that he provided confidential information at a crucial time to the 
White House about the status of a Resolution Trust Corp. investigation of the 
failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. The Arkansas thrift was owned by a 
business partner of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
when Clinton served as governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the hearings, two leading Democrats on the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee -- which conducted the Senate hearings -- 
have met privately with Bentsen and outgoing White House Counsel Lloyd N. 
Cutler to discuss Altman, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers did not demand Altman's resignation, the sources said, but their 
discussions about his future apparently sent a subtle message to the White 
House and Treasury that Altman should consider leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican senators on the Whitewater panel publicly have called for Altman's 
resignation. Treasury officials had thought that Altman could survive GOP 
attacks but that it would be nearly impossible without the support of senior 
Democrats on the key committee that deals with Treasury on many legislative 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the message conveyed to Cutler and Bentsen by Banking Committee 
Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who 
is likely to assume the chairmanship next year, virtually ends Altman's chances 
to stay at Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Whitewater-related action Friday, the chairman of the Senate 
subcommittee that oversees the independent counsel law called for the appellate 
court panel that appointed new Whitewater counsel Kenneth W. Starr to rule on 
whether Starr's past Republican activities are grounds for his withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 With Democratic anger over Starr's appointment continuing to rise, Sen. Carl 
Levin (D-Mich.) wrote Judge David B. Sentelle, presiding judge of the 
independent counsel division of the U.S. Court of Appeals here, to complain 
that Starr's appointment "puts at risk the historical public acceptance of the 
independent counsel process." Starr "lacks the necessary appearance of 
independence essential for public confidence," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that handled 
the newly enacted independent counsel law, said "the same standard should apply 
to Mr. Starr" that Republicans applied to former special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. when they expressed concerns that he was not independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr was named by Sentelle's panel Aug. 5 under the new law, which was signed 
by President Clinton on June 30. Fiske, who had been in charge of a six-month 
Whitewater investigation, was named by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno under pressure 
from Republicans after the previous law expired. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have been careful not to join in public attacks on Starr 
and even distanced the President from critical statements about Starr made by 
Clinton's personal attorney, Robert S. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 As independent counsel, Starr will investigate whether Clinton benefited from 
money funneled to Whitewater Development Corp. from Madison Guaranty, which was 
owned by James B. McDougal, his investment partner in the Whitewater real 
estate venture.  
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Democrats and other Clinton supporters have charged that Starr 
cannot be impartial and objective in his investigation because of his interest 
in a Republican political career and his earlier interest in intervening in a 
sexual harassment suit filed by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state 
employee, against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his appointment, Starr reportedly considered filing a brief in the 
sexual harassment suit to argue against the President's claim of immunity. He 
also reportedly considered a run for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate 
from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have finally uncovered a real case of political interference in the 
Whitewater investigation: the actions by partisan Republicans who successfully 
demanded that Robert B. Fiske Jr. be removed as independent prosecutor," 
complained a statement released Friday by the Back to Business Committee, an ad 
hoc group of Democratic politicians with close ties to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentelle, a conservative North Carolinian and an appointee of President Ronald 
Reagan, confirmed Friday that he had met with conservative Republican senators 
in July, during the time that his panel was selecting a new Whitewater special 
prosecutor.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) also confirmed that he and Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) had lunch with Sentelle on July 14, but both Sentelle and Faircloth 
denied that they discussed any issues related to a new independent counsel.

AQMD DELAYS DECISION ON 20-YEAR SMOG PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: PANEL AGREES TO ANALYZE 
RIORDAN'S LESS STRINGENT PROPOSAL, HOPING TO REACH A CONCLUSION BY SEPT. 9. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under fire from all directions, Southern California's air quality board 
unanimously postponed a decision Friday on a new 20-year smog plan so that a 
last-minute proposal by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan can be analyzed by a 
team of experts. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate Riordan's concerns, the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District board created a team of atmospheric chemists and pollution analysts 
and regulators to analyze the city's proposal. The board's goal -- although 
considered unlikely -- is to reach a conclusion on the plan's viability by the 
time the panel convenes again Sept. 9 to adopt a clean-air plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay came after several months of public debate over the AQMD's updated 
strategy for achieving clean air and only three months before a federal 
deadline faced by the agency and the state Air Resources Board for a completed 
and approved plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's appearance at Friday's session was believed to be the first time a 
Los Angeles mayor has commented on smog issues before the regional board. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor called air quality planning the single most important factor 
affecting Southern California's economy, but emphasized that he is not trying 
to avoid clean air mandates. Instead, he said, he wants to spend more time 
looking for more economical ways of achieving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put most simply, Los Angeles wants clean air and good jobs," Riordan said. "I 
have heard it said that I am asking for a delay in cleaning up our air. I am 
not. I repeat, I am not. . . . I believe the plan advanced by the city of Los 
Angeles will clean up our air faster than any of the other plans under 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the cost of cleaning the nation's most polluted air is steep and the 
impact on society is dramatic, the AQMD has struggled for years to find ways of 
spreading the economic burden fairly among all industries, motorists and 
consumers. But the latest effort drew intense criticism Friday from virtually 
every sector of the economy as well as from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, designed to meet federal and state health standards in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties by 2010, features more than 100 
proposed transportation and industrial measures. State law requires an updated 
plan every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Riordan's alternative proposal -- which emerged in detail this week -- 
the AQMD would move less aggressively in reducing nitrogen oxides, which 
contribute to ozone and particulates, the two most severe types of pollution 
that dirty the Southland's air. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan, an array of long-term measures using advanced 
technology to reduce emissions from cars, trucks and other mobile sources would 
be scrapped. His plan also proposes alternatives for cleaning up particulates 
that include more stringent controls on dairy farm manure in San Bernardino 
County and on "fugitive dust" that blows off rural fields and lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those proposals immediately triggered negative reactions from officials in the 
Inland Empire, who believe Los Angeles is trying to shift much of the burden 
for a cleanup to their region. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD staff members say Riordan's proposal would violate state law and endanger 
public health by delaying for several years a viable plan for cleaning up 
particulates, which are the tiny pieces of soot and dust that can lodge in 
lungs and cause respiratory disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's aides say the AQMD does not yet have a workable plan for 
particulates, so public health would not be jeopardized by eliminating many 
long-term measures and searching for less costly and more effective ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they agreed to review it, many board members view the mayor's plan 
with skepticism because the AQMD and National Academy of Sciences rejected 
similar ideas in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's plan got a boost Friday when James Boyd, executive officer of 
the state Air Resources Board, said he would recommend that his panel reject 
the AQMD plan because it too optimistically assumes that 84% of nitrogen oxides 
from cars, trucks, trains and other mobile sources can be eliminated by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said the AQMD plan sets an unnecessary and unfeasible target, echoing one 
of the major criticisms made by the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd's comments are considered crucial to the success of the plan, because the 
Air Resources Board has veto power over it. Because the AQMD board faces 
logistic problems in resolving the lingering issues in a month, many officials 
believe the deadline will be missed by at least several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said developing an economically reasonable plan is so vital to 
California that it is worth the risk of violating the deadline set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, the AQMD and state air board have until Nov. 
15 to submit a final plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that 
outlines how the region will meet health standards for ozone, the main 
ingredient of smog. If the deadline is missed, the EPA could impose sanctions 
next year, including a freeze on federal highway funds and restrictions on new 
businesses that pollute. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD also is under pressure to adopt an aggressive plan by February or 
face the prospect of the EPA stepping in under a court order to clean up the 
Southland's air with its own proposals.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, environmentalists also opposed the AQMD version, saying the 
measures are so vague and unrealistic that they eventually would be rejected by 
the federal government. They also rejected the mayor's plan as being too weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the controversy is over AQMD and EPA proposals that would force 
airlines, ships, trains and interstate diesel trucks to reduce emissions. 
Riordan and local business leaders say the measures would devastate the economy 
by making the region unable to compete in interstate commerce with other major 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD board Chairman Henry Wedaa indicated Friday, however, that he would be 
unwilling to go easy on those sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me make myself clear: It's time for planes, trains, ships and interstate 
trucking to do what our local businesses have been doing for years -- clean up 
their emissions," Wedaa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing the AQMD's plan would cost businesses and consumers in the four 
counties $5.4 billion per year through 2010, according to an agency economic 
report. The mayor's office says its strategy could cut the costs by $3.2 
billion per year.

PRIEST GIVEN 8 YEARS IN PRISON IN MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an apology and a plea for mercy, a St. Anthony's Seminary priest who 
admitted molesting a choirboy was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Robert Van Handel, handcuffed and wearing the red jail jumpsuit of a 
sex offender, told the court he was sorry for sexually molesting the 
14-year-old while he was leader of the Santa Barbara Boys Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franciscan priest pleaded guilty in May to lewd and lascivious behavior 
with a minor, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Zonen sought the maximum eight years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a man who had been molesting children for two decades. We have no way 
to know how many children he had access to and molested," Zonen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Patrick McMahon reviewed court documents, probation 
reports, letters and Van Handel's diary in which the priest described being 
sexually aroused by watching boys singing in the choir. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge reprimanded him for his betrayal of trust, saying he used his 
position of power to feed his pedophilia.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Handel was the second priest convicted of sexually molesting children at 
St. Anthony's Seminary, a boarding school for high school-age youths. The 
downtown seminary, run by the Franciscan order of the Roman Catholic Church, 
closed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel organized by the Franciscans released a 72-page report in November 
detailing blatant sexual abuse at the seminary, including fondling, nude games 
and sexual encounters in the rooms of friars. Twelve friars allegedly 
participated, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Handel apologized to his victims and said he accepts responsibility for 
the molestations. He was only charged with one molestation because the statute 
of limitations had expired on those crimes, Zonen said.

ROBERTI FAREWELL DRAWS BIPARTISAN PRAISE; RETIREMENT: WILSON HEADLINES FETE TO 
HELP FORMER SENATE LEADER PAY OFF CAMPAIGN DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The twilight of a man's career is not a time to hold grudges -- not even in 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
 So with state Sen. David A. Roberti only weeks from retirement after a 
quarter-century in the Legislature, his opponents laid down their rhetoric, 
dusted off their sentimentality and joined his supporters Thursday night at a 
dinner in the Van Nuys Democrat's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare goodwill gathering over chilled cucumber dill soup and tournedos of 
beef, Gov. Pete Wilson and top legislative leaders put aside ideological 
bickering to share a microphone and a spotlight to praise the former Senate 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 guests turned out at a Radisson Hotel ballroom for a "This Is Your 
Life" fete that longtime Capitol observers declared historic for its bridging 
of the partisan gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Like retirement parties anywhere, people brought jokes, stories, memories, 
skits and gifts. But because this is an election year, the gifts took the form 
of legal tender. With Democrats and Republicans alike paying $100 to $500 a 
head, the 55-year-old Roberti got a hand in reducing nearly $200,000 in 
leftover campaign bills that had forced him to mortgage his Tudor-style Los 
Feliz home and borrow from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a touch of political history for the most ranking Republicans in 
California -- and especially the governor -- to lend their names to help retire 
a Democrat's campaign debt," said Robert Forsyth, a former Roberti spokesman 
who now works in public relations. "At one time or another, David has fought 
viciously against them." 
</P>
<P>
 It was pay-back time for the private, portly politician who retained a 
record-breaking 13-year hold on the Senate leadership in part by raising and 
doling out contributions to loyal Democrats. The event this week raised $90,000 
to help pay off the debt incurred during Roberti's failed state treasurer's bid 
in June and an earlier gun-lobby-led recall attempt in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That Wilson would consent to headline Roberti's farewell fund-raiser came as 
little surprise to anyone who recalled that the two started their careers as 
elected officials together in 1966. That year, as the Vietnam War dominated the 
news and sideburns set the fashion standard, both became rookie assemblymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met him, I thought this was a shy -- almost painfully shy -- young 
man," Wilson told the crowd. "Obviously, he was intelligent. But I had no idea 
he would flower as he has. And I had no idea I would feel personal affection 
for him, which I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation abounded over the plans of Roberti, who in December becomes the 
first career politician to be ejected from the Legislature by voter-approved 
term limits. Although he is mum about his options, Roberti says he believes a 
judgeship might be too structured, and has been talking to law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 As Senate president pro tem until earlier this year, Roberti became known for 
his skill at stitching together a united Democratic front and preventing it 
from unraveling in times of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he occasionally did so by exacting political revenge -- 
stripping committee chairmanships and withholding endorsements -- was recalled 
Thursday night, with humorous digs, as no more than business as usual in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 If the evening's entertainment was worth the price of admission, then the 
credit goes to four female state senators who performed imitation rap songs 
under the stage name The Dames Under the Dome.

RAT SPARKS A 6-HOUR OUTAGE AT UC BERKELEY CAMPUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wayward rat shut down the UC Berkeley campus for six hours Friday when it 
stumbled onto the university's main power cable, a university spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rat, which was badly charred, crawled inside the central campus substation 
about 5:30 a.m., where it formed a circuit between the university's Pacific Gas 
& Electric switch and a steam-energy source, shorting out the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 The blackout left hundreds of offices and laboratories and about 10,000 
employees without power while emergency generators supplied electricity to the 
university Police Department, vital lab and health services, and an animal 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students are on vacation until Tuesday.

HEAT KILLS BOY, 4, TRAPPED IN TRUNK OF CAR; WEATHER: PLAYMATE IS IN FAIR 
CONDITION AFTER TEMPERATURES REACHED ABOUT 160 DEGREES INSIDE AUTO. TROPICAL 
AIR BRINGS RECORD HIGH OF 104 TO L.A.

<P>
 Warm, tropical air from the south brought Los Angeles a record high 
temperature of 104 degrees Friday, claiming the life of a young boy in 
Riverside County and causing heavy thunderstorms, lightning, brush fires and a 
rare tornado warning in rugged portions of the Inland Empire.  
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy died and his 3-year-old playmate was in fair condition after 
they accidentally locked themselves in the trunk of a car while playing near 
their homes in the sunbaked Moreno Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said temperatures in the trunk reached about 160 degrees before the 
grandfather of one of the boys realized they were missing and pried the trunk 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead boy was identified as Jared Victor Tootell. His playmate, Anthony R. 
Pullum, was in fair condition at the Loma Linda University Medical Center, a 
nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lightning touched off a 480-acre blaze in the sparsely populated 
Cactus Valley area near Hemet, at one point threatening about a dozen homes and 
a camp attended by about 150 children, said Bonnie O'Connell, a spokeswoman for 
the Riverside County Fire Department. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, those homes were no longer threatened, O'Connell said. A 
second fire, about a mile away, consumed about an acre, and a smaller fire 
believed caused by downed power lines destroyed a mobile home in the back yard 
of a house in southeast Hemet, O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of fires going on . . . small fires caused by the downed 
lines and lightning strikes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rains and isolated flooding damaged several houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A funnel cloud was reported at one point, though apparently it did not touch 
down, the National Weather Service said. A tornado warning was in effect 
through 4 p.m. Forecasters predicted further thunderstorms today.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the 104-degree high at the Civic Center smashed the record for 
Aug. 12 of 96 degrees, set in 1898, said Robert Baruffaldi, a National Weather 
Service meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight low of 75 was three degrees higher than the record minimum for 
the date, set in 1972. It was the third night in a row that the overnight 
reading broke records, Baruffaldi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high temperatures Friday included 110 in Monrovia, 109 in San Gabriel, 
107 in Woodland Hills and Van Nuys, 106 in Burbank, 105 in Montebello, 104 in 
Pasadena, 102 in Anaheim and 100 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Baruffaldi attributed the continuing heat to a high pressure system to the 
east, which is blocking normal air flows and allowing warm air to move up from 
the south and southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's preventing the usual cooler air from . . . coming off the ocean," he 
said. "Instead, we're having tropical air . . . which is warm to begin with. 
Since we're staying warm overnight, it doesn't take long for us to heat up and 
reach these record highs." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters were expecting the pattern to continue, with only a slight cooling 
trend over the weekend. The high temperature in Los Angeles is expected to be 
101 today (saturday) and 98 on Sunday, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sierra backcountry of Northern California, firefighters were expecting 
to bring two major brush fires under control. One fire destroyed at least two 
structures Friday in the rural town of Nevada City. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada, residents of Twain Harte were allowed to 
return to their homes after being evacuated because of a fire that burned 1,400 
acres of brushy timberland. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were almost fully in control of the blaze late Friday and were 
expecting the douse the last embers early this morning.

NORTHRIDGE DROPS ANCHORAGE WITH A 10-RUN FIFTH INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the competition been ice fishing, the team from Anchorage, Alaska, might 
have had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Alaska made four errors that helped Northridge to a 14-2 victory 
Friday night in the first round of the Little League Western Regional 
tournament for 11-12 year-olds before 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping put the chill on Alaska was Michael Frost, who was in the lineup only 
because Jonathan Higashi was declared ineligible for living outside the 
Northridge boundaries. Frost was three for three with a home run and two 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shaking silly I was so nervous," said Frost, who had been seven for 
nine in a reserve role earlier in the tournament. "The home run was the first 
in my life. I felt so excited." 
</P>
<P>
 The home run came in a 10-run fifth inning that blew open a close game and 
made starting pitcher Peter Tuber an easy winner. Tuber went five innings, 
allowing one hit -- a solo home run by Keith Browne -- and striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff ace Nathaniel Dunlap retired the side in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (13-0), the Southern California champion, will play Las Vegas 
tonight at 8. Las Vegas defeated Colorado, 10-4, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of Higashi, the team's catcher, forced Matt Cunningham to play 
behind the plate for the first time all season. Frost took Cunningham's spot in 
the outfield. Cunningham had no passed balls, compared to eight pitches that 
got past two Alaska catchers with runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt had two days to practice behind the plate," said Larry Baca, the 
Northridge manager. "The kids were stunned (when informed of Higashi's 
disqualification), but both Cunningham and Frost really came through." 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska (7-2) scored a run in the top of the first and Northridge came back in 
the bottom of the inning on a walk to leadoff batter Justin Gentile and three 
wild pitches.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge added a run in the second when Gregg Wallis followed singles by 
Tuber and Frost with an RBI groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Gordon hit a two-run home run in the third inning to give Northridge a 
4-1 lead. Gordon also drove in two runs with a single in the fifth and was 
three for three with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the fifth, shortstop Matt Fisher homered and doubled, and Wallis 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 The big inning enabled Baca to play most of his reserves. It also helped 
relieve anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were nervous today, but I don't think we'll be nervous from now on," 
Gordon said. A Little Way

TU PROVES TO BE JUST TOO MUCH FOR BLESZYNSKI 
</P>

<P>
 What figured to be a showdown between two of the nation's best junior players 
-- both from the Valley -- turned into a rout and a big victory for 
Northridge's Meilen Tu. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Tu defeated fourth-seeded Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks, 6-1, 
6-2, Friday in the semifinals of the United States Tennis Assn. Girls' 18 
national championships at the Almaden Valley Athletic Club in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu will face No. 7 Lilia Osterloh of Winchester, Ohio, in today's final. 
Osterloh defeated unseeded Dawn Buth of Wichita, Kan., 6-2, 4-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu and Bleszynski are old rivals with bright futures in tennis. Bleszynski, 
17, won two gold medals at the U.S. Olympic Festival in St. Louis in July. In 
June, she breezed to a championship in the Southern California Tennis Assn. 
Junior Sectional tournament. She will attend Stanford on a tennis scholarship 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu, 16, dropped out of Granada Hills High and started a home-study program 
while touring Europe most of the year as a member of the U.S. International 
Junior Team.  
</P>
<P>
 She has captured championships this year on clay (the Banana Bowl in South 
America) and on grass (the Surbiton Junior Championships in London). 
</P>
<P>
 Tu was surprised by the lopsided victory, especially after Bleszynski broke 
her serve with a delicate drop-volley shot to take a 2-1 lead in the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh my God, we're going three sets,' " Tu said. "I was concerned 
that Ania was getting confidence. She's a rival. She's from the same area and 
we've played each other since we were 10 and she's tough. But I've been so 
mentally tough. I'm not making any mistakes. I'm not giving up anything. I've 
been rock solid, mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu, who broke Bleszynski's serve seven of eight times, broke back to make it 
2-2, finishing a love game with a winner down the line. She didn't look back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared for a 3 1/2- to 4-hour match," Tu said. "But things are really 
clicking for me. I feel great, and I'm really proud of myself."

DIGEST: MCGILL RALLIES TO DEFEAT KLEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jill McGill of Denver moved within one victory of her second consecutive U.S. 
Women's Amateur title Friday by rallying for a 1-up victory over NCAA Division 
I champion Emilee Klein of Studio City at The Homestead's Cascade Course in Hot 
Springs, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really am happy just to make it back to the finals," said McGill, who will 
play Wendy Ward of San Antonio in today's 36-hole championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward shot a six-under-par 30 on the front nine on the way to a 7-and-5 rout of 
Andrea Baxter of Eagle, Ida. It was the most lopsided victory in the Women's 
Amateur semifinals since 1977, when Canada's Cathy Sherk was a 9-and-8 winner 
over Brenda Goldsmith of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ward was coasting past Baxter, McGill lost two of the first three holes 
to Klein, who played at Notre Dame High. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill nearly fell three holes down when she put her approach over the green 
on the 355-yard sixth, where Klein was sizing up a 20-foot birdie putt. McGill 
chipped back to about 24 feet, but made the putt for par. Klein missed the 
birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill began her comeback with a birdie on the par-four seventh and evened the 
match when she reached the par-five ninth in two and two-putted for another 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who will turn pro instead of returning to Arizona State for her junior 
year, birdied the par-five 17th but missed a twisting 22-foot birdie putt on 
the 18th that would have evened the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're out there trying as hard as you can, and that's all you can do," Klein 
said. "Now it's time to move on."

NURSING HOME INSPECTORS STEP UP O.C. ENFORCEMENT; HEALTH: MORE THAN 80 
CITATIONS ISSUED SO FAR THIS YEAR, UP FROM 3 IN 1992. OFFICIALS CREDIT NEW 
STAFF, BETTER TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 86-year-old nursing home resident, whose water container and emergency 
button were out of reach, eventually became so dehydrated he was admitted, 
semi-comatose, to an acute-care hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A 98-year-old resident of the same Fullerton nursing home, Harbor Health Care, 
had difficulty begging for a drink because her tongue was so dry and her lips 
so cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents developed sores after being left in wet or soiled beds. One was 
found chilled after being left alone all night on the floor of a dining room 
with its patio doors open, his pants soaked with urine and his shirt covered 
with mucus. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just a few of the problems found earlier this year by state 
Department of Health Services inspectors and noted in their records. In 
response, the home was slapped with 11 citations in four months calling for 
thousands of dollars in fines -- more than three times as many citations, in 
fact, as Orange County district inspectors issued in all of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor, which has since has changed owners and is now complying with 
government regulations, was an extreme case, garnering more citations by far 
than any other skilled nursing home in the district this year. The previous 
licensee blamed the conditions on a trustee appointed by a bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up enforcement shows that inspectors in Orange County, accused 
just two months ago by an advocacy group of laxity, are making far greater use 
of citations and fines as a disciplinary tool. 
</P>
<P>
 After issuing only three citations for fines totaling $8,250 in 1992, Orange 
County inspectors wrote 56 calling for $96,800 last year and had logged more 
than 80 in 1994 as of Monday, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 No one believes that the dramatic increase in citations signals a sudden 
decline in quality of care in the area's nursing homes. But California 
Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a San Francisco-based group that monitors 
nursing homes, argues it means inspectors are finally doing their 
long-neglected duty. "I don't think it's that the facilities have gotten 
worse," spokesman David Seubert said. "I think it's that (inspectors are) back 
doing their jobs again." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the recent dramatic leap in citations in the Orange County 
district is due to the staffing additions, improved training and better 
monitoring by supervisors in the district office, said Jacqueline Lincer, 
administrator for the Orange County district.  
</P>
<P>
 Only two months ago, regulators found themselves on the hot seat at a hearing 
conducted by a fact-finding panel, in which Seubert's group accused them of 
falling behind the rest of the state in enforcement, based on the 1992 citation 
record. The panel, chaired by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), 
called on the state auditor general to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 But state health officials said that by that time, the auditor general already 
had investigated and recognized the matter was under control. In fact, they 
said, they had never stopped doing their jobs, despite the small number of 
citations issued in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincer said that in 1992, the district's citation level dropped off because it 
had an overwhelming caseload and it took on eight new evaluators in April who 
required training. But inspectors continued to issue what are known as 
"deficiencies" against nursing homes, a disciplinary tool that ultimately can 
lead to a facility's financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both methods are used by inspectors, often simultaneously. Harbor, for 
example, was notified in February that it would lose its right to bill for 
Medicare or Medi-Cal patients -- a financial debacle for most nursing homes -- 
because of nine serious deficiencies. The termination was then rescinded in 
April after the facility passed an inspection, according to state records.  
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Smith of Care Net-Fullerton, listed as one of the licensees during the 
time Harbor was having difficulties with the state, said the facility was 
supposed to be run according to state regulations by a trustee appointed by a 
bankruptcy court judge. The trustee could not be reached for comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing home industry representatives say citations gauge little more than the 
district office's staffing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could literally track the department's hiring by" the citation numbers, 
said Lori Costa, director of regulatory programs for the California Assn. of 
Health Facilities, a trade group representing 1,200 facilities statewide. "I 
can always tell because one of the first things (inspectors) learn is how to 
write a citation." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said her group considers Orange County one of the more rigorous offices 
-- and not because of the number of citations it issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the state's 16 districts, Orange County regulators issued the second 
highest number of deficiencies per inspection, behind the San Bernardino 
district, during the fiscal year ended in September, according to the latest 
annual statistics released by the federal Health Care Financing Administration. 
The rate was 27 deficiencies per inspection, compared to a statewide average of 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Deficiencies can range from minor violations, such as housekeeping problems, 
to more serious violations, such as endangering patients' safety or rights. The 
district, with 72 homes, includes all public and private homes in Orange County 
and a handful of county-run facilities in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4% of the district's deficiencies were considered to be of a serious 
nature, problems that could cost a facility its Medicare and Medi-Cal 
certification. Again, only San Bernardino had a higher percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers mean the county has been aggressively enforcing regulations, 
said Brenda Klutz, assistant deputy director of the state's licensing and 
certification program. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, of the California Assn. of Health Facilities, argued that it is the 
possibility of decertification that gets nursing home officials' attention, not 
the cumbersome process of citations and fines, which can be subject to lengthy 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That enforcement mechanism is much more expeditious," she said of 
decertification. "Providers get very nervous. It's a very heavy hand. . . . It 
brings about results." 
</P>
<P>
 Seubert, whose group tracks deficiencies, citations and complaints in an 
annual "report card" on nursing homes, agreed that decertification is a serious 
business, but argued it is so seldom applied that it is virtually an empty 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "These facilities are put on the decertification track, then the facility gets 
it together and mops the floor and then gets recertified. . . . Everybody knows 
you're never going to get decertified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seubert said citations are imperfect too; only a fraction of the fines are 
ever collected. But he said they are "the best tool we have." 
</P>
<P>
 State records show that of 14 homes with serious deficiencies in the fiscal 
year ended in September, the Orange County district decertified two facilities 
and restricted payments on two others. One home was denied certification on its 
initial application. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not in compliance, we don't just give it to them," Lincer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homes, including Harbor Health Care, have risked decertification more 
than once. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton facility was warned in early January, 1993, that it did not meet 
the requirements for certification. It was then notified less than two weeks 
later that federal regulators had reconsidered and determined the facility did 
meet the requirements after all. The following February, Harbor was in trouble 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincer called Harbor "the exception, not the rule." She said her office, which 
conducts both state and federal inspections, found Harbor "out of compliance" 
but was overruled by federal officials. That rarely happens, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, state officials said, it does not matter what regulatory mechanism 
is used, as long as it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real measure (of effectiveness) is not the citations with fines," said 
Margaret DeBow, the state's deputy director for licensing and certification. 
"It's whether the problem gets corrected. That's really the best incentive we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 From a consumers' standpoint, state officials said, the best way to evaluate a 
facility is to look through inspection reports -- which are available at the 
nursing homes -- not to add up deficiencies and citations. The reports explain 
the circumstances and context of inspectors' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with questions and complaints about homes and other health facilities 
in the Orange County district can call the office at (800) 228-5234.

 SUITE SUCCESS? For a mere $91,000, you could be watching the Rams play their 
first home exhibition game tonight, against New England, from a luxury suite. 
The number of empty suites among the 108 leased at Anaheim Stadium is at a new 
high for this football season. . . . Average annual prices, for a variety of 
stadium events, range from $20,000 (single box, corner view) to $91,000 (double 
box, 50-yard line). Rams spokesman Pete Donovan says they make a fun day: 
"Suites are leased to entertain customers. It's not so critical that the home 
team is good." 
</P>
<P>
 FUN AT HOME: We all know Engelbert Humperdinck can sing. But can he sing 
karaoke? You'll get a chance to find out if you're at the Home & Garden Show at 
the Anaheim Convention Center, which starts today and runs through next weekend 
(N2). . . . Humperdinck appears next Saturday in a sing-along with 
convention-goers accompanied by a karaoke music machine. . . . Also new at the 
annual show: Indestructor, a $10,000 earthquake shelter, designed by Brad Bona 
of Anaheim. It looks like a gazebo but can store up to 400 gallons of water and 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 MORE FILLING: When Nancy Parker took control of Santa Ana-based Winchell's 
Donut House five years ago, the company was losing $13 million a year. Now it's 
in the black, with profits on the rise. Parker credits a new team management 
approach. But the Roundtable for Women in Foodservice credits Parker. It 
recently honored her with its National Pacesetter Award. . . . Says Parker: 
"We're no longer just a group of regional donut shops. We're expanding."

<P>
 ABSENT: When Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is feted at a Beverly 
Hills reception Monday, the invited Orange County contingent will be absent. 
Local Armenians are upset with Ter-Petrosyan for his criticism of opposition 
groups, as well as emigre organizations. . . . "We are doing a lot for 
Armenia," local Armenians say in a statement, but favor "democratic 
institutions that allow pluralism."

CITY HALLS FACE SHAKE-UPS AS O.C. INCUMBENTS OPT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nov. 8 elections will signal a changing of the guard for many city 
councils in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Several well-known incumbents were absent from the lists of candidates who 
filed to run for office by Friday's deadline. Among them are Santa Ana Mayor 
Daniel H. Young; Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson; Laguna Beach 
council members Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney; Orange Mayor Gene Beyer; and 
San Juan Capistrano Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
 But a small army of candidates is seeking to fill those and other open seats 
throughout the county. In all, 215 people will vie for the 73 available council 
seats and six mayoral posts on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of candidates will grow, since many cities have extended the filing 
deadline to Wednesday. That extension occurred automatically when incumbents 
had not filed for reelection by Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Several larger cities, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana and Huntington Beach, have 
especially crowded fields. But none is larger than Fullerton, where an 
unprecedented election oddity will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton voters not only will decide among an array of candidates during a 
special election on Oct. 18, but they will have to do so again in the regular 
election a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, two newly elected council members will have served a mere two 
weeks on the council before facing reelection. This situation evolved when 
three council members who voted for a 2% utility tax last year were recalled by 
voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Tanney, Orange County's registrar of voters, said he can't remember a 
similar occurrence in the history of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the voters understood the timing of this, which ended up 
putting the elections back to back," Tanney said. "It's an additional cost, but 
the people wanted to recall these folks, and voted that way to get rid of them 
at the earliest possible date."  
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and Councilwoman Molly McClanahan would 
have expired in November anyway. But after winning, recall organizers went to 
court and forced a special Oct. 18 election rather than waiting and 
consolidating the two elections. This will cost the city an estimated $107,000, 
according to City Clerk Anne M. York. 
</P>
<P>
 The term of the third recalled council member, Don Bankhead, would not have 
ended until 1996, so whoever is elected on Oct. 18 to replace him will serve 
two years, provided the candidate can win reelection on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recalled council members cannot run to replace themselves in the 
special election, Bankhead will be a candidate in the Nov. 8 election and could 
win his old seat back. Catlin and McClanahan are staying out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney said such a scenario will never happen again because of a new state 
law, effective next year, which will require that voters recall and replace 
candidates during the same election. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton City Attorney R.K. Fox called the Oct. 18 election "a waste of money 
and a source of confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes us look silly to have two elections within three weeks of 
each other," he said. "But, we respect the ruling of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, council members who survived a similar recall in June will go 
before the voters once again. Mayor Charles V. Smith and council members Craig 
Schweisinger and Tony Lam all are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Another election oddity will occur in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although three seats are open, only two will be filled this election, because 
of a charter amendment passed in 1992 changed the selection process of the 
city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, only council members could run for mayor. But beginning this 
year, anyone can run for that office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly is running for reelection against retired businessman Curtis A. 
Stickler. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daly were to lose the mayoral race, he would retain his council seat for 
two more years, eliminating one of the open seats. If Daly is elected and a 
third seat remains open, the City Council will have 60 days to appoint someone 
to the position. If they fail to do so, then the city must hold a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little confusing because this is the first year, but it will be easier 
in the long run," said Assistant City Clerk Ann Sauvageau. 
</P>
<P>
 Seats are up for grabs in cities where several longtime incumbents are 
stepping down, either by choice or because of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, the departure from the council of Gentry, the first openly 
gay elected official in Orange County, and Lenney, an environmental activist, 
means the panel could lose its liberal majority; there may be a forceful 
challenge in this election from more conservative candidates with a different 
political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, seven candidates have announced their intention to replace 
Young, who has served as mayor since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, four of seven council spots are open, including 
Patterson's, who is running for the 2nd District seat on Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 One incumbent who doesn't want to leave office is Fountain Valley council 
member Laurann Cook, whose decision to seek a third term has sparked some 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is running again despite a ballot measure passed by voters in 1984 that 
limits council members to two four-year terms. However, since Fountain Valley 
is a general law city, the term limits cannot be enforced under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar controversy occurred two years ago in Fountain Valley when 
Councilman George B. Scott was elected to the council for the sixth time 
despite the term limits ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters have the right to make the decision this election as well," Cook 
said.

 METROLINK: The average person who takes the train is male, white and pretty 
affluent, according to a new survey (B5). . . . Metrolink has succeeded 
slightly in getting more women and minorities on board, but the passenger

 JUST TALK, SO FAR: MCA's Christine Hanson calls it an "urban entertainment

talking about. The project would be Sega's most ambitious effort to expand its

high-tech entertainment attractions. The Universal City attraction could be 
running by late 1995. Cost: $25 million.

 ON TARGET: Bill Clinton is a big fan of town hall meetings, but he wouldn't 
have enjoyed taking the podium in Palmdale on Thursday night. Not when hundreds 
came to a love fest for guns (B24). . . . Palmdale, after all, is prime NRA

forms they give you to sign are just everywhere," says Laura Brunts, who 
manages a gun shop in town.

 LAST SUPPER? Politicians on both sides of the aisle showed up at a Sacramento 
dinner Thursday for outgoing state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). They 
showered him with praise and, more importantly, money to help pay campaign

TITANS' NEXT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR MUST BUILD TRUST, SHUMARD SAYS; ADMINISTRATION: 
HE CITES THAT AS A KEY REASON WHY HE DID NOT SUCCEED AT CAL STATE FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The person who replaces Bill Shumard as athletic director at Cal State 
Fullerton will face a wide range of challenges, but the biggest one will be 
trying to succeed where Shumard believes he failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The key will be building trust and support with university President Milton A. 
Gordon and other top administrators. Shumard, now an assistant athletic 
director at Long Beach State, and some of the longtime coaches on the staff 
agree on that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard thinks that's where he fell short. He believes a loss of 
administrative support during his troubled three-year tenure made it difficult 
for him to function as effectively as he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 And he believes sniping from inside his department hurt his cause, as much as 
the bad publicity from the courtroom defeats the university suffered when it 
tried to drop women's volleyball, and fired volleyball Coach Jim Huffman. 
Dissension also flared when football was suspended, men's gymnastics was 
dropped and scholarship funds were reduced in wrestling. The program appeared 
to be in a constant state of upheaval. "Cal State Crisis," some called it. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be the backdrop as the pace to choose Shumard's successor quickens 
next week. The six finalists are scheduled to be interviewed by members of the 
search committee and other groups on campus, as well as by Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 The finalists include two associate athletic directors at state universities, 
John Easterbrook of Fresno State and Reginald Blaylock of San Diego State, and 
two women, Central Connecticut State Athletic Director Judith Davidson and 
Joanne Fortunato, a management consultant in Marlboro, N.H. The other finalists 
are Jack Mehl, business manager of the Rose Bowl, and William Lide, athletic 
director at West Chester (Pa.) State. 
</P>
<P>
 A replacement is expected to be named by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of who is chosen, the important thing is for the institution to 
embrace college athletics and make the kind of commitment needed for a Division 
I athletic program," said Shumard, who returned to Long Beach, his alma mater, 
little more than a month after resigning at Fullerton. "Those were the battles 
I had to fight. And it's critical for the new athletic director to have 
everyone's full support . . . " Especially, he said, the president's. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, who is on vacation, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Coach Augie Garrido, who also is an assistant athletic director and a 
member of the search committee, thinks the new athletic director will face 
"important issues" on several different fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the keys for the new athletic director will be to make the department 
more a part of the total academic program," said Garrido, who has coached at 
Fullerton for 19 years, a tenure interrupted by three years at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "The athletic director has to wear a lot of different hats. The person needs 
the mentality of an attorney to deal with NCAA compliance issues and other 
things such as that. And from a budget standpoint, the person needs to have the 
skills of a politician in being able to help raise money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrido feels one of the biggest challenges will be to rally the 
department's coaching and support staff at a time when state funds have been 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido said he thinks morale among coaches is "average at best." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be important for the new athletic director to be able to pull that 
group together, along with the support staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Rogers, who has coached women's gymnastics at Fullerton for 19 years, 
also thinks improving morale within the department will be important. He 
remembers the years when Neale Stoner was athletic director -- from 1972-79 -- 
as a time when the department's morale was especially high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neale had a way of making you feel special as a coach," Rogers said. "As a 
reasonable person, you know an athletic director can't be at all your events, 
but he stayed involved even when he couldn't get to an event. I remember one 
Sunday morning after we had won a big meet, I wasn't where I was expected to 
be, but he still tracked me down where I was to congratulate me. It made me 
really feel like my boss was proud of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think somehow the new athletic director has to find the common threads of 
the program and weave them together to get everyone really working toward 
common goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer Coach Al Mistri, who has been at Fullerton for 13 years, thinks trying 
to improve the entire program's revenue should be a priority for the new 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the other programs we compete against in soccer are better equipped 
financially than we are," Mistri said. "The legacy of the past three athletic 
directors is that they couldn't improve the resources significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Coach Judi Garman, who has been at Fullerton since 1980, also 
believes developing revenue sources will be important for the new director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of us are at the point of being worn down by the lack of 
resources," she said. "We're at a really exciting time for women's athletics, 
and Cal State Fullerton can be a big part of that. What we need is someone to 
give us direction and support from the administration. We can be an important 
part of the overall university, but it seems too often we've been on the 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
 One side issue of private fund raising efforts is how the money is 
distributed. If individual coaches solicit donations, should the money go 
directly to their programs or into a general fund that helps support all 
sports? 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard believed that money should go into one fund for distribution by the 
athletic director. Garrido, for one, thinks funds raised separately by coaches 
should go directly to their programs until "reasonable funding levels" for 
those sports are met. "How that will be handled will be an important decision 
for the new director," Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's successor also eventually will be thrust into an evaluation of 
emphasis among the various sports. Shumard still firmly believes the university 
should make a strong commitment to basketball because of its revenue potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program generated $250,000 last year with only eight victories," Shumard 
said. "UC Santa Barbara is generating a million dollars a year from basketball 
now, so it shows what can be done, even without a nationally ranked program." 
</P>
<P>
 The new director won't have to be as concerned about meeting gender equity 
guidelines at Fullerton in the years ahead, as many other universities will. 
"Fullerton is in good shape now from that standpoint, since there's no football 
program," Shumard said.  
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty of other challenges to test the mettle of the person who 
is hired.

DEVERA IS TRYING TO WORK EVERYTHING OUT; TENNIS: COACHES AND CRITICS QUESTION 
HER DEDICATION TO THE GAME. OTHERS SAY SHE IS TOO TALENTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faye DeVera hears it from everyone: her parents, her brother, her coaches, 
other coaches, players, even reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 If you worked harder, you could be so much better.  
</P>
<P>
 Better? How much better? 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera's third-round showing in the U.S. Tennis Assn. national championships 
at Morley Field puts her among the country's top 30 players in the girls' 16 
division. A sophomore at Villa Park High, DeVera, 15, is ranked fourth in her 
age division among Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 5, 100 pounds, DeVera hits her backhand harder than some women on 
the professional tour, and she makes more net appearances in one match than 
most of her peers have in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could be the best player to come out of Orange County and Southern 
California in a long time," said DeVera's coach, Mike Nelson, who runs a tennis 
academy at Ridgeline Country Club. "I've been running this academy for 13 years 
and we haven't had anybody coming out of here hitting the ball like she does." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Schultz, a sales representative for Wilson Sporting Goods and a family 
friend, has worked with DeVera since she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the way she plays now, she could get a college scholarship to a major 
school," Shultz said. "But she could be a dominant force in college tennis if 
she worked a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
 If she worked a little harder.  
</P>
<P>
 So three hours a day isn't enough? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a couple of the really good players are playing six hours a day, but I 
can't see myself working harder than once in the morning and afternoon," DeVera 
said. "I can't see myself working harder than three hours. My mind starts 
wandering and I play sloppy. It wouldn't be worth it. I wouldn't get anything 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to practicing for three hours, DeVera also runs, lifts weights and 
jumps rope, though she admits she slacked off on the latter two activities of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Tuesday's opponent -- Julie Ditty of Ashland, Ky., the tournament's 
fifth-seeded player, hasn't slacked off on much of anything. Ditty badly 
outclassed DeVera, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess three hours a day isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needs more guidance," Nelson said. "Some kids need to be shown the way. 
She understands now what she has to do. She realizes now there's a whole clump 
of kids better than her." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz said DeVera simply needs to play more. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she would restructure how she practices, that would help," Schultz said. 
"She drills a lot. I think the kids need to play more matches and part of the 
problem is the lack of competitive people to play with." 
</P>
<P>
 However, during the summer, the competition gets plenty stiff for DeVera. Her 
brother, Jason, a sophomore at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo comes home and 
challenges the little sister to 11-point tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to have to give me seven points, but not anymore," she said. "I beat 
him sometimes, but I can never really tell when he's trying hard either. 
Sometimes, he'll get mad and beat me easily." 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera said Jason, who plays for the Cal Poly tennis team, usually works her 
harder than her coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother wants it for me," she said. "He looks at himself and thinks about 
when he was my age and highly ranked. He thinks I have a chance to really make 
it really big, so he wants me to work really hard. He doesn't want me to blow 
my chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he started working hard too late. He always says, 'I'm not out here 
working out for me. I'm doing it for you, so you can get better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Phil DeVera, Faye's father, is not known for his light workouts either. In 
fact, the DeVera family workouts are often much more intense than Nelson's or 
Schultz's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think her parents think she could be a pretty good player and I think that 
frustrates them," Schultz said. "I can't tell her to go out there and play 
more. It's got to come from herself. I'm very anti-pushing kids too much. If 
she doesn't want to do it, I'm not going to push it down her throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nila DeVera, Faye's mother: "I've told her if she wants to stick with it, 
you have to give it your full attention. She could push herself a little more, 
but we can only push her so much. You can't drag her out to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera said she is hardly dragging herself to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the game, and I'm only playing as much as I want to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she's not on the court, the sociable DeVera is usually hanging out with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'm too lazy to go out with my friends and get on the phone and 
arrange everything, but I think that will change a little bit if I get my 
license," said DeVera, who turns 16 in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schultz: "She's very social. A lot of people who want her to be a better 
player think she's too social." 
</P>
<P>
 But other coaches, including Schultz, believe part of DeVera's problem is she 
might be too talented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things come pretty natural to her, and that's makes her not willing to work 
as hard," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera said her talent has often made her friends jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan Hollis (a Villa Park senior) would get mad at me because I'd win without 
trying," DeVera said. "He'd be working his butt off and lose. That's how I used 
to play. I'd win without even trying." 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken a while to sink in, but DeVera is finally realizing she can't win 
that way anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes in practice, I'd go through the motions," she said. "If I were to 
practice the way I play, then there would be a big difference in my game. I'm 
starting to do that now. Now, I realize it has to come from myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad losses at national tournaments have changed DeVera's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I thought, 'Yeah, I'm going to turn pro,' " DeVera 
said. "But then as I got older and started traveling to national tournaments, I 
saw how many good players are out there and how tough it will be for me. So 
then, I thought, 'Well, maybe after college.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After college, DeVera will try and make it on the pro tour and emulate? A 
grinder, Chris Evert? A serve and volleyer, Martina Navratilova? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. 
</P>
<P>
 Try, a natural, Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes everything look too easy," DeVera said. "And he has a good time on 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's all DeVera is trying to do.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; MARINERS DO RIGHT BY WILLARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Willard has been riding the major-league-to-triple-A shuttle for most of 
the last 11 years, but none of those seasons have been as successful as this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard, a 34-year-old catcher from Hueneme High and Oxnard College, is 
hitting .311 with 20 home runs and 71 runs batted in at Calgary, the Seattle 
Mariners' triple-A affiliate. Willard has had seasons in which he hit better 
than .300 and he has had seasons in which he hit 20 homers, but they were never 
the same seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best part for Willard is the Mariners gave him what he felt was an 
honest shot at the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Atlanta Braves last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I was treated fairly by the Braves," Willard said. "The worst 
mistake I made was going back to the Braves." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard, who drove in the winning run for the Braves in Game 4 of the 1991 
World Series, left the team as a free agent in 1992. He rejoined the Braves in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Willard had a good season at Richmond, Va., hitting .318 in 107 
games, he heard through sources in the organization that the Braves had no 
intention of calling him up, regardless of his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about quitting," Willard said. "I wasn't sure I was going to play 
this year, but I just got the urge, and I was thinking about managing or 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard said the Mariners approached him and left the possibility open that 
Willard might coach in the system. The team also gave him a shot at the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about going there and contributing as best I could and if 
things didn't work out playing, I would hope to get a job coaching," Willard 
said. "We talked about it before the season started. They said let's just see 
what happens. They said show me a good attitude and we'll see what happens. 
I've been doing just that." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard has spent 14 days with the Mariners this year, and he has one hit -- a 
game-winning three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
 With the major league strike, Willard's chances of returning to the majors 
this season seem slim. He no longer even worries about being a major league 
starting catcher. As a quality left-handed hitter, he would be happy as a 
backup catcher. He said he also might play in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 An uncertain future is nothing new for Willard, though. "I have been wandering 
and looking for a break for a lot of years now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Streaking: Damon Buford picked the wrong time to get hot, just as the major 
leagues were preparing to shut down for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford, center fielder for the Baltimore Orioles' triple-A team in Rochester, 
N.Y., recently had a 19-game hitting streak snapped. He hit .345 during the 
streak, raising his average to .269. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford's average had been as low as .220 early in the year. He attributed the 
slow start to moving between Rochester and the Oriole bench. Buford, a 
Birmingham High graduate, began the season in Baltimore but was sent down April 
17. He went back up May 10 and back down May 21. Back up June 14 and down June 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Dizzy? Now try to hit a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am actually glad that I came down to play," said Buford, who had spent most 
of his time on the bench with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford's chances of sticking with the Orioles might improve next year because 
Mike Devereaux will be a free agent. If the Orioles don't re-sign Devereaux, an 
outfield position would be up for grabs and Buford would be among the players 
given first shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem like that," he said, "but it's one of those cases where you 
never really know what's going to happen, so you have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spell it D-E-R-E-K: The Chicago Cubs appear to have found Derek Wallace's path 
to the majors, and it runs through the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, a Chatsworth High graduate and first-round pick out of Pepperdine in 
1992, was moved from the starting rotation to the closer role at double-A 
Orlando two months ago, and he pitched well enough to earn a promotion to 
triple-A Iowa on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a starter I was having trouble with my changeup, and after about three or 
four innings the hitters would time my fastball and they would start getting to 
me," Wallace said, "but as a closer you can come in and pretty much use two 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace was 2-9 with a 5.74 earned-run average at Orlando, but after he became 
the closer he posted a 2.91 ERA and converted eight of 10 save opportunities. 
Wallace gave up two runs in one inning in his first triple-A outing Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Struck out: Three local players were sent down to the minor leagues just 
before the strike, allowing them to continue playing -- and continue getting 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Phillies sent catcher Mike Lieberthal (Westlake) to 
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and the Angels sent outfielder Garret Anderson 
(Kennedy) and pitcher Andrew Lorraine (Hart) to Vancouver. All moves were made 
within the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Another local player was more fortunate, or less fortunate, depending on one's 
point of view. Third baseman Jeff Cirillo (Providence) remains on the Milwaukee 
Brewers' major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
 While players on minor league contracts are in the majors they receive a 
pro-rated share of $109,000, the major league minimum salary. While they are in 
triple A they receive their regular minor league salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cirillo, on strike in the majors, will not be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other local players might miss out on September call-ups. Buffalo 
pitcher Travis Willis (Camarillo) and first baseman Rich Aude (Chatsworth), 
Ottawa catcher Tim Laker (Simi Valley, Oxnard College), Rochester catcher Gregg 
Zaun (St. Francis), New Orleans shortstop Mark Loretta (St. Francis) and Buford 
are among those most likely to be called up when rosters are expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal, Anderson and Lorraine also would have been likely to spend 
September in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Dennis Moeller (Valley College) was named pitcher of the week in 
the American Assn. last week. Moeller pitched five scoreless innings in three 
relief outings and earned two victories for the Kansas City Royals' triple-A 
affiliate in Omaha, Neb. Moeller is 7-6 with a 4.13 ERA and five saves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Laker, catching for the Montreal Expos' triple-A team in Ottawa, was hitter of 
the week in the International League last week. Laker was eight for 19 with 
nine RBIs. Although he had not hit higher than .242 at any of the five minor 
league stops in which he had more than 35 at-bats, Laker is currently hitting 
.322 with eight home runs and 57 RBIs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Roland De La Maza (St. Genevieve, College of the Canyons) continues to tear 
through minor league baseball's lower levels. De La Maza is 10-2 with a 3.24 
ERA at Class-A Columbus, Ga. De La Maza, 22, was 10-3 with a 2.52 ERA last 
season at Class-A Watertown, N.Y., after the Cleveland Indians drafted him in 
June. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Foderaro (Hart, Canyons) is off to a good start in his first season of 
professional baseball. He is 2-1 with a 2.52 ERA for rookie-level Johnson City, 
Tenn. Foderaro, drafted in June by the Cardinals, is doing better in the minors 
than he did at Brigham Young this spring, when he had a 4-3 record and a 6.05 
ERA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hook (Newbury Park, Ventura College), who signed with the Houston Astros 
before the draft this year, is not doing as well at rookie-level Kissimmee, 
Fla. Hook is 0-2 with a 5.14 ERA.

FAMILY TIES HELP CIARELLI BE SUCCESSFUL ON BEACH CIRCUIT; VOLLEYBALL: FORMER 
UCLA ALL-AMERICAN AND PARTNER HOLLY MCPEAK, 1993 CHAMPIONS AT SEAL BEACH, START 
THEIR DEFENSE WITH A QUICK VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cammy Ciarelli must have felt right at home shuffling through the hot, sticky 
sand Friday when she began the defense of her title at the Miller Lite Open 
beach volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Rocky, is in his usual place, sitting in his wife's chair inside 
the players' box watching her every move and giving her encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 4-year-old son, Tony, is just beyond the fence that encircles the court 
and most of his time is spent kicking sand into the gentle breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Felicia, standing nearby, who at 6 already has the long golden 
hair reminiscent of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 And the four of them will be back today, because Ciarelli and partner Holly 
McPeak made quick work of their opening-round match, defeating Patty Dodd and 
Jennifer Murrell, 15-5, in just over 30 minutes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli and McPeak, seeded second in the eight-team Assn. of Volleyball 
Professionals event, had just the start they were looking for in their bid to 
repeat as tournament champions and earn their fourth tour victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In her five years of playing professional beach volleyball, Ciarelli has 
earned nearly $125,000, including $22,279 through 11 events this year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, volleyball is not just a job for Ciarelli, it has been her lifestyle 
since she was an all-league player at Laguna Beach High in the late '70s.  
</P>
<P>
 Since her marriage to Rocky Ciarelli in 1987, it has become a partnership on 
and off the sand as the two have combined to bring continued success to the 
Huntington Beach High volleyball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 They coached the girls' team, which advanced to the semifinals of the Southern 
Section playoffs last fall. The Oilers are expected to be one of the top teams 
in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, they coached the boys' team to the Division I championship with 
back-to-back upsets over top-ranked El Toro in the semifinals and Laguna Beach 
in the title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely been a volleyball marriage," Cammy Ciarelli said. "It's tough 
playing and practicing with the same partner all year, so I rely on Rocky for 
my training and Holly for the matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Marrying into the tightly knit Ciarelli family has helped pave the road to 
success for the former UCLA All-American. She has learned the mental approach 
to the game and enjoyed prolonged victory celebrations with her "extended 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of family celebrations in our house," she said. "And plenty of 
red wine and pasta." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli credits her husband with encouraging her to stick with volleyball 
once she returned from playing professionally in Italy in the mid-80s and also 
with his advice on dealing with the mental side of the beach game. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be successful in this sport you have to develop all your skills and also 
be able to know the cagey side of it, such as knowing your opponents and where 
to place the ball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily training, staying fit and good nutrition are equally important to 
staying competitive on the pro level, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing beats a good Italian celebration afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top eight teams, only sixth-seeded Scott Ayakatubby and Brent Frohoff 
were eliminated. They won their opening match but were defeated by Canyon Ceman 
and Dan Vrebalovich in the second round, then were eliminated in the 
consolation bracket by Kevin Martin and Chris Young. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The top two seeded teams of Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes and Mike Dodd and 
Mike Whitmarsh had no problems advancing to today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, No. 3 Randy Stoklos and Adam Johnson will have to come out of the 
consolation bracket, since they lost their second-round match to the No. 
14-seeded Brian Gatzke and Jeff Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-seeded Tim Hovland and Leif Hanson also had a scare when they lost their 
opener, 12-10, to 24th-seeded Larry Mear and Mike Minier. Hovland and Hanson 
then rallied to win two in a row and stay alive for today's rounds. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In men's semifinals today: Karch Kiraly-Kent Steffes vs. Troy Tanner-Wes 
Welch, 8:30 a.m.; Eduardo Bacil-Jose Loiola, 8:30 a.m.; Brian Gatzke-Jeff 
Rodgers vs. Canyon Ceman-Dan Vrebalovich, 9:30 a.m.; Bill Boullianne-Eric 
Fonoimoana vs. Mike Dodd-Mike Whitmarsh, 9:30 a.m. In today's women's 
semifinals: Nancy Reno-Angela Rock vs. Sandra Pires-Jackie Silva, 8:30 a.m.; 
Valinda Hilleary-Pat Keller vs. Holly McPeak-Cammy Ciarelli, 9:30 a.m.

SANTA ANA VALLEY BOYS' BASKETBALL ON PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Valley High School boys' basketball program has been placed on 
one-year probation for playing a potential transfer student in a summer league 
game, Santa Ana Unified School District officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Century's Ike Harmon, the player in question, played three games for Santa Ana 
Valley in July but was not officially registered at the school.Harmon has 
announced his intention to attend Santa Ana Valley in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Southern Section rules, a coach cannot have contact with a student until 
he is enrolled at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Superintendent Joe Tafoya said there had been no recruiting 
violation. The probation is not expected to exclude the Falcons from Southern 
Section playoff competition this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon, a 6-foot-5 center, will be immediately eligible if he does enroll at 
Santa Ana Valley. He averaged 9.2 points and 6.1 rebounds and blocked 41 shots 
at Century last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Harmon, Ike's brother, was a senior on the Centurions, which finished 
23-5 and reached the second round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmons also have six daughters, all of whom attended Santa Ana Valley.

BOISCLAIR'S RISE TO NO. 1 LEADS TO RESOUNDING FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tournament committee moved Erin Boisclair to the head of the class. They 
seeded her No. 1, dubbing her the best 16-and-under tennis player in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Boisclair, of Agoura Hills, arrived at Morley Field in Balboa Park for 
the United States Tennis Assn. Girls 16 National Championships, she expected to 
score straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
 But after she was eliminated in singles and doubles Friday, Boisclair, 14, 
wore the look of a schoolgirl who had just received a report card and the 
grades were lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 She was stunned and disappointed. And after a moment's thought, she was 
determined to do better next time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I learned a lot from this tournament," she said. "I put too much 
pressure on myself, when I should just come out and play my tennis. I tried to 
relax. I mean, it's too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair was eliminated in singles Friday morning. To put a capper on a 
miserable day, she and Janet Walker of Seffner, Fla., then lost in the 
semifinals of doubles to second-seeded Katherine Ashley of Chestnut Hill, Me., 
and Annica Cooper of Geneva, Ill., 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Boisclair-Walker appeared to have the match in hand. They held a 
one-set, 3-0 lead with Boisclair serving. Then they unraveled, losing 12 of 13 
games. Boisclair, a strong server, was broken five times in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair will finish eighth in singles because she was beaten by 
second-seeded Aubrie Rippner of Chico, 6-3, 6-3, in an earlier consolation 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Boisclair trounced Rippner, 6-2, 6-0, in the Miami (Fla.) Easter Bowl in 
April. But Boisclair said her head wasn't in this match. A 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 
setback to 10th-seeded Tammy Encina of Miami Beach in the Thursday 
quarterfinals was still haunting her. She had stayed up the night replaying the 
defeat in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put way too much pressure on myself," Boisclair said. "Everybody knew 
it. My coach knew it. My dad knew it. I was, like, shaking in every match." 
</P>
<P>
 If this was a lesson in humility, Boisclair said she might as well take it 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to take it sometime," said Boisclair, dabbing her face with 
a towel, her disappointed eyes hidden under the bill of a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been seeded in a national tournament No. 1. If it didn't happen 
here, it would happen later. It's over now and I learned a lot."

 Catcher Jonathan Higashi of Northridge Little League has been disqualified 
from the Western Regional tournament after an anonymous letter sent to Little 
League headquarters in Williamsport, Pa., revealed he lives outside the 
Northridge Little League boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Higashi did not play Friday in Northridge's 14-2 victory over Anchorage, 
Alaska, and Northridge will not have to forfeit any games. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League rules stipulate that a team must forfeit its previous game if an 
ineligible player is discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only the team last defeated by the offending team may lodge the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier, which Northridge defeated in last week's division final, could have 
protested up until Friday's game began.  
</P>
<P>
 This explains why the entire Northridge rooting contingent breathed a 
collective sigh of relief when the first pitch was thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 Merle Sanders, administrator of District 40, of which Northridge belongs, did 
not contact Whittier after receiving word of the letter from Western Regional 
director Carlton E. Magee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I investigated and discovered the allegation to be true," he said. "The boy's 
father voluntarily removed the player from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself, what is my moral duty? Based upon the way the rules are 
structured, my knowledge can't be used (by Whittier)." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Manager Larry Baca said he had no idea where Higashi lives.  
</P>
<P>
 This was Higashi's first season in the Northridge Little League. He previously 
played in an independent league in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eligibility affidavit turned in by Northridge at the beginning of 
tournament play more than a month ago, Higashi's address was listed improperly, 
indicating that somebody within the league knew of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there are adults who don't grasp what Little League baseball is all 
about," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higashi was told Wednesday that he would not play in the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty sad and started crying," said Higashi, who had started every 
game at catcher.

SHERMAN WILL LEAD THE MARCH; SOFTBALL: TOP CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE ASSISTANT 
SUCCEEDS 13-YEAR VETERAN TORGESON AS HEAD COACH. 
</P>

<P>
 Janet Sherman, an assistant softball coach at Cal State Northridge for five 
seasons, has been named head coach, the school announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman had been the top assistant the last three seasons and now takes the 
reins of a team that finished as Division I runner-up last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She replaces Gary Torgeson, a popular and successful coach who guided the 
Northridge program for 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson left Northridge to accept a position as dean of physical education 
and athletics at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure at Northridge, Torgeson's teams compiled a record of 
636-214-2 and won four national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Because several members of the team were displaced by the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
last season was an extremely difficult one for Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Torgeson managed to hold his team together, leading the Matadors to a 
52-10 record and a berth in the final against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman believes it is important to have continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a troubled program that needs any major changes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be helpful to the returning players that a familiar face will 
be around." 
</P>
<P>
 Jen Richardson and All-American Kathy Blake will team to give Northridge a 
formidable pitching duo next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good recruiting class and we have some returnees, so I look for us 
to be really competitive," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will compete in the newly formed American West Conference next 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, a former All-American catcher at UCLA, becomes the third coach in the 
17-year history of Northridge softball. She has yet to name an assistant.

MATHEWS TAKING ON ADDED ROLE AT VENTURA; COLLEGES: BASKETBALL COACH SAYS HE HAS 
BEEN NAMED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Philip Mathews, the highly successful men's basketball coach at Ventura 
College, said Friday he has been named the school's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment became effective July 1, but Mathews said the college has not 
officially announced it yet.He replaces Jerry Dunlap, who resigned in May after 
holding the position for 19 years. Dunlap is now a physical education teacher 
at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, 43, said he is looking forward to his new duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be challenging coaching basketball and being the A.D.," Mathews said. 
"But it's something I think I can handle. I think it'll be a nice career move 
to get into athletic administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews took over the Pirate basketball program during the 1985-86 season and 
quickly built it into one of the finest among junior colleges in the country, 
winning the state title the following season.  
</P>
<P>
 He is 261-55 over nine seasons at Ventura and has won 30 or more games in a 
season five times, including the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Pirates won their eighth consecutive Western State Conference 
North Division title and reached the state championship title game for the 
second consecutive year, but lost to Long Beach City, 63-61, in the final at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Mathews is one of several moves made over the summer by the 
Ventura athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Don Adams was named baseball coach to replace Gary Anglin, 
who resigned after last season, his 17th with the Pirates.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Miki McFadden was hired recently to head the women's volleyball program. 
 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden, who played for the United States in the 1968 Olympics, replaced 
Sharon McAlexander, who resigned.

ANGEL PLAYERS LEAVE ON UNPAID VACATIONS; BASEBALL: DIAPERS TAKE THE PLACE OF 
GROUNDBALLS FOR DISARCINA; FINLEY MIGHT GO TO LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The four Angel players sat around in their underwear Wednesday night, smoking 
cigars, drinking a few beers, reflecting on their lost season. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly seemed possible that it could all be over, but they kept talking 
long into the night, each trying to convince the other that surely this would 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 They awoke Friday morning, waiting for that phone call, waiting for someone, 
anyone, to say a settlement had been reached. Instead, they got word from the 
Major League Players Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, no progress was made. Oh, and by the way, this weekend's games have 
already been canceled.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of playing ball in Detroit this weekend, shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
found himself feeding his 3-week-old baby, and getting instructions from his 
wife, Janee, on changing diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn sometime," DiSarcina said. "You can only play stupid for so 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Spike Owen was making travel plans for Austin, Tex., where he 
was going to surprise his three sons, who never realized their dad could take a 
summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Bob Patterson was headed off to the family vacation home in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Chuck Finley was talking about going to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an eerie feeling," DiSarcina said. "There was such a nervous energy 
after our last game -- everyone seemed kind of excited -- but now it's already 
starting to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement of the strike is wearing off real quick, and I think everyone 
will start to realize real quick that this is serious business. This is no 
vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief pitcher Joe Grahe said: "Vacations are nice, but when they're not paid 
vacations, you want them to be over as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 While the players were at or heading home Friday, Angel management went to 
work, trying to act as if this were a usual business day. It soon became 
apparent it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, bracing for a projected $6-million loss, surprised the staff by 
laying off three full-time, front-office employees and said that more 
budget-linked firings could be coming in November. The entire scouting staff 
already has been pulled in. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi, Manager Marcel Lachemann and the coaching staff 
convened for four hours, discussing personnel moves. They talked about what 
needed to be done if the season resumes, still hanging onto faint hope that 
they can get back into the American League West race, knowing they are only 5 
1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going on the assumption that it will be a short stoppage," Bavasi said. 
"If this thing starts up, we want to be prepared. If it doesn't, we haven't 
lost anything." 
</P>
<P>
 When the meeting ended, they shook hands and parted ways, everyone realizing 
it could be the last time they're together. After all, when your team has the 
worst record in the American League, changes are made on the coaching staff 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sinking feeling, walking in, and seeing all of the empty lockers," 
said Ken Macha, Angel third base coach. "I don't feel good about this at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been though the strike of '81, and to treat this as a vacation is wrong. 
If this thing goes through the winter, it could change the whole state of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my whole personal life's in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
 Macha, who would like to join his family in Pittsburgh, discovered Friday that 
a round-trip air ticket costs $1,344. He inquired about a seven-day advance 
fare, but that was $671, including a $250 penalty if he changed the return. How 
can he be expected to predict a return date? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everthing's kind of (messed) up right now," Macha said. "I'm just sitting in 
my apartment, trying to decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Really, no one knows quite what to do. Lachemann was trying to decide whether 
to stay in town or go to Vancouver, Canada, and visit the triple-A club. He was 
told that he might as well go home, and will be leaving this weekend for 
Penryn, Calif., near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Harold Reynolds was going to hang around town, but said he 
likely will go ahead and take the scenic drive north part of the way on U.S. 1 
to his hometown of Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he's there, he plans to stop by the local newspaper and say hello to his 
colleagues. He's a columnist, you see, writing every Sunday for the Corvallis 
Gazette Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a little tough explaining what's going on to the readers," Reynolds 
said. "They really don't understand. I don't blame them. It's complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I'm not even sure all of our guys realize what this is all about, 
and that might be the saddest thing of all." No Work, No Pay

 At the outset of the sport's eighth work stoppage, negotiators for the players 
and owners agreed to accept federal mediation to try to resolve their 
collective bargaining stalemate.Neither side seemed optimistic of a quick fix. 
Further negotiations are unlikely until both sides meet with the mediator, who 
can only urge a settlement, not enforce one. A similar attempt was unsuccessful 
during a 50-day strike in 1981.

DODGERS FACING RIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FIRST CLUE; REACTION: AS THE PLAYERS CLEAR 
OUT THEIR LOCKERS, SOME ARE BITTER ABOUT OWNERS' POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orel Hershiser was seated on a table in the Dodger clubhouse Friday morning 
next to his son, Quinton, when he was asked his prognosis of the players' 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient is sick," Hershiser replied. "You have a billion-dollar industry 
and you can't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinton, who had stumped reporters for about 15 minutes with a game of 
riddles, thought his dad was still playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that a new one?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little that is new, though, about the first day of baseball's eighth 
work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you taking most everything or leaving most everything?" Jim Gott asked 
Eric Karros, as they loaded carts with bats, spikes and even some of Gott's 
karate equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much time since 1981 and now, and I think the thing that 
bothers me the most is that (the owners) look down on us so much, like we are a 
Third World country or something," Gott said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that the issues we are dealing with are the same as they 
were in 1985 and each year we've come back and extended the basic agreement at 
the end, but they are the same exact issues," Gott said. "They have never been 
happy and we've been happier than them and haven't wanted to give up the status 
quo. The only resolution is for them to open the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti, whose last non-baseball job was shoveling crushed gypsum at a 
boat dock, said he could get another job if he had to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have come from a background where things weren't handed to us, so 
we can do that again," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The change (the owners want) is so drastic, and when they say, 'It's my way 
or the highway,' it's a bad feeling and there is no compromise to be had. . . . 
You get a bad, rotten feeling, and combine that with (being) an athlete that is 
used to being competitive day in and day out and doesn't back down from a 
challenge. I've tried to be cool-headed about it, but the attitude is that if 
there is no salary cap, there is no compromise. I see the strike lasting 
because we are not going to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 The players trickled into the clubhouse, Karros among the first to arrive. "It 
hasn't hit me yet," he said. "Right now, it just seems like an off-day -- 
probably Saturday or the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Valdes, the only player the Dodgers sent to the minors with the strike 
in mind, had a renewed spirit about the situation. He hadn't looked happy on 
Thursday, when he was told he would be sent to the Dodgers' triple-A team in 
Albuquerque so he could continue to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some plans to visit my family (in Mexico) on my mind, and when they 
told me, those plans were suddenly gone," Valdes said. "But I thought about it 
last night, and I think I am lucky because I love to play baseball and with the 
strike on, I will still get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes, who made $595.63 a day on the major league roster, will be paid 
$157.92 a day at Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, being in first place in the National League West makes this 
strike bittersweet. The players have been told by the union not to work out as 
a group, but some wish they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep ourselves in shape, however we do it individually, because 
some of us were talking, and we remember what it was like when we went to 
Taiwan on the tour (last fall) after being off for three weeks, and we were 
embarrassed," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only won one game out of five and the people over there were saying, 'We 
didn't know we were this close to having a true World Series.' And we were 
thinking, 'You have to be kidding me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser said there is time to salvage the season, or at least the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a competitive season and you could crown everybody right now," 
Hershiser said. "To restart and have a pennant race, you would have to have two 
or three weeks of playing time. But you could start with the postseason if you 
had to, which would be a better alternative than canceling it, although I 
probably wouldn't be saying that if we were one game out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a big mistake to not have a postseason. There has been a 
World Series every year since 1905 that world wars or labor negotiations 
haven't stopped. I don't think anybody wants to be a part of that. There would 
be books written about it and probably a movie made. At this point, it would be 
a sci-fi." 
</P>

 Meanwhile, 9-year-old Quinton says having his father home in the summer is 
fun, but different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it feels weird to have him around because I'm so used to him being 
at the ballpark," Quinton said. "It's really fun having him around, but I'm 
used to him coming home about 11 at night and he comes in and says good night 
when you don't even know it. And I'm used to going in and saying goodby to him 
in the morning because I'm going to camp or something. And now, I get to eat 
breakfast with him." No Work, No Pay

UNITY STILL U.S. GOAL IN SOCCER; ELECTION: DESPITE WORLD CUP SUCCESS, 
ROTHENBERG WILL FACE THREE CHALLENGERS TODAY IN HIS BID TO REMAIN U.S. 
FEDERATION PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago at another resort hotel on a different coast, soccer found 
itself at a crossroads. After a weekend of intrigue, power plays and agonized 
debate, soccer moved into the fast lane, electing Los Angeles attorney Alan 
Rothenberg president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Rothenberg is here at the USSF's annual general meeting, seeking 
reelection. And the same kind of back-room politics is driving this 
presidential campaign, in which there are three challengers to Rothenberg. 
They, though, are battling the same savvy that Rothenberg employed to gain 
victory in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the last election, a spokesman for FIFA, soccer's international 
governing body, called one of the candidates and asked him to withdraw. The 
candidate refused and, in an outraged address to the convention on the morning 
of the vote, accused Rothenberg of bringing in outsiders to influence the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, FIFA was much closer than a phone call from Zurich. FIFA 
president Joao Havelange and senior vice president Guillermo Canedo showed up 
at a cocktail party held by Rothenberg on Thursday night. Lest any delegates 
miss the connection, Havelange -- the sport's most powerful figure -- was in 
the ballroom only three minutes before he, too, was wearing a Rothenberg 
campaign button. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did in 1990, Rothenberg is running a high-profile, high-pressure 
campaign. Name recognition was an important goal in 1990, when Rothenberg noted 
his association with the defunct L.A. Aztecs professional team and his position 
as commissioner of soccer for the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 This election, Rothenberg is a known quantity -- his campaign buttons refer 
only to his first name, as in, "Alan. For the Good of the Game" and, the theme 
of mutual self-interest, "Alan. He Wins, We Win." 
</P>
<P>
 But familiarity might have bred contempt. Rothenberg's tenure as USSF 
president ran concurrent to his term as chairman of the World Cup Organizing 
Committee. That led some soccer insiders to complain that even a man of 
Rothenberg's enormous energy could not properly do both jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was before MLS. Months before the start of World Cup, Rothenberg 
announced that he was also going to head a new professional league, Major 
League Soccer. It was Rothenberg's connection with the for-profit MLS that led 
critics to accuse him of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg calls the situation a "confluence of interest" and says he can ably 
serve all of the USSF's constituent groups -- professional, amateur and youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new league has also become a campaign issue. Rothenberg said 
Thursday that the viability of MLS will be seriously compromised should he not 
win reelection. He even suggested that other candidates wanted MLS to fail, 
although their public remarks don't support that contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg has released information this week that will no doubt bolster his 
campaign boasts of engineering enormous financial success: The World Cup profit 
is expected to surpass $40 million, more than double the earlier projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Any discussion of money, however, invariably raises the thorny issue of World 
Cup bonuses and their impact on the legacy funds for soccer's future. More than 
$14 million of the World Cup profit will go into a pool for severance, vacation 
pay and bonuses for about 500 employees of the World Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The top executives -- Rothenberg, Scott LeTellier and Elizabeth Primrose-Smith 
-- are expected to receive bonuses of up to $2 million, with Rothenberg's bonus 
capped at $3 million. The World Cup board of directors will vote on the matter 
after a final accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 These money matters are a big issue with Rothenberg's opponents -- Richard 
Groff, USSF treasurer; Hank des Bordes, USSF executive vice president, and 
Louis Palivos, president of the Illinois Soccer Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the bitter battle for the presidency -- Rothenberg is not alone in 
calling the politicking ugly -- a meeting of candidates was called in Dallas 
two weeks ago. A USSF official gamely asked the candidates to consider stepping 
down to avoid another public washing of soccer's dirty laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 His suggestion was greeted with snorts and firm assurances from the candidates 
that none would pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials then pleaded with them to run clean campaigns free of personal 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 That has not happened. And despite a World Cup successfully behind it, soccer 
is back where it was four years ago, teetering on the brink of a momentous 
decision.

RAMS' OFFENSE ON THE SPOT EARLY; PRO FOOTBALL: BETTIS, MILLER WILL PLAY TONIGHT 
AGAINST PATRIOTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So far they appear to be the same old downtrodden Rams, showing no spark and 
offering little promise of better days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 They failed to score a touchdown in last week's exhibition opener with Green 
Bay, a common shortcoming during last year's 5-11 season, and they were 
helpless to stop the Packers from scoring the first time Green Bay had the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first-round draft pick, tackle Wayne Gandy, looked like a revolving door 
as Sean Jones spun past him and blasted quarterback Chris Chandler. The team's 
two rookie receivers, Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley, who are being counted on 
to produce this season, combined for two catches for 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have lost six consecutive exhibitions, and although that's fine for a 
team saving its best for regular-season play, the Rams' track record suggests 
that they have some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, (quarterback) Chris Miller didn't play last week and I didn't play last 
week," running back Jerome Bettis said. "But fans don't want to hear that 
stuff. Preseason game or not, this team needs to start winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's all this talk about how we're going to be better, but talk won't cut 
it. The only thing that is going to get people interested in this team is 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of interest will be evident at Anaheim Stadium tonight. Ram ticket 
manager Don Nims said the team has distributed 29,000 tickets for the 
exhibition with the New England Patriots. Nims added, however, that he expected 
only 25,000 to 26,000 to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the 25,000 fans that we have there will be very loyal football fans," 
assistant coach Joe Vitt said. "And they will see that we are improving on 
defense, improving on offense and trying to work on things that will give us 
the best chance to win the (regular-season) opener." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the plan last year, and the Rams lost their opener -- for the fourth 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, meanwhile, are also preparing for a regular-season opener, under 
the direction of Bill Parcells, who is 29-9 in exhibitions as coach of New 
England and the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, while 5-11 like the Rams a year ago, appear headed in the 
opposite direction. The team has captured the fancy of fans throughout New 
England, and drew 37,800 in a rainstorm last week for a 24-6 victory over the 
New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave the Rams after last week's lackluster debut? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a sense of urgency this week to practice better and 
then play better," Bettis said. "We need to put some points on the board. We 
can't have people stay in there for the whole game and risk being lost for the 
regular season, but we need to put in a good effort for the people and show 
them something." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who was rested last week, will start, as will Miller, who will be 
making his first appearance as the Rams' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has undergone surgery on his left knee twice in the last two 
seasons, has been impressive in practice and has displayed leadership 
qualities, but he has yet to get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preseason games, from a win-loss standpoint, are not that important," Miller 
said. "But we have a lot of new faces and it's important for us to develop team 
chemistry and show our fans a piece of what they are going to get during the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Miller and Bettis will play at least a quarter and said 
the team's No. 1 offensive and defensive lines will play at least two quarters.

THEY TAKE AX TO ITALIAN GRAND PRIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italian Grand Prix was canceled by international racing authorities on 
Friday after local officials refused to go along with safety demands by 
chopping down 123 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said that it called off the 
Sept. 11 race at Monza because it could not get a guarantee that the major 
curve on the track would be altered to slow the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The circuit is in a Milan park and the changes would have meant cutting 
centuries-old trees on a scale that outraged ecologists. Although a divided 
central government approved the work, local officials had the final say, and 
they refused. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rome, Gianni Letta, a Cabinet secretary appealing on behalf of premier 
Silvio Berlusconi, sought a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race must be run and must be run at Monza," Letta said. He suggested that 
one or more curves could be added to slow the racers down before the dangerous 
tree-lined curve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attempts are being made to find another venue," said federation spokesman 
Martin Whitaker at the time trials of the Hungarian Grand Prix. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety-plagued season's problems began at another Italian track, Imola, 
when three-time champion Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed 
during the San Marino Grand Prix.

 Three-sport standout Phil Fonua, a defensive lineman at Mira Costa High in 
Manhattan Beach, was in critical but stable condition Friday at Torrance 
Memorial Hospital after undergoing surgery Thursday for a ruptured aneurysm in 
his brain, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 275-pound Fonua, preparing for his senior year, collapsed 
Wednesday during a workout in the Mira Costa weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua was named Southern Section Division VII co-player of the year last 
season after helping Mira Costa win its first section football title. He also 
was starting center on the basketball team and finished fourth in the shotput 
at the State track and field meet. ROB FERNAS

DEFENSIVE QUESTION MARKS GREET UCLA; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DONAHUE BEGINS VIGOROUS 
SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO LOSS OF 14 TOP MEMBERS OF UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A third grader can handle the math: 22 minus 14 equals trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an equation facing coaches as UCLA begins preseason practice today in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the top 22 defensive players from last season must be replaced 
before the Bruins open their season against Tennessee on Sept. 3 at the Rose 
Bowl, where they ended their 1983 season at 8-4 with a loss to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the losses were unexpected -- undergraduates who chose to try their 
luck in the NFL draft or are injured and sidelined for the season or have 
trouble with the law that will probably keep them out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Marvin Goodwin, linebacker Jamir Miller and nose tackle Bruce Walker 
decided to give up the rest of their college eligibility for the pros. 
Linebackers Andrew McClave and Brian Tighe were forced to quit because of 
shoulder operations. Safety Tommy Bennett is still facing forgery charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In their places are the young and untried, the willing but so far untested. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers they provide will go a long way toward determining UCLA's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no different from any other season," said Coach Terry Donahue, who also 
pointed at holes to be filled in the offensive line in his state-of-the-Bruins 
address on Friday. "There are questions every season, but the questions are 
always in different places." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive coordinator Bob Field, who will grade the next 20 days of tests, 
takes a philosophical approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing the six underclassmen is like having injuries before the season," he 
said. "Five or maybe all six of them probably would have started. And we can't 
stand any more injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem is pass defense. Only Oregon State among Pacific 10 schools 
does not offer a formidable passing game. Three conference quarterbacks who 
threw for more than 3,200 yards last season are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee passed enough last year to make its quarterback, Heath Shuler, the 
No. 1 pick of the Washington Redskins. And Southern Methodist, opponent No. 2, 
is a run-and-shoot offensive team, passing more than 40 times a game. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with all that, UCLA has starting cornerbacks Carl Greenwood and Teddy 
Lawrence back but must find safeties to replace Goodwin and the graduated 
Travis Collier. Sophomores Paul Guidry -- who was third in the Pac-10 in punt 
returns last season -- and Abdul McCullough were the starters coming out of 
spring practice. Behind them are Ted Nwoke, who played in specialty pass 
coverages last season, and Erik Holcomb, a converted wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind them are freshmen Shaun Williams, Glenn Thompkins, Javelin Guidry -- 
Paul's brother -- and DuVal Hicks, players who have yet to attend a UCLA class 
and are given good chances of playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "No coach really likes to use freshmen," Field said. "You would hope that you 
wouldn't have to use them. But when you use nickel (five-back) coverages like 
we do, some of them are going to have to play." 
</P>
<P>
 While Field sorts out the defense, new offensive coordinator Bob Toledo will 
spend time working on the running game. The man who isn't supposed to be there, 
tailback Skip Hicks, was there Friday at media day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks' recovery from a knee injury suffered while long jumping last spring has 
been remarkable, Donahue said. "He's been the speediest healer I've seen in my 
24 years here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the man to convince is Gerald Finerman, the team doctor. Recovery from the 
injury Hicks suffered generally takes at least nine months, and his operation 
was only six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting him to play," said Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will start Sharmon Shah, who has recovered from his own knee 
problems, at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 The early schedule is formidable, and Donahue acknowledges he would prefer 
that Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton were still playing football to 
offer season-opening competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there are Tennessee and Nebraska, both top-10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've gone well against those nonconference schools, then you'll have a 
pretty good gauge as to whether you're ready for a difficult conference race," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 And you will find out if you have the right answers for the preseason 
questions.

 Buoyed by 10 returning starters, a banner recruiting harvest and hopes of a 
Rose Bowl appearance, a Heisman Trophy and maybe even an Outland Trophy or a 
Lombardi Trophy, USC launches its 1994 football season on campus this morning 
at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second season of his second Trojan tenure, Coach John Robinson brings 
back a solid core from his 8-5 team of last season -- quarterback Rob Johnson, 
320-pound All-American offensive tackle Tony Boselli and a recruiting class 
rated by many as USC's best in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans open the season against Washington on Sept. 3 at the Coliseum, 
then travel to Penn State on Sept. 10. Two-a-day practices begin today and 
continue through next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The headliner is Johnson, who starts his senior year as a Heisman candidate. 
Johnson had a big season in 1993, throwing for 3,630 yards and 29 touchdowns 
while completing 68.6% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Johnson and USC, when it seemed they were on their way to 
the Rose Bowl, an almost routine two-yard pass by Johnson was intercepted in 
the end zone by UCLA's Marvin Goodwin. At the time, the Trojans trailed, 27-21, 
in the final minute.  
</P>
<P>
 So USC, co-champion of the Pacific 10 with a 6-2 mark, missed out on a trip to 
Pasadena, going instead to Anaheim and beating Utah, 28-21, in the Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 6-feet-4 and 220 pounds, had a season that surprised even him. A year 
ago, he was shown the USC passing records, topped by Rodney Peete's 8,225 
yards.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Johnson was ninth on the list with 2,343 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 He looked at Peete's number that day and said: "I have no shot at Peete, none. 
But I can catch some of those other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he can catch 'em all.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson can pass Peete with 2,252 yards, considerably fewer than he gained 
last year. Hard to believe, but he's almost 1,000 yards ahead of Todd 
Marinovich, who passed for 5,001. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will have a new backup in Brad Otton, a 6-6 transfer from Weber State. 
Two-year backup Kyle Wachholtz, who is academically ineligible, will transfer 
to another school for his last year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli, the 6-7 1/2 lineman projected as a first-round NFL draft choice, 
wants to play a complete season. He hopes to become USC's first Outland Trophy 
winner since Ron Yary in 1967, or the school's first Lombardi Trophy winner 
since Brad Budde in 1979. The Outland goes to the best interior lineman in the 
country, the Lombardi to the best lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his roommate, Johnson, Boselli said Friday the focus is simply on 
winning football games.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he gets (the Heisman), but we both feel the same way -- if we win 
every weekend and go to the Rose Bowl, he's got it. Rob's the best quarterback 
in the country, he's shown that." 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli played half a season a year ago. He was having another All-American 
year until the first quarter at Arizona, in the season's fifth game. He went 
down in a heap with a dislocated left kneecap.  
</P>
<P>
 He missed five games but returned stronger than ever. At Washington, during a 
22-17 victory, he drove defensive linemen eight and 10 yards off the line or 
onto their backs on running plays.  
</P>
<P>
 Six offensive starters and four defensive starters are back, including 
linebackers Jeff Kopp and Brian Williams, who led the defense last year with 83 
and 78 tackles, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 Also returning for the defense are defensive lineman Matt Keneley and 
cornerback John Herpin. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Johnson and Boselli as returning offensive starters are tailback Shawn 
Walters, who gained 711 yards and scored seven touchdowns; wide receiver Ken 
Grace, tackle Kris Pollack and Boselli's running mate at tackle, Norberto 
Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
 The punter, John Stonehouse, returns, as does kicker Cole Ford. Among 
Robinson's recruits is Adam Abrams of San Diego, one of the nation's 
outstanding high school kickers last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior college transfers expected to make an impact include linebackers Israel 
Ifeanyi, a Nigerian who played at Orange Coast, and Errick Herrin, a Gulf War 
Marine veteran from Mt. San Jacinto Junior College.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the freshmen, considerable interest has been focused on Darrell Russell, 
a 6-4, 300-pound defensive lineman from San Diego. In fitness drills the other 
day, he had a 28-inch vertical leap.  
</P>
<P>
 Contact drills will not begin until Wednesday, but already two injuries have 
been reported. Returning linebacker Gerald Caruthers broke a bone in his foot 
while running and will miss at least the Washington game, and returning 
tailback LaVale Woods is still favoring a knee injured during track season. 
</P>
<P>
 This team will be bigger, physically stronger and deeper in numbers than 
recent Trojan teams, Robinson says. He hopes games such as those against Penn 
State and Notre Dame last year, where his players were manhandled up front, are 
things of the past.  
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't a physically dominant team last year and we need to be if we're 
going to win championships," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And the best thing I can do for Rob Johnson this year is give him a good 
running game. Last year, we'd pass and go ahead by two touchdowns, and then we 
couldn't control the game with our run game. This year, I want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Washington game, I don't think we made a first down in our last three 
series. I want to have that sense of control -- that's a big issue with me."

PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES HIT HARD; SALARIES: FEWER GAMES BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE 
WILL MEAN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LESS FOR MANY PLAYERS.

 Orel Hershiser knew the players union would be negotiating baseball's basic 
agreement this season, so he wasn't counting on the incentives in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was going to be a chance of a work stoppage, so you don't budget 
for something you may not have," Hershiser said. "It would be like budgeting to 
win the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers rarely offer incentives, but Hershiser's contract calls for 
$250,000 for each start from his 30th to 34th. With his 21 starts, plus the 10 
more he probably would have made if the games were being played, Hershiser 
stands to lose $500,000 because of the strike. Any cushion Hershiser had to 
reach 30 games during the season was blown a month ago when he suffered a 
strained left side while warming up, causing him to sit out two starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the players union has negotiated with the owners to have the 
incentives pro-rated," said Dennis Gilbert, a Beverly Hills sports agent. "But 
if the players were worried about their contracts and their incentive programs, 
they wouldn't be going on strike. There are other issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the other players who will be affected if the season does not 
resume quickly: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Bedrosian of the Atlanta Braves is one relief appearance from the 
$100,000 bonus that comes with his 35th and six games away from another 
$100,000. His base salary of $750,000 increases $100,000 when he appears in his 
35th, 40th, 45th and 50th games. He has been in 44 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All starting pitcher Bret Saberhagen of the New York Mets needs is 32 2/3 
innings to earn his first bonus of $100,000. His base salary is $3.529 million 
and he stands to lose $300,000 for not collecting incentives for pitching 210, 
225 and 240 innings. He has pitched 177 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harold Baines of the Baltimore Orioles could lose $300,000. He is 36 plate 
appearances (at-bats, walks, sacrifices etc.) from the $100,000 that comes with 
his 400th. He would also collect $100,000 for his 450th and 500th plate 
appearances. His base salary is $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julio Franco of the Texas Rangers is five plate appearances from a $150,000 
bonus. He has a base salary of $1 million and one incentive package based on 
plate appearances worth $1 million. He has already collected some of the 
incentives and would probably lose $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rene Arocha of the St. Louis Cardinals is two relief appearances from a 
$5,000 bonus and eight appearances away from another $5,000. Along with his 
base salary of $140,000, his incentives are based on a point system -- two 
points for each start, one point for each relief appearance. He receives $5,000 
each for 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 points. He has 52. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland Athletics is five appearances 
short of earning $50,000 for pitching in his 50th game. He is 20 appearances 
from another $50,000. With a base salary of $3.335 million, he is paid $50,000 
each for appearing in 50 and 65 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charlie Hayes of the Colorado Rockies has already earned $25,000 for 450 
plate appearances, but will lose another $25,000 if he doesn't reach 550. He is 
paid a base of $3.050 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever Greg Olson of the Atlanta Braves was a risky investment because he 
was coming off an elbow injury. So the Braves paid him a base salary of 
$500,000 and $1 million for appearing in his first game with an additional 
incentive package that could total $1.5 million. He is paid $25,000 for each 
game between one and 40 and $50,000 for each game he appears in from 51-60. He 
has been in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oriole closer Lee Smith was signed to a base salary of $1.5 million and an 
incentive package worth another $800,000 based on appearances and games 
finished. He is nine appearances away from earning $112,000 and was on a pace 
to earn a total of $224,000. If he finishes six more games he would also earn 
an additional $100,000. He has 41 appearances and has finished 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher John Smoltz, whom the Braves had considered putting in the bullpen, 
had a realistic chance to make an additional $150,000 based on starts and 
innings pitched. Besides his $3-million base, he is three starts and 33 1/3 
innings away from a bonus of $50,000. He has pitched 134 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Angels' Chili Davis is 32 plate appearances away from earning $150,000 
and Bo Jackson, who has an incentive package worth $1.2 million, is five games 
way from earning another $200,000 for playing in 80 games. He will be paid 
$200,000 for playing in 80, 90, 100, 110, 120 and 130 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Winfield of the Minnesota Twins has one of the more interesting 
incentive contracts, based on home attendance. But it didn't do him any good. 
With a salary of $2.25 million, Winfield can earn another $100,000 based on the 
team's attendance if it draws 2.5 million and 2.7 million. However, the Twins, 
who have only drawn 1,398,565, would not have reached 2.5 million based on 
their average attendance of 23,704.

 Newswatch -- A Newswatch item Thursday did not fully explain why Assemblyman 
James E. Rogan (R-Glendale) was not commenting on a proposed bill that would 
have allowed youthful graffiti vandals to be whacked with a paddle. Rogan, who 
was not scheduled to testify in support of the bill, was in his district for a 
town hall meeting.
