 VIDEO GAMES: Are you ready to get interactive? Ready or not, GTE California 
plans to drop $41 million in the next 18 months to wire 83,000 Ventura County 
households with fiber-optic cable (D1). . . . In addition to better TV 
reception, an array of "interactive TV programming" is promised by the 
telephone company. GTE's Mike Crawford says TV viewers are evolving: Once glued 
to the tube as "passive watchers," they're becoming "interactive media 
participants." And, he said, they expect to get "movies, games, home banking 
and shopping, travel, investment and video phone services." 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE HAVENS: Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks continue to pop up as among the 
safest cities in the nation. . . . A Money magazine study showed that Simi 
Valley has the fourth lowest violent crime rate of cities of at least 100,000 
people. Thousand Oaks wound up 10th on the list. Researchers compiled the list 
of the 15 safest and most dangerous cities (B10) by crunching FBI stats on the 
violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. If you add 
"nonviolent" burglaries, theft, auto theft and arson, Simi Valley ranks No. 1 
and Thousand Oaks No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGH MILEAGE: Deborah Ricketts gives new meaning to cross-country running. The 
40-year-old Ventura athlete recently completed the equivalent of a 
coast-to-coast jaunt: 2,810 miles, to be exact. . . . The "Exercise Across 
America" challenge set down by the American Running and Fitness Assn. didn't 
require Ricketts to hit the highway. Instead, she said it helped motivate her 
to run an eight-mile loop on the Ojai Valley Trail every morning for about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 DROPPING OUT: More than 1,100 Ventura County students never made it to their 
high school graduation last year. Instead, they joined the millions of school 
dropouts across the nation (A3). . . . County public schools still have a 
better dropout rate than the state (B1), but the proportion of dropouts climbed 
a bit. Even the Oak Park Unified School District, which had a flawless record 
in 1992, lost two students last year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; $3 MILLION 
ASKED TO FUND THEATERS FOR ARTS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to capitalize on the success of the newly renovated Alex Theatre, 
Glendale city staff members have asked the Redevelopment Agency for $3 million 
to fund several theaters as anchors for a cultural arts district. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding request proposes spending $2.5 million to build a 300-seat 
playhouse for the Colony Studio Theatre and budgets $500,000 for renovation 
efforts and rent assistance for a local theater company, A Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, will consider the 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The theaters would join the 69-year-old Alex Theatre along the Brand Boulevard 
corridor as part of a theater district designed to attract businesses such as 
coffeehouses, bookstores and art galleries, said Jeanne Armstrong, 
Redevelopment Agency director.

BURIAL BENEFIT FOR RESERVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Another Perk for the Military, Forevermore," Column Left, May 17: 
</P>
<P>
 As Colman McCarthy sits comfortably in his home tonight, he would do well to 
thank the National Guard and Reserve personnel who have put their lives on the 
line so that he can do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazement. That was my reaction, and I suspect the reaction of most others who 
read McCarthy's column begrudging those who have served their country in 
uniform for 20 or more years a dignified burial in one of our 114 national 
cemeteries. Perhaps it was the heat of deadline that prompted him to rail 
against such a justifiable measure or perhaps it is because he is one of the 
misinformed who still believes reservists are nothing more than "weekend 
warriors." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the United States cannot go into any level of conflict 
without the National Guard and Reserves. They account for 44% of the Army's 
combat power (soon to be 54%) and 62% of the tactical airlift. 
</P>
<P>
 To call reservists' service "meaningless" is an affront to every person in 
uniform. Was it "meaningless" when the Reserves, as part of the total force, 
responded to Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf? Was it "meaningless" when 
they left behind their families to fight in the brutal climate of Korea, the 
jungles of Vietnam and in the Pacific and European theaters of World War II? Is 
it "meaningless" when they put their lives on hold to keep order and provide 
humanitarian aid during hurricanes, floods, riots and other national 
emergencies? 
</P>
<P>
 The new statute will result in less than 500 additional burials annually. What 
is important is that these reservists have earned the right to be laid to rest 
in a national cemetery.

 * It was disappointing to read McCarthy's complaints about the benefits given 
to military reservists. He seems to think that reserve duty is "easy." 
Apparently he has never seen a reservist inside a tank when the temperature is 
117 degrees (tanks, contrary to the popular myth, are not air-conditioned). 
Apparently he seems to think that what we do is "meaningless." Was our service 
"meaningless" when the reserves were needed in the Gulf War? Over the past 
several years California reservists and guardsmen were called up for floods, 
wildfires, riots and even sent to war. He claims that we see our service in the 
Guard and Reserves merely as an income supplement. I am asked to "donate" my 
time to the extent that I am paid for less than half the time I actually spend 
in uniform. Every time my unit has been mobilized I have had to contend with a 
reduced income, as my military pay is much lower than my civilian salary. In 
complaining about the burial benefits for reservists, McCarthy is ignoring the 
large numbers of reservists and guardsmen who are presently interred in the 
national cemeteries after dying in combat.

 * McCarthy's article is petty and small-minded. He not only exaggerates the 
extent of benefits afforded anyone in the armed forces but ignores the 
requisite level of sacrifice and commitment. With the 50th anniversary of D-day 
fast approaching, we should be looking for more ways to honor those few who 
were, and are, willing to give of themselves in the service of their country.

MEDI-CAL LIENS ON HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article on Medi-Cal tells the story of the often tragic consequence of 
the new federal and state laws on liens against the assets of nursing home 
residents (May 17). Most older persons entering nursing homes will eventually 
be covered by Medi-Cal because of the high cost and long-term nature of nursing 
home care. The impact of the lien law is particularly hard on widows and 
widowers who find themselves unable to sell their homes and buy more 
appropriate or affordable quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is not nearly as dark as it seems for families with both a 
husband and wife living when one enters a nursing home, if the family gets 
proper legal advice. The Medi-Cal lien and estate recovery laws are more a trap 
for the unwary than a serious interference with protection of the spouse 
remaining in the family home. 
</P>
<P>
 First, no lien may be placed on the family home during the lifetime of the 
person in the nursing home if his/her spouse is living there. Second, once 
Medi-Cal eligibility is established, the person in the nursing home can 
transfer the house to the spouse without affecting eligibility. Third, on the 
death of the spouse in a nursing home, the state cannot obtain a lien or 
recover the property if it was transferred to the spouse prior to the death of 
the nursing home resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar provisions in the law apply even where there is no spouse living in 
the family home. Liens may not be imposed and no claims may be made against the 
estate of a nursing home resident if his/her child is living in the home and is 
under age 21, or any age if the child is blind or substantially disabled. In 
addition, liens may not be imposed during the lifetime of the resident under 
certain other circumstances. If a lien is imposed, and the nursing home 
resident returns home, the lien is automatically dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to saving the family home is consulting a lawyer or advocate who is 
familiar with Medi-Cal laws and regulations. The time to get the advice is when 
the family member is entering a nursing home. Low-income individuals can obtain 
help from their local legal services program without charge.

 * What's wrong with homeowners whose medical bills are paid for by Medi-Cal 
having a lien put on the home which doesn't have to be paid until the surviving 
spouse passes away or sells the house? It seems to me that we've given up the 
idea that we should pay our own way. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is in the process of selling her house in order to have enough to 
pay her way to live in a retirement home. I feel that is a responsible course 
of action. As a taxpayer I hope that in the interest of fairness the policy of 
placing liens on homes to pay medical bills is not overturned.

 I put this question before you: Try to name another woman, past or present, 
who equals Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in dignity, class, grace, style or 
elegance. It is the combination that cannot be equaled.She was not the first to 
bear an unimaginable tragedy, but she was the first to bear it within the arena 
of a world stage, and we were better as a nation by her bearing. She brought 
dignity, honor and respect to us when we were floundering in the mires of 
horror. We will never be the same because she raised us up a few notches. She 
leaves with us her mark. Thank God.

 The death of the journalist, book editor, patron saint of American art and 
mother Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis requires acknowledgment that we have lost the 
best of her generation. She was more heroic than any Greek tragedy. In a style 
that was uniquely her own, she helped heal a nation long ago in the cold winds 
of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Her intelligence, grace and dignity under duress will not be seen again, or 
soon forgotten. Even in her leaving us, because we were always too selfish to 
let her be, she chose to overlook the springtime bouquet of her beloved Central 
Park; what style. 
</P>
<P>
 May God and the people of this nation bless her, for she has blessed us all by 
her too brief presence. We bid her farewell, rest and the peace that a nation 
could not grant her. We are truly sorry.

D-DAY ANNIVERSARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "50 Years Later, Normandy Gets Set for 2nd Wave," May 16: 
</P>
<P>
 Your article says, " . . . Tens of thousands of World War II veterans, joined

cemeteries of northern France on June 6 to remember D-day -- the bloody 
beginning of the end of World War II."  
</P>
<P>
 A gracious action would be for President Clinton to send as his emissary one 
of our former presidents -- Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter or George Bush -- all war 
veterans. But such gestures are uncommon among politicians of the "me

THE SERIOUS SEASON IS YET TO ARRIVE; WILSON'S MAY REVISIONS PLAY GAMES WITH THE 
STATE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Tis the election season and Gov. Pete Wilson is playing political games with 
the state budget. Wilson himself has tacitly recognized this in admitting that 
the May revisions of his proposed 1994-95 budget will have to be redone after 
the June 7 primary to reflect a "realistic assessment" of his expectation that 
the federal government will reimburse California $3.1 billion for immigration 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government should indeed reimburse California for much of the 
money the state spends on services for immigrants, and the governor is right to 
seek federal repayment for state education, health and incarceration costs for 
undocumented immigrants. However, White House officials maintain that Wilson is 
overstating the problem by inflating the number of illegal immigrants in 
California. They also emphasize it is Congress, rather than the Administration, 
that must be persuaded to support President Clinton's effort to help states 
deal with the problems of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the $3.1 billion -- a figure that Wilson first presented in 
January -- is just not in the cards, so there's no point in counting on it for 
the state budget.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a fine line between Wilson's legitimate bashing of Washington and 
socially divisive immigrant-bashing. He has crossed that line a few times, most 
recently in some of his reelection campaign's television commercials that seem 
to blame illegal immigrants for all of California's recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also embraced another politically charged issue in the budget. In 
issuing his May revisions last Friday, Wilson deleted the $26.4 million that 
had been designated for the new controversial state testing program known as 
the California Learning Assessment System. A small but vocal group of special 
interests has managed to exploit real but fixable problems in the testing and 
scoring procedures in an effort to turn those into a referendum on the new, 
academically rigorous tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says the money will be set aside until the Legislature can agree on a 
satisfactory bill to overhaul the test. By holding the tests hostage to 
funding, Wilson may appeal to noisy critics but he further undermines CLAS, 
which is designed to cultivate and measure critical thinking skills of 
children. Yes, fix the problems. But what CLAS needs is a tuneup -- not an 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost amid all the political posturing is what the legislative analyst's office 
calls the most important policy proposal in the Wilson budget: his plan to 
realign the state and county responsibilities and fiscal relationship. Wilson 
has proposed increasing county revenues by $3.2 billion in exchange for the 
counties assuming responsibilities for certain health and welfare programs and 
to provide greater county administrative flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to give counties a significant cost share in some programs they 
administer so that they will become more efficient and effective. However, 
there are big questions whether the proposal is as fiscally neutral as Wilson 
maintains -- that is, whether counties can handle such a realignment and what 
changes should be made by the Legislature to enact such a restructuring. This 
is a fundamentally important issue that merits serious further discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's May revisions traditionally kick off the first serious 
discussion of the budget in Sacramento. Sadly, not in this political year.

BROGDAN FOR L.A. COUNTY ASSESSOR; RETIRED VETERAN OF THE OFFICE HAS VOWED TO 
CURE THE PROBLEMS OF THE LYNCH AND HAHN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County assessor, a relatively obscure nonpartisan elected 
official, has an important function: He or she oversees what in terms of land 
value is the largest property-taxing jurisdiction in the nation. One of only 
three countywide offices (the sheriff and district attorney are the other two), 
the assessor has an annual budget of $85 million and a staff of almost 2,000 
that is responsible for determining property tax bills. The department 
identifies the ownership of all taxable property and establishes value for 
assessments and reassessments. It's a key function that provides a major chunk 
of county revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the assessor's office long has suffered from serious leadership and 
morale problems that cannot but affect the quality of work being done there. 
The petty backbiting that plagued the assessor's race, both this year and four 
years ago, is enough to give free elections a bad name.  
</P>
<P>
 Those problems are the main reasons The Times cannot endorse either the 
current assessor, Kenneth P. Hahn, or his leading rival, former Assessor John 
Lynch. There are 14 other candidates; it's a pathetic comment on this race that 
several have been accused of being Lynch stooges who ran in order to force Hahn 
into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Our choice for assessor is John Carl Brogdan, a now-retired veteran of the 
office who well understands its workings and the principles of leadership and 
organization. Brogdan has promised to return fairness and calmness so that 
staffers can get on with backlogged work. That alone would be a major feat, 
given recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, (no relation to former Supervisor Kenneth Hahn) came into office four 
years ago after the tumultuous term of Lynch, who had the reputation for having 
a volatile temper. Lynch threw county auditors out of his office and was 
accused of assaulting an employee, a charge he denied. Hahn came into office 
largely by way of having a name nearly identical to one of the county's most 
popular politicians ever. While Hahn can rightly claim he made some 
improvements in the office, he has shown poor judgment that led to him being 
embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Lynch; Hahn now admits that after the last 
election, he sent a series of unsigned notes to Lynch that prompted the former 
assessor to claim harassment. Although Hahn appropriately questions the 
political timing of Lynch's lawsuit, he also acknowledges that his sophomoric 
actions hardly command respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogdan has been out of the assessor's office for two years, but that could 
turn out to be an asset. He does need to demonstrate that he has the energy to 
go back to work and do the job that needs doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the one thing on which 14 assessor candidates can agree is that 
there should be no continuation of the Lynch-Hahn years. The Times endorses 
John Carl Brogdan.

COMEBACK TEAM OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's safe to say that no American softball team faced more adversity this past 
season than the team at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus was in disarray after the January earthquake, having sustained 
perhaps more damage from a natural disaster than any other university in U.S. 
history.That meant the already difficult work of mixing athletic road trips and 
studying became considerably more difficult. One example was that students had 
to ride shuttles to libraries at UCLA because the CSUN facility was too damaged 
to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 There was emotional trauma, too. Pitcher Amy Windmiller and teammate Shannon 
Jones, who lived at the Northridge Meadows apartment complex, barely escaped 
with their lives when the building collapsed, killing 16 occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 So, given all this, there's no way this team is going to match the previous 
year's dream season, in which it was nationally ranked and earned a spot in the 
college World Series, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. These women are tough, not to mention intimidating, aggressive and 
gritty, as sports writers have said all season long. One of their top players, 
Tamara Ivie, wears a tattoo of the TV cartoon character Bam Bam. And Windmiller 
and Jones are having the season of their lives. Jones had never hit better than 
.232 before this year; this season, she's hitting .395. Windmiller has 24 wins 
against just two losses and an earned-run average that you would need a 
microscope to find. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Matadors will again find themselves competing in the college 
World Series. They are ranked third in the nation, with a record of 49 wins and 
eight losses. They are giving their quake-ravaged campus something to cheer 
about, and the rest of us a lesson in how strongly folks can recover from 
harrowing times.

ARAFAT'S SKILL AS A CRAFTY FOX IS INADEQUATE TO THE TASKS OF NATIONHOOD; 
PALESTINIANS: THEIR DREAM NEEDS A MANDELA, NOT A CASTRO, IF IT IS TO SURVIVE 
ITS EMBRYONIC STATE OF ACCEPTANCE BY ISRAEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By EFRAIM KARSH, Efraim Karsh is director of the Mediterranean Studies Program 
at King's College, University of London.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat has done it again. Just as the PLO was taking control over 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip from the withdrawing Israeli army, he urged, in a 
closed meeting in Johannesburg's Great Mosque, a jihad, a "holy war," for the 
liberation of Jerusalem. Although he later asserted that the "holy war" he had 
in mind was a peaceful one, the damage was done.  
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's propensity for shooting himself in the foot -- the jihad remark 
coming on the heels of his last-minute refusal to sign the self-rule agreement 
in Cairo; his siding with Saddam Hussein during the Kuwait crisis -- casts 
serious doubts on whether he is the right person in the right place at the 
right time in Palestinian national history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragically for Arafat, his vast popularity among Palestinians (at least until 
recently) has never been matched by real power. His authority has been 
consistently challenged by extremist elements, most notably the Hamas militant 
religious movement, which has come to represent roughly half of the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories; moreover, his grasp over the 
Palestine Liberation Organization itself has been far from complete. Having to 
tread a thin line among rival Palestinian factions has forced him to play the 
fox rather than the lion, manipulating and cajoling, pitting friend and foe 
against one another, seeking the lowest common denominator.  
</P>
<P>
 While these traits may have been useful, perhaps indispensable for keeping the 
PLO intact during its dark moments, they may prove counterproductive at this 
stage in Palestinian history. What is needed now is a leader who will make 
difficult and responsible decisions, even at the risk of temporary 
unpopularity, not an arch-manipulator tuning his antennae to the loudest noise; 
what is now needed is a down-to-earth leader who will not shun the less than 
glamorous aspects of nation- and state-building, rather than a high-profile 
jet-setter: a Nelson Mandela rather than a Fidel Castro, a healer and 
bridge-builder rather than a captive of anachronistic revolutionary 
exultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Arafat can make this transformation is highly questionable. When a 
deranged Jewish settler killed Muslims at prayer in Hebron in February, Arafat 
quickly bowed to Palestinian popular rage and pulled out of the peace talks, 
despite the general indignation in Israel over the atrocity and the condolences 
and apologies of the Israeli government. Conversely, when Hamas carried out 
gruesome massacres of Israelis in Afula and Hadera, Arafat offered no 
unequivocal condemnation of these acts, in violation of his signed agreement 
with the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
 That Arafat is sensitive to the Palestinians' popular mood is understandable; 
they are after all his constituency, and their well-being is his 
responsibility. What is not excusable is his catering to public whim. For all 
their horrendousness, the Hebron, Afula and Hadera massacres vindicate the 
historic choice made by Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin; if 
anything, they prove the indispensability of peace and the hopelessness in the 
perpetuation of the conflict. Flinching in the face of obstacles that are bound 
to litter the road to reconciliation between Arabs and Jews is an assured 
recipe for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Arafat's complete insensitivity to Israeli public opinion likely to 
benefit his own people. He may score short-term points among them, but it is 
only Israel that can deliver the territories. If the Israeli public remains 
unconvinced of Arafat's trustworthiness, no government will be able to deliver 
the painful concessions needed for the sake of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, this reality seems to have escaped Arafat. Unversed in the ways 
of democratic government, and mindless of the Israeli ethos, having demonized 
it through decades of bitter struggle, he seems not to have missed a single 
opportunity to alienate the Israeli public. Whatever he hoped to achieve by the 
bizarre episode in Cairo on May 4, 70% of Israelis polled the following day 
expressed severe doubts regarding the viability of peace with Arafat.  
</P>
<P>
 To everything there is a season. Certain leaders fulfill distinct functions at 
specific moments in their nations' history. Winston Churchill was indispensable 
as a wartime leader, only to be rejected by the British electorate once the war 
was over. Chaim Weizmann was instrumental in laying the foundations of the 
Zionist movement but was reduced to playing second-fiddle by David Ben-Gurion, 
who, in turn, would lose the national leadership, despite his centrality in the 
establishment of the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could apply to Yasser Arafat. He has been instrumental in inducing 
the mainstream PLO to disavow its commitment to the destruction of Israel, 
bringing his people closer than ever to the realization of the national 
aspirations -- if alongside rather than in place of the state of Israel. In 
this he has fulfilled a historic function in the life of the Palestinian 
people. Yet he may not be the most suitable person to carry this endeavor to 
its natural conclusion. This daunting task will probably be better shouldered 
by a new and more realistic generation of Palestinians, unburdened by vainglory 
and old thinking and better acquainted with both the daily needs of ordinary 
Palestinians and the intricacies of the Israeli democratic system. Arafat can 
then take the back seat as the grand old man of the evolving Palestinian 
statehood, a national figure outside and above the political squabbles. 
Remaining in the driver's seat for too long can only end up in an accident.

PLATFORM; EVOLVING DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip J. Cunningham, WEI JINGSHENG, one of China's most prominent 
dissidents, was released in 1993 after serving 14 1/2 years of a 15-year 
sentence for his activities during the 1977-79 Democracy Wall period. He 
commented on the democracy movement in his country today in an interview this 
spring in Beijing with writer Philip J. Cunningham. The following is an excerpt 
from that interview: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tian An Men was a democratic movement. The new democratic tide started from 
the Democracy Wall period of 1979; at that time it was only in the education 
and awareness stage. . . But only 10 years later, in 1989, nearly everyone 
acknowledged that more democracy was needed.That is progress . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Confucianism creates an undemocratic society based on obedience, but the 
system is only superficially stable. If people cannot express ideas, vent 
dissatisfaction, then you have a basically unstable system that cannot correct 
itself. Democracy is geared to involve more people, it is suited to human 
nature.  
</P>
<P>
 The one thing we don't need is another dynasty. Democracy is a path; it is not 
based on grabbing power, but must develop gradually. Even people from the 
Chinese Communist Party will provide key support; we have to coexist with 
different ideas. The actual structure of the system may not resemble the 
structure of a Western democracy, but the underlying principles will be the 
same . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chinese government makes a big improvement in the human-rights 
situation, then continuing (most-favored-nation status) is appropriate. But if 
big improvement is not made, MFN should not be continued. In all likelihood, if 
the communists get MFN in hand, they will turn around and start to arrest the 
activists, their so-called enemies. Under these circumstances, China should not 
get MFN, even though denial will cause hardship for the Chinese people. If the 
people are not guaranteed basic human rights, then the loss is even greater . .

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; THE PATH TO OZ IS PAVED BY BUSINESS; THERE'LL BE NO 
RETURN TO GLORY UNLESS LEADERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PITCH IN TO CREATE 
OPPORTUNITY AND JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LODWRICK M. COOK, Lodwrick M. Cook is chairman and chief executive officer 
of ARCO and chairman of RLA. The telephone number for the Los Angeles schools 
partnerships office is (213) 625-6989. Elsewhere, call the school-district 
administrative headquarters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something about California, the beauty of its weather, perhaps, or the majesty 
of its scenery, seems to encourage delusionary thinking: If we put on our ruby 
slippers, close our eyes and wish hard, we will find ourselves restored to the 
Oz that the Golden State has always invoked -- serene, happy and sunny. 
</P>
<P>
 California, indeed, has much to offer -- climatic advantages, deep-water 
ports, highly skilled workers, world-famed technology centers and a lifestyle 
that is envied everywhere. And I have to include, of course, the wide range of 
business opportunities that have drawn so many commercial enterprises to the 
state, including my own. Like other transplants from the East, ARCO has 
reinvented itself as a California company in its 22 years in Los Angeles and we 
wouldn't dream of being anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 But California today, especially Los Angeles, is quite a different place than 
the one that greeted us in 1972. Blighted areas are grimmer, more frightening, 
more hopeless. The schools seem increasingly overwhelmed by the challenges they 
face. Once, California seemed so rich that it hardly mattered if business came. 
Those days are over. But what is especially troubling is that our response to 
these problems has been so uncertain and ineffective. Are we willing to fight 
for California's future, or do we go on deluding ourselves that if we turn our 
back on the problems, they will cure themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 The most damaging delusion is the idea that those of us who are leaders, 
particularly in business, can afford to avert our eyes while the problems that 
plague the state are dealt with by government. The truth is that government in 
this state is hard-pressed to maintain the status quo, let alone effectively 
address tasks as complex as restructuring our schools and reviving the 
riot-scarred areas of our cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and city have important responsibilities in both areas, of course, 
but I am convinced that their efforts will bear generous fruit only if the 
community in all its facets is strongly committed to getting the job done, and 
actually involved on a daily basis. In the area of school restructuring, I find 
encouraging evidence of such community involvement. LEARN -- the Los Angeles 
Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now -- is a mix of all the leadership 
elements of this huge, complicated, multicultural region. And while much 
remains to be done, LEARN has at least begun to arrest the slide of the Los 
Angeles public schools and powerfully reassert the neglected interests of our 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN is an important beginning but only one step. My advice to business is to 
stop complaining about the school system -- I've done my share -- and instead 
work at becoming its daily partner in developing the youngsters who will be our 
employees and our leaders. Join the LEARN effort, adopt a school, get involved. 
Call the partnerships office at the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
They'll get you started. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more than in the schools, our commitment to California's future will 
be tested by our willingness to take aggressive action in support of our inner 
cities. If we continue to shun them, they will not go away or miraculously 
improve; they will only get worse -- more threatening, more desperate. One of a 
number of programs designed to ameliorate the problem came into existence 
shortly after the L.A. riots two years ago. It's RLA -- Rebuild Los Angeles. 
The results have not been all that we'd hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 When I volunteered to chair RLA, many people wondered why. The answer isn't 
that I have a precise formula for making it work. I don't. But I know that it 
won't have a chance without someone who is willing to overcome his or her 
reluctance and take the first step toward a better future for that part of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why not me? And why not you? Since becoming RLA chairman, I have come to 
realize that the most desperate shortage we face in trying to rebuild the riot 
areas of Los Angeles isn't money or skilled personnel or computers -- it's 
interest. The TV coverage of the riots frightened the people of Los Angeles, 
both inside and outside the affected areas of the city. Two years later, the 
insiders are left with their problems and the others are trying to forget about 
the whole thing -- while praying that it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to do is add a little sweat to our prayers. Invest in minority 
equity funds and financial institutions. Increase minority employment, 
recognizing that multiculturalism can be an opportunity rather than an 
obstacle. Spend more on minority vendors. Seek opportunities to make 
investments that will produce jobs in economically depressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, as we say in business, is very clear: We must build the 
future of California together, or we're never going back to Oz again.

HERE IS POSSIBLE FROM THERE; REMEMBERING HER ORIGINS HAS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE 
FOR A TEEN-AGE MOTHER WHO MADE IT, AGAINST THE ODDS.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYDIA A. NAYO, Lydia A. Nayo is an associate professor at Loyola Law School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I get the calls a couple of times each year. A local public junior high school 
counselor, usually from a school boasting a "mostly minority" student 
population, will ask me to speak at Career Day. Unless my schedule is 
unyielding, I cannot resist the invitation. I am a Role Model, capitalized: an 
African American woman with an advanced degree who does work that many of the 
audience members have fantasized about. I may be the first person of color some 
of the kids have seen who does the work that I do. I may be the first real-life 
lawyer some have ever seen. Having been there, I cannot resist going back. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that I have been invited because I represent possibility. My 
information kit usually directs me to tell the students something about the 
education I needed to become a law school professor. I am to impress them with 
the hard work it will take to get from where they are to where I am. They are 
at a crossroads, I am told, having to decide what to do about the rest of their 
secondary education in order to realize a dream or two. Some of them are 
considering whether to continue their education at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Santa Monica YWCA Career Day was at the John Adams Middle 
School. The students were restless, wearing on the patience of their teachers 
and vice principal. The other panelists were a professional beach-volleyball 
player, a recreation supervisor and an intimidating karate instructor with the 
fourth-degree black belt. As befits our host, the panel was all female. 
</P>
<P>
 As I gathered my notes, I realized why I make the time to attend career days: 
It is a grounding exercise. I do not want to forget that my present self is the 
sum of my life. As much as career days give me a chance to represent 
possibility to young African Americans, I also get to remind myself, "Here is 
very much possible from there." I once was, in the language of social science, 
an economically disadvantaged, single teen mother. Statistically, I should not 
be a law-school professor, nor should my daughter be an only child or a college 
graduate. These facts are vital elements of my discussion, because the risk 
exists that some members of the audience are or will become single teen 
parents. There is an equal likelihood that there are many economically 
disadvantaged children at the school at which I am speaking.  
</P>
<P>
 I tell them about my origins and my early parenthood, not merely as cautionary 
tale, but also as an offering of hope. It is as important to me to include 
unplanned parenthood in my presentation as it is to point out how I got into 
college, what my grades were like or the route I took from law student to law 
professor. It is part of my objective of presenting possibility to these 
students: You can have a life after early, unexpected parenthood. It will not 
be an easy life, but it can be productive and fulfilling. There are innumerable 
sources willing to suggest to them that they will fail in life. I like offering 
the possibility that they will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't sugarcoat the teen parenting experience: Once I became a parent, I 
gave up dating as it is traditionally perceived and deferred a college 
education in favor of full-time employment until my daughter was 8 and able (if 
not particularly willing) to accept an explanation for our changed economic 
circumstances. I tell the students that my daughter and I grew up together, 
that I was attending to the needs of a child while just out of my own 
childhood. And I always identify the life choices I made that were directed by 
the promise I made to myself that my child's life would be better -- filled 
with more options and possibilities -- than mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do I forget to tick off the positives: Having a daughter gave me great joy 
and purpose. I discovered that, to persuade this child that she could do 
anything or be whatever she wanted, I had to live my life in a way that 
affirmed that. It was not enough simply to tell her that the world was her 
oyster if I, her primary role model, did not do what I wanted. She was a 
powerful catalyst, propelling me through college and graduate school, keeping 
me from remaining in a job that bored me. And, my daughter has always been my 
most ardent fan and strongest supporter.  
</P>
<P>
 She even helped me get through law school. She gave me a life-saving study 
tip: When studying for long periods, take a two- to five-minute break every 
hour. During this short break, wash your face, make a doctor's appointment, 
prepare lunch, check the mail, check airline ticket prices to Tahiti. Whatever 
you do, she advised me, get out of the chair in which you are studying and move 
your brain to something else. As promised, I came back from my breaks 
refreshed, ready for work. I continue to pass this hint on. (It works for 
bar-exam preparation as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is with wonder that I tell students that life is change and growth, and 
what seems like a mistake can become an opportunity. I remember how my high 
school guidance counselor responded to my pregnancy. She suggested that I 
withdraw from my college-preparatory public school for gifted and talented 
girls and enroll in vocational school, where I could "learn a trade and maybe 
find a husband and father" for me and my child. I ignored her and graduated 
with my class; my mother brought my daughter to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, surprised silence greets my reference to my teen pregnancy. 
Usually, the students are more interested in my annual income, whether I go to 
court, whether there is a test you have to take to get into law school. Once a 
student asked if law-school professors are "real lawyers."  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the other times. For instance, in Santa Monica, a student asked 
my favorite career-day question: What is my daughter doing now? 
</P>
<P>
 She's living in Philadelphia, finishing her MBA, working in mortgage banking. 
She is planning a July wedding. We are friends, she calls four times a week, 
she is happy. These are the most affirming facts of all.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For purely food-related reasons, I have recently come to regret the end of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing personal against the fall of communism, but life was so much less 
complicated when all we had to worry about was the destruction of the Earth by 
a misplaced finger on a nuclear trigger. Sure, there was the occasional 15-part 
New Yorker series on the dangers of living under high-power lines, but who had 
time to read those things? 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer clusters? 
</P>
<P>
 Ebola virus? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, too busy worrying about a nuclear holocaust to think about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to the absence of an external bogey man -- bogey person, I should 
say -- upon which to fixate, we have to face all kinds of unpleasant new 
threats, all coming from within our borders, all invisible to the naked eye, 
all having to do with our food and water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientifically speaking, icky things that can make you sick have replaced 
communism as the biggest threat to the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week we were treated to a number of news stories coinciding with the 
first anniversary of the Minneapolis cryptosporidium outbreak. The bacterium 
invaded that city's water supply around this time last year, causing severe 
gastrointestinal illness and more than 100 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been awful. Imagine former President George Bush at a Japanese 
banquet. Imagine half a city acting like that. Imagine having to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, during an hour devoted to pesticides in the food supply, last week's "48 
Hours" featured a segment on four Midwestern families. The families shopped at 
their regular markets for produce, then handed over their apples and lettuce 
and broccoli to the producers, who sent the stuff off to chemists for analysis. 
Most of the samples tested positive for pesticides, leading one of the moms to 
weep on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news just gets worse: Washing fruits and vegetables doesn't 
necessarily make them clean because pesticides are not water soluble. And 
waxing -- a common practice among purveyors of produce -- not only keeps fruit 
and vegetables fresh, but may keep them coated with pesticides too. 
</P>
<P>
 The show featured the obligatory back and forth between the experts: One said 
even a little pesticide residue is too much, the other said allowable levels 
are too small to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 You would dearly love to believe the second guy, but as one of the stricken 
moms so rightly pointed out: They used to say smoking was OK too. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched, all I could picture were great big gobs of greasy grimy 
pesticide residues on the juicy strawberries my child has been inhaling by the 
pint. 
</P>
<P>
 How do we know that children who ingest a cornucopia of pesticide today will 
not sprout horns tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 The only solution seems to be to buy organic produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, Birkenstocks remain optional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, the Times' Food section ran a frightening and clear-eyed 
story about the myriad dangers in our presumably safe food supply. Hot dogs, 
chicken, eggs, oysters, fish, milk, cantaloupe, soft cheeses -- you name it. 
Potential bacterial bombs, just waiting to explode in your child's delicate 
intestines. 
</P>
<P>
 What stood out for me -- and haunts me to this day -- was a passage about 
hamburger meat: "Other nations, with wildly different degrees of sanitation, 
are also playing a greater role in the American food supply. . . . Even today, 
for instance, a single hamburger patty may contain meat from hundreds of 
animals raised in different countries under varying degrees of regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 And even as the government and some food producers are unable to uphold 
stringent hygiene standards, Food and Drug Administration officials announced 
last week that they had approved for sale a genetically engineered tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato, "designed" by Calgene Inc. of Davis, Calif., will be marketed 
under the MacGregor label and might be in stores as early as next week. Its 
altered genetic structure will enable the tomato to ripen on the vine and stay 
fresher longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a tomato whose genes have been tampered with (besides the 
temptation to make lousy sexist jokes) does indeed have a certain allure. I 
almost had decided to give one a try until I heard what FDA Commissioner David 
Kessler had to say about it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Foods produced by genetic engineering are as safe as food in our grocery 
stores today." 
</P>
<P>
 And to think I was so worried about nuclear destruction.

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; NEW YORK ENACTS TOUGH BREAST-FEEDING PROTECTIONS

 It's a crime to try to prevent a mother from breast-feeding in public under a 
civil rights measure signed last week that gives New York the toughest such law 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows nursing in malls, restaurants and other public places, even if 
the breast and nipple are exposed. The measure imposes fines up to $5,000 or 
prison sentences up to five years for anyone who illegally prevents 
breast-feeding in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The law gives nursing mothers the strongest protection in the country, said 
Elizabeth Baldwin, a lawyer with the La Leche League, a group that promotes 
breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if anyone bothers us, we can say, 'Listen, we are protected by law here. 
. . . You have no right to infringe on what's happening between me and my 
child,' " said Liza Habiby, who added that she was ordered out of a mall in 
suburban Albany last year for breast-feeding. Take Your Love Out to the 
Ballgame -- and Propose? 
</P>
<P>
 Agrowing number of romantics are eschewing candelight-dinner marriage 
proposals in favor of giant electronic messages at big-league baseball games. 
At least 11 of the 28 teams -- but not the Dodgers or the Angels -- offer the 
service, most charging a fee that is donated to charity. Nearly 70 couples got 
engaged at Yankee Stadium last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams limit use of their message boards to birthday, anniversary and 
public-service announcements, reserving remaining time for sponsors. But the 
Cincinnati Reds prohibit video-screen proposals on principle. "It's the 
philosophy of the club that a commitment of that type is a very personal and 
romantic thing and should not be trivialized by some kind of public display," 
said Chip Baker, the club's director of marketing. "It should be a thoughtful, 
romantic expression." Higher-Paid Women Get More Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Highly compensated female workers are more likely to receive family-related 
benefits than their lower-paid counterparts, a new paper by Nancy Saltford of 
Cornell University concludes.  
</P>
<P>
 The research shows that women who receive family-related benefits are usually 
professionals who earn more than $35,000 per year. The fewest family benefits 
went to women earning less than $10,000 per year. Saltford also found that 
college-educated women were three times as likely to be offered benefits as 
those with less than a high school diploma.

 "He's a professional charmer," said Bernardo Bertolucci, smiling down at 
9-year-old Raju Lal, resplendent in his jeans, denim jacket and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he liked "Little Buddha," the little actor had just flashed a high 
sign, grinned and enthused "Fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
 Raju, who plays one of the young candidates for Lama Dorje in Bertolucci's new 
movie, was the scene-stealer at the reception Monday following the screening of 
the Miramax release at the Avco Cinema in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounding up the stairs to the balcony level of the Armand Hammer Museum, Raju 
and the equally exuberant Alex Wiesendanger, 11, who stars as the possible 
reincarnation of the Tibetan lama, brought some much-needed vitality to the 
low-key party. 
</P>
<P>
 Keanu Reeves, who portrays Prince Siddhartha/Buddha, was a no-show. And 
although there were some star faces -- including Dennis Hopper, George Hamilton 
and Carrie Fisher -- at the screening, the crowd that drifted across the road 
to the museum to check out the eats seemed mainly the usual lean and 
hungry-to-be-with-it Hollywood backdrop group, dressed in their best-of-Barneys 
shades of beige, sand and black. 
</P>
<P>
 The film may glorify the beauty of burgundy and gold, the primary colors of 
the Bhutan monastery where much of the film is set, but Hollywood's sense of 
aesthetic is much more sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making this film was a great voyage," said producer Jeremy Thomas, clutching 
a folded Tibetan flag and a kata, the traditional shawl of blessing, which had 
been given to him by a lama who was pleased by the film's focus on Tibetan 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 European-style kissing on both cheeks generated some warmth at the party but, 
with the balcony open to the cold air and the food just minimal hors d'oeuvres, 
no one was going to stick around for long once the basic pleasantries were 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to a Chinese restaurant," Alex said. The young star, nattily 
dressed in a New Yorker-style blue blazer and crimson tie, interrupted his 
wrestling and teasing with Raju for a moment to politely ask Bertolucci what 
film the Italian director was going to work on next. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that it would be another co-production with Thomas, who also collaborated 
with Bertolucci on the Oscar-winning "The Last Emperor," Alex exclaimed: "Jeez, 
these people never stop. They're like the Energizer bunny, they keep going and 
going and going!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he and Lal bounded away again, personifying excitement in a crowd that 
was playing it cool.

BOOK REVIEW / POLITICS; A VISIONARY APPEAL FOR A COMMITMENT TO RACE REFORMS; 
CIVIL RIGHTS AND WRONGS: A MEMOIR OF RACE AND POLITICS, 1944-1994 BY HARRY S. 
ASHMORE ; PANTHEON, $25, 442 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fires of Watts in 1965, like those of South-Central in 1992, were the 
beacon of a certain painful but insistent truth: Crime in the streets of 
America is merely the symptom of a much deeper social and economic malaise that 
we ignore at our own terrible risk. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed to cure the ailment, argues Harry S. Ashmore in "Civil Rights 
and Wrongs," is "a firm commitment to massive social reform," a commitment 
articulated and embraced long ago by a nation that had declared a "war on 
poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 "A generation later, the commitment still has not been carried through," warns 
Ashmore in a memoir that amounts to a spirited appeal to the American 
conscience. "The steady escalation of violent crime has demonstrated the 
futility of relying on the criminal justice system, backed up by the military, 
to maintain a tolerable degree of domestic tranquillity." 
</P>
<P>
 It's telling that Ashmore invokes the solemn phrasings of the Constitution in 
his prose. He's a stalwart of American democracy, a goad to the American 
conscience, an intellectual from the Deep South who spoke out for civil 
liberties as an author and editor at a time and place where men and women were 
paying with their lives for their commitment to social progress. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the credentials that Ashmore brings to bear on "Civil Rights and 
Wrongs," a survey of the politics of race in America over the last 
half-century. Ashmore styles his book as a memoir, but it is really a work of 
political history. The author gives us a closely measured assessment of the 
civil rights commitment (or lack of it) of figures ranging from Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, from Booker T. Washington to Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, I wished that Ashmore were chattier and more forthcoming in his 
storytelling, but he is so intent on calling our attention to the ills and 
dangers of race relations in America over the last half-century that he does 
not find much room in 400-plus pages to kick back and tell some war stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Ashmore has some good tales to tell. Born in South Carolina, he was a 
combat officer in World War II, a Pulitzer-winning newspaperman, the editor in 
chief of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the leading light of the Center for 
the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal think-tank in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then, though, he tantalizes us with a memorable moment from a life of 
commitment and engagement. When Jimmy Carter was pilloried for confessing to 
lust in his heart in a Playboy interview, it was the Rev. Martin Luther King 
Sr. who vouched for his morality to the Southern electorate. "They can't kill 
you for looking," the elder Rev. King insisted. "Old as I am, they still look 
good." Ashmore points out how effective the endorsement turned out to be "at an 
interracial peanut roast in an Atlanta park in the year of Our Lord 1976." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, who still lives in Santa Barbara, is an insider in California 
politics too. He recalls, for instance, a visit to Jesse Jackson in a poor 
black neighborhood near USC. When Ashmore arrived, he found Jackson stretched 
out on a bed, tutoring an attentive Jerry Brown in the art of presidential 
politics: "What you've got to do to attract the black vote is get identified 
with Africa," Jackson intoned -- and Brown, accompanied by Linda Ronstadt, 
promptly embarked on a well-publicized jaunt to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore is not afraid to acknowledge that there have been a good many false 
starts and barriers on the road to equality. He demonstrates, for example, that 
the Democratic Party was thrust into the vanguard of civil rights advocacy 
despite its historical and political roots, not because of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ashmore refuses to admit that the problem of race in America is 
hopeless or intractable, and he closes his book on a visionary note. "The task 
of redemption remains unfinished," he observes, but he is encouraged by the 
latest Democratic President to undertake the task: "Bill Clinton came before 
the American people as a healer, committed to bringing together a divided 
nation," Ashmore writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a politician in a poor Southern state, Clinton had also recognized the end 
of racial discrimination as a pragmatic necessity -- not only to meet the 
pressure exerted by newly enfranchised blacks, but also to free whites of the 
crippling legacy from the racist past." 
</P>
<P>
 The closing passages of Ashmore's book -- so spirited and so full of promise 
-- are the true mark of the classic American liberal, an endangered species 
whose moments of glory and doubt are well described in "Civil Rights and 
Wrongs." And, we come to understand, Ashmore represents exactly the kind of 
Americanism that is essential for the success of a democracy.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'BUDDHA': TERMINAL BLISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the editor of Tricycle, the Buddhist Review, one of the few journalists 
allowed on the set of "Little Buddha," the new Bernardo Bertolucci film, wrote 
about her experience, one question continued to trouble her. What was the word 
Little doing in the title? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the filmmakers, it turned out, could give her a satisfactory answer, 
but now that the picture itself is here, the reason seems obvious. Despite its 
illustrious pedigree, "Little Buddha" turns out to have the sensibility of a 
children's film, the most elaborate and expensive "Afterschool Special" ever to 
make it to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a children's film, of course, is not necessarily a negative thing, and 
aspects of "Little Buddha" do linger pleasantly in the memory. But what lingers 
as well is the suspicion that this is a children's film at least partly by 
default, the product of too much goofy New Age reverence and too little nuance 
and sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who remember such Bertolucci films as "The Conformist" and "Last Tango 
in Paris" may be surprised at this turn in his career, but those pictures are 
deep in the director's past. More recently we've seen the likes of "The Last 
Emperor," which, its many Oscars notwithstanding, is best remembered for how 
everything looked, not for what anyone said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, especially when, as here, Bertolucci collaborates with Vittorio 
Storaro, one of the world's preeminent cinematographers, the director has a 
tendency to become a prisoner of his own particular gift for luscious images, 
to assume that the dramatic side of things will more or less take care of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Story, however, can be neglected only at great risk, especially when two 
parallel tales are being told. The first begins in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery 
in modern-day Bhutan, where Lama Norbu (Chinese actor Ying Ruocheng) gets a 
telegram he's been waiting for for nine years, a message that soon puts him on 
a jet headed for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Though all Buddhists believe in reincarnation, only Tibetan Buddhists believe 
that specific people, invariably great teachers, can be identified in their 
next incarnation. And Lama Norbu has reason to believe that his own teacher, 
admittedly a man with a hell of a sense of humor, has been reincarnated as an 
8-year-old American named Jesse Konrad (newcomer Alex Wiesendanger). 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly nonplussed by this news are Jesse's parents, Lisa (Bridget 
Fonda) and Dean (singer Chris Isaak), a sprightly young couple who don't quite 
know what to make of all these robed and shaven monks appearing suddenly in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They don't object, however, when Lama Norbu gives Jesse a child's life of the 
Buddha. This little book forms the basis of "Little Buddha's" second narrative 
strand, a film-within-a-film set in Asia 2,500 years ago that details how the 
fun-loving Prince Siddhartha transformed himself into a great spiritual being. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it plays at times like an infomercial on Eastern religions, this half 
of "Little Buddha" is the most successful. For one thing, this is where 
Storaro's photography and James Acheson's production and costume design are at 
their best, making good use of the never-before-seen streets of Bhutan and 
creating opulent set pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And though eyebrows and even entire faces were raised when it was announced 
that Keanu Reeves was going to play Siddhartha, in fact, he does what the part 
calls for as the golden youth shielded from misery and death who takes the path 
to enlightenment. Hewing closely to traditional texts, this part of "Little 
Buddha" comes off closest to the fable quality the filmmakers were apparently 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern half, however, the lack of texture that is the film's weakest 
link is most evident. The Mark Peploe and Rudy Wurlitzer plot, from a story by 
the director, seems determined to take the drama out of every situation, while 
the accompanying dialogue is invariably hollow and unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Being blissed out may be an enviable state for a human being, but it is not 
necessary the best one for a film. 
</P>
<P>

brief shots of a leper and a holy man with a weight hanging from his tongue.

TV REVIEWS; MTV'S 'GANGSTA RAP' AN OBJECTIVE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is gangsta rap, with all its violence and alleged sexism, merely a form of 
modern reportage -- a newspaper of the street, as its proponents typically 
proclaim -- or advocacy journalism of a particularly cynical and odious sort? 
That's the age-old (or 5-years-or-so-old, anyway) question that recurs 
throughout MTV's "Gangsta Rap" special, premiering tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening crawl for this MTV News-produced half hour warns that the show 
"contains violent imagery and excerpts of some videos that are not shown on 
MTV."Indeed, non-fans who carp about MTV's lax standards and practices may be 
shocked to learn how many gun-toting, pro-payback anthems the web turns down 
that do show up on The Box and other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the bias you'd expect toward the youthful audience, MTV News once again 
does a surprisingly good job of objectively framing a moral debate, allowing 
defenders and detractors a reasonable voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hip-hop historian" Bill Stephney boils down much of the prevailing message to 
this: "Nobody cares about me, so why should I care about anyone else?" The 
result is a virus-like rage that turns fascinatingly visceral -- and, 
ironically, of course, crosses cultures -- in the right creative hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, the result may just be heightened capitalism, in the case of brilliant 
producer Dr. Dre, who eschews "gangsta" labels or politics and admits, "I'm 
here to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of Dre's contemporaries consider their work in nobler terms. 
"Whatever I wrote was honest ," says Tupac Shakur, boiling down his defense of 
some admittedly negative themes. He may be right, but that attitude begs 
another unasked question -- whether "honesty," celebrated in the absence of all 
other ideals, is really as platonic a virtue in isolation as the rappers might 
hope.

TV REVIEWS; SOBERING MONTAGE HITS HOME IN 'D-DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No flags wave in Charles Guggenheim's film, "D-Day," for PBS' "The American 
Experience." No crowds cheer, no bands erupt with jaunty marching songs.No 
eyewitnesses boast about their exploits during the unprecedented Allied armada 
that invaded Nazi-held France on June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission seemed to have been carried out with a gloomy determination, which 
in a kind of filmmaking miracle, Guggenheim precisely conveys in this spare, 
minimalist, deliberately unromantic film on D-day's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a sobering hold this potentially suicidal mass invasion has on the 
collective historical memory. Even when Hollywood tried to pump up D-day into a 
John Wayne-style Crusades with "The Longest Day," it was shot in black and 
white. A big reason is the extraordinary vault of gritty, cinema-verite-type 
military-made footage shot at the scene, which Guggenheim assembles into a 
narrative with astonishing skill. 
</P>
<P>
 He has done something more: Running alongside often beautifully composed and 
preserved images is a sound montage of servicemen's recollections. It makes for 
a resounding TV time machine, for while we see what was there, we hear what was 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The American Experience: D-Day" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

TV RATINGS; SEASON FINALES ARE THE WEEK'S BIG DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Season-ending episodes brought larger than usual audiences to several TV 
dramas last week. But the opening installment of CBS' movie about the Menendez 
murders did not share in the windfall, A. C. Nielsen data showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "NYPD Blue" did best among the dramas, placing No. 5 among the week's 78 
prime-time network programs with an audience of about 15.7 million homes. "L.A. 
Law," completing its eight-season run on NBC, tied for No. 7 with ABC's "Home 
Improvement." And Fox's "Melrose Place" registered its biggest ratings ever to 
finish No. 18 nationally--and No. 4 locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Part 1 of CBS' "Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills" got clobbered on Sunday, 
however. With about 9 million homes tuning in, it finished at No. 46 and not 
only ranked well behind ABC's telecast of the hit movie "City Slickers" (No. 6) 
and NBC's movie "Seasons of the Heart" (No. 21), but also fell about 565,000 
homes short of the audience Fox got five weeks earlier for "Honor Thy Father 
and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders."

HUDLER GETS BUGS OUT OF ANGELS, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He used to eat bugs to motivate his teammates in St. Louis. He swallowed a 
worm last season while playing for the Yakult Swallows in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode the pine a lot," Rex Hudler said, "and got bored. I had to come up 
with something to get my teammates going. So I always had to resort to 
something crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, those things didn't taste too bad -- kind of like bacon -- but my 
wife told me she doesn't want me to do that stuff anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 So Hudler has taken the conventional approach, and is relying now on his bat, 
which he used effectively to lead the Angels to an 8-5 victory over the Detroit 
Tigers on Tuesday night in front of 12,626 fans at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "These have been the three most exciting months of my life," said Hudler, who 
went three for three with a double, home run and two runs batted in. "My wife 
gave birth to our first baby. Mr. (Bill) Bavasi offered me a major league 
contract. And now this. It's a small miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy for the team, really. I mean, my mom and dad don't even have 
me on their fantasy baseball league, so I'm not worrying about numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Since being moved into the leadoff spot last Wednesday, Hudler is batting .625 
with five doubles, three homers and seven RBIs. He has hit a home run in each 
of the last three games he has started. 
</P>
<P>
 New Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann, who had never seen Hudler until last 
Thursday, started him at second base against a right-handed pitcher for the 
first time Saturday. He tried it again Tuesday against Bill Gullickson. Now, 
Hudler, 33, just might be staying in the lineup until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could have imagined that someone who was out of the major leagues at the 
end of the 1992 season, spent last season helping his team win the Japanese 
World Series and was released this spring by the San Francisco Giants, is 
becoming an Angel savior? 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I picked a good year to come back, with the rabbit ball," said 
Hudler, who is batting .429 and has a .786 slugging percentage. "I have the 
greatest batting coach in the world in Rod Carew. I've got everything you'd 
possibly want." 
</P>
<P>
 It's his infectious personality, his ability to make everyone around him a 
little more cheerful, that has endeared Hudler to his teammates. Pitcher Mark 
Langston had been trying to get the Angels to acquire him for the last four 
years, and now that he's here, his teammates wonder if he is for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark told me all the stories about him," said Angel starter Chuck Finley 
(4-3), who won his third consecutive game, yielding seven hits and five runs -- 
three earned -- in six innings. "It's like you can't believe it until you see 
it. His enthusiasm is very welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said: "He's one of the most exciting guys I've ever seen play. Nobody 
I've ever played with has the intensity he has. He's picked this whole team up. 
Believe me, his attitude is contagious." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the worm incident in Japan, Hudler said: "Jack Howell started asking 
the Japanese players on the team how much they'd give to see me eat a worm. He 
got about about $600 (worth of yen), so how could I refuse. It was a great 
spirit-lifter, but then the manager told the media: 'Guess what my crazy 
American did today?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Next day, one headline said: 'Crazy American eats worm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (21-25) certainly are responding to Hudler, winning five of their 
last six games. It also appears that the bullpen might be responding to 
Lachemann, compiling a 0.59 earned-run average in the last six games, with a 
1-0 record and four saves, including Joe Grahe's seventh Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably doing it in spite of me," Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 This victory, though, was special for Lachemann. It was against Tiger Manager 
Sparky Anderson, his high school idol. Lachemann, his brother Rene, and Oakland 
coach Jim Lefebvre used to be batboys for Anderson's American Legion team, 
Crenshaw Post 715. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be happier for Marcel," Anderson said. "I told him I was going to 
send him a telegram (when he was named Angel manager), but my minutes are very 
precious. I didn't think I should waste them since he was coming to town in a 
few days."

CUBS STYMIE DODGERS, WIN EIGHTH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is being likened to a young Roberto Clemente, so exceptional is Raul 
Mondesi's ability in the field. And Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, Mondesi 
did not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 31,912, some who had come to see the Dodgers' league-leading 
offense, were once again denied. Against Chicago, the Dodgers were held to four 
hits in a 2-0 complete-game victory by Willie Banks, who extended the Cub 
winning streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the best games thrown against us this season," Dodger first 
baseman Eric Karros said.  
</P>
<P>
 But what the crowd did see was another solid pitching performance by Orel 
Hershiser (3-1, 2.50 earned run average) and a play by Mondesi in the eighth 
inning that won't soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cubs ahead, 2-0, and Shawon Dunston on second base, Mark Grace hit a 
drive into the gap in right center. Mondesi, who was shading Grace toward the 
right field line, took off running, stretched his glove out, dived and caught 
the ball, holding on as he tumbled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that good?" Mondesi asked. "That was not like a great catch, that was 
just a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring 46 runs in seven games, the Dodgers have only three runs in 
their last two games, and all of them were driven in by a pitcher, Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bats have been still, you could say," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "I'm 
hoping they won't be that way tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said he won't change the lineup, but it took him a while to answer 
that question. Since hitting a three-run homer and driving in a fourth run 
against Colorado in the Dodgers' first game of their recent trip, cleanup 
hitter Tim Wallach has three hits in his last 30 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Banks (5-4), the Dodgers got three of their hits in the first two 
innings and didn't get their fourth until the eighth inning, when Jeff Treadway 
pinch-hit for Hershiser and singled up the middle.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was the best I have thrown my curveball since high school," said 
Banks, who pitched the first complete game of his career. "Lasorda told me a 
long time ago at a banquet that if I ever pitched against the Dodgers, that 'We 
are going to kick your . . .,' and that has always stayed with me in the back 
of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time in his 10 starts that Hershiser left the game with his 
team trailing. In seven of his starts, he has turned over a lead to the bullpen 
and in the other two, he left with a tie. He has held opponents to three earned 
runs or less in all 10, pitching six innings or more in each start. In six of 
his starts, the Dodgers have won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel better this season then at any time since my surgery, but it hasn't 
all of a sudden been like, 'One year and he's back,' it's been going to the 
training room and putting in a lot of hours of work," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs scored twice in the fourth inning. After Dunston was safe on a close 
play at first and Ryne Sandberg singled, Mark Grace's fly ball advanced the 
runners to second and third. Derrick May's groundout scored Dunston and Sammy 
Sosa's double off the wall in center scored Sandberg. The Cubs would have 
scored in the eighth inning if not for Mondesi's catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played with Roberto Clemente for six years, and Mondesi reminds me of him 
more than any other fielder I have ever seen," said Coach Manny Mota, who has 
helped teach Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberto believed that he was the best, and when Mondesi is in the field, he 
thinks he is the best. The way he fields and throws, it reminds me of Roberto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie Smith did a good job of preparing him during spring training for 
playing right field -- that was Reggie's position, you know. He worked with him 
in the outfield every day."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; CANUCKS GAIN FINALS IN DOUBLE OVERTIME, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Adams scored 14 seconds into the second overtime, lifting the Vancouver 
Canucks to a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night and into 
the Stanley Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks won the Western Conference Finals four games to one to advance to 
the NHL finals for the second time in their history. 
</P>
<P>
 They will face the winner of the Eastern Conference finals between the New 
York Rangers and New Jersey Devils. The Devils lead that series 3-2, with Game 
6 tonight at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks were last in the finals in 1982, when they were swept in four 
games by the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams scored the game-winner on a rebound of a shot by Dave Babych from the 
left point. Toronto goaltender Felix Potvin gloved the initial shot, then 
dropped it in front, where Adams backhanded it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Potvin just sat in the crease after the goal, seemingly stunned by the defeat 
as thousands of fans at the Pacific Coliseum waved white towels, signifying the 
victory. Potvin made 43 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired and kind of numb," Adams said. "I don't feel anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great feeling, we're halfway there and we're making a run for it." 
</P>
<P>
 They began their run Tuesday night after falling behind, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto took its lead in the first period on goals by Michael Eastwood, Doug 
Gilmour and Wendel Clark. The Canucks tied it with three goals in the second by 
Murray Craven, Nathan Lafayette and Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Canucks and their 11th in the 
last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's early lead spoiled a shutout string for Vancouver goaltender Kirk 
McLean, who made 31 saves. McLean had gone more than seven periods without 
allowing a goal after the Canucks won Games 3 and 4 by shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams scored the tying goal at 17:57 of the second period on a rebound after 
Potvin stopped shots by Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable, this is what you work for, this is what you dream 
about," said Canuck Coach and General Manager Pat Quinn, a former Toronto 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've got a Maple Leaf somewhere on my body, so I don't know if it's 
good we beat them, but I'm proud of our guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Burns shuffled his forward lines and the Leafs scored three times in 
4:25 in the first period.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; LENDL, THIRD-SEEDED EDBERG JOIN THE FIRST-ROUND CASUALTY 
LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Between them, they have played in 30 Grand Slam event finals. They have been 
part of tennis' elite for so long, they have come to symbolize the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the red clay here at Roland Garros Stadium, playing against opponents 
who have never experienced the quarterfinals of a major tournament, Stefan 
Edberg and Ivan Lendl were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 That they would lose in the French Open in Paris was expected, perhaps 
inevitable. But in Tuesday's first round? 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, seeded third, was thought to have a chance to win the one Grand Slam 
tournament that has eluded him. But he had 18 double faults in losing to fellow 
Swede Henrik Holm, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (7-2), 6-7 (10-8), 6-4, in a 4-hour 
4-minute marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Holm, 25, has yet to win a tournament, and had lost all three previous matches 
against Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl, a four-time French Open champion who was unseeded and unprepared, lost 
in the first round for the second consecutive year, this time to Arnaud Boetsch 
of France, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 He then withdrew from next month's Wimbledon tournament, citing a recurring 
back problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very complicated thing and I am hoping to get better with it," said 
Lendl, 34. "It was very disappointing because I have been feeling good for a 
while with it and then all of a sudden just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, 28, thought he had overcome his struggles as he prepared for the 
French Open this month, but lost in the first round here for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where I lost it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so much Edberg's loss as Holm's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Holm, who reached the third round of the last two Grand Slam events, savored 
his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tournament official warned reporters, "Last question," during a news 
conference, Holm responded, "(But) I need the publicity!" 
</P>
<P>
 If he continues playing as he did Tuesday, publicity will be the least of his 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edberg rallied to force a fifth set by winning a long, error-filled 
fourth-set tiebreaker, Holm did not fold, although it seemed he might. 
</P>
<P>
 During the set, Holm yelled at the chair umpire when a call went against him 
as he trailed 2-1. After interrupting play for nearly a minute, he finally 
bowed to the umpire and said, "Thank you," continuing to insist that the ball 
had been out. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Edberg, calmly waiting for Holm to end his tirade, who cracked. He 
double-faulted on his next serve. Holm broke for 2-2, but Edberg was not going 
away quietly, and outlasted his opponent in the third tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Holm said he was trying to remain calm before the start of the 
decisive set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just concentrating," he said. "Finally, I made some unbelievable returns." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what it took to overcome Edberg. Even at match point, he continued 
to battle. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first match point, Holm lofted a nice lob over Edberg's head in the 
center of the court. Edberg reached with his backhand and got the ball, which 
hit the tape and barely made it over the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good jump," said Holm, who promptly gained another match point 
with a forehand winner. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Edberg was out of luck. After a long rally, Holm rifled a shot down 
the line and all Edberg could do was watch. 
</P>
<P>
 His next step was toward the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Sergi Bruguera and Jim Courier, finalists last year and winners of the last 
three men's titles, advanced in straight sets. Courier, the 1991 and 1992 
champion but seeded seventh here, defeated Jean-Philippe Fleurian of France, 
6-1, 6-4, 6-4. No. 6 Bruguera, the defending champion, has been struggling with 
shoulder problems but routed No. 68 Martin Damm of the Czech Republic, 6-1, 
6-1, 7-6 (7-3). . . . No. 2 Michael Stich was a 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 victor over Renzo 
Furlan of Italy.

SABATINI DEFEATED BY FARINA; SLUMP NOW SPANS 37 TOURNAMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriela Sabatini continues to play like a shell of her former self. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing an opponent who had never won a game against her, No. 8 Sabatini 
became the latest victim in the already thin women's field Tuesday at the 
French Open. She lost in the first round to Silvia Farina of Italy, 2-6, 6-2, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Sabatini was leading Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-1, 5-1, in the 
quarterfinals, then lost in three sets. Since then, Sabatini, 24, has not shown 
the fight that made her one of the best players over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only other first-round loss in 35 Grand Slam tournaments was against 
Barbara Potter in the 1985 U.S. Open, when Sabatini was 15. She failed to reach 
the fourth round at Roland Garros Stadium for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although playing sluggishly, it appeared Sabatini would advance Tuesday when 
she had two break points to take a 4-1 lead in the third set. But Farina, 
ranked 108th, held serve, then sensed Sabatini's vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized she was scared," Farina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini has not won a tournament since the 1992 Italian Open, a span of 37 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of hard to believe I lost the first round here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome her slump, Sabatini has changed coaches four times since January. 
But she acknowledged that her problem against Farina was attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't put that much fight in those moments (in the third set)," she said. 
"I lost a little bit of my patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini's early departure followed by a day No. 4 Martina Navratilova's loss 
in the first round. Following them out were No. 5 Jana Novotna of 
Czechoslovakia, who lost to No. 94 Anna Smashnova, a Soviet immigrant from 
Israel, 6-4, 6-2; No. 6 Kimiko Date of Japan, who lost to No. 18 Amanda 
Coetzer, 6-2, 6-1, and No. 14 Zina Garrison-Jackson, who lost to No. 81 Silke 
Frankl of Germany in a match carried over from Monday, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin, 31, continuing her attempted comeback, lost to Marketa Kochta of 
Germany, 6-0, 6-1. She left the court in tears, but later said she continues 
because tennis remains fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a challenge," Austin said. "It's still a pleasure . . . that's 
what keeps me in the game." ELLIOTT ALMOND

MORNING BRIEFING: HAIRLESS IN SEATTLE: FANS ARE REALLY BUZZING OVER BUHNER

 The Seattle Mariners offered free admission recently to anyone consenting to a 
Jay Buhner-style "buzz cut" hairstyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners provided barbers outside the Kingdome, and about 400 fans had 
their locks shaved down to the quarter-inch length that Buhner, a Mariner 
outfielder, prefers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 86 showed up who had already had themselves buzzed. 
</P>

 Buhner commented: "This is the grunge capital of the world."

 Ripping the Pip: Alan Greenberg of the Hartford Courant criticized the Chicago 
Bulls' Scottie Pippen, implying that Pippen has muffed the role of Bull main 
man since Michael Jordan retired.  
</P>
<P>
 "In or out of Jordan's shadow, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest 
that when it comes to guts, graciousness and just generally acting grown-up, 
Scottie Pippen might not be such a pip of a guy," Greenberg wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Pippen was introduced to the Chicago crowd, he received not the boos he 
deserved, but a rousing ovation. Fans will forgive anything if a player can 
help their team win. No wonder guys such as Pippen come to believe that they 
are bigger than the game. We liked Pippen better when he was in Jordan's 
shadow. Riding out front, he doesn't look too pretty. More like an all-time 
grate."

 Oops: The Colts, who begin play as a Canadian Football League expansion team 
in Baltimore, recently took some of that city's reporters on a tour of old

 As Jobie Waldt, Colt facilities director, showed them the TV booth, his right 
leg went through the rotted floor, up to his knee.

 Ban Boswell: Washington Post columnist Thomas Boswell wrote after the deaths 
of drivers Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna that auto racing should be 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the Post was deluged with letters. Mike Gleason of Shillington, 
Pa., wrote: "Auto racing may be the last bastion of good sportsmanship in 
American sports. How often do you see 'trash talking' at an auto race? How 
often does a pit-clearing brawl occur in auto racing? How often does an 
opposing team in baseball or football offer to give assistance to an 
up-and-coming team? This does not happen in any other professional sport. Race 
car drivers appeal to fans because they are just ordinary people."

could wear an earring. Butler's reaction: "At the time, Kal Daniels and Darryl 
Strawberry wore them, and Blake came to me and said: 'I want an earring like 
Darryl. I told him, 'As long as you are in this house, you will not wear an 
earring.' And he said, 'Well, I guess I have to move out.' "

<P>
 Most people give me the same answer when I ask them how they feel about the 
possibility of L.A. and Orange Counties being NFL-less by 1995. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It goes something like this: "Oh, that's too bad, but it'll mean more games on 
TV every Sunday and that's great." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The lack of passion for the local teams is reflected at the gate. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis' Raiders were last in the NFL in number of tickets sold for home 
games last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Frontiere's Rams were 24th among the 28 teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have an outdated facility, but the Cleveland Browns drew far more 
fans in a stadium that is even less attractive than the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had a 5-11 record, but sold fewer tickets than the Cincinnati 
Bengals, who were 3-13. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Southland likes to bill itself as the sports capital of the nation. 
However, when it comes to pro football, it is the stay-away capital. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This might not only be the best Dodger team in a number of years, but the most 
pleasant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Stewardesses have told me that, as a rule, they don't enjoy working chartered 
flights involving athletic teams, but that they like this team because it is so 
well mannered," Tom Lasorda said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What sophomore jinx? Mike Piazza was chosen as the National League player of 
the week for May 16-22. Tim Salmon was chosen as the American League player of 
the week for May 9-15. . . . Kevin Gross' home run Monday night against the 
Chicago Cubs was the first by a Dodger pitcher this season.Too bad Darren 
Dreifort rarely gets to bat. He hit 22 home runs last year at Wichita State, 
where he also played the outfield. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Both cleanup hitters Tuesday, the Dodgers' Tim Wallach and the Cubs' Mark 
Grace, played at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Caray, who is celebrating his 50th anniversary as a baseball 
broadcaster, might limit his duty to Cub home games next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hall of Fame outfielder Billy Williams is listed as the Cubs' offensive 
coordinator and Chuck Cottier as their defensive coordinator. But, no, they 
don't have a quarterback coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle hit 52 home runs in 1956, the year he set the record of 20 home 
runs in the first two months that was broken by Ken Griffey Jr. on Monday. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado Rockies have never drawn fewer than 40,000 for a game at Mile 
High Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill, who is tearing up the American League and batted .311 for the 
New York Yankees last year, has a National League average of .259 in 799 
at-bats with the Cincinnati Reds. . . .

 Suspended former King Bernie Nicholls was replaced on the New Jersey Devils' 
roster by former King Corey Millen last Saturday. . . .

 Nearly 1,000 athletes, the largest number for any collegiate meet in the 
nation, will compete in the NAIA track and field championships Thursday through 
Saturday at Azusa Pacific. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among those who have participated in the meet are Bob Hayes, Florida A & M; 
Bobby Morrow, Abilene Christian; Bruce Jenner, Graceland of Iowa; Rod Milburn, 
Southern; Billy Olson, Abilene Christian; Al Feuerbach, Emporia State, and Dave 
Johnson and Christian Okoye of Azusa Pacific, which is favored to win its 10th 
team title in 12 years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how Buster Mathis Jr., who fights Riddick Bowe June 11 at Caesars 
Palace, feels about the announcement that Bowe will oppose Larry Donald July 15 
at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Collegiate Licensing Company, the University of Michigan 
leads NCAA schools in nationwide sales of sports apparel and merchandise. 
Georgetown is second, Florida State third, North Carolina fourth and Alabama 
fifth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon's performance in the playoffs makes his selection as NBA most 
valuable player, a regular-season award, look good. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is a given that the Milwaukee Bucks will draft Glenn Robinson first. The 
Dallas Mavericks, who need a point guard more than a small forward, should take 
Jason Kidd second over Grant Hill. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' 6-foot-7 shooting guard, is supposed to 
weigh 185 pounds, but he doesn't look that heavy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The weekly Sprint Soccer Poll has the following top 10 three weeks before the 
start of the World Cup: Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Netherlands, Italy, 
Colombia, Belgium, a tie for eighth between Norway and Spain, and Nigeria. 
Mexico is 12th and the United States 13th. . . .

 John McEnroe probably doesn't care about my opinion, but I think Mary Carillo 
is the best tennis commentator on TV. . . .

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; DAVY JONES BACK IN THE FIELD FOR NOW, BUT 
GOODYEAR MIGHT STILL REPLACE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Davy Jones got his race car back Tuesday, but the reprieve might be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had been moved out of his Lola-Ford Monday by owner Kenny Bernstein, who 
wanted Scott Goodyear, his team's lead driver, to drive it. Goodyear's similar 
car had been bumped from the field Sunday by rookie Marco Greco. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein learned Tuesday, though, that if he made that switch, Mark Smith 
would move up to first alternate and Jones would be listed as second alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 So he put Jones back in the qualified car, and Goodyear will go back to being 
first alternate -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation might be reversed again after Thursday's final practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a case of keeping our options open, so we have a chance of 
having two cars in the race," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one car that's in the race, we have one car that's the first 
alternate. If something should happen Thursday to any one of the qualified 
cars, then (our) second (car), which is Scott Goodyear's car, will be in the 
race (because it's) the first alternate. In that case, we'll both stay where 
we're at. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not, then most likely Scott will replace me." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time an alternate started was in 1986. Dennis Firestone crashed in 
the final practice session, wrecking his car, and Dick Simon joined the field. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 When Mario Andretti won his only Indy 500 in 1969, one of the more memorable 
vignettes was of car owner Andy Granatelli giving his driver a kiss in Victory 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 During a moment of reflection the other day, Andretti revealed the real story 
of the much-photographed incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the picture real close, you can see that he is whispering 
something in my ear, not kissing me," Andretti said. "I had a deal with Andy 
that if I won the 500 or the championship, he would double my driving fee -- 
and I must say that Andy was always quite generous with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, when I pulled into Victory Lane, he leaned over and said, 'You little . . 
. .' Every time anybody mentions that so-called kiss, I think of that. I 
finally decided it was time to tell all. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Andy was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti will be roasted and toasted at an Arrivederci Tour dinner Thursday 
night. Expected to take their shots at Andretti, who is retiring after this 
season, are team co-owners Paul Newman and Carl Haas, actor James Garner, Tim 
Allen of the TV show "Home Improvement" and drivers A.J. Foyt, Bobby Unser, Dan 
Gurney, Emerson Fittipaldi, Johnny Rutherford and Andretti's teammate, Nigel 
Mansell.

<P>
 Proceeds will be divided between the Methodist Children's Hospital and the 
charity fund of Championship Auto Racing Auxiliary, which donates more than 
$100,000 annually to various causes. SHAV GLICK

 The New York Yankees held a special defensive workout, reportedly on the 
orders of owner George Steinbrenner. The Yankees, with the best record in 
baseball at 28-13, were coming off of a 6-5, 10-inning loss Sunday to the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 WABC, the team's flagship radio station, said Steinbrenner wanted the workout, 
which lasted 45 minutes and concentrated on defensive positioning, particularly 
on bunts. But Manager Buck Showalter sidestepped the question of the owner's 
involvement.

 "There were just some things we needed to work on," Showalter said.

charging the mound after he was hit by Smoltz. Both players also were fined.

said he was traveling more than 110 m.p.h. on Interstate 4 in a Ferrari

lawyer filed a motion arguing that a breath test given after the traffic stop

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS SIMPLY WENT WITH INSTINCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After making three exceptional fielding plays during Monday night's game, all 
Delino DeShields could remember Tuesday was the one he blew in the sixth 
inning, when he went to his left to field a ball and threw it away trying to 
turn a double play. It wasn't a routine double play, but DeShields says things 
he does in the field aren't always routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to be a hero, so I got burned," said DeShields, who cost the Dodgers 
a run. "Sometimes, it will be like that. I guess I think that with the ability 
that God gave me, it enables me to do things that the next man might not be 
able to. Being up by one run, I wouldn't have tried it if it were later in the 
game. But last night, I was feeling pretty good out there, and I just did what 
comes naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields said he took rookie Garey Ingram shopping on the recent trip and 
bought him some clothes. "He didn't have anything he could wear on the road, 
just like me when I showed up in jeans, and we can't wear those on the road. He 
came with a bagful of jeans, so I bought him some stuff just like Oil Can Boyd 
and Tim Raines did for me when I came up. They didn't like the way I dressed, 
like in construction boots and jeans. They said, 'This is the big leagues, 
man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With Dave Hansen about ready to come off the disabled list, Ingram, who was 
called up from double-A San Antonio, is expected to be sent down soon. MARYANN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARDINALS STRAND RECORD 16, LOSE TO PHILLIES, 4-0 
</P>

<P>
 The St. Louis Cardinals set a major league record by stranding 16 runners 
without scoring, losing to David West and three Philadelphia relievers, 4-0, 
Tuesday night at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like 100 sitting in the dugout," Cardinals manager Joe Torre said. 
"You see those guys at the end of the inning, they're throwing their helmets 
in, you count the helmets. That's a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous mark for runners left on base in a shutout loss was 15, most 
recently by Kansas City against Detroit in 1975. The NL record was 14, most 
recently by the Phillies against Montreal in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Jordan's double in the ninth inning snapped a scoreless tie as the 
Phillies won for the 10th time in 12 games. Pete Incaviglia added a three-run 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 West, Bobby Munoz, Heathcliff Slocumb (4-0) and Doug Jones combined on a 
seven-hitter. The Cardinals left the bases loaded in the fourth and sixth 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 6, San Francisco 3 -- Phil Clark hit a three-run homer in the first 
inning to back Joey Hamilton in his major league debut, and the Padres beat the 
Giants at San Diego for their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres, who on Sunday ended a club-record 13-game losing streak, had a 
four-run first inning for the second straight game. The Giants have lost six 
consecutive games and eight of their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton (1-0) was working on three days' rest after being promoted from 
triple-A Las Vegas. San Diego released 1989 NL Cy Young Award winner Mark Davis 
to make room for Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Hickerson (2-4) was pitching on only two days' rest because of Bill 
Swift's arm tightness. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 11, Florida 1 -- Darrin Fletcher drove in a career-high five runs and 
Butch Henry pitched 6 2/3 shutout innings, leading the Expos past the Marlins 
at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal tied a National League record with four sacrifice flies, including 
two by Fletcher, who also hit a three-run double in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been four sacrifice flies in a game seven other times in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 8, Atlanta 0 -- Doug Drabek pitched a three-hitter for his seventh 
consecutive victory and had three hits himself as the Astros roughed up Tom 
Glavine at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (7-1) matched his 1988 career-best streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros, winning for the fifth time in six games, got to Glavine (5-4) for 
a run in the third inning on two-out singles by Drabek, James Mouton and Steve 
Finley. Mouton had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Jose Vizcaino's two-out single gave New York the 
lead in a three-run ninth inning and Bobby Bonilla and Ryan Thompson homered as 
the Mets won at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Jones (5-4) pitched eight strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 11, Cincinnati 7 -- Walt Weiss had four hits and Andres Galarraga and 
Charlie Hayes each had three as the Rockies got 17 hits to beat the Reds in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Red third baseman Tony Fernandez and Manager Davey Johnson were ejected by 
umpire Wally Bell in the eighth inning after arguing a third-strike call.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; RIPKEN'S 300TH HOMER HELPS EXTEND BREWER SKID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal Ripken hit his 300th career homer and drove in six runs Tuesday night as 
the Baltimore Orioles got 15 hits at Milwaukee and sent the Brewers to a 
club-record 13th consecutive loss, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Higuera (1-4) blew a 5-0 second-inning lead, surrendering home runs to 
Ripken and Jack Voigt in the third and to Chris Hoiles in the fourth. Leo Gomez 
later added two solo homers in his first multi-homer game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken hit a three-run double against reliever Jeff Bronkey in the fourth 
inning after Higuera walked the bases full. Ripken scored on the play when 
shortstop Jose Valentin threw the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Eichhorn (1-1), who gave up four hits in 4 1/3 shutout innings, earned 
the victory in relief of Sid Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 10, Seattle 1 -- Brent Gates went four for five and tied a team record 
with eight consecutive hits as the Athletics beat the Mariners at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bordick doubled twice and tripled as the A's won their second in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Jimenez (1-2) won for the first time in five starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, who went four for four Monday night, tied the club record of eight 
consecutive hits set in 1973 by Joe Rudi. The streak ended when Gates was 
called out on strikes in the seventh against former Oakland reliever Rich 
Gossage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Boston 3 -- Jack Morris (3-4) gave up two unearned runs in seven 
innings to get his first road victory for the Indians and Albert Belle had a 
two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Sele (5-2) gave up five runs, eight hits and four walks in 5 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Sox designated hitter Andre Dawson, who has had nine knee operations, 
suffered an injured left knee while running out a grounder and will undergo 
tests today. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Toronto 1 -- Terry Mulholland pitched a five-hitter for his first 
complete game this season, and Wade Boggs and Jim Leyritz homered as the 
Yankees beat the Blue Jays in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland (5-3) led the Yankees to their 13th victory in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stewart (3-4) failed to reach the sixth inning for the fourth consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Minnesota 3 -- Joey Cora hit a go-ahead, two-run triple with two 
out in the seventh inning to lead the White Sox to victory in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Newson's first home run of the season led off the seventh and made the 
score 3-3. Larry Casian (1-3) relieved Pat Mahomes, Lance Johnson singled, Mike 
LaValliere sacrificed and Tim Raines walked with two out. Cora followed with 
his drive into the right field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Cook (2-0) got the victory. Jack McDowell, who hasn't won since May 7, 
lasted 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 2, Kansas City 0 -- Kenny Rogers, despite being injured in a hotel 
mishap, pitched a six-hitter for his first career shutout as Texas stopped a 
four-game losing streak in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers (5-3) took five stitches in his left knee when he slipped on an 
escalator at the team hotel on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco hit his 10th home run in the first inning and Rusty Greer hit a 
leadoff triple in the fifth and scored on Jeff Frye's infield out.

LEACH DUO LEADS USC TO THE TOP AGAIN; TENNIS: SON OF COACH WINS KEY THREE-SET 
MATCH TO GIVE TROJANS THEIR THIRD NCAA TITLE IN LAST FOUR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC won its second consecutive NCAA men's tennis championship Tuesday with a 
4-3 victory over Stanford in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Trojans' third title in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Stanford came into the tournament ranked first and second, 
respectively, in the nation. USC had defeated the Cardinal the last two times 
they played, both times by 4-3 scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In each match, the teams split the singles matches after USC had won the 
doubles point. 
</P>
<P>
 The only change in Tuesday's match was Jon Leach's clinching 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 
victory over Jeff Salzenstein of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a Hollywood finish out there," said USC coach Dick Leach. "You 
couldn't ask for a better script than to watch your son play for a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon has won two huge points for us the last two years at the NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he had lost to Salzenstein in two previous matches and had dropped 
the first set Tuesday in a 6-7 tie-breaker, Jon Leach said he wasn't nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not like Pete Sampras. Every shot I hit is not going to go in," he said. 
"I just hit the ball knowing some will go in and some won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Salzenstein's broken shoelace at break point in the third set also might have 
helped Leach by breaking Salzenstein's concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened at a critical time of the match," Salzenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself if I needed to ruin his rhythm, then I would stop," Leach 
said. "That's exactly what he (Salzenstein) did." 
</P>
<P>
 But Salzenstein credits Leach's backhand return in taking nine of the next 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Gould, coach of Stanford, thought the key to the match may have been his 
No. 2 doubles team of Robert Devens and Salzenstein's 9-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Black and Brett Hansen captured singles matches for USC, and Chris 
Cocotos, Jim Thomas and Vimal Patel won for Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and Leach captured No. 1 doubles for USC, and Patel and Grant Elliot won 
No. 3 doubles for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's championship was the school's 15th, tying the Trojans with UCLA for the 
most in the tournament's history.

DIVISION I BOYS' TENNIS; DANA HILLS PROVES ITSELF AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive match, Dana Hills was facing a Sea View League 
opponent it had already defeated. And for second consecutive time, Dana Hills' 
David Bailey heard the same talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been dealing with the same attitude for a week now," Bailey said. 
"Well, we wanted to turn that attitude around. Woodbridge and University were 
saying they lost because they didn't play their best. They lost because we're a 
good team and we're talented." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' superior talent was evident from the start Tuesday. They led, 
6-1, after the first round and ran away with a 14 1/3-6 2/3 victory over 
University in a Southern Section Division I boys' tennis quarterfinal at Dana 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Dana Hills (22-0) will play Palos Verdes Peninsula, an 11-10 
winner over Diamond Bar, in Thursday's semifinals at a site to be determined. 
Bailey said he isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in this for the long haul," said Bailey, who with his partner Christian 
Spaulding swept three doubles sets, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. "We're looking to win this 
thing. I think we can go all the way. I'm sure this (score) is going to scare 
them. They're going to look at these scores and go, "Oh, God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The scores of the first-round sets were close, but Dana Hills won all but one 
of them -- a Jason Meyers 6-3 victory over the Dolphins' Brandon Fallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their guys were really fired up," University Coach Josh Davis said. 
"Psychologically, that first round affected us, but to our guys' credit, they 
came back and played tough in the second round." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough, but not good enough. Dana Hills won four of six sets in the second 
round and clinched the match on Fallon's 7-6 (7-2) victory over Raja Kapadia. 
After two rounds, Dana Hills had scored only a third of a point less than it 
did in the entire first meeting with University (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
 After two rounds, the Dolphins had won all six doubles sets. In the last 
round, Dana Hills dropped two of three meaningless doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be really close," Bailey said. "There's a lot of 
talent out here." 
</P>
<P>
 However on Tuesday, Davis acknowledged that Dana Hills owned most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a really good team," Davis said. "They've got a great opportunity to 
get to the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I match: 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills 16, Mission Viejo 5 -- Fernando Machuca and Christian Fernandez 
won two of their three doubles sets for Mission Viejo. Machuca and Fernandez 
won, 6-2, 6-3. The Diablos finish the season 11-9.

DIVISION II BOYS' TENNIS; RIVERSIDE POLY TURNS OUT TO BE TOO MUCH TO HANDLE FOR 
LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 Laguna Hills ran out of gas in the final round Tuesday and lost to Riverside 
Poly, 12-9, in the Southern Section Division II boys' tennis quarterfinals at 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks played well in the first two rounds and were down only 7 1/3-6 2/3. 
Relying on Tom Yim (32-1) and No. 2 doubles Kenton Payne and Christian Schutte 
in Round 3, Laguna Hills (11-11) needed to win two of the remaining four 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough when you don't know anything about your competition," Laguna Hills 
Coach Jay Marshall said. "You have to set up everything before the match and 
hope it's right. It's not like basketball and football where you can make 
adjustments while the game goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yim, playing at No. 2 singles, did as expected, sweeping his sets, 6-0, 6-4, 
6-1, and Payne and Schutte took their final set, 6-2, but the rest of the team 
was unable to get by the fourth-seeded Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks' Ryan Slack and Jason Hill lost quickly in doubles to Brett Masi and 
Scott Merryman, 6-0, and Jeff Llanes was defeated by the Bears' No. 2 singles 
player, Kevin Schiller, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 With coaches and players looking on, the No. 3 doubles team of Wayne Cho and 
Dennis Harper played a strong match against Riverside Poly's No. 1 Kris Mueller 
and Jack Williams, but lost, 6-4, giving the Bears the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really happy with our No. 3 singles and doubles," Bear Coach Mike Vanta 
said. "They each gave us one win, which we needed to get the match." 
</P>
<P>
 For Laguna Hills, Schutte and Payne won two of three, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, and 
Arnold also took two of three, 6-1, 6-1, 0-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Poly (21-2) will face top-seeded Sunny Hills Thursday at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw some of them play at the individual events and they are tough," 
Marshall said. "Once I find out their lineup I'll have to make a decision on 
what we are going to do with ours. It's possible I'll make some changes." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division II matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills 15 1/3, Alhambra Keppel 5 2/3 -- The doubles teams of Kevin Kim 
and Hiren Bhavsar and Joseph Gilbert and Joey Springer swept their matches to 
lead No. 1-seeded Sunny Hills to the semifinals. Kim and Bhavsar won their 
matches 6-2, 6-1, 6-2. Gilbert and Springer won 6-0, 6-0, 6-1. The Lancers, the 
defending champion, are 20-1.

DIVISION I BASEBALL; BARONS HANG ON, BEAT ESPERANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron LaRuffa, Fountain Valley High School baseball coach, was taking the 
glass-is-half-full stance after the Barons' 8-6 victory over Esperanza Tuesday. 
There was, he said, a lot to be thankful about. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Barons would be playing Simi Valley Friday in the quarterfinals of 
the Southern Section Division I playoffs was quite satisfying. That they had 
knocked off the defending Division I champion and set a school record for 
victories was even worth celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the end, the Barons were most thankful that they had hung on after 
teetering toward collapse, nearly blowing an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "A win is a win," LaRuffa said. "This team is peaking." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly was through five innings. The Barons (24-3-1), the No. 1-seeded 
team, were leading, 8-0, and had Chris Ponchak, their rather nasty closer, on 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 The ingredients were right, but the mix was volatile. Esperanza was unwilling 
to give up its position as reigning champion without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (14-13) scored six runs in the sixth and had the tying run at the 
plate before Ponchak got the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was second-guessing myself 8 million times (for bringing in Ponchak)," 
LaRuffa said. "But he has been the guy who comes in and closes things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, showed why in the seventh. He was bloodied mentally and physically -- 
after being tagged in the face in the top of the seventh -- but he was in 
command again. The Aztecs went down meekly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about that," LaRuffa said. "There were too many good things 
today. We played good baseball in all but one inning." 
</P>
<P>
 True. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons got clutch hits from the bottom of the order. Craig Ritter and Dan 
Keller, the Nos. 8 and 9 batters, each drove in two runs. It was the second 
consecutive game they have made big contributions. Both had two hits in a 14-1 
first-round victory over Montebello Schurr Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top of the order had been carrying us during league," Keller said. "Craig 
and I talked about it. We wanted to do it in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley also got solid pitching. Starter Tony Liuzzi (7-0) allowed 
only three hits and struck out five in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't throw a lot of pitches, except in the bullpen," LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons even avoided disaster when they ran into it. Danny Hoppie nearly 
passed teammate Deric Yanagisawa at third base in the fourth inning. Only a 
poor relay throw prevented the inning from ending with the base-running 
blunder. The Barons then scored four runs with two outs to break a scoreless 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny just forgot who was running in front of him," LaRuffa said. "Deric 
isn't the fastest guy. We'll work on that tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, for LaRuffa and the Barons, there will be a tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 4, Fontana 3 -- Jeff Moore had three hits, including an RBI single 
to score Chris Beck with the go-ahead run in the top of the sixth inning, and 
Benito Flores and Spencer Frost added two hits each to lead visiting El Dorado 
(21-7). The Golden Hawks will face Crescenta Valley in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood 14, Katella 1 -- Jae Park had a hit and a run scored and Dave Rojo 
had an RBI triple for host Katella (18-9-1). Lakewood (22-6) scored six runs in 
each of the fourth and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 3, Palos Verdes Peninsula 0 -- Sophomore Mike Hessman (8-3) gave up 
one hit, a single in the fifth, and struck out eight to lead host Mater Dei 
(18-8-1). Erik Mattern had a double and two RBIs and Mike Waugh added two hits 
for the Monarchs, who will play second-seeded Lakewood Friday.

MONROE GETS DROP IN FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The winner of a competitive softball game usually is the team that makes the 
fewer errors. Such was not the case in the City Section 3-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe and Verdugo Hills took turns dropping the ball, booting grounders and 
overthrowing teammates. What this game came down to was which team made the 
costliest errors -- and Verdugo Hills paid dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe parlayed four singles and two errors into a four-run second inning and 
went on to beat defending champion Verdugo Hills, 7-3, Tuesday in the 3-A title 
game in front of about 350 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take it anyway we can get it," Monroe Coach Bill Hence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe (17-2) scored in the first inning when winning pitcher Melissa Ennis 
(13-1) came home on a groundout by Silvia Ramos, but it was the second inning 
that proved disastrous for the Dons (18-4). 
</P>
<P>
 After Alanna Torres' bases-loaded single gave the Vikings a 2-0 lead, Ennis 
hit a comebacker to pitcher Shannon Schoonover, who flipped the ball to catcher 
Jodi Kent. But the throw got away from Kent and Cindy Gutierrez scored. Kent 
retrieved the ball from the backstop, but then overthrew Schoonover, who was 
covering the plate. Charlotte Ali scored on the overthrow, but Torres (three 
for four) was thrown out at the plate by shortstop Stephanie Wood, who 
recovered the overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, who like the Dons made four errors, added a run on a single by 
Lupe Brambila (two hits). 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to put a little pressure on them with our speed," Hence said. 
"That (inning) took a lot of pressure off us, really." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, who won the school's first title last year, never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hit the ball well all year," Verdugo Hills Coach Dan Balkey said. "But, 
when you're down four or five runs right off the bat like this, it's hard (to 
come back)." 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills rallied for three runs in the sixth on three hits and an error 
to get to within 6-3.

SANCHEZ KEEPS HART RUNNING BY SHUTTING DOWN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Right-hander Luis Sanchez had thrown a three-hit shutout to lead Hart to a 4-0 
victory in the second round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs 
Tuesday, and what did he get? These words from pitching coach Bill Sizemore: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't touch a ball tomorrow," he said. "We're going to run your butt off." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez nodded and slipped his right arm into an ice pack that looks like a 
sling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches have told me I have to basically work my (behind) off in the 
playoffs," said Sanchez, Hart's good-luck charm on the mound. In three seasons 
the junior is 20-2. By defeating Beverly Hills, he improved to 7-2 and lowered 
his earned-run average to 2.49. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez struck out 10, walked none and was ahead in the count on 21 of the 25 
batters he faced. He threw first-pitch strikes to 15 of them. But today he 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (21-5), which plays Rio Mesa on Friday, scored twice in the first inning 
on three hits -- including Jeremy Seipel's leadoff double -- and a walk, but 
the runs scored on a wild pickoff throw and a double steal. No. 9 hitter Aron 
Miyata drove in the other two runs on a sacrifice fly in the fourth and a 
double to left-center in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, meanwhile, baffled Beverly Hills (18-9), striking out five of the 
first six batters. Jeremy Booth, a Collegiate Baseball preseason All-American, 
had two of the Normans' three hits. But Booth never came up with runners on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good the whole game," Sanchez said, "and I really got my slider down 
for the first time."

IGOU PITCHES IN, POWERS NOTRE DAME TO VICTORY

 Just call Rich Igou the all-around man. On Tuesday, the senior left-hander led 
Notre Dame High to a 5-2 victory over Newbury Park in the second round of the 
Southern Section Division I baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Igou went two for two, including a three-run homer in the first inning. Then 
he took over for starting pitcher Andy Lutz in the bottom of the sixth inning 
and earned his third save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 All that after pitching 10 solid innings in Friday's first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fired up to get in there and pitch," Igou said. "I was ready to go. I 
had four days' rest and I knew I could go in and do good." 
</P>
<P>
 Igou smacked the home run over the 350-foot center-field fence on a 3-and-2 
count. Joey Orlando, who singled to left, and Justin Bunch, who walked, also 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (20-5) made it 5-0 when Chris Crowley ripped a two-run homer over 
the 345-foot left-field fence in the third. Orlando, who singled to center, 
scored on the homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit the long ball early and that really hurt us," Newbury Park Coach 
Gary Fabricius said. "And their pitcher did a good job keeping us off speed 
with his curveballs." 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (19-8) scored all of its runs on wild pitches by Lutz. Stu 
McGugan scored the first one in the fourth inning and Brian Collins the other 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Smith (6-4) took the loss. He gave up five hits and five runs in 2 1/3 
innings. Lutz (7-1) gave up seven hits and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told that Smith throws hard and he would be tough to hit, but we've 
faced guys that throw harder all season," Notre Dame Coach Tom Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame will play Nogales, a 5-4 winner over Alhambra, in the quarterfinals 
Friday.

KOZLOWSKI STAYS UNBEATEN; SIMI VALLEY REMAINS ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Meet the Simi Valley High baseball team's starting rotation: Kary Kozlowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski, a senior right-hander, started the Pioneers' 7-0 victory over Santa 
Monica in the second round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also started Simi Valley's first-round victory over Alemany last week. And 
he'll start against top-seeded Fountain Valley in the quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is hotter than a firecracker now and he is going to pitch," Simi Valley 
Coach Russ Stephans said. "We are not going to lose with other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski (8-0) pitched four scoreless innings, giving up two hits, striking 
out four and walking none. After Simi Valley took a 5-0 lead in the top of the 
fifth, Stephans pulled Kozlowski in favor of Nathan Celusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Celusta pitched well too, striking out four in two hitless innings. Jeff 
Weaver pitched the seventh, striking out two. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (20-6) has won six in a row since the suspension of Coach Mike 
Scyphers pending police and school district investigations into possible 
financial and disciplinary improprieties. His absence doesn't seem to have hurt 
the Pioneers, who are wearing black caps as a tribute to Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously six in a row speaks for itself," Kozlowski said. "We are playing 
pretty well right now, playing pretty loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley scored all the runs it would need in the fourth inning. Tim 
Nykoluk tripled to drive in two and two scored on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, junior first baseman Jeff Michael blasted his third home run of 
the season, a booming shot to left field. Michael was the only player in the 
game with two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who we play next," Stephans said. "It's not an issue. If we play 
like we have the last four or five games, we'll be all right."

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Glick is one of the best pitchers in the area, with an 
11-2 record and 1.36 earned-run average. The hard-throwing left hander is a top 
professional prospect and has 129 strikeouts and 19 walks in 72 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Glick pitched a three-hitter and struck out 17 in Palmdale's 
5-1 first-round victory over El Segundo in the Southern Section Division III 
playoffs. "He was the best we've seen this year," El Segundo Coach John 
Stevenson said. "I'm not so sure if we played him again that he wouldn't do the 
same thing." Glick loaded the bases in the first inning by hitting two batters 
and walking another. Then he struck out the next three hitters. "Our hitters 
were impressed," Stevenson said. "And I was impressed, watching them walk into 
the dugout after striking out." It was Glick's 10th complete game of the 
season.

DIVISION II BASEBALL; CANYON'S POISE GRINDS DOWN BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Jacobs was in a jam, so the Canyon pitcher bowed his head, said a prayer 
and returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Brea-Olinda had all the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, a junior left-hander, pitched out of trouble in the fourth inning, 
providing a boost that helped the Comanches to a 5-2 victory over the Wildcats 
in the second round of the Southern Section Division II baseball playoffs 
Tuesday at Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Century League-champion Canyon (22-5) plays Temecula Valley in the 
quarterfinals Friday. Brea-Olinda, co-champion of the Orange League, finished 
its season 22-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for Jacobs' mental fortitude in the fourth, Canyon might not 
be the team continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda catcher Mike Brambilla led off the inning with a double. Matt 
Weyant then dropped a prefect bunt along the third-base line that Jacobs 
fielded cleanly but made a wild throw to first that enabled Brambilla to score. 
Weyant went to third before Comanche right fielder Darren Chandler could 
retrieve the ball and return it to the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs was visibly flustered, but he refused to fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to bear down," Jacobs said. "I asked the Lord to just help me 
get the batters out. I knew I had to." 
</P>
<P>
 He struck out the next three batters, stranding Weyant at third. Sometimes 
positive thinking really does help. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was big," Canyon Coach Mike Najera said. "You can't give a team like 
Brea too many runs. We needed that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches, who produce runs at a dizzying pace, rewarded their tough 
teammate by scoring four runs on four hits in the top of the sixth inning. 
Canyon added one more in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs (7-0) pitched into the sixth inning, allowing one run on five hits and 
striking out seven. He was relieved by Scott Redfox, who held the Wildcats in 
check until Brambilla hit his eighth homer of the year in the bottom of the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore left-hander Bryan Robinson (8-2) took the loss, giving up four runs 
in 5 1/3 innings. Robinson was working on a one-hitter until the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambilla was the game's star on offense, going three for three with two runs 
scored and a home run. Unfortunately for the Wildcats, Brambilla did not 
receive much support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their pitching silenced our bats," Brea-Olinda Coach Steve Hiskey said. "We 
just didn't put enough balls in play." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division II games: 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley Valley View 8, Valencia 6 (8) -- Joe Secoda had two hits and 
drove in Ben Esque with the tying run with two out in the bottom of the seventh 
for Valencia (13-13). Art Francis had two doubles and two RBIs for the Tigers. 
Valley View is 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside North 7, Fullerton 6 -- Riverside North (15-11) scored two runs in 
the bottom of the seventh for the victory. Greg Freeman had four hits, 
including two triples, two RBI and two runs scored for visiting Fullerton 
(21-6).

DIVISION III BASEBALL; LA QUINTA'S TEAM APPROACH TOPS SADDLEBACK, 10-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 La Quinta took an unselfish approach to its Southern Section Division III 
baseball game Tuesday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight players combined for 12 hits as the Aztecs beat Saddleback, 10-1. Seven 
players also scored for La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 50th victory in the last two seasons for the Aztecs (25-3). La 
Quinta advances to play Bellflower St. John Bosco in the quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta was 25-6 last season and lost in the section title game to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The major benefactor was sophomore left-hander Joe Garcia. He gave up a run 
and three hits in six innings to improve to 7-0. He has allowed nine earned 
runs in 63 innings this season for an earned-run average of 1.00. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really composed," La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said about Garcia. "(If 
he's nervous), he doesn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta, the Garden Grove League champion and the second-seeded team, took 
advantage of three Saddleback errors and three hit batters in the first three 
innings for a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Linck had two hits and drove in two runs. He had a sacrifice fly to drive 
in the first of four runs in the third. Linck also had an RBI single in the 
fourth to put La Quinta ahead, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon London had a double and a single and drove in a run, Sean Carlson had two 
hits and drove in a run and C.J. Livernois had two hits, including a double, 
and scored three runs for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Livernois had a hit but also walked once, was hit by a pitch another time 
and scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough team to face," Demarest said. "It's not one guy all the time, 
which can be a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's lone offensive highlight came from a familiar source -- senior 
Tony Zuniga. He hit a home run, his fifth, with one out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback advanced to the second round with a 6-3 victory over Trabuco Hills, 
the Pacific Coast League champion, last Friday. The Roadrunners end the season 
16-12. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division III game: 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley 8, Tustin 5 -- Chris Tapia's RBI triple in the fourth inning 
scored the winning run for Antelope Valley, stopping Tustin's eight-game 
winning streak. The fourth-seeded Tillers were led by Ryan Winmill, who was two 
for four with one RBI and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers lost their last chance to score when Winmill lined into a double 
play with runners on first and second in the seventh inning.

SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS; FULLERTON UPSETS LAKEWOOD WITH TWO RUNS IN 
THE 12TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nadia Hoerner and Valerie Miller hit back-to-back triples and Amy Simpson 
singled in Miller in the 12th inning to give Fullerton a 2-0 victory over 
fourth-seeded Lakewood in the second round of the Southern Section Division II 
softball playoffs Tuesday at Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Fancuberta (16-12) gave up seven hits and was supported by a solid 
defensive effort. Lakewood (22-8) had runners at second and third in the first 
inning, but had only three runners reach second base the rest of the way. In 
the fifth, left fielder Simpson threw out Amy Lewis at the plate, preventing 
the tiebreaking run. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and McAulay each had two hits. Fullerton (16-13) will play host to 
Covina Charter Oak Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier La Serna 1, Laguna Hills 0 (18) -- With two outs in the bottom of the 
18th, La Serna (16-7) got two hits and then a bouncer over the infield to score 
the winning run, ending Laguna Hills' hopes of defending its division title. 
Alycia Stevens and Jennifer Arzola each had three hits for Laguna Hills 
(15-10). Windy Scofield (6-5) pitched all 17 2/3 innings for the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Redondo Union 1, Woodbridge 0 (17 innings) -- Woodbridge 
freshman Stephanie Bernritter had a no-hitter through 12 1/3 innings, didn't 
walk a batter and struck out 10 in 16 innings before leaving with arm 
stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Washington (10-3) replaced Bernritter and walked Selena Fine, who was 
bunted to second base. After shortstop Alison Johnsen threw out Leanna Evans at 
first base, and Fine broke for third, first baseman Keri Byrd's throw across 
the infield skidded past the third baseman and Fine scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen had three hits and a stolen base, adding to her section career record. 
She finished with 195. Winning pitcher Kari Martin struck out 16 and had the 
only hit for Redondo (20-5). Fourth-seeded Woodbridge finished 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance 2, Irvine 0 -- South Torrance's Rachelle Brown pitched a 
no-hitter to beat the third-seeded Vaqueros. Amy Young (17-7) struck out four 
and gave up seven hits for host Irvine (18-10). 
</P>
<P>
 In Division VI: 
</P>
<P>
 Temecula Linfield Christian 5, Liberty Christian 0 -- Linfield Christian's 
Janelle Gonzales (15-1) struck out 10 and walked one in a no-hitter.

 Kennedy (21-6-1) took a 1-0 lead in the third inning with some help from the 
Foothill pitching staff. Marie Gieron and Robin Tessman walked six in the first 
three innings. Gieron walked three in the second inning and escaped thanks to a 
popup and a strikeout. But she wasn't as fortunate in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 After Laurie Fritz struck out on a 3-2 pitch to open the inning, Gieron walked 
Jamie Pietranowicz. Tessman then came in and walked Crystal Geringer, moving 
Fritz into scoring position. Lisa Pitt followed with an RBI single to 
left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill bounced back with a two-out rally in the bottom of the inning, 
scoring three times despite only one hit leaving the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 hitter Lauren Bauer (two for two) started off with an infield single and 
stole second. Michelle Churnock followed with a ground ball to the left side. 
Shortstop Fritz went to her right to field the ball and attempted to tag Bauer 
sliding into third, but the Foothill freshman slid around the tag. Carley 
Rutledge singled to left to score Bauer. Robin Tessman followed with a ground 
ball to short, which Fritz threw away for a three-base error. Churnock and 
Rutledge scored on the play for a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gieron returned to the pitching circle in the fourth and gave up only two hits 
the rest of the way for the save. ERIC MADDY

 Today's pairings (at Cypress College): Division I -- Alhambra Keppel (17-0) 
vs. Garden Grove (15-1), 2:30 p.m.; Division II -- Long Beach Jordan (15-2) 
vs.Rosemead (13-1), 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champions: Division I -- Keppel; Division II -- Etiwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Keppel continues to dominate a sport introduced to the Southern 
Section in 1980. The Aztecs are going after their sixth title since 1987 and 
their fifth in a row. The team dominated the individual finals two weeks ago by 
winning three of five events. The leaders include Brian Tan and Nhi Phung, each 
of whom plays on two doubles teams. Rosemead should have the edge in the lower 
division. The Panthers were a Division I quarterfinalist last season before 
dropping down. They are coming off a 10-9 semifinal victory over second-seeded 
Hacienda Heights Wilson. ERIC SHEPARD

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: GRANT GETS IN FACE OF SYLMAR, COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Often, when a man shaves his mustache or beard, it takes a while for those 
around him to identify what's different. Friends of Grant High baseball Coach 
Jeremy Lawrence will have no trouble recognizing the change in him this week. 
He is sporting half a beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the Lancers began their bus trip to Sylmar to play what was 
perhaps their last game of the season, Lawrence told his team that if they 
could beat the highly regarded Spartans, he would shave half of his beard and 
remain lopsided for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think (Sylmar) would lose two in a row," Lawrence cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (11-12, 8-9 in league play) nearly knocked off Sylmar on May 9, but the 
Spartans scored four runs in the seventh to win, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Grant scored a 4-2 victory over the Spartans (24-5, 15-2). It 
was the second straight defeat for Sylmar, which had a 20-game winning streak 
snapped by Poly last week. MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Not This Time 
</P>
<P>
 Poly right-hander Jerry Delgado made sure it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado's two-run double snapped a 2-2 tie in the fifth inning against Sylmar 
last week, and the Parrots scored a 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been snake-bitten by them the last two years," Poly Coach Chuck Schwal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly was 0-5 against Sylmar, including two extra-inning, one-run losses this 
season. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Just Reloads 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a talent drain. Royal's volleyball team lost five of six starters, 
including three who signed with NCAA Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for a down year, right? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Ferguson plugged in a new crop of players who have led the 
Highlanders to the Southern Section Division II semifinals tonight against 
South Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not dependent on any one or two individuals," he said. "We have five 
horses and they all do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Josh White is the only returning starter. The new starters are Scott 
Hambly, Garrison Chaffee, Eric Carlsen, Matt Olsen and Danny Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Because of numerous errors in the official team scoring totals at the Southern 
Section track and field championships Saturday, the Channel Islands girls' team 
was incorrectly listed as tied for sixth place with Hart and Nogales with 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands actually scored 24 points, good for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau won the shotput (46 feet 6 1/2 inches) and was second in the 
discus (130-9), and Shawanda Hotchkiss finished fourth in the triple jump (36-1 
3/4) and fifth in the long jump (17-0) to account for 24 points -- awarded to 
the top six finishers on a 10-8-6-4-2-1 basis. MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 Given New Life 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Jones of North Hollywood and Jamarra Callahan of Cleveland will compete 
in the City Section track and field championships Thursday thanks in part to a 
City rule that allows for at-large berths in the preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones will run in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles and Callahan will compete 
in the 400 even though neither qualified in those events at their respective 
conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones did not compete in the Valley Pac-8 Conference finals because of surgery 
on his nose following a motorcycle accident. In the Northwest Valley Conference 
finals, Callahan was disqualified for a false start in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 The City allows each school to designate one athlete as an at-large entry in 
one running event and one field event in the City preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones ran 40.16 to finish second in his heat of the City preliminaries, and 
Callahan timed 60.25 to place third in her heat.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS; PACIFICA RIPS CYPRESS TO REACH 
QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago, it would have been a matchup between between the third- and 
fifth-ranked teams in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days ago, it was considered a matchup between two teams that could win the 
Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the Pacifica-Cypress matchup was a mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Pacifica did nothing wrong in a 9-0 Southern Section Division I 
victory at Cypress, a team that beat the Mariners in the Cypress tournament 
championship game, 2-1, early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But with much more on the line, freshman Toni Mascarenas (14-3, 0.10 
earned-run average) pitched 6 2/3 innings of no-hit ball and Pacifica (20-5-1) 
advanced to Thursday's quarterfinal against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't ever imagine us, in a game this big, getting this blown out," 
Cypress Coach Diane Pohl said. "It's shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the field, Pacifica Coach Rob Weil was asked how the rest 
of the division was supposed to interpret his team's play, which came on the 
heels of a 5-0 victory over Capistrano Valley. Are they that good? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just say that we're playing with a lot of confidence," Weil said. 
"Everyone is contributing." 
</P>
<P>
 And everything happened Pacifica's way on Tuesday. Every starter had a hit and 
four players -- Rachelle Breig, Autumn Gwinner, Amy Smith and Shelly Dunn -- 
had two hits each. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who had scored just enough runs to get by this year, took a 2-0 
lead in the second. Mascarenas singled and took second on an error; an out 
later, Smith singled home Mascarenas, and Dunn singled to left field. Ninth 
batter Kristin Freed (two RBIs) followed with a squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the biggest play of the game," Weil said. "I felt if we could get 
two runs, with the way Toni was pitching, we would be real tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pohl thought Cypress (18-6) deflated after Pacifica scored twice after two 
were out in the third. Consecutive errors by third baseman Christa Saindon and 
a single by Natasha Sisco made it 4-0. Sisco was batting .135, but was 
indicative of Pacifica's performance: The bottom-four batters in the lineup had 
six of the team's 13 hits and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica added five runs in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions committed four errors behind freshman pitcher Stacy Silva 
(15-5), but the Mariners still pushed across five earned runs -- which is three 
more than Mascarenas has allowed all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, barely beating the throw to first base from right field, had Cypress' 
only hit, with two out in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 2, El Toro 1 -- Paula Schoonover had an RBI single and Lynea 
Backlund and Laurie Gillis each scored to lead visiting Fountain Valley 
(17-8-1). Backlund (3-0) struck out seven and allowed one hit in 3 2/3 innings 
of relief. Jennifer Hamer had two hits for El Toro (22-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 2, Ventura Buena 1 -- Debbie Wilson (15-1) struck out five and 
allowed nine hits for second-seeded Los Alamitos (23-4) at Ventura. Sheri 
Bergeron drove in the go-ahead run in the fourth inning. The game ended when 
second baseman Amanda Peterson threw out Jennifer Peck at home. Los Alamitos 
will play host to Foothill on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 6, Garden Grove 1 -- Top-seeded Marina (23-2) won its 13th straight and 
will play Agoura or San Marcos in the quarterfinals. Agoura and San Marcos will 
resume their game today tied, 1-1, in the 19th inning. Marcy Crouch (19-2) 
struck out eight and gave up five hits -- including three to Jennifer Johnson. 
Jenny Ramirez had a pinch-hit RBI single for Garden Grove (18-12).

 Today's pairings (at Cypress College): Division I -- Alhambra Keppel (17-0) 
vs. Garden Grove (15-1), 2:30 p.m.; Division II -- Long Beach Jordan (15-2) 
vs.Rosemead (13-1), 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champions: Division I -- Keppel; Division II -- Etiwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Garden Grove will have its hands full in the Division I championship; 
Keppel has won its last 96 matches, dominating a sport that was introduced to 
the Southern Section in 1980. The Aztecs are going after their sixth title 
since 1987 and their fifth in a row. The team dominated the individual finals 
two weeks ago by winning three of five events. The leaders include Brian Tan 
and Nhi Phung, who each play on two doubles teams. The third-seeded Argonauts 
are riding high after defeating second-seeded La Puente Nogales, 10-9, in the 
semifinals. Crucial victories came from their top girls' doubles team of Lien 
Ly and Huong Nguyen, who swept both matches on Monday, and junior Judy Pak, who 
is undefeated in girls' singles during the playoffs. Argonauts Coach Vicki 
Toutz says she believes her team's balance will be a key in the match. Rosemead 
should have the edge in the lower division. The Panthers were a Division I 
quarterfinalist last season. They are coming off a 10-9 semifinal victory over 
second-seeded Hacienda Heights Wilson. ERIC SHEPARD and JANE HUANG

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: SAFE BOATING NEEDED ON HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memorial Day weekend, one of the busiest of the boating season, is also one of 
the deadliest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people will die in boating accidents this holiday weekend and more 
than 800 will die in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tragically, 80% of the victims aren't wearing life jackets," said Richard 
Schwartz, president of the Boat Owners Assn. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz added that alcohol is a factor in about 50% of boating deaths 
nationwide and improper operation is a factor in a third of the fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 BOAT/U.S. suggests boaters keep abreast of weather forecasts and conditions; 
keep an eye out for other boaters, swimmers, skiers and objects in the water; 
make sure the boat isn't overloaded, and that there is U.S. Coast 
Guard-approved gear enough for everyone aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The week of June 5-11 has been designated "National Safe Boating Week," but 
there is no reason to wait until then to start playing it safe. On Memorial Day 
weekend in 1993, there were 45 boating-related accidents, 21 injuries and one 
death in California. Throughout the year, 67 people died as a result of boating 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say alcohol played a key role in more than half the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, of 12 alcohol-related fatalities, eight were people who fell 
overboard after drinking, and five of eight were passengers," said John R. 
Banuelos, director of the California Department of Boating and Waterways. "So 
even if the operator is sober, the passenger is at risk if he or she has been 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 People do seem to be thinking more clearly, however. In 1989, alcohol played a 
role in 59% of boating deaths in California. That figure dropped to 33% last 
year. Of course, new and stricter laws might also be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER FISHING -- The water has been warming slowly off the Southland 
coast, and the fishing is also heating up. The long-awaited yellowtail bite 
showed some consistency in the last week at San Clemente Island, with boats 
tallying impressive counts on the weekend and again on Tuesday. The Pacifica 
out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing on Tuesday reported a count of 71 yellowtail 
ranging from five to 20 pounds and four white seabass. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the white seabass have been pushing 40 pounds. Mark Montes of Lomita 
boated one of the biggest, a 49-pounder, while aboard the Dreamer last 
Thursday. More locally, aboard half- and three-quarter-day boats, light-tackle 
anglers have been enjoying the best barracuda bite all year off the Newport and 
Huntington Beach coast and at the northern Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Marlin flags are flying again. It's been a slow month, but a 
busy week off the Baja peninsula, where striped marlin are back on the feed. An 
unusually large striper, weighing in at 223 pounds, was caught aboard the 
Juanita. Swordfish are being seen, but few are being caught. One was lost after 
a three-hour fight. Yellowfin tuna, mostly football-size, are abundant, 
although wahoo and dorado have yet to arrive in force.  
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Striped marlin and tuna are keeping anglers busy, but fishing is 
far from spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 La Paz: The best fishing remains at Cerralvo Island, for pargo and cabrilla, 
while unseasonably cool water is keeping the more exotic dorado, tuna and 
marlin from making it this far north. Angler Ken Allen of Long Beach caught an 
almaco jack -- previously categorized and commonly referred to as a Pacific 
amberjack -- estimated at 130-140 pounds, which could have qualified for an 
all-tackle world record had it been kept and officially weighed. "I had a scale 
on the boat that goes to 100 pounds and it bottomed it out," Allen said. 
"Nobody knew where we could find a scale so I just gave it to the captain. Oh 
well." The all-tackle record is a 132-pounder caught in 1964 in the La Paz 
area. Allen used 50-pound-test line, but there is no line-class category for 
the species. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: Top catch was aboard the Red Rooster III at the 
Revillagigedo Islands south of Cabo San Lucas: a 361-pound yellowfin tuna -- 
the largest of the season -- by Bob Schultz of Signal Hill. The boat returned 
Saturday with 148 tuna averaging 150 pounds, 107 wahoo and 35 grouper. A 
400-pound blue marlin was caught and released. There are reports of albacore 
schools 650 miles west of San Diego and the fish are moving slowly toward the 
coast. At their current rate of travel, they could be within range of the fleet 
by the end of June.  
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- The California Fish and Game Commission approved deer hunting 
regulations for 1994-95 and established dates, tag quotas and modified some 
hunting zones, including the expansion of zone X9a, the popular southern Mono 
County zone. The earliest hunts -- in zones X9a and X9b, in the Inyo County 
foothills -- open Sept. 17 and run through Oct. 10. Instructions on tag 
applications are explained in the Department of Fish and Game's 1994 big-game 
hunting booklet, available in sporting goods stores. Applications for X zones 
and other tag drawings must be received at the DFG's License and Revenue Branch 
office in Sacramento by 5 p.m. June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Paddle Sports Expo '94, the West Coast's largest paddling event 
featuring clinics and tryouts on more than 100 kayaks, will be held June 4 from 
9 a.m.-5 p.m. at Newport Dunes in Newport Beach. Cost is $7, $3 for seniors and 
free for children 12 and under. Details: (714) 261-0200. . . . Art's Fishing 
Tackle in Gardena is holding a two-part rod-building clinic June 4 from 11 
a.m.-1 p.m. and 2-4 p.m. Details: (310) 323-3339. . . . The television show 
"Sportfishing With Dan Hernandez" says there is limited space for anglers who 
want to be part of the taping of an episode featuring San Clemente or Catalina 
Island aboard the Pacifica out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing on June 4. Cost is 
$95. Details: (213) 721-5357.

BOND YIELDS, COMMODITIES DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields fell as plunging commodity prices and a rising dollar 
helped lessen concern that inflation might accelerate. Stocks, encouraged by 
the bond market, closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year bond yield fell sharply at the opening but rose a bit, 
partly in reaction to weaker-than-expected demand for $17 billion in two-year 
notes auctioned Tuesday afternoon by the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's yield closed at 7.39%, down from Monday's 7.43%. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, closed up 13/32 point, or $4.06 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The high yield for the two-year notes at the auction was 5.94%, the highest 
since two-year notes sold for 6.01% on Oct. 23, 1991. In addition, some market 
participants took profits on the morning's increases, which were tied to 
commodity prices and the performance of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain in the Midwest drove soybean futures prices down sharply Tuesday, 
triggering steep declines in many commodity prices one day after a broad 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB index of 21 agricultural and industrial commodities, is viewed as a 
gauge of inflation and is commonly watched in the bond market because inflation 
erodes the value of fixed-term investments. The index fell 3.67 points to 
234.69. The index had vaulted 4.67 points Monday to its highest level in 3 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to soybeans, grain, cocoa, coffee, precious metals, hog and crude 
oil prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, news that the United States and Japan will resume formal trade talks 
sent the dollar sharply higher against most major currencies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar climbed to 104.65 Japanese yen from 
104.36 yen Monday. Against the German mark, the dollar was quoted at 1.655 
marks, up from 1.645 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks moved ahead, tracking the bond market's rebound. Also 
helping sentiment was the dollars sharp rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling to collect profits in the stocks of several big name companies 
restrained the Dow Jones industrial average, which settled for a slim gain. The 
popular gauge of blue-chip stock performance edged up 2.76 to 3,745.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader-market measures fared better. The New York Stock Exchange composite 
index rose 0.62 to 251.40 and Standard & Poor's 500 stock index increased 1.61 
to 454.81. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller companies gained 6.52 points at 
731.47. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Big Board, advancing issues beat declines by about 1,245 to 915. Volume 
on the NYSE floor totaled 280.02 million shares, up from 249.42 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS lost 18 to 270 after falling 15 1/2 on Monday on news it is losing eight 
television affiliates to rival Fox Network. Goldman Sachs removed CBS from its 
recommended list, citing the loss of the affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 * New World Communications, the owner of the defecting stations, gained 2 1/8 
to 12 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical Care America jumped 3 7/8 to 27 1/4 on its plan to merge with 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, which fell 5/8 to 39 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merck ended up 5/8 to 30 7/8, off a high of 32 1/4, in heavy trading after 
the resignation of the head of its Medco unit fueled speculation about who will 
be named Merck's new CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris fell 1 3/8 to 53 7/8 in active trading ahead of its board 
meeting today. The stock has rallied recently on speculation that the company 
may separate its food and tobacco businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dell Computer rose 3 to 29 after posting solid first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended the session 
2.26% lower, with share prices under pressure from weak debt markets and DAX 
futures prices, dealers said. The DAX average ended at 2,198.72, down 50.93 
points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average fell 19.3 points to 3,089.1, 
while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average finished up 53.41 points at 20,622.12, 
while 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 37.09 points, to end at 2,468.52, the session 
high.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHY BOND BULLS NEED TO WAKE UP, SMELL THE COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone trying to sell you a bond nowadays will tell you that the recent jump 
in long-term interest rates is a false alarm, at least as far as inflation is 
concerned. There is no inflation to speak of, the bond bulls insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, you're a coffee drinker. The price of a pound of coffee on 
futures markets has rocketed from 72 cents at the start of the year to $1.33 
now -- an 85% gain -- as bean production has fallen drastically in South 
America and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Philip Morris Cos.' General Foods division just announced that it 
is boosting the retail list price of a can of regular Maxwell House coffee from 
$2 to about $2.50, or 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities are the proverbial fly in the ointment of the no-inflation crowd 
this year. Though prices of crops, metals, wood products and other basic 
agricultural and industrial supplies are constantly in flux, their general 
direction has been unmistakably up lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities rocketed on Monday 
to a 3 1/2-year high, causing a mini-panic in the bond market. On Tuesday, the 
CRB index fell back 1.5%, but it's still up nearly 4% year-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB index is heavily weighted toward grain prices, so it has been surging 
in recent weeks as fears about a dry Midwest spring (and already low 
inventories of key grains) have driven crop futures prices higher. Meanwhile, 
another commodity index -- the Journal of Commerce Industrial index, which 
tracks prices of metals such as aluminum and zinc -- also has been advancing 
strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, rising commodity costs aren't translating into a higher consumer price 
index, the most closely watched inflation index. The bond bulls argue that 
commodities' rally is a mere blip, and that the world economy isn't strong 
enough to support higher raw materials prices, let alone higher prices for 
finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contend commodities' recent gains are the work of professional traders, 
not the result of "real" demand. There may be some truth to that. Caroline Van, 
analyst at hedge-fund tracker International Advisory Group in Nashville, says 
her firm is increasingly hearing from big investors who want to place money 
with hedge funds that trade in commodities. "They're interested in commodities 
as a (new) asset class," Van says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, well-known hedge fund manager Mark Strome believes metals 
such as copper, nickel and aluminum are poised for dramatic price rises. "I 
think this is the opportunity" in financial markets in '94, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But for metals prices to surge, Strome concedes, real demand -- from busier 
factories churning out more goods -- will have to be there worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Genetski, who runs a Chicago-based economic advisory firm bearing his 
name, predicts that the No. 1 surprise this year will be a stronger U.S. 
economy than Wall Street now foresees. The Federal Reserve Board, Genetski 
argues, allowed money to be so loose for so long (1991 to 1993) that the seeds 
of robust future business and consumer spending are already sown. 
</P>
<P>
 While the conventional wisdom is that the Fed's credit-tightening moves this 
year will slow the economy, Genetski points to the surge in bank loan demand 
from business borrowers in recent months as evidence that the economic 
expansion is gaining steam, not losing it. Commercial and industrial loans 
outstanding, which plunged from 1991 through '93, have jumped to $605 billion 
now from $585 billion at Jan. 1, even as rates have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher demand for goods and services -- not just in America, but also now in 
recovering Europe -- is what's behind the upward pressure on prices of many 
once-glutted commodities, Genetski says. As those higher prices stick, and work 
their way into the cost of products at retail (like coffee), he believes the 2% 
to 3% inflation of recent years will turn into 5% inflation in 1995 and 6% in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 What about global competition and rising productivity? Those influences ought 
to suppress price increases, says investment strategist Katherine Hensel at 
Lehman Bros. in New York. Plus, she notes that raw materials generally account 
for only one-third of manufacturing costs; labor is two-thirds, and there's 
certainly no shortage of labor around the world, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Genetski and other economy-bulls say the strength in commodities this 
year is the inflation bell tolling -- softly so far, but unmistakable.

RAPIST HELD IN ORANGE COUNTY MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers were returning from Northern California on Tuesday with a 
paroled rapist in custody for questioning about the beating murder of a 
Huntington Beach woman last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for Edward Patrick Morgan, 28, ended Monday night in Quincy, where 
Plumas County deputies chased him down after he left the home of Sonya Marvin, 
22, who was charged Tuesday with harboring a wanted felon. 
</P>
<P>
 The battered body of Leonora Annette Wong, 23, was found in Orange early 
Friday in a parking lot across from the Australian Beach Club, where she and a 
friend had gone Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confiscated a videotape from a surveillance camera outside a business 
near the club, and another recorded by a bar patron Thursday. Lt. Timm Browne, 
a police spokesman, confirmed Tuesday that the tapes were being held as 
evidence, but he declined to discuss what they showed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police had presented evidence to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King said that he expected charges to be filed 
today, but that authorities were reviewing the case and he could not specify 
the charges in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's friend, Rebecca Klein, saw her leaving the bar about 1 a.m. Friday with 
a man matching Morgan's description. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately knew something was wrong," Klein said. "She wouldn't just walk 
away and leave." She alerted police, who later found Wong's body and began 
looking for the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was convicted of rape in 1985 and sent to the California Institution 
for Men in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 He went back to prison in April, 1991, for unlawful sex with a minor. Two 
months ago, Morgan was released from Folsom Prison after serving a term for 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad Mr. Morgan is in custody, and hopefully he'll never be released 
again," said Pat Thayer, one of the detectives who went to Quincy for Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Quincy said Marvin, who was accused of hiding the rapist, had 
never been in trouble with the law. She works as a typesetter at a local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him, that's all you need to know," Marvin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Burhop, a former Folsom cellmate of Morgan, also was arrested in Quincy 
on Monday for investigation of harboring a felon and violating parole. He was 
being held without bail Tuesday.

ROBERT HOLZER; GEOPHYSICIST, UCLA DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert E. Holzer, a physicist, geophysicist and educator who helped pioneer 
the tracking of thunderstorms, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzer, a former UCLA professor, died Thursday at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He began studying electrical charges in lightning in the late 1930s and within 
a decade determined that storms could be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without leaving a shack in the remote Arctic waste," he said in 1948, "a 
scientist may be able to keep track of day-to-day thunderstorm activity over an 
entire continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Nov. 21, 1906, in Portland, Ore., Holzer earned a bachelor's degree in 
physics from Reed College and a doctorate in physics from UC Berkeley. He was a 
National Research Fellow at the University of Chicago, and taught at Fenn 
College, UC Berkeley and the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, Holzer moved to Southern California to head the physics department at 
Pomona College. A year later he was one of the first to join UCLA's new 
Institute of Geophysics. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzer taught geophysics, space physics and meteorology at UCLA until his 
retirement in 1974. Holzer served as dean of physical sciences at the 
university and was elected chairman of the statewide UC Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a professor emeritus, he continued his research until his death. Holzer 
also helped lead the scientific community into space research. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzer is survived by his wife, Wilma; a daughter, Roberta Ankenbauer; two 
sons, William and Thomas Holzer, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to a charity of 
the donor's choice.

FLOWERS BEGINS MARKETING TAPES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Gennifer Flowers wanted Tuesday was to explain why Americans should pay 
$19.95 to hear 57 minutes of taped phone talk in which Bill Clinton calls her 
"darlin' " and "babe," but never calls her his lover. 
</P>
<P>
 She got that and much more at her news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers got gaped at by delegates to the state Republican Convention, who, 
coincidentally, were convening one floor below at the Sheraton New York Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 She got pushed into a corner when a fight broke out among television crews 
trying to follow her. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers is releasing "Setting the Record Straight," two cassette tapes and a 
transcript of conversations with Clinton in 1990-91. She says she secretly 
recorded the calls to protect herself after reporters began asking about her 
allegations of an affair with Clinton, which she says began in the late '70s 
and ended in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 For those wondering whether the new tapes are worth the money: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 12 minutes of them were thoroughly aired during the last presidential 
campaign; 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton, who went on television at the time and admitted to having had 
marital problems, never admits on the tapes to an affair with Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a commentary that accompanies the tapes, Flowers says to "listen carefully 
to his phrasing. Not just what he says, but how he says it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone is decidedly cozy, but the additional 45 minutes of recording do not 
contain much new; why is she reviving the issue? 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the publication of her story in a supermarket tabloid, 
Flowers said, "I have been vilified by the mainstream media" and "felt the 
burning frustration" of what she calls an attempt by Clinton supporters to 
cover up her story.

<P>
 In an effort to speed economic recovery from the Jan. 17 earthquake, business 
owners from Canoga Park and Reseda will attend a revitalization workshop on 
June 3 and June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, which was announced by Councilwoman Laura Chick, will address 
issues of economic revitalization, community cleanup, landscaping, crime and 
safety and historic preservation in the central business districts of Canoga 
Park and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Bernstein, spokesperson for Chick said the focus will primarily be 
economic. 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting a high level of participation, Tom Hillborn, president of the Reseda 
Chamber of Commerce, said, "Part of what will make this very successful is the 
timing of it. The area is in massive devastation. . . . Everyone sees the 
necessities of revitalizing the area." MAKI BECKER

BARTINE ZANE, 96; SILENT FILM AND TV ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bartine Zane, an actress whose career began in silent films opposite Buster 
Keaton and later included a return to the profession as a septuagenarian, has 
died. She was 96. 
</P>
<P>
 A Burbank resident since 1951, Miss Zane died Friday at Saint Joseph Medical 
Center of congestive heart failure, said her longtime friend, Randy Sills. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Feb. 9, 1898, in Robeline, La., she settled in Los Angeles with her 
family in 1916. She landed her first silent film job a short time later after 
responding to an open call audition for Famous Players-Lasky. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1920, Miss Zane starred opposite Buster Keaton in "The High Sign," one of 
the first movies Keaton made at his own studio. According to Sills, Keaton 
taught the young woman to drive one evening after encountering her when he was 
on his way to a party at Fatty Arbuckle's. Thinking that the infamous parties 
at Arbuckle's were inappropriate for her, the comedian quickly explained the 
controls and told her to take his car home. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next several years, she appeared in silent films starring such 
luminaries as Gloria Swanson, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy and Lon Chaney. She 
retired in 1928 after marrying department store manager Ralph Zane. The couple 
were married 40 years, until Zane's death in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up acting, she worked in a dressmaking shop on Hollywood 
Boulevard with her mother, supplying clothes for many of her former Tinseltown 
colleagues. During World War II, she worked as a volunteer at Birmingham 
Hospital (later Birmingham High School) in Van Nuys. She also volunteered at 
Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the death of her husband, friends encouraged her to return to 
acting. Soon after, she landed a part in a commercial for Boone's Farm Wines as 
a motorcycle-riding granny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to start it and rev it up," she told The Times in 1983, "but they'd 
catch me on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 She later made appearances on television in "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and 
"Benson" and in such movies as Disney's "The Devil and Max Devlin," playing an 
angel. She also taped a handful of commercials for companies such as Orowheat 
and Grandma's Cookies, and made a popular spot for a phone company in which she 
gently reminded people to call their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Zane is survived by no immediate relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral will be held 3 p.m. Thursday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, 6300 
Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be 
made to the American Heart Assn.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GRANVILLE FOR CLERK-RECORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in a decade, Orange County voters will have the opportunity 
to vote for one person to hold the combined job of county clerk and recorder. 
The best candidate for the countywide post is Gary L. Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville took a step nearly unheard-of for an elected official when he 
recommended that his office of county clerk be merged with the recorder's 
office to save money. The Board of Supervisors heeded the suggestion last year, 
and Granville has helped fold the clerk's office, where he supervised more than 
300 staffers handling paperwork for the courts in the county, into the 
recorder's office. The recorder's staff registers births, deaths, marriages and 
property records. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the four candidates for the combined county clerk-recorder is the 
incumbent recorder, Lee Branch, who should have left office long ago and who 
should now be rejected by the voters. Judges concerned by his poor management 
of the combined office a decade ago lambasted Branch then. The supervisors 
broke the office in two, let Branch stay as recorder and appointed Granville 
clerk. The county clerk's office improved markedly; morale gained, the public 
received better service, the judges were satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the county personnel department found that morale suffered 
in the recorder's office when Branch became involved personally with a woman 
who worked for him. In an unprecedented move, the supervisors this year 
censured Branch and recommended that the county grand jury determine whether he 
should be removed. The issue remains unresolved; the voters should remove 
Branch even if the grand jury does not take the first step. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville was a businessman and a newspaper reporter in Orange County before 
becoming an aide to a county supervisor. After being appointed county clerk, he 
won elections for the post in 1986 and 1990. His tenure ends in December when 
the post is combined. Granville has an impressive list of endorsements. His 
ability to get along with workers and supervisors at every level of government 
and his efficiency on the job have earned him the unenviable task of again 
cleaning up after Branch.

 Bond yields closed slightly lower Tuesday as the latest surge in commodity 
prices gave way to some profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, encouraged by the bond market and by a stronger dollar, also rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain in the Midwest drove soybean futures prices down sharply Tuesday, 
triggering steep declines in many other commodity prices one day after a broad 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 agricultural and industrial 
commodities, which had rocketed 4.67 points on Monday to its highest level 
since October, 1990, gave back 3.67 points to 234.69 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture Department meteorologist Norton Strommen said the rain this week 
in the central and eastern Corn Belt will improve crop prospects threatened by 
a severe lack of moisture over the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, July soybean futures tumbled 37.25 cents to $6.95 a bushel at the 
Board of Trade. July corn sank 8 cents to $2.67 1/4, July wheat fell 7 cents to 
$3.29 3/4, and July oats declined 4 cents to $1.23 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold followed grains lower: June gold futures dropped $2.60 to $387.30 an 
ounce on the New York Merc. Oil prices also eased. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, which had jumped from 
7.30% to 7.43% on Monday, plunged at the opening as commodities fell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bond rally ebbed as the day wore on. At the close, the T-bond yield 
was 7.39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders expressed some disappointment over the Treasury's auction of $17 
billion in two-year notes Tuesday. The high yield for the notes was 5.94%, the 
highest since October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury will sell new five-year notes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, news that the United States and Japan will resume formal trade 
talks sent the dollar up against most major currencies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York the dollar climbed to 104.65 Japanese yen from 104.36 yen Monday. 
Against the German mark, the dollar was quoted at 1.655 marks, up from 1.645. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks moved ahead, tracking the bond market's rebound and the 
stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit taking in some blue chips restrained the Dow industrial average, which 
settled for a slim gain, adding just 2.76 points to 3,745.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures fared better. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 
1.62 points to 454.81, and the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 
jumped 6.52 points to 731.47. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Big Board, advancing issues beat losers by 12 to 9. Volume on the NYSE 
floor totaled 280 million shares, up from 249 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks hit by profit taking included Caterpillar, off 2 1/4 to 
108 1/4; Deere, down 2 3/8 to 71 5/8, and Alcoa, off 1 to 69 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also on the downside, CBS plunged 18 to 270 after falling 15 1/2 on Monday 
on news it is losing eight television affiliates to rival News Corp.'s Fox 
Network. Goldman Sachs removed CBS from its recommended list, citing the loss 
of the affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also falling was Cap Cities/ABC, off 17 3/4 to 735 1/2, while News Corp. 
jumped 2 to 54 7/8 and New World Communications, the beneficiary of the 
defecting stations, soared 2 1/8 to 12 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's winners, many tech stocks rebounded. IBM jumped 1 3/8 to 63 
1/8, AST Research gained 1 1/2 to 16 3/4 and Dell Computer shot up 3 to 29. 
Dell posted solid first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical Care America soared 3 7/8 to 27 1/4 on its plan to merge with 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, which fell 5/8 to 39 1/8. Also in the health care 
area, Merck added 5/8 to 30 7/8 after trading as high as 32 1/4. The 
resignation of the head of Merck's Medco unit fueled speculation about who will 
be named Merck's new CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. Frankfurt's DAX index tumbled 50.93 points, or 
2.3%, to 2,198.72, reacting to news of a 15.8% rise in Germany's April money 
supply and comments by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer ruling out "for the 
time being" more interest rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index fell 19.3 points to 3,089.1, while Tokyo's 
Nikkei average finished up 53.41 points at 20,622.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 37.09 points to end at 2,468.52, the session 
high.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; ON-LINE FORUMS CAN PROVIDE HELP WITH NAGGING PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even the most experienced computer users sometimes need help. When I need help 
with a product, I typically start by calling the manufacturer's technical 
support department. I prefer this option because it allows for give-and-take 
between me and the technician. 
</P>
<P>
 But telephone support has its drawbacks: Some companies charge for it; often 
it's a long-distance call; sometimes you can't even get through. I don't know 
what's worse, staying on hold or having to leave a number hoping that a 
technician will call you back and actually reach you. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to use an on-line service or computer bulletin board to seek 
help from the company or a fellow user. Many hardware and software companies 
operate forums on the commercial on-line services, and some have their own 
dial-up bulletin boards. You'll probably have to pay long-distance charges to 
dial into their boards, but you'll pay an hourly on-line fee if you dial into 
one of the commercial on-line services. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, which charges up to $9.60 an hour (at 9,600 or 14,400 bits per 
second) to access its forums, is by far the most popular service for hardware 
and software support. America Online ($3.50 an hour) comes in second. Prodigy 
($3.60 an hour for bulletin board access) is gearing up its product support 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the major software and hardware vendors, including Microsoft, 
WordPerfect, Lotus, IBM, Apple, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, operate CompuServe 
forums where company representatives provide help to customers. In many cases, 
fellow users are also willing to help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, these fellow users often know more than the company representatives. 
And because they're not on the company payroll, they're more than willing to 
share their frustrations, report bugs and suggest techniques to get around the 
product's limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before posting a question, browse through the board to see if your question 
has already been answered. Most company forums are organized by product and 
further broken down by topic. If you do ask a question, be sure to post it in 
the right spot and use a descriptive subject line. Don't just type "Help Me." 
Enter a subject line such as "Microsoft Word Printing Problem" or "Speadsheet 
for Mac -- What's Best?" 
</P>
<P>
 Intuit, which publishes the popular Quicken personal financial management 
software for DOS, Windows and Mac, is one of the many software companies on 
CompuServe. One Quicken user posted a query about her frustrations in trying to 
use the program to manage her 401(k) retirement plan. Several others 
immediately responded that they too had run into this problem, and they offered 
work-arounds to make up for the program's limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to messages, the forums offer files you can download. Last month I 
was having trouble with my video display, which I traced to an out-of-date 
video driver for my Diamond VGA card. So I signed on to Diamond's CompuServe 
forum and downloaded the newest software driver, at no cost other than 
CompuServe's connect fee. My problem was solved, and I never had to leave my 
house or wait for someone to send me a disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Symantec, which publishes the popular Norton Utility programs for the PC and 
Mac, uses its on-line forums to provide customers with interim program updates. 
These are not new versions of the programs (there's a charge for those) but 
minor bug fixes or special files, such as one that lets its anti-virus program 
tackle viruses that weren't around when the software was last updated. 
</P>
<P>
 Forums are also great places to find add-ons, macros and templates to enhance 
popular programs such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, Ami Pro, Excel and Lotus 
1-2-3. In many cases, these files will add functionality that simply wasn't 
built into the program itself. Some are provided by the software publisher, but 
many come from fellow users or developers of shareware, who allow you to 
download their handiwork freely. You're required to pay if you keep any 
shareware permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few companies offer support via the Internet, but I expect that to 
change over the next few years. There are, however, a number of "newsgroups" 
(forums) where users discuss software and hardware. It's also possible to 
download files (such as video drivers and templates) via the Internet, but you 
have to know where to look and how use the file transfer protocol (ftp). 
Locating files on the Internet can be tricky, but one resource, called Archie, 
can help you find a file if you know its name. If you don't know exactly what 
you're looking for or you're not network-savvy, you're better off using one of 
the commercial on-line services.

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SENSOR 
MAY BE THE SUSHI SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sushi sensor: Concern over complaints about illnesses related to eating raw 
seafood have spurred University of Alaska, Fairbanks, scientists to developing 
a way to detect parasites that occur naturally in fish. The parasites are not 
usually harmful in well-cooked fish, but they cause problems when fish is eaten 
raw or underdone. 
</P>
<P>
 The parasites are small and extremely difficult to see. Typically, they are 
found by shining a bright light on a fillet. They show up as dark spots against 
the bright background and are removed by hand. This labor-intensive process can 
account for half the cost of producing a fillet. The University's patented 
technology uses an electronic sensor that takes advantage of the natural 
ability of fish flesh to conduct electricity. Since a typical cod fillet, for 
example, is many times better at conducting electricity than parasites are, the 
parasites show up as voids in the magnetic field. The sensor has been tested 
only on cod and pollock, but it may prove helpful with salmon, whose opaque 
meat makes the parasites difficult to distinguish.

 Bring up the chart: Anyone who has been shuttled from medical specialist to 
medical specialist will appreciate the problem of making sure the records make 
the trip as well. First Data Corp., which already processes information for the 
credit card, consumer funds transfer, mutual funds, receivables management and 
cable television industries, thinks it has the answer with its First Empower 
database for patient information.  
</P>
<P>
 First Data's Health System Group, based in Charlotte, N.C., designed First 
Empower to handle not only text, but voices and images as well. This multimedia 
capability allows the database to contain not only text, but radiology, 
ultrasound and arteriogram images; patient photographs, and on-line voice 
annotation. The display system resembles a typical medical chart. All the 
doctor has to do is click on one of the "tabs" to bring up lab test and 
radiology results, past orders and the like.  
</P>
<P>
 First Data, aware of fears that privacy could be compromised, says it is 
taking elaborate measures to make sure medical records go only to those 
authorized to receive them, and it is taking extra steps on issues such as HIV 
status and pregnancy. First Empower is being tested at several hospitals in the 
East.

 High-tech diapers: If you thought supercomputers were only used for modeling 
complex phenomena such as weather patterns or molecular structures, think 
again. Dow Chemical used a Cray-2 supercomputer at the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
and a high-performance Silicon Graphics workstation to test a design for an 
improved disposable diaper. The design in question uses Dow's Drytech 
super-absorbent polymer particles distributed in a fluff pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as computers can visualize storms, the numerical results of the diaper 
tests over time were converted into images and animated to show researchers 
just what happens inside a baby diaper. The Dow visualizations showed the 
concentration of liquid and its motion over a period of time (12 seconds) using 
color codes ranging from violet (wet) to brown (dry). The polymer particles 
were represented as spheres. As the liquid hit the particles, the violet turned 
brown, so researchers knew that a diaper design for drier bottoms was achieved. 
No word yet from any babies.

 Virtual access: If virtual reality technology can train airplane pilots, can 
it also help firms determine whether their facilities are accessible by 
wheelchair? 
</P>
<P>
 While VR equipment is still expensive and often unwieldy, such applications 
are beginning to emerge. Chicago-based Prairie Virtual Systems Corp. has 
already developed a program to help architects design wheelchair-friendly 
buildings. The program lets the user experience a virtual environment from the 
perspective of a person in a wheelchair. Do doors open correctly? Are sinks at 
the right height? The program was used last summer to test plans for a hospital 
in Aurora, Ill., where architects found the sinks protruded too far. 
</P>
<P>
 These questions will be discussed at the annual "Virtual Reality and 
Disabilities" conference, sponsored by the Institute for Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers and Cal State Northridge's Center on Disabilities. It is 
set for June 8-10 at the San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel.

 Thanks to Internet mailing lists, you can be in constant contact with people 
from Paris to Perth who share the same interests.Such mailing lists number in 
the thousands; unlike the Internet's "newsgroups," which function as forums, 
the material on mailing lists comes to you. You don't even need an Internet 
account; almost any electronic mail address will do. 
</P>
<P>
 There are mailing lists for almost everybody. For scholarly discussion of 
schizophrenia, for instance, send e-mail to listserv@umab.bitnet with the 
message subscribe schiz-l (your name). In fact, to join any mailing list, you 
typically send a message containing the word subscribe to an electronic 
postmaster, known as a listserver. Once you're subscribed, you'll receive 
messages from everyone on the list, and you can respond to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications to list members take a different address than list 
housekeeping, so note the listserver address in case you want to cancel your 
subscription. (Just send a message unsubscribe or signoff to the listserver.) 
</P>
<P>
 For a list of mailing lists, send e-mail to listserv@bitnic.bitnet with the 
message list global. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, you may find it 
necessary to limit your subscriptions to a couple of lists. Some lists are 
echoed as newsgroups and may be easier to read that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some on-line services charge a small fee when e-mail is received from 
the Internet; check with your service before subscribing to any mailing list.

VENTURA URGES MORE STUDY ON FUNDING FOR AVENUE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite repeated requests by Ventura Avenue residents for more money to 
maintain neighborhood streets and sidewalks, the Ventura City Council has 
postponed a request by one of its members to make repairs in the area a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 As the council reviewed the 1994-95 budget at Monday's meeting, City 
Councilman Gary Tuttle proposed shifting the city's street maintenance 
allocations by taking money usually designated for other parts of Ventura and 
concentrating the funds on the crumbling roads and sidewalks of northwestern 
Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have the council make a commitment to give the Avenue first 
choice," Tuttle said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, in unanimously approving the $103-million budget late Monday, City 
Council members said they needed more information on how the city's 
computerized system selects streets and sidewalks for priority funding before 
deciding whether to favor one area of the city over another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would support evaluating the entire city," said Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures. "I would hate for us, out of an emotional concern, to do this now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The budget approved Monday sets aside $1.7 million for street maintenance and 
$50,000 for sidewalk maintenance in the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Ventura public works officials survey streets and plug 
information on road conditions into a computer, which produces an annual 
maintenance list showing which blocks and sidewalks are most in need of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuttle said that process may not be as scientific and objective as it 
appears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (streets and sidewalks on the Avenue) get a little less priority than 
other neighborhoods," he said Tuesday. "I mean, just look at who elects people, 
where the votes are in this city, who makes donations to the campaigns, and 
then look at where those people live." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he doubted that politicians were more likely to give 
preference to streets where the town's wealthier residents live. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's true or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's council members came under increasing pressure to pay attention to 
the neighborhood around Ventura Avenue, after a series of random, night-time 
shootings left residents frightened and clamoring for more city help in dealing 
with crime and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At an emotional community forum two weeks ago, residents blasted the city for 
skimping on police protection and failing to repair potholes and build 
sidewalks. Meanwhile, residents charged, streets in the city's more affluent 
eastside neighborhoods are maintained on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, Buford and Councilman Jim Monahan attended the meeting and pledged to 
help Avenue residents improve their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Camilo, who lives on Franklin Lane just off Ventura Avenue, complained 
at the town meeting about the poor quality of his and neighboring streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Camilo said he was pleased to hear that the council may consider 
Tuttle's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get that (before the City Council) for four years 
already," he said. "I've been pushing to make the Avenue more decent, you know 
what I mean? I hope they do it. Not just say it, but do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Buford and Councilman Gregory L. Carson, however, usually Tuttle's allies on 
the council, on Monday sided with other council members, saying his proposal 
was too politically charged and not well-planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody has a right to access to public services and this proposal 
is not conducive to a community that has to live together," Buford said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue area is not the only neighborhood in the city in need of money for 
street maintenance, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson pointed out that his mother lives in eastern Ventura and has to mow the 
street in front of her house because of all the weeds that sprout up through 
the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a worthy discussion to say you have to prioritize, but I don't know what 
you would prioritize (the Avenue) against," he said.

OXNARD TO LOBBY AGAINST COUNTY RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council wants face-to-face meetings with county transit board 
members to argue them out of forcing the city to divert money it now uses for 
buses and road maintenance to a commuter-train service few people ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, with no direct representation on the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, is opposed to a funding plan approved by that panel earlier this 
month that classifies Metrolink as an "unmet transit need" rather than an 
"emergency transit need," as it was identified after January's Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 That reclassification means that starting in July, 1995, Oxnard would have to 
spend up to $540,000 in state funds annually for Metrolink instead of using the 
money for bus and road services, as it has for years. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope the personal meetings -- as yet unscheduled -- will 
persuade commission members to come up with alternative ways to pay for the 
twice-a-day commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously the concern is that we fought to get Metrolink, and we feel it's 
appropriate to have it," said Councilman Thomas E. Holden. "But in our minds we 
weren't going to fund it with our current transportation funding." 
</P>
<P>
 City Traffic Manager Samia Maximous had asked the council to approve sending a 
letter immediately to the commission opposing its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holden and council members Andres Herrera and Bedford Pinkard said 
meetings would have more impact than written correspondence. Mayor Manuel M. 
Lopez and Councilman Michael A. Plisky were absent from Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative spending plan approved earlier this month by the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission, which disburses state and federal transit funds, 
calls for borrowing $1.6 million from a reserve fund to pay for next year's 
Metrolink service. 
</P>
<P>
 But by mid-1995 -- the beginning of the 1995-96 fiscal year -- Oxnard would 
have to spend up to $540,000 a year for its Metrolink station under the 
commission's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also agreed May 6 to hire a consultant to survey Ventura 
County's transit needs and draw up a half-cent sales-tax measure to pay for 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Both items passed on a 4-3 vote of commission members after hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in November must approve the half-cent sales tax, or future funding for 
Metrolink may be in jeopardy. Ventura County is the only area served by 
Metrolink without such a sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials fear that, beginning in July, 1995, they will be forced to 
cut back South Coast Area Transit bus service and other Oxnard transit programs 
to pay for a commuter train that few people ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers of riders per cost may not make much sense when you look at the 
other services we'll have to give up," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 For April, an average of 59 round-trip riders commuted to the Los Angeles area 
daily from Oxnard, according to Metrolink. Those numbers, the most recent 
Metrolink could come up with, are enough to warrant spending the money, the 
transportation commission believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard transit planners conducted their own survey on May 11 and 12. On 
those days, 51 and 66 people, respectively, rode the trains, according to the 
city survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the Oxnard study said, Metrolink ridership from other stops is 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, average daily ridership from Moorpark dipped from 267 in March 
to 212 in April, and Simi Valley ridership sank from 428 passengers each day in 
March to 349 daily in April, Maximous said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis of the Ventura County Transportation Commission told council 
members Tuesday that commissioners would welcome the dialogue with Oxnard 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, however, is under no obligation to alter its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state Transportation Development Act, passed by the Legislature in 
the early 1970s, cities and counties receive money for a variety of transit 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law stipulates that the funding must first be spent on mass transit -- 
not street and road improvements, as Oxnard has traditionally done.  
</P>
<P>
 Once an agency's transit needs are deemed met -- a decision made by the 
countywide panel -- the city or county is free to use the balance of the funds 
for street paving and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission next meets June 3, when more detailed funding 
discussions are scheduled.

COUNTY JOBLESS RATE UNCHANGED IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's 7.4% jobless rates showed no change from March to April, but 
remained considerably higher than the state's estimate of unemployed workers in 
April of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate for April of 1993 was 7.0%, but officials at the state's 
Employment Development Department, which compiles the figures, cautioned that 
new methods of gathering statistics make comparisons between years unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schniepp, director of the Economic Forecasting Project at UC Santa 
Barbara, said the stagnant figure was disappointing nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down 3,000 jobs in the county from last year at this time," he said. 
"We keep on losing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the available jobs are in low-paying fields such as retail, he said. 
And factoring in declining salaries with limited employment opportunities, 
Schniepp said, "doesn't lead me to believe that we're making much progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The Employment Development Department estimates that 28,000 people in the 
county were out of work in April, despite the creation of 4,500 seasonal farm 
labor jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency had earlier reported the county's unemployment rate in March as 
8.4%, but officials revised it Monday, saying a computer error had caused them 
to inflate the numbers of people out of work in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people working all weekend in Sacramento to figure it out," said 
research manager Jerry Shea. "It turned out we had been counting some people 
twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said the April figure is also subject to change, and could fluctuate by 
as much as 0.6% by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Reed, an analyst with the department, said seasonal hiring for 
agricultural workers is probably at its peak. Since last month, 4,500 
agricultural jobs were added. But according to Reed's calculations, most of 
those jobs are going to people from outside the county, which she said was 
characteristic of migrant farm labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there was no change in the unemployment rate for the county, Reed said 
the number of positions in non-agricultural fields increased by 900 jobs since 
March. Again, she said, commuters and new residents taking those jobs may 
account for the lack of change in the unemployment rate . 
</P>
<P>
 Service trades added 600 new jobs, while the government sector added 400, 
mostly in education. Retail and construction added only 100 jobs each. Schniepp 
said he was troubled by only minor gains in construction opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think that you'd see construction figures coming up in response to 
the earthquake," he said. "In addition, we're headed into the building season; 
longer days, warmer weather. But there has not been much seasonal change." 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said he believed unemployment would be higher if some people hadn't 
simply given up on the area and moved elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't just hang around and wait to be employed," he said. "You also 
may have people who get discouraged and just give up. When the people who put 
these statistics together call them up and ask if they're looking for a job, 
they just say no. So they get left out of the labor force." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Dever, an assistant manager at the Ventura employment office, said her 
office has listings for cashiers, tellers, retail sales clerks, laborers and 
housekeepers. Jobs available in April were much the same, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid," she said, "they're all on the low end of the scale."

OFFICIAL TO CHART CITY'S FISCAL REBIRTH; VENTURA: FORMER BURBANK MAYOR THOMAS 
FLAVIN IS PRAISED FOR HIS EXPERTISE IN REINVIGORATING AGING COMMERCIAL 
DISTRICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Burbank mayor known in his hometown for his enthusiastic support of 
business has been selected by the Ventura City Council to chart the city's 
economic revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Flavin, 47, will finalize negotiations with the city in the next two 
weeks on a six-month contract to determine Ventura's economic needs and outline 
how Ventura can meet its financial goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin, who is seeking a salary of $6,000 per month, could be kept on at the 
end of his contract to serve as Ventura's permanent economic development 
coordinator, council members said. The economic coordinator would be 
responsible for attracting new businesses to the city and encouraging existing 
ones to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ventura has recognized over the last few years that it needs to 
become more proactive in economic development, and I think it has potential to 
do so," said Flavin, a longtime Burbank resident who moved to Camarillo this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members praised Flavin as an expert in reinvigorating aging commercial 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings a wealth of experience in the field of economic development," said 
Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who said she hopes Flavin will help the council 
"come up with a vision and prepare a strategy" for economic revival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Vietnam War veteran, Flavin has worked as an assistant city manager for 
Oceanside and Burbank and as a corporate and business consultant. He served as 
a Burbank City Council member and mayor from 1989-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "For better or for worse, Tom is a really strong individual," said Burbank 
City Manager Bud Ovrum, a Flavin supporter. "He was the driving force that took 
(Burbank) from being a status quo kind of city to (one that is) much more 
aggressively pro-business." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Ventura's council members say they are looking for exactly such a 
transformation in their own city. Measures, the biggest vote-getter in last 
November's council election, swept into office on a pledge to make Ventura more 
friendly to business. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, Flavin supporters and detractors alike say he should have little 
trouble satisfying such expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lockheed Corp. announced a year into Flavin's term that the company was 
moving to Georgia and taking more than 10,000 local jobs with it, Flavin and 
other council members began pushing to bring other businesses to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank council worked to create a "media district specific plan" that 
examined how local movie and television studios could continue to expand 
without encroaching on nearby residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "That plan has been an absolute blessing for us, that helped take the sting 
out of the loss of Lockheed," Ovrum said. "The studios are now growing by leaps 
and bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank City Councilman Bob Bowne praised Flavin for opening up communication 
between the city and businesses by holding quarterly, round-table lunches 
between city leaders and owners of Burbank's biggest corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tom saw the advantages in trying to create a very user-friendly environment 
in the community," Bowne said. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics, however, said Flavin steam-rolled over any opposition in his path 
in the name of economic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of mistrust of government and encouraging people to hate the City 
Council, he was like gasoline on the fire," said Tim Murphy, a former Burbank 
City Council member who served with Flavin. "He tried to control dissent, and 
he turned people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Burbank voters were so turned off, in fact, that they tried to recall 
Flavin and fellow Councilman Michael Hastings in 1990, accusing them of 
favoring developers. The campaign, however, died from lack of interest after 
supporters gathered only 7,239 of the 8,720 signatures needed to place the 
initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted McConkey, one of the recall movement's organizers, on Tuesday criticized 
Flavin for indiscriminately wooing new businesses to Burbank without first 
supporting existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He managed to toss a lot of cash at a lot of companies to get them to move 
here," he said. "So far, it's produced no new jobs, the companies just moved 
from elsewhere in Los Angeles and all they are doing is bringing their old 
employees to Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin dismisses such criticisms, saying he does not wish to rehash what is 
already past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof is in the pudding," he said. "You've got the revitalization of 
'Beautiful, Downtown Burbank,' which stands out in Southern California as one 
of the area's top revitalization efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he added, there will always be disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do in a community is not going to have 100% support," he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY REAL ESTATE CONTINUES COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County from January to April increased 15.3% over last 
year, continuing an upward trend in the real estate market, according to a 
report from TRW-REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than half those sales were of existing homes costing under $175,000, 
leading one analyst to caution that the county's market is still far from the 
boom days of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does bode well for the industry," said Nima Nattagh of TRW-REDI, which 
monitors monthly home sales. "But I don't think people should set their hopes 
too high that we'll be returning to the peak market of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nattagh said a 15.3% increase was healthy, Ventura County didn't fare 
as well as other regions in Southern California. Home sales jumped nearly 35% 
in Orange County and 34% in Riverside County. Los Angeles County tied with 
Ventura, posting a 15.3% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanon Wolf, president of the Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors, said 
area realtors have been selling almost exclusively to first-time buyers. She 
said buyers are mostly young families who intend to stay in the homes only 
three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them, this is not their dream home," Wolf said.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost 60% of sales in Simi Valley and Moorpark during April were of homes 
priced under $200,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is improving and we're getting a lot of first-time buyers out," 
she said. "We're not sitting here complaining. But to be honest, talking among 
the other realtors, we're still seeing a decrease in property values." MARY F.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TRANSFERS AMBULANCE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors approved Tuesday the transfer of ambulance 
contracts from Pruner Ambulance Co. to Irvine-based CareLine Inc., the nation's 
second-largest ambulance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors approved the transfer with little comment after Phillipp K. 
Wessels, county Health Care Agency director, described the contract 
reassignment as "a sound transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel confident that the transfer of this assignment is in the best 
interests of our citizens," Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
 County auditors have found CareLine to be financially sound, with $80 million 
in assets, Wessels said. And checks with officials in Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, where CareLine operates Mercy Ambulance Co., revealed no 
ongoing problems with operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts can be canceled with 90 days notice if service is substandard, 
Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner serves all of the county except Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 No opponents to the transfer commented. Ken Maffei, president of the county 
firefighters' union, had protested the sale last week, because it had followed 
by just days the supervisors' two-year renewal of the Pruner contract. The 
firefighters had also sought the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest "would be a waste of time," Maffei said. "The supervisors have made 
their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new arrangement, all Pruner employees, including owners Don and 
Jackie Pruner, would continue as employees after the CareLine sale is complete 
next month, Pruner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she supports the sale because CareLine will 
honor Pruner's commitment to open a new ambulance station in Oak Park next 
month. DARYL KELLEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; TEACHER IS STATE SCIENCE AWARD 
FINALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third-grade teacher at a Port Hueneme school is one of six teachers 
statewide and one of only three elementary school teachers to be named a 
finalist for the California Presidential Awards in Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Burnett, who teaches at Bard School, will travel to Sacramento in June to 
receive recognition for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a team of four third-grade teachers at Bard, Burnett teaches science to 
about 120 students. She sponsors an after-school science club and takes 
students to the Navy's construction base in Port Hueneme to use high-tech 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A secret of Burnett's success in the classroom is her genuine interest and 
enthusiasm about her subject, Bard Principal Deborah DeSmeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's incredibly interested in the field of science," DeSmeth said. "She has 
done a lot of background work to make sure she understands her subjects. And 
she has a love of it that shows through. She gets the kids excited about 
science." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE CHIEF OUTLINES NEW GOALS, TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard traffic officers will soon begin using hand-held computers that print 
out a violator's ticket on the spot and shorten the length of time it takes to 
fill out a citation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers also will begin sending under-aged cadets into liquor stores 
to try to purchase alcohol and issue citations to any violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other police tactics and goals were discussed Tuesday at the Oxnard 
City Council meeting, when Chief Harold Hurtt delivered his department's annual 
status report.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to throw the old ticket book out," Hurtt told the council. "This 
will practically eliminate any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt presented a series of statistics that show crime in several categories 
dropping over previous years. But other offenses, such as murder, arson and car 
thefts, rose in 1993, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oxnard Police Department is sworn to the security of our community, 
protection of the rights of all people and is dedicated to courteous and 
professional service," Hurtt told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief detailed a series of programs aimed at achieving a better 
quality of life for Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are more community-based policing. Also, Hurtt plans to step up the 
bike cops program, which now has 15 officers and six reserves patrolling city 
streets on mountain bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, the (drivers) are sitting there with a beer between their legs or 
drinking, and the officers can ride up on them," Hurtt told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also vowed to strengthen its commitment to intervention and 
prevention programs that Hurtt credited with lowering crime statistics on a 
long-term basis. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; UNDERSTAFFING CLAIM BY NURSES IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State investigators have rejected nurses' claims that Ventura County Medical 
Center is chronically understaffing the wards that serve its most critically 
ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We interviewed staff, we reviewed staffing records," said Elizabeth Mock, a 
supervisor with the state Department of Health Services Licensing and 
Certification.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did not find that to be a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses, who submitted as many as 60 examples of what they considered unsafe 
staffing practices, were astounded at the state agency's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know how they could come to that conclusion," said Sheila 
Raives, an intensive care nurse who helped organize the effort.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know for a fact that there were times the intensive care nursery was two 
people short" of required staffing, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the California Nurses Assn. contended that administrators 
floated staff members who lacked proper training into intensive care units or 
left wards short-staffed.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a nurse made a medication error that, if left unchecked, could 
have led to complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators have consistently denied the charges, saying they are 
careful to meet state and local hospital standards for the critical care wards. 
</P>
<P>
 The state licensing agency investigated the claims, and in a one-page 
statement filed last week found no deficiencies in the hospital's staffing.  
</P>
<P>
 Strict California standards govern how many registered nurses and other 
trained staff members must be in intensive care units at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Raives said that staffing problems continue at the county hospital and that 
nurses will again bring their concerns to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a question that the nurses need to document differently so that even 
the state could figure out, it could be a matter of adjusting how we document," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mock said the state is required by law to investigate every complaint and 
would follow up if the nurses came forward with new information. PHYLLIS W.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAYOR WON'T HAVE TO PAY FEES OF RIVAL 
</P>

 A Ventura County judge ruled Tuesday that Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton does 
not have to pay the attorney's fees of a political rival who successfully sued 
to disqualify Stratton in the race for county auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura accountant William Baker had sued Stratton to recover the $10,000 he 
spent in a legal battle to remove Stratton's name from the June 7 ballot.Baker 
won his suit that contended Stratton failed to meet the educational 
requirements of the job as outlined in a 1957 state law. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William L. Peck, who disqualified Stratton 
from the auditor's race, ruled that Baker's campaign benefited from Stratton's 
removal and so he had no cause to file for reimbursement of his attorney fees. 
Before Stratton was disqualified, there were six candidates in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel bad at all," Baker said. "I thought there was a 50-50 chance of 
winning this. I accept the judge's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he was relieved that the matter was behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to get this over," he said. "It's been a very trying experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker filed a lawsuit against Stratton in March to disqualify him from the 
race because he lacked the accounting experience required by the 1957 law. 
Stratton argued that the job requirements were outdated and that his master's 
degree in business administration more than qualified him to run for 
auditor-controller. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; POWER OUTAGE HITS 2,000 RESIDENTS

<P>
 About 2,000 Thousand Oaks residents lost electrical power Tuesday after a dead 
oak tree collapsed onto power lines, triggering a small fire and toppling a 
nest of baby woodpeckers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The power lines were hit at 5:50 p.m., causing a transformer and a patch of 
grass to catch fire at the intersection of Houston and Greenwich drives, said 
Christina Bradley, Southern California Edison spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters quickly put out the fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity was restored to 90% of the 2,000 customers by 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, 
Bradley said. Most of the affected customers live along Hillcrest Drive, 
between Moorpark Road and Erbes Road, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters found several woodpeckers in the nest that toppled from the oak 
tree when it fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "They survived the fall," Ventura County Firefighter Tyrone Hurley said. "They 
were four little redheads. We called animal control to take care of them."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing was stopped Tuesday and a Simi Valley child-molestation 
defendant allowed to plead guilty to 23 of 49 charges against him after his 
12-year-old victim broke down in tears during testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started crying and said she didn't want him to go to jail," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Dee Corona explained after the girl was led away from the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attacker, Marco Antonio Quezada, 32, entered the guilty pleas in Ventura 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada was charged in April with 49 criminal counts in connection with 
attacks on the girl from December, 1988, to May, 1992. The incidents -- 
including fondling, masturbation and oral copulation -- began when she was in 
third grade and lasted until May, 1992, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl cried while testifying in a preliminary hearing to determine whether 
there was enough evidence for Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. to 
order Quezada to stand trial. The proceeding was quickly recessed when 
prosecutors figured out a way to resolve the case without further testimony 
from the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, a special allegation that accused Quezada of using force 
to molest the girl also was dismissed. That allegation would have required a 
prison term upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada faces up to 52 years in prison for his guilty plea but is eligible for 
probation. Campbell ordered him to undergo psychological tests before his July 
15 sentencing. He is free in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona knew before Tuesday's testimony that the girl had reservations about 
Quezada serving prison time, but he said, "It's the first time she's made it 
that clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Joseph D. O'Neill said prosecutors filed too many charges 
against Quezada. The 49 criminal counts prevented an earlier disposition of the 
case that would have spared the girl from having to testify, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty-nine counts is absurd," O'Neill said. "This is a classic example of the 
district attorney overcharging these cases and inviting me to take it to 
trial." DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LANDON APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Chris Landon on Tuesday was appointed the director of the Conejo Valley 
Family Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, a fifth satellite health clinic set to 
open next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved Landon's appointment on a 4-0 
vote.Supervisor Vicky Howard was sick and did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee praised the decision to open the clinic in Thousand 
Oaks. The other clinics administered by the Ventura County Medical Center are 
in Simi Valley, Ventura, Oxnard and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness it's going into Thousand Oaks," Kildee said. "As soon as it's 
open it's going to be full." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the clinic will be open to everyone, it will cater mostly to 
low-income residents on Medi-Cal, estimated at as many as 7,000 in east Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Landon is the medical director of the county's Pediatric Diagnostic Center in 
Ventura, a position he has held since 1989. He said he will continue to work at 
the center, but that three new pediatricians will help ease the workload there. 
</P>
<P>
 The location on Thousand Oaks Boulevard was chosen for maximum visibility and 
convenience of east county residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get geographically closer to people," he said. "Instead of 
having to waste time going up and down the Conejo Grade, we will come to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic will be open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week, he said. He will 
share part-time duties there with six other doctors. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MENTAL TEST ORDERED FOR KIDNAP SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ordered a psychological evaluation for a Ventura man accused of 
kidnaping an auto salesman and leading police on a chase to Universal City -- 
and the defendant's attorney said his client will eagerly cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson said defendant Daryl Lynn Simpson 
believes he is Jesus and wants to tell the court-appointed psychologist his 
religious message. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, an unemployed 32-year-old oil-field worker, will probably change his 
not guilty plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, Lipson said. But Lipson 
said that would depend on the opinion of the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark ordered the 
psychological examination Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Simpson was test-driving a black, $27,000 Camaro Z-28 from Paradise 
Chevrolet on Victoria Avenue earlier this month when he told a salesman that he 
was God and on his way to radio station KLOS in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove south on the Ventura Freeway to the San Fernando Valley, police said. 
The salesman escaped when Simpson exited the freeway to make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police spotted the car in Van Nuys, triggering a chase where 
speeds reached 90 m.p.h. Simpson was finally arrested after the car he was 
driving hit a curb and got a flat tire. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: TEEN-AGER PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN FIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager pleaded not guilty Tuesday to one count of 
conspiracy for allegedly taking part in several street fights that erupted in 
Newbury Park in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second, unrelated felony case, an arraignment for 18-year-old Brady 
Willmon was postponed until June 7 at the request of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon, a former Westlake High School football player, faces the charge of 
conspiracy for allegedly engaging in a series of street fights on Wendy Drive 
on April 14. The fights -- which reportedly included gunfire -- involved three 
gangs and occurred within 30 minutes of each other, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon was arrested in the incident but released on $5,000 bail. He was 
rearrested seven days later and charged with breaking into a Thousand Oaks 
house and beating a teen-ager inside. He is now free in lieu of a $30,000 bail 
in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's attorney has denied that Willmon assaulted the Thousand Oaks 
teen-ager or broke into the boy's home. He has said Willmon is being charged in 
the street fights because he associates with some of the combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli said a jury trial on the conspiracy 
charge is scheduled for June 27 before acting Superior Court Judge Herbert 
Curtis III. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MARTENS APPOINTED TO PLANNING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has appointed Ted Martens, president of a local 
homeowners association, to the city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason said he chose Martens from a field of nine candidates 
because he lives in a housing project on the east side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martens will represent a part of the city not now being represented on the 
commission," Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several projects that the commission will consider, including a 3,000-house 
subdivision, are being proposed for the east side, Lawrason said, adding that 
residents there have needed a voice during the planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved Martens' nomination by a vote of 4 to 0, with Councilman 
Scott Montgomery abstaining. Montgomery, a candidate for the County Board of 
Supervisors, said he abstained because Martens is campaign treasurer for Simi 
Valley Councilwoman Barbara Williamson, who is also a supervisorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Steve Brodsky said he resigned to pursue a job outside 
California. Martens will serve the remainder of Brodsky's term, which expires 
in November. SCOTT HADLY

FEDERAL GRANT OKD FOR QUAKE CRISIS COUNSELING IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials released $22.4 million Tuesday for earthquake crisis 
counseling in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, the formal approval that local 
mental health counselors need to launch a nine-month program in schools, 
mobile-home parks and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County expects to receive as much as $4.3 million from the federal 
grant, enough to hire 100 social workers and contract with private agencies 
already serving earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the grant was approved, the plan provoked criticism from city 
leaders who argued that the money could be better used for rebuilding the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, federal and local officials rushed to support their investment in 
the community's mental health. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge quake and its aftershocks unleashed stress and emotional 
trauma on a massive scale," U. S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. 
Shalala said in a statement. "We've learned from past disasters that the 
emotional aftershocks can continue long after the actual disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Mental Health Director Randall Feltman said he plans to bring 
residents suffering earthquake-related stress to speak to the County Board of 
Supervisors on June 14. The board must give its official approval before county 
workers can begin using the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that money can help people," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said, "if it can 
relieve their fears . . . I think it's money well spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither state nor local officials received formal notice of the grant, which 
was announced Tuesday afternoon by the U. S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. It is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltman could not confirm that the county had received the full $4.3 million 
it had requested, although he has received verbal assurances that the full 
amount is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four months since the quake, FEMA has allocated $2 million in Ventura 
County and a total of $12.7 million across the region for crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1 million of the new grant would go for contracts with five private 
agencies, including Clinicas del Camino Real Inc., to reach Spanish-speaking 
families; Catholic Charities of Ventura County, to work through churches; 
Interface Children, and Child Abuse and Neglect Inc., to deal with troubled 
children, and Turning Point Foundation, to help with mentally ill residents.

VANDERKOLK WINS LONG BATTLE TO BUILD LIBRARY IN OAK PARK; SERVICES: DESPITE 
CUTBACKS IN MANY SECTORS, THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS APPROVES THE PROJECT IN 
CONCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Achieving one of her earliest goals as a county official, Maria VanderKolk on 
Tuesday persuaded the Board of Supervisors that a $1.7-million library should 
be built in Oak Park despite three years of cuts in library services 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are concerns that constructing a new library would send the 
wrong message in tough economic times, the board unanimously approved in 
concept a new 9,500-square-foot library on the Oak Park High School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real moment for me," VanderKolk said. "I've been working on this 
issue since I first took office." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said the Oak Park package -- which includes free school district 
land and full payment of construction costs by development-related revenue -- 
was simply too good of a deal to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the money, you have the land, you have the (community) cooperation," 
Supervisor Susan Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors John Flynn and Maggie Kildee said they could back the new library 
partly because it would be the county's first to incorporate the sophisticated 
interactive techniques of the "information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 "The futuristic tone of this library could set the model for the future," 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board authorized an engineering study of the project, with final approval 
tied to a $650,000 sale of land that will pay for part of the construction. The 
library probably will not be open for three or four years, VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors also expressed concern about who would pay $83,000 each year 
in higher operating costs if the old, cramped Oak Park library -- now hidden in 
the center of the high school campus -- is replaced by the new larger library 
nearby on Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk acknowledged that the new operating costs are a problem, since 
money could be drained from other county libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the crux of the issue, " VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, county Chief Adminsitrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said he feared 
that the new library would cost the county -- whose 15 libraries have trimmed 
hours at least 50% -- money that it does not have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned in terms of the on-going costs and the timing of this," 
Wittenberg said. "I don't want people to get the signal that this is an 
expansion we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg noted that state support for libraries has been cut 45% in recent 
years and that the county had to supplement its $6.7-million library budget 
with $1.6 million in general funds this year. He said he anticipates an even 
tighter budget next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 But VanderKolk and supporters from Oak Park argued persuasively that their 
proposition was a unique opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the entire $1.7 million to build the new library would be covered 
either by fees from Oak Park developers, the sale of Oak Park land donated by 
developers or special fees dedicated for use in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk identified $2.27 million that could be raised for the new library, 
with $200,000 going for library books and nearly $400,000 set aside for future 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Oak Park Unified School District has not only committed to operating 
the library during school hours at its own expense but to donating the $500,000 
library site. In addition, the school district will pay for library materials 
used by students, district spokesman Stanley Mantooth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Oak Park library is "bursting at the seams," because Oak Park has 
grown from a tiny community just a few years ago to 11,500 residents today, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg pressed Mantooth on whether the school district could contribute 
more to operating costs. But the educator responded: "We're kind of in the same 
boat (as you) in terms of financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park residents also assured the board that their community can be counted 
on to help pay extra operating costs if the county is still in deep financial 
trouble when the library opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have to raise the money, they will," Oak Park librarian Heather Ross 
said of her neighbors. VanderKolk added: "This community will make this library 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindy Heidt, a member of the Oak Park library committee, noted that affluent 
Oak Park has long paid much more property tax to library services than it ever 
received back. 
</P>
<P>
 The current 6,500-square-foot library is hard to find, has little parking, no 
restrooms and far fewer books than other county libraries in similar areas, he 
said. Ojai, for example, has 44,000 books, but Oak Park just 20,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're looking for is something that is on par with the other libraries," 
Heidt said. "We really are asking for a reasonable return for what we have 
contributed." 
</P>
<P>
 Though forced to balance competing needs, the county's top librarian, Dixie 
Adeniran, said in an interview that she favors the Oak Park facility. "That 
community needs a better library than they have," she said.

VENTURA SCHOOL PANEL VOTES TO BUY BUSINESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura school board on Tuesday approved spending nearly $5.7 million to 
purchase a large business park on Valentine Road near Victoria Avenue for its 
adult school program. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members voted unanimously to buy the Ventura Business Campus, two large 
office buildings at 5200 and 5280 Valentine Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District's adult school plans to move its 
administrative offices and Technology Development Center, which has 300 
students, to the office complex in September, 1995. The school district is 
getting a deal on the property, officials said, because they are purchasing it 
from a realty group that foreclosed on the previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a lot of money, " board member John Walker said. "But we're 
really getting a very, very good deal, not only for people right now in the 
district but also for their children in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The district will buy the office park for only $3.75 million, which officials 
said amounts to three-quarters of its current market value. In addition, the 
district will spend about $1.9 million on improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire $5.7 million cost will be financed through privately issued bonds, 
called certificates of participation. The district will repay the bonds from 
adult-school tuition and lease payments from other tenants in the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Technology Development Center, now split between two buildings on Dean and 
Palma drives, will occupy only part of the 5200 building. All of the tenants at 
5280 will be allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire adult school has about 8,500 students, most of whom attend classes 
at the Dean Drive campus.

SUPERMARKET SHOWDOWN; SHOPPERS AT 2 STORES ARE CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF A PARKING 
LOT FEUD; ' IT'S LIKE THE HATFIELDS AND THE MCCOYS. ' ANONYMOUS RALPHS SECURITY 
GUARD 
</P>

<P>
 As the battle of the supermarkets heats up along Ventura Boulevard, the 
customers have become the pawns, the parking lot the battlefield and private 
security guards the masters of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Vons and its brand new -- and very near -- neighbor Ralphs (which 
opened just last Thursday) are patrolling their adjacent parking lots. If you 
park at Ralphs, you'd better shop at Ralphs, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose a space on the wrong side of the property line and you're lucky, 
you'll be asked to move; not so lucky and you'll get a warning ticket; unlucky 
and you'll be towed. 
</P>
<P>
 One hired security guard at Ralphs said he'd written "a gang" of tickets to 
Vons shoppers since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I do." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the parking feud that requires Ralphs black-uniformed men on one side 
of the lot and Vons blue-clad guards on the other, he rolled his eyes, chuckled 
and said: "It's like the Hatfields and the McCoys." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supermarkets are at the center of the ruckus, according to 
several merchants in the area, the parking squabble is between the owners of 
the two adjacent malls, one containing the new Ralphs, the other home to the 
old Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this is because the two (owners) don't get along," said Vons guard 
Michael Moser. "Just put a big brick wall between the stores or something." 
</P>
<P>
 The feuding over the Ralphs project at the intersection of Ventura and Topanga 
Canyon boulevards goes back at least to last summer, when Stan Weiss, who owns 
the Vons and the Warner Plaza it is in, protested what he said was Ralphs 
limited access from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The current dispute has nothing to do with a competitor moving in next door, 
Weiss said Thursday. It's simply about parking, about customers from another 
store taking his customers' spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Toibb, owner of the Gateway Plaza, home to the new Ralphs -- who 
admitted to "some tension" between him and Weiss -- said the guards were there 
to act as "traffic cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just what they do, said guard Moser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watch and if they're walking toward Ralphs, then I tell 'em . . . they 
can't park here," he said. "They get an attitude and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Shopper Nancy Mahdavi didn't have an attitude, but she didn't quite follow the 
signs -- "No Vons Parking," "No Ralphs Parking" -- either. 
</P>
<P>
 She parked in the Vons lot, and she shopped at Vons. And then, with a few 
minutes left on her lunch hour, she also ducked into Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shopped in both," she said, defending her honor and rightful claim to a 
Vons parking spot. "The only question is, do I have to push the Ralphs cart 
clear back over there?"

TRIAL FOCUSES ON DEFENDANT'S ROLE IN SUICIDE; COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY ALEX 
COVENTRY AIDED IN THE DEATH. COUNSEL ARGUES HIS CLIENT NEVER THOUGHT THE MAN 
WOULD KILL HIMSELF. 
</P>

 Alex Coventry assembled a shotgun, loaded a shell into the chamber and handed 
the weapon to his despondent roommate, encouraging him to follow through on his 
often-repeated threat to commit suicide, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Medina, who had been drinking most of that day last summer, leveled 
the gun at his chest and pulled the trigger, his organs shredding as the 
buckshot passed through his body. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury seated Tuesday in Van Nuys Superior Court will be asked to determine if 
Coventry's actions violated a rarely used, 120-year-old law that makes it a 
felony for "any person who deliberately aids, advises or encourages" someone to 
commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors say Coventry's actions were clearly illegal, the defense 
maintains that Coventry never believed Medina would go through with the 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Coventry faces up to three years in state prison. He is free on 
his own recognizance. Attorneys will make opening statements Thursday to the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 2, 1993, Medina, who had been drinking for eight hours, shot himself 
in the darkened bedroom of Coventry's Tujunga apartment while the defendant and 
his girlfriend were present. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, Coventry handed the weapon to Medina, who was 
despondent over financial problems, and told him: "Stop talking about it. Just 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the case may have shades of that of retired Michigan 
pathologist Jack Kevorkian, who has gained international attention by helping 
20 terminally ill people commit suicide with a machine he designed. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys on both sides of the case caution that Medina's case differs 
from Kevorkian's principally because Medina's suicide did not seem to be 
well-planned and there was no evidence he was terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the people who died under Kevorkian's guidance, Medina's suicide "is 
something that develops in an hour over cocktails," Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew 
R. Flier said. Coventry has no medical training and Medina's use of a firearm 
threatened other people, Flier said, unlike Kevorkian's machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Flier believes Coventry took two important actions that directly linked him to 
the suicide: handing Medina the gun and then telling him "to put up or shut 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 There is some indication Medina was suffering emotionally. Testifying at a 
preliminary hearing in October, Coventry's girlfriend, Linda McDowell, said 
Medina told her just after he shot himself: " 'Linda, don't worry about it. 
Everything's OK now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Kenneth Lezin stressed that the law under which Coventry 
is being prosecuted says a person must deliberately assist the person 
committing suicide, which he maintains was not the case with Coventry. 
</P>
<P>
 The word deliberately "makes all the difference in the world," Lezin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did (Coventry) ever intend or plan or believe Leonard was going to 
kill himself," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; PARKING LOT CLOSURE STIRS CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notices that were posted at the only city parking lot in Sherman Oaks warning 
the lot will close for a year in June were "premature," according to an aide to 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., expressed 
concern about the parking issue in an interview. Close said the city has not 
made good on what he said was its promise to provide alternative parking while 
a senior housing project is being built over the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking lot is behind Tower Records at the intersection of Ventura 
Boulevard and Cedros Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses on Ventura Boulevard that "are reeling from the earthquake, are 
going to be seriously hurt because there is no city parking lot," Close said. 
"Residents who live to the south of there are not going to be able to find 
parking in front of their own homes, apartments and condos because of customers 
and employees parking there. It's going to be a big mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs, which have since been removed, said the lot would be closed from 
mid-June, 1994, to mid-June, 1995. Those signs will be replaced with signs 
giving the exact date in June when the lot will be closed, and, hopefully, the 
location of alternate parking, said Yaroslavsky aide Vivian Rescalvo.  
</P>
<P>
 The lot will likely be closed sometime in the latter part of June, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not reneging," Rescalvo said. "We're going to do what we can to find 
alternative parking." 
</P>
<P>
 But she stopped short of promising that the city will provide alternative 
parking during the construction because most off-street parking in the area is 
reserved.  
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some inconveniences, but in the long term it will be of benefit 
to the community because we will have increased the supply of parking," 
Rescalvo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has pushed the senior citizen housing project to include a 
two-story apartment building over two levels of public parking. The number of 
metered parking spaces will be increased from the present 137 to 209. KAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SUSPECTED TAGGER'S BAIL BID DENIED 
</P>

<P>
 A man accused of scrawling graffiti across the San Fernando Valley has lost a 
bid to have his $12,600 bail reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell Block turned down a request by 
Michael Adamar of Granada Hills to be released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamar, 18, is being held in County Jail, awaiting a June 7 trial on four 
counts of vandalism. He pleaded not guilty to the charges after being arrested 
May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Gary Geuss said police reports link the Granada Hills High 
School student to 15 additional incidents, and more charges will likely be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamar's case is one of the first to be prosecuted after the Los Angeles 
Police Department began tracking graffiti vandals with a centralized computer 
system that allows investigators to compare reports of tagging, Geuss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Adamar's tagging on public buildings and an LAPD 
anti-graffiti trailer has cost approximately $11,000 to clean. "He has wreaked 
a whole lot of damage throughout the Valley," Geuss said outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Adamar belongs to a "tagging crew" known as DYP, which stands 
for Destroy Your Property. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AIRPORT SHUTTLE FIRM FINED, GETS PROBATION 
</P>

<P>
 A Van Nuys airport shuttle company was fined nearly $5,000 this week for 
violating state Public Utilities Commission rules, City Atty. James K. Hahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Prime Time, had already been fined $80,000 by the PUC for the 
same violation -- hiring drivers as independent contractors rather than 
employees, as the law requires, said Ruth Kwan, head of the city attorney's 
consumer protection division. Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Barry 
Kohen imposed this most recent fine and two-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drivers have to be employees . . . for insurance reasons, for liability 
reasons, for workers' comp reasons," Kwan said. Prime Time's hiring the drivers 
as independent contractors was an effort to avoid paying such costs as 
insurance and workers' compensation for them, Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Time -- which operates in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura and San 
Bernardino counties -- also engaged drivers who did not have charter licenses 
and illegally made its drivers pay for their workers' compensation coverage, 
said Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The company pleaded no contest to three counts of failing to comply with a PUC 
order. In addition to the fine of $4,950, Prime Time was placed on two years 
probation, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also violated PUC rules by denying Los Angeles International 
Airport officials access to its driver records, Hahn said. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; MURAL ARTISTS UNDAUNTED BY VANDAL'S ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about every day for two months, a group of Sun Valley teen-agers took up 
paint brushes and set to work on a wall, learning lessons of art from a master. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the lesson became a lesson of pain -- delivered by either a 
bottle or balloon filled with a thick black paint that exploded across two 
panels of the mural, splattering a stagecoach and a scene of the early Spanish 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts so much inside," said Stephen Valenzuela Jr., a 15-year-old who goes 
to Van Nuys Middle School. He brought his sister to San Fernando Road to 
proudly show off the mural and instead found it vandalized. "But you just set 
that aside and keep on painting." 
</P>
<P>
 For Joe Gonzalez, a nationally known artist hired by the Sun Valley Community 
Venture Council to create the mural as a symbol of a new community spirit, it 
was the first time in 37 years that someone had damaged one of his works. 
</P>
<P>
 But still the painting goes on, the black paint has been sanded off and the 
repairs continue. When painting started in early April, Gonzalez guessed that 
it would take about three months to finish. But he had not counted on the 
feverish pace the dozen students would set, painting even between bites of 
sandwiches when they could have been taking breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the damage, the project is well ahead of schedule and a dedication 
ceremony is tentatively planned within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting will be the last for artist Frank Martinez, a 70-year-old native 
of Sun Valley who Gonzalez asked to design the Sun Valley mural, but he will 
look on it as his best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of this one, no kidding, I'm really proud of it," Martinez said. 
The pride comes not so much from the mural itself, but from the knowledge it 
has implanted in the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our future," Martinez said of the youths. "Because each and every one 
has his own idea of what art is all about, what we do here will not have been 
in vain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Community Venture Council looks at the project -- which is in 
view of both passing Metrolink trains and the nearby Golden State Freeway -- as 
a way to attract attention to the long-neglected community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art heals," said Jan Liptak, head of the Sun Valley Community Venture 
Council. "I think art is the one common thing to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Liptak had been searching for an artist to lead the project last year and 
found many who were not willing to work within the project's $10,000 budget. 
She had called the Goez Art Gallery in East Los Angeles looking for another 
artist when Joe Gonzalez answered the phone. He immediately offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the teen-agers have been drawn to the project because of Gonzalez's 
reputation. "When they told me it was him, I jumped right in," said Al 
Saldivar, 15. "Every day you show up here you learn something new." ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MOVER SENTENCED FOR OVERCHARGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man who runs a San Fernando Valley moving company was sentenced to 
20 days of community service and fined after being convicted of overcharging 
homeowners fleeing their homes in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Smith, a 42-year-old Van Nuys man, pleaded no contest Monday in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court to five counts of making false statements and five 
counts of violating moving regulation laws, according to the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is a Mayflower agent and president of L.A. Moving, Storage & 
Distribution Inc. of Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was ordered to pay more than $3,300 in restitution to six victims 
in Sherman Oaks and $3,000 to the California Public Utilities Commission to 
reimburse the agency for investigative costs. Smith was personally ordered to 
pay $1,350 in fines, according to Deputy City Atty. P. Greg Parham. 
</P>
<P>
 The multi-agency Earthquake Fraud Prevention Task Force began investigating 
L.A. Moving after several people phoned a hot line to complain about the moving 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the violations occurred on Jan. 19, two days after the devastating 
earthquake. One man was charged nearly $2,900 for a job, a figure the PUC 
determined was more than $800 too much. A woman was charged nearly $2,000 for a 
move after she was guaranteed the cost would not exceed $1,000. THOM MROZEK

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; PROPOSED LAW WOULD 
PUNISH 911 ABUSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest class of lawbreakers in California could very well be 911 abusers. 
A bill that goes before the state Senate Judiciary Committee this week would 
make it a misdemeanor to call 911 "with the intent to annoy or harass another 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 A conviction would carry penalties of six months in jail, a $1,000 fine or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also aims to hold 911 abusers accountable for their actions, making 
them reimburse cities and counties for the costs of sending officers out on 
bogus calls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's beyond our ability to fathom why anyone would tie up critical emergency 
phone lines to demand a ride to the airport, report a dead cat, spew 
obscenities at the officer who answers, point accusatory fingers at their 
neighbors or just plain hang up. But people really do this. 
</P>
<P>
 On an average day in the City of Angels, the dispatchers at the Los Angeles 
Police Department receive between 150 and 200 crank calls. So it is not 
surprising that the city is among the chief backers of 911 legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is taking the problem seriously enough to put its lobbyists to work 
rallying support in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles Police Department has a problem of callers making repeated 
calls to a dispatcher without any emergency to report, but rather out of a 
desire to annoy or just to chat. Some individuals have been known to make up to 
75 or 80 calls per night," Norm Boyer, the city's chief legislative 
representative, wrote in a letter supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has tried to remedy the problem by warning them on the phone 
not to annoy, by contacting these callers at their homes, and by issuing 
written warnings, all to no avail," Boyer wrote. The department has even asked 
the phone company about removing these callers' phones, but that cannot be done 
without a court order." 
</P>
<P>
 The push for legislation to punish 911 abusers grew out of the Central Valley 
and an incident on Christmas night, 1991, when a man who said he "just wanted 
to see what happened" dialed 911 while staying at a friend's house. He tried to 
hang up, but the line remained open. Deputies, suspecting a domestic 
disturbance, knocked on the door, but the three men inside, including a college 
criminal justice major, hid in the bathroom and waited for the officers to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course they didn't. Instead, the deputies summoned backup, fearing a 
hostage situation. The entire Mariposa County Sheriff's Department, as well its 
911 lines, was tied up for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 When they found the prank violated no law, deputies in Mariposa County decided 
some changes in the law were in order. The idea to make 911 abuse a crime was 
embraced by Assemblyman Sal Cannella (D-Modesto). So far, the bill has sailed 
through all legislative channels with unanimous support. 
</P>
<P>
 People who report pseudo-crimes, then run snickering into the night, already 
face charges of filing false reports, and the new law wouldn't deal with them. 
Nor would it be likely to be enforced against people who call to report dead 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the measure would target people like Ludovit Salka, who called 911 a 
record 582 times in July, 1990, earning the dubious distinction of being the 
first person in Los Angeles County to fall under a court order NOT to dial 911 
to report drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Salka, it seems, was convinced all his neighbors in the Tujunga Hills were 
making and selling drugs. He watched them, photographed them and made their 
lives miserable for 13 years. "He's probably the worst we've ever had," said 
Lt. David Musil at the Downtown communications center. But he added that Salka 
isn't an isolated case. "It's not unusual to find people who have called up to 
100 times a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Contained in the packet of materials the lawmakers are considering is the case 
of the extremely persevering -- dare we say obsessed? -- caller up north in 
Santa Clara County. He reached out and touched 911 73 times during the wee 
hours of June 2, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 This clearly qualifies as a violation of Section 6531, Subsection b, if the 
bill becomes law. It reads: "An intent to annoy or harass is established by 
proof of repeated calls over a period of time, however short, that are 
unreasonable under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to get away with 911 abuse. The police dispatchers know where 
people are calling from because computers automatically trace the calls. 
Callers are recorded.  
</P>
<P>
 So don't drop the dime if you can't do the time.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; L.A. TO PRESS FIGHT OVER LANDFILL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After meeting in closed session, the Los Angeles City Council announced 
Tuesday that the city will continue its three-year legal battle against a plan 
to expand the Sunshine Canyon Landfill north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty.Keith Pritzker said the council instructed his office to 
pursue an appeal of a Superior Court judge's ruling that would give operators 
of the landfill the go-ahead to begin the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal is the latest development in a long-running legal battle that has 
pitted a coalition of neighboring homeowners and the city of Los Angeles 
against the landfill operators and the county of Los Angeles, which approved 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning several rounds in the battle, the city and the homeowners group 
lost the latest legal challenge, prompting a Superior Court judge to rule 
earlier this month that he would lift a court order that halts the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After its latest loss in the battle, the City Council met to decide whether to 
continue its legal battle.  
</P>
<P>
 Pritzker said the city so far has spent about $560,000 on outside lawyers to 
fight the expansion. But he said the city is hoping to get the landfill 
operator and the county to pay for the city's legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners group, called the North Valley Coalition, has already filed a 
new lawsuit against the expansion. HUGO MARTIN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MACHINE HELPS CHECKING OUT LIBRARY BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Library patrons can now check out books at Glendale's central library as 
easily as they can withdraw cash from their checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 87-year-old Glendale Central Library, 222 E. Harvard St., is one of two 
Los Angeles-area libraries to install a 3M SelfCheck System -- a machine that 
looks and works a bit like an automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians hope the month-old system, which cost administrators $18,000 to 
install and requires a $1,200 yearly maintenance fee, will lessen long checkout 
lines caused by staff cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This machine has already helped us to be more efficient," said Marie Fish, 
central library administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, which serves more than 1 million readers a year, has lost five 
staff members since 1989 and currently faces a citywide hiring freeze and a 
book budget that is half what it was two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems are compounded by a growing city population -- sending more 
residents to the facility to check out books from the library's 350,000-volume 
collection, said Chuck Wike, library community relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Some current patrons appeared oblivious to the machine this week as they 
walked by the system to the circulation desk, but not library volunteer Brenda 
Chambers, who heaved an armful of 19 books onto a shelf next to the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers, who checks out more than 20 books each week to read to students at 
Fremont School as part of the Grandparents and Books program, said the system 
will cut down the amount of time she spends in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This machine will be a great boon for this library," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are currently about 50 3M SelfCheck System machines in libraries across 
the country, with several libraries using more than one machine, said Cathie 
Ericson, spokeswoman for 3M, the Minnesota-based manufacturer of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Glendale library administrators are negotiating to buy a second 
machine, the device will not replace circulation staff members needed to give 
patrons research advice or to provide additional assistance, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
 To check out a book using the machine, patrons place their library card under 
a scanner. After the user is authorized, the machine tells the patron to slide 
a book across a shelf under the monitor so the scanner can read a bar code 
placed in the upper right hand corner of the first page. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine then prints out a receipt which has the name of the patron, the 
name of the book and the date it must be returned to the library. JENNIFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE'S LEE LAUNCHES TURNAROUND TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since taking over as president of Pierce College in mid-April, Mary Lee has 
enrolled the struggling school in what she believes is a crash course that will 
raise enrollment and lower expenditures by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 One move has been to produce 170,000 copies of a 12-page promotion of the 
school that was inserted in Sunday's edition of The Times, an advertising 
tactic Lee used successfully at Valley College, where she spent 10 years as top 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to sell education," said Lee, who was appointed to the job 
upon the March 18 resignation of former President Lowell Erickson. "And I 
believe how you package things makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Another "packaging" tactic undertaken by Lee was to begin reorganizing course 
offerings so students who choose a new "fast-track" program will be guaranteed 
the classes they need to complete requirements for a two-year degree within 
four semesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee hopes those moves, along with attempts to streamline the registration 
process, will help reverse a slide in the number of students taking classes at 
Pierce, which determines the amount of state funding community colleges 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1983 to the fall of 1993, enrollment dipped from 21,260 to 15,695, the 
lowest since 1969. The ideal enrollment for the school, said Lee, would be 
about 18,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee is convinced that raising enrollment will not solve financial problems 
at Pierce, which faces a budget deficit of nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to raise more revenues," she said, "and work at this problem from 
both ends." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lee, that has meant endless meetings with local business leaders, from 
whom she urges in-kind contributions such as the replacement of aging water 
pipes or architectural designs for proposed science and student services 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 She also asked that more than $100,000 in annual proceeds from a swap meet run 
by the Foundation for Pierce College be given to the college, instead of paying 
salaries of the two full-time foundation staff members. Her request was granted 
by the foundation board, resulting in the termination of the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that (Lee) has a plan," said foundation Executive Director 
Esther Kenyon, whose last day is Friday. "The foundation was building good 
relations between the college and the public, and I hope that will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the flurry of activity, Lee said most students probably have not yet 
noticed any results from the change in college presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have brought a sense of urgency that Pierce needs change," Lee 
said. "I hope the students will start feeling the benefits soon." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COACH CHARGED WITH STEALING GIRLS' PANTIES 
</P>

<P>
 A girls soccer coach broke into the homes of teen-age players to steal their 
underwear, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Castellanos, 19, was ordered to appear June 8 in Pasadena Superior Court 
for arraignment on seven felony counts of residential burglary and 12 counts of 
receiving stolen property after a Tuesday hearing in Glendale Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos, who has pleaded not guilty, is being held at the Los Angeles 
County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police testified that Castellanos had a computer printout listing the names 
and addresses of 15- and 16-year-old girls who played in Division Two of the 
American Youth Soccer Organization with him when he was arrested April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos knew the girls whose homes he allegedly burglarized, police said. 
They either played on his or on his father's teams and on other teams in AYSO 
region 88, said Glendale Police Investigator Brian Melnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos was arrested after Glendale Community College student Keri 
Peterson identified him as the man she saw standing in her living room April 
26. She further identified a pair of panties seized from the defendant -- blue 
and pink striped Jockeys -- as her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Officer Espie Fernandez testified that Castellanos told her 
during an interview on April 29 how he broke into each of the 20 houses cited 
on a "break-in" list found in the bedroom of his Montebello home. 
</P>
<P>
 The list included names of 23 girls, a column called "underwear mission," 
indicating if underwear was taken from their homes, and a column labeled "money 
received," Fernandez testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos also told police he took money from several of the residences, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large plastic bag containing underwear, including some pieces that were 
labeled with the owner's names, was found in Castellanos' attic, Fernandez 
testified. She added that Castellanos identified which pair belonged to which 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said that Castellanos told her he took the underwear because he 
"wanted a memento from each of the girls" and that he "felt he had conquered 
each house by doing so." JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CLOSED YOUTH CENTER SEEKS CITY FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of directors of the Glendale Teen Support Center has asked the city 
for a $20,000 contribution toward a $100,000 fund needed to reopen the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the request on June 6 as part of a daylong 
budget review session. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Sweetnam, board president, said the council should contribute to the 
center because it was the only facility of its kind in the city where 
youngsters could drop by after school to talk with one another and with 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has in the past funded the center, which was closed in February for 
lack of money. The city allocated $10,000 in its 1993-94 budget and $30,000 
during the 1992-93 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay said while the "overall issue of youth is of concern 
to the city," the council faces tough decisions trying to mend a $3.1-million 
shortfall in the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also expressed concern about the amount of money available in 
the 1994-95 budget to give to nonprofit groups in the community.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to vote yes on each request, but we have a very, very tight budget," 
said Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 Special requests from community groups asking the city for money exceed the 
city's public assistance fund set aside for these organizations, said Ray Cruz, 
executive assistant to the city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Five local nonprofit agencies have asked the city for $129,300. The public 
assistance fund contains $91,490 in the 1994-95 budget to meet such requests.  
</P>
<P>
 While officials had hoped to reopen the youth center by Aug. 1, board member 
Jack Bilheimer said facility directors are still planning how to raise funds to 
put the center back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is also looking for a new home for the Lexington Avenue facility, 
Bilheimer said, adding that the center's former building cost $24,000 a year to 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, opened in November, 1992, provided a place for about 270 youths a 
month to socialize, study, play pool and talk with adults. Some of these 
teen-agers spoke to the City Council and asked council members to approve the 
board's funding request. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the teen center was open, I got better grades because I did my homework 
on the computer there and it was neater," said Nicole Wonser, 15. JENNIFER

 Civil rights activists have announced a $500 reward for information leading to 
the arrest of those who vandalized a building used by Armenian-American Boy and 
Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists said the reward sends a message of no tolerance to perpetrators who 
painted swastikas on the wall of the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletics 
Union and Scouts building at 544 W. Broadway on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Two vans parked nearby were also defaced. After an investigation, police 
classified the incident as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe in reacting with fear. We must put those who did this in 
jail," said Jan Tucker, vice president of the Armenian American Action 
Committee. "When someone puts out a swastika and targets some minority group, 
the message is very clear: 'We want you dead.' "  
</P>
<P>
 The reward money was collected from members of the Armenian American Action 
Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Armenian General Benevolent Union, the San Fernando 
Valley/Northeast Los Angeles National Organization for Women and the Los 
Angeles County Peace and Freedom Party also participated in the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the crime can call the Armenian American Action 
Committee at (818) 830-2794. JENNIFER OLDHAM

FEMA OFFERS NEW GRANTS TO AID HOMEOWNERS; RECOVERY: EXTENSION OF REPAIR PROGRAM 
WILL HELP SAFEGUARD RESIDENCES IN FUTURE EARTHQUAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Southland homeowners who suffered damage in the Northridge 
earthquake are eligible for new grants from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to help safeguard their homes in future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA is sending letters this week to roughly 200,000 homeowners who qualify 
for the additional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 These are people who previously received FEMA "minimal home repair grants" of 
$10,000 or less following the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The new grants are an extension of the home repair program, said Frank 
Kishton, FEMA federal coordinating officer. This is the first time that the 
agency has offered them in the wake of a federal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do we want to assist people with critical repairs not covered by 
insurance, but we also would like to make their homes better able to withstand 
damage in the event of future earthquakes," Kishton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter to homeowners, FEMA lists 10 measures that can help minimize 
quake damage and the maximum allowable grant for each measure. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, FEMA will pay as much as $50 of a homeowner's cost to strap down 
a water heater. The agency will pay as much as $150 of the cost to secure a 
chimney or mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, FEMA may also pay at least part of the cost of these 
projects: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bolting the walls of a house to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anchoring fuel or pressure storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Securing water well surface pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fortifying a mobile home against wind damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bracing the "cripple walls" of the crawl space under many older houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners eligible for the new grants should visit a FEMA earthquake service 
center before starting such projects, FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building specialists at the service centers can answer questions that may 
prevent some homeowners from spending money needlessly. The specialists can 
also recommend which preventive measures would be most appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no deadline for applying for the new grants, Edmonston said. "But we 
encourage people to work with the service centers as expeditiously as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 After completing projects, homeowners should return to the FEMA center where 
they applied for a grant with verifiable receipts for their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA representatives will review the receipts and mail checks to homeowners, 
reimbursing them up to the stated limits.

2 MEN ARRESTED IN FATAL DRUG-RELATED SHOOTING OF TRANSIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men have been arrested on murder charges in connection with the 
drug-related slaying of a transient in Dixie Canyon, including one suspect who 
had fled to Las Vegas, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Jones, 25, was shot several times in the chest in the early morning 
hours of April 8 while arguing with several acquaintances, Van Nuys Police 
Detective Steve Fisk said."It was a drug deal that went bad, over a dispute 
over $80," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting at 4047 Dixie Canyon Ave., police responded to 911 calls 
and found six spent bullet shells and Jones' body in the roadway. For at least 
a week, they were unable to determine the identity of the victim because of the 
many aliases and false addresses he had given during several contacts with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he had told police wasn't true," Fisk said. "So we were following 
bum leads. But we turned over enough rocks to find out who he hung with, and 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 After finding some of Jones' acquaintances, who led them to other clues in the 
case, police arrested Alameldein Ali, 35, on May 12 as he slept in an abandoned 
car in Hollywood. Authorities also issued an all-points bulletin with a license 
plate number of a car believed to have been involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 17, authorities in Las Vegas recognized the license plate and arrested 
Billy Mayberry, 36, on suspicion of murder, police said. Mayberry has waived 
extradition and is expected to be flown back to Los Angeles today, escorted by 
two Los Angeles police detectives.

SOLDIER'S TALES; THREE VETERANS REMEMBER D-DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're all in their 70s now. Some would call them heros. Their stories are 
very personal but they do belong to history, the legacy of what they did for 
their country in places with names like Sainte-Mere-Eglise, Bayeux, Carentan 
and Arromanches. On June 6, 1944, they landed on beaches code-named Utah, 
Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. They were boys, then, in their 20s, and they help 
liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny. Officially, it was called D-Day, the day of 
decision to send 5,300 ships, 155,000 soldiers and 12,000 aircraft on an 
assault of a fortified French coastline of Normandy. It was the largest 
invasion in history, and turned the tide against the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are snapshots of three veterans from that conflict, Frank Corrales, Jack 
Stephenson and Andy Draghi. Stephenson revisited Normandy last year, and Draghi 
is going to Normandy in June to celebrate the anniversary. But Corrales will 
never go back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Corrales, Encino "And then it went beyond fear. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrales was in the Big Red One, the combat unit immortalized and, Corrales 
thinks, romanticized by Hollywood. Corrales was in the second wave of troops 
that landed on D-Day. He was 26 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left Portsmouth (England) the day before at the crack of dawn. It was a 
rough crossing. We couldn't find shallow water to land the troops. I was up to 
my neck in water. There were bodies all over the place. It felt like a dream. 
Like watching a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 On shore shells were hitting all around us. We were all scared. And then it 
went beyond fear. I never want to go back. It's a very, very bad memory for me. 
I don't want to see it again. There were no John Waynes. No gung-ho guys. Just 
a bunch of human beings. Had we had our choice we never would have gone."  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Stephenson, Studio City Stephenson has chosen to keep his D-Day memories 
alive. He's met with his buddies from the 3rd Armored Spearhead Division every 
year since 1948. Stephenson talks about the war with the clarity of a professor 
of history. He was a newspaper pressman in the 1940s so he got to see his name 
in the paper before he received the famous "greetings" letter. It was 1942. He 
was 21. He went overseas two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Red One, the 29th Infantry Division and the 4th Infantry Division got 
the beaches clear. A storm came up and we were delayed for three days waiting 
for the weather to change. We didn't know what was going to happen. Never been 
in combat before. We were all draftees. We just went about our jobs and stayed 
alert, dug in so we had a place to dive into when shells came in. The dead were 
lieing in fields. No one had time to pick them up. You get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first battle we fought we broke through the German lines like it was a 
football game. We were guards and tackles and (Gen. George) Patton came 
shooting through the middle with the 3rd Army. We still get so mad when the 3rd 
Army is mentioned. We hated Patton's guts. He got credit for everything we did. 
We were the first to reach Belgium. The first to cross the German border. The 
first to capture German tanks. The first to shoot down German planes. The first 
to invade Germany since Napoleon. Patton got all the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 * Anniversary Ceremonies 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning on June 5, President Clinton will join Queen Elizabeth 11, French 
President Francois Mitterand, and former presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and 
Bush for the historic commemoration. Commemorative events will include 
re-enactment of the paratrooper drop by the 82d Airborne Division on 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise. There will also be a ceremony at Utah Beach, where the bulk 
of American forces landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Draghi, Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best-kept secrets of the D-Day invasion was Mulberry, the operation 
to build two prefabricated harbors and breakwaters so troops and supplies could 
be delivered in sheltered waters to support the invasion. That task was left to 
the Merchant Marine. Draghi was part of that operation. He was a radio officer 
on the Liberty Ship S.S. Matt W. Ransom. Draghi is going back to Normandy this 
yea. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the morning of June 6 we knew we were due to go. We watched as the 
warships started out on their mission. Slowly we moved out. There were so many 
ships. All morning and into the evening bomber and fighter planes were headed 
for France -- literally layers of them. Their wings and fuselages were painted 
with white and black stripes. Heavy gun firing was heard. Flashes were lighting 
up the sky. It was almost midnight. I was looking at the wreckage of a Navy 
fighter that had crashed. Suddenly a body appeared . . . and it banged against 
the hull. It was headless. Everyone became silent. The war was real."

MAN CONVICTED IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A reputed gang member was convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder in the 
death of a Canoga Park man gunned down in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Ray Lopez, 20, was found guilty by a Van Nuys Superior Court jury in the 
slaying of Jaime Ramos, 19, who was shot in the head March 29, 1993, by a 
passing motorist while Ramos was riding in his cousin's car on Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard near Wyandotte Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially linked Lopez to the killing after witnesses identified his 
distinctive 1970 red Chevrolet Monte Carlo fleeing from the scene, according to 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his arrest two weeks after the shooting, Lopez initially denied any 
involvement in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ultimately admitted being the shooter, but that it was in self-defense," 
Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos apparently knew he was being attacked because he yelled "get down," and 
pushed his cousin before he was shot in the head, according to testimony at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's second-degree murder verdict means the panel "did not believe it 
was self-defense," Samuels said, adding that she believes the shooting was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Darlene Schempp is scheduled to sentence Lopez on June 17. He faces a 
maximum sentence of 20 years to life in prison.

 An Azusa man who was arrested on suspicion of robbing and assaulting another 
passenger in the bathroom of a bus as it traveled south on the Golden State 
Freeway apparently hadn't thought much about how he would make his escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Collier, 34, was arrested after he followed Vincent Schultz, 46, of 
Orange into the bathroom at the rear of the bus about 2:15 a.m. Monday, said 
Deputy Corry Cline of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Santa 
Clarita Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz told authorities that Collier punched him several times and emptied 
the contents of his pockets onto the bathroom floor before taking his money. 
Collier then returned to his seat, where he stayed until authorities arrested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier was taken into custody after Schultz reported the incident to the bus 
driver, who notified authorities and stopped near Six Flags Magic Mountain in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz was treated for minor facial injuries at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital and released, authorities said. MARK SABBATINI

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PAROLEE TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING OF 
GIRLFRIEND, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old parolee was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges that he 
fatally shot his 16-year-old girlfriend, a Littlerock High School student, when 
she visited his Palmdale apartment to retrieve her pager. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant found that there is sufficient evidence 
to try Manuel Guadalupe Sanchez Jr. for murder after a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's investigator testified that Sanchez admitted firing the handgun that 
killed Nicole Inuma of Llano. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who is on parole for receiving stolen property, also was charged with 
being a felon in possession of a firearm, Deputy Dist. Atty. John B. Evans 
said. The defendant is being held in County Jail without bail, pending a 
Superior Court arraignment June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison with the 
possibility of parole, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's preliminary hearing, Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Lee testified 
that Sanchez provided at least two accounts of how Inuma died May 6 in his 
apartment on 2nd Street E. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first spoke to deputies, Sanchez said he and Inuma were watching 
television when an unidentified man knocked at the door, forced his way inside 
and pointed a revolver at Sanchez. Inuma shoved him out of the way and was hit 
in the chest by a bullet, Sanchez originally told deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a later interview, "his story went from a third party doing the 
shooting to his admission that he was the one who fired the gun," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez told detectives that he was removing a gun from his waistband when it 
fired accidentally, striking Inuma. "The defendant identifies himself as the 
shooter," the prosecutor said. "He just says he had an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said he questions the second account because the bullet followed a 
slight downward path and because several witnesses heard the couple arguing 
before the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, investigator Lee said that Sanchez had stolen Inuma's pager 
"to assist him in selling marijuana." An argument erupted when Inuma arrived to 
take back the device, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Richard Guluzza, called no 
witnesses during Tuesday's hearing. Guluzza could not be reached for comment.

 I'll designate a driver to cruise through my mind.  
</P>
<P>
 But let me tell you  
</P>
<P>
 I'll warn him of the twisted thoughts and ghoulish nightmares.  
</P>
<P>
 That exist on my freeway of thought.  
</P>
<P>
 -- From the poem "Head Trip," by Bowman High School student Christine Forman 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having a troubled past is considered an asset in Richard Weekley's creative 
writing class at Bowman High School, a continuation school for students taken 
out of traditional schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekley has taught students to capture their experiences and emotions through 
poetry. Today, the class will unveil a book of the students' writings called 
"Buried Mirrors" at the school, 21515 Redview Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Forman's "Head Trip" and Len Carthy's "That Damn Basil" are among 
the more than 40 poems written by 23 students contained in the book. Carthy's 
work reads: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm missing a piece of my finger.  
</P>
<P>
 That damn Basil is always trying to break me apart.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the plants are trying to do me in now.  
</P>
<P>
 Or was it that knife?  
</P>
<P>
 I'm missing a piece of my finger.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice big chunk that's gone.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book, available for $2.50, is simple -- 38 pages printed on letter-sized 
paper folded in half. But Weekley and his students said that capturing the 
feelings in print means more than the slickness of the product or its sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people are more poetic here than at a normal high school," said 
Melvin Butters, 18, a student with two poems in the book. "The people here have 
gone through different experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekley said he started the class, now in its second year, because he felt 
there were plenty of talented minds at the school, but many were afraid to 
write because of bad experiences in English classes at traditional schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the main thing they'll get out of this classroom is willingness to 
trust themselves and their thoughts and feelings," he said. "We do a lot of 
encouraging of them to take their feelings and thoughts and express them, 
knowing they won't be laughed at." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Bowman students are willing to "take more chances" than 
traditional students do once they are comfortable writing, making their poetry 
more intriguing, Weekley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Beauchamp, 16, said that he started writing love poems for girls when e 
was a freshman but that Weekley's class has opened him up in other ways. 
Beauchamp has two poems in the book, neither containing any romantic 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's taught us not how to write, but what to pick out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Weekley student, Brian Preece, has won a scholarship to the California 
State Summer School for the Arts in creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekley, whose poems have been published in four countries, said he taught for 
24 years at traditional schools in the Santa Clarita Valley before requesting a 
transfer two years ago to Bowman, where he felt there would be more freedom in 
what he could teach students.  
</P>
<P>
 He said some of his creative writing techniques could be taught at regular 
schools, but a full course on it was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students' enthusiasm for poetry has proved surprisingly strong, Weekley 
added. He said he went to a poetry reading in Los Angeles about three months 
ago, and several of his students asked to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here are the supposed troublemakers, the gang-bangers, and they're sitting at 
a poet-laureate reading, and at the end of it they're going, 'God, that was 
great,' " he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FIRE USED IN EFFORT TO BOOST POPPY GROWTH; 
NATURE: DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION USES 'PRESCRIBED BURNS' TO REMOVE 
NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES THREATENING RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fields that are sometimes ablaze with the vibrant orange of blooming poppies 
were glowing Tuesday morning in the orange of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In an experimental effort, the state Department of Parks and Recreation 
decided to set fire to nearly 15 acres of land within the sprawling California 
Poppy Reserve in hopes of increasing the display of poppies and other 
wildflowers in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully this will be effective and (we'll) continue with a larger program 
and promote more poppies," said Craig Mattson, a supervising ranger with the 
state parks department. "We know fire's real effective with most plant 
communities. This is a real unknown with wildfires." 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called prescribed burns, which charred about eight acres west of the 
visitor's center and more than six acres near the park entrance, burned off 
grasses, tumbleweeds and other non-native plant species that can choke out 
naturally occurring vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalist Mary Lou MacKenzie said that since the state bought the 1,700 acres 
west of Lancaster and designated the land a poppy reserve in the late 1970s, 
the property has remained virtually undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve's volunteer association for several years has been asking that 
steps be taken to keep the poppies plentiful, MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattson said that some consideration is even being given to the prospect of 
allowing sheep to graze within the reserve as a means of reducing the 
non-native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, Mattson said, is that not much is known about the impacts 
of fire or limited grazing on poppies or other wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on a knoll above a slowly burning field, Mattson stressed that there 
are many unknowns. "We may see no poppies on this next year," he said. "And 
then in two years, there may be poppies in this little plot and nothing around 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Crossman, resource ecologist for the parks department, said that 
California poppies usually flourish in areas that are a bit disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the parks department cannot control the weather, particularly the timing 
and amount of rainfall as well as winter and spring temperatures.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after years of drought, optimum conditions and plentiful rains 
resulted in a tremendous poppy season at the reserve, with hillsides covered 
with the state flower visible as an orange glow for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 With little rain this past winter, however, the poppy season was at best 
disappointing. Besides the lack of rain, non-native grasses and weeds 
overshadowed the wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parks department news release states: "No matter what is done, the amount 
and timing of the seasonal rainfall will have more weight in determining the 
intensity of the spring flowering season."

RACIAL TENSIONS BLAMED IN SERIES OF JAIL FIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Racial tensions among prisoners have led to at least five large-scale fights 
at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho since Saturday, resulting in injuries to 
45 inmates, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially motivated brawls at the five-facility county jail are common, but 
tend to occur in spurts, said Sheriff's Cmdr. Robert Spierer. The most recent 
outbreak of fights appears to have been caused by a series of isolated temper 
flare-ups, he said, but word of each disturbance has spread to other inmates 
and further increased tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual . . . when the weather warms up for tempers to flare up," 
said Spierer, who commands the 10,000-inmate jail. 
</P>
<P>
 A disciplinary dorm with restricted privileges has been set up for inmates 
suspected of participating in the brawls, he said. The department is 
considering filing criminal charges against one inmate suspected of inciting 
much of the fighting, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 No deputies were injured during the latest series of disturbances. Six of the 
45 injured inmates were hospitalized. The most serious appeared to be an inmate 
who sustained a puncture wound to the chest. He was listed in good condition at 
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fight started shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday when about 130 black 
and Latino inmates at the jail's maximum security East Facility began arguing 
over who would sit where to watch television, said Sheriff's Deputy Jeff 
Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the prisoners fought with their fists and feet for about five minutes 
before deputies exploded four grenades containing stinging plastic pellets, 
stopping the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten inmates were treated for minor injuries at the jail's clinic, Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four fights erupted Monday, the first at 12:20 a.m. at the jail's medium 
security South Facility when a black inmate told a Latino inmate to be quiet, 
Cannon said. A skirmish between about 30 black and Latino inmates followed, 
which lasted about three minutes before deputies stopped it using pepper spray. 
Eight inmates were treated for minor injuries at the jail's clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 4:30 p.m. another fight broke out at the South Facility, this 
time among 120 inmates in four barracks, Cannon said. The inmates fought with 
broom handles and jail-made knives for about seven minutes before deputies 
stopped the fight with pepper spray and verbal commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Three inmates received puncture wounds and eight others were treated for minor 
injuries at the jail's clinic, Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other fights erupted at 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. in a dorm at the East Facility, 
each involving 50 to 60 inmates, he added. Five of the six inmates injured in 
the second disturbance had to be taken to County-USC Medical Center for 
treatment.

 SAFE BET? Now that Irvine has been named Money magazine's safest place to live

instead of moving their headquarters to the Dallas suburb of Plano, Tex. . . . 
Plano, after all, was only 13th on the magazine's list. Says Brady, who faxed

American Bar Assn. . . . . Newport Beach attorney Art Nakazato, its first 
president, explains: "Traditionally, Asian Americans have shied away from 
litigation. Our group wants to make this place a better place to live by 
pushing for more Asian judges and making people aware of their legal rights." 
The county has about 500 Asian American attorneys.

 DID THEY JUNK IT? Local artist Mitchell Syrop's photograph of a tropical beach 
with the words "Junk Bond" was such a hit with Columbia Savings & Loan that it 
bought the piece for its corporate art collection. Columbia failed, of course 
-- partly because of junk bond investments. Now the Laguna Art Museum is 
looking for the piece -- sold at a bankruptcy auction for $5,500 -- for its 
photo exhibit "Commodity Image." . . . . In the meantime, Syrop, who's speaking 
there tonight at 7, created a copy for the museum's exhibit.

 FEWER DROPOUTS: The good news is that the state high school dropout rate has 
gone down quite a bit in recent years -- 38% since 1986 (A3). And, in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, the same pattern has held. . . . Meanwhile, in 
Glendale, the rate has fallen 82%. But there is some bad news. The 1993 dropout 
rate in Los Angeles Unified, the county's largest district, still was 29.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 SECURE TOWN: Not only do kids stay in school in Glendale, but it's also a 
pretty safe place to live -- 15th safest in the whole United States in fact, 
Money magazine says. "There's a spirit here that doesn't tolerate violent 
crime," said Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen, a city public information officer. . . . Los 
Angeles, to nobody's surprise, was ranked the 17th most dangerous city (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 D-DAY: They went over as boys and now are senior citizens. But for many D-Day 
veterans, memories of the historic Normandy landing 50 years ago have certainly 
not faded (B5). Not when ex-soldiers, such as Jack Stephenson (above), of 
Studio City, keep them alive with annual reunions. . . . "The first battle we 
fought," he said, "we broke through the German lines like it was a football 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 GAY OLE TIME: Everybody will get a chance to meet the Flintstones again when 
the family from Bedrock finally visits the big screen Friday. But many admirers 
already got a glimpse of Fred, Wilma and the gang last spring when the film was 
shot at Vasquez Rocks in Agua Dulce. . . . Universal, in fact, added security 
to make sure that people stayed off the sets. 
</P>
<P>
 PRICE IS WRONG: Haircuts, laundry, dry cleaning. You name it, and women have 
probably paid more for the same service than men. Well, a bill in the state 
Assembly might change that. It's called the Equal Pricing Act, and it would 
make gender-biased pricing illegal. . . . "It's discrimination," said Tricia 
Oeser, NOW coordinator in the Valley, "and we're the ones who can least afford 
it." Michael Arkush

DANA PARSONS: ABUSE MEMORIES TRUE OR FALSE? WE SELDOM CAN BE SURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 John had read my column last week about Sandy, who at 30 remembered for the 
first time that her father had abused her for years when she was a child and 
young teen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted you to hear another side of the story," John said when he called. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked for nearly an hour this week, about himself and the other 50 or so 
members of the Orange County chapter of False Memory Syndrome, a group of 
parents who say they stand falsely accused by their children of molesting them 
as youngsters. John is 62, with gray hair and beard. His story began about 6 
1/2 years ago, he said, shortly after his middle daughter gave birth to a girl. 
John saw the infant at 8 weeks old but shortly thereafter got a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 A social worker told John he could no longer visit his granddaughter. The 
reason, she said during a later interview, was that his daughter had accused 
him of having had sex with her more than 20 years ago when she was a child. "I 
about fell out of my chair and was in a total state of shock," John said. "The 
conversation lasted 10 minutes, and I told her the charge was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days later, he got a letter from his former wife of 25 years, 
detailing the allegations, relayed to her from their daughter. He mailed the 
letter to his daughter's husband, thinking maybe he could shed some light on 
things. Instead, his son-in-law steadfastly supported his wife and made it 
clear that John should stay clear of his granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't seen his daughter or his granddaughter since. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his protestations of innocence, I was shocked to learn that John 
initially questioned whether he was guilty of the abuse. "The first thing that 
happens is you go through an introspection that never ends," he said. He even 
returned to his Midwestern town where the family lived and asked friends and 
neighbors if they remembered anything inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, his ex-wife sent him a follow-up letter in which she 
detailed more allegations and said a second daughter had made similar claims 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I was like anyone else," John said, "thinking maybe I did 
something, maybe something happened, maybe I walked in my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 His ex-wife accused John of "being in charge of a multi-generational satanic 
cult," he said. John believes it is his ex-wife's and daughters' religious 
fervor and the particular kind of therapists they enlisted that accounts for 
their allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hadn't done anything, I asked, why question yourself? "Looking back, my 
first reaction was anger and that it was preposterous, but then you think these 
allegations are being made against me and I'm going to have to defend myself 
and I have to take a close look at my life. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is that some professionals adhere to the possibility of 
repressed memories, while others don't. For example, Paul McHugh, director of 
psychiatry at the esteemed Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, has 
debunked repressed memory. "People don't forget important things that happen to 
them," McHugh told The Times in an interview late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 John's current wife is also involved in the False Memory Syndrome chapter. At 
times, she sounds more outraged than John about the allegations against him. 
"If you talk to these fathers," she said, "they go into deep shock (when first 
accused). It's probably the worst crime a man can be accused of. Initially, 
they get very angry. They say this is totally impossible but yet here is your 
own sweet little daughter, who you've been taking care of all your life, all of 
a sudden is making these accusations and you say, 'How could someone you love 
say this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I tell John and his wife that these repressed memory cases fascinate me, 
because there's often no way to know who's telling the truth and because the 
human stakes are so high. 
</P>
<P>
 In John's case, however, there's at least one more important footnote. I 
talked this week to John's son-in-law, the man who refused to allow John near 
his infant daughter 6 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The son-in-law told me that, after his wife made the original allegations 
against her father, she later implicated her mother. Subsequently, she 
implicated him as well. The couple now is divorced. A court has awarded him 
custody of their daughter, with his ex-wife restricted to limited visitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The son-in-law said he believed his wife until she started accusing him of 
abuse. He says he originally went to "the same type of professionals" his wife 
was seeing and they told him he was an abuser and "part of a satanic cult." 
</P>
<P>
 So, I asked, has that changed your mind about John? "If that much of her 
memories were false (involving himself), then it makes me very, very suspicious 
of the rest," the son-in-law said. "I can't say more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Are you saying you can't exonerate John? I asked. "I cannot ever foresee 
allowing my daughter to be with him alone. There will always be that doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet you were falsely accused, I said. "As you said, there's no way to ever 
know in these cases," he said. "The only way I would ever know for sure is if 
my ex-wife were to recant. That would be the only resolution, and even then, 
who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 John is not legally barred from seeing his granddaughter but both he and his 
former son-in-law believe it would cause too many problems with John's daughter 
if he were to do so. And thus far, John refuses as a matter of principle to see 
the little girl under any ruse that depicts him as anything but her 
grandfather. 
</P>

HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE SHOWS SLIGHT INCREASE IN '93; EDUCATION: COUNTY'S 
OVERALL FIGURE IS BETTER THAN EIGHT YEARS AGO -- AND STILL BELOW THE STATE 
AVERAGE, ACCORDING TO REPORT. VENTURA DISTRICT HAD LARGEST GAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Contrary to a statewide trend of fewer high school dropouts, the number of 
Ventura County students leaving school before they graduate has increased 
slightly, a state report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's dropout rate is still below the state average and is far 
better than eight years ago, according to the report, to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the county's dropout rate moved up from 9.8% to 11.7%, as more 
than 1,100 students from Fillmore to Oak Park stopped attending high school 
before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest increase by far in 1993 was in the Ventura Unified School 
District, where 180 students in 10th grade and above opted out of school, 
causing the dropout rate there to soar from 7.8% to 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dropouts in Ventura were from the district's El Camino independent 
study program, where students meet once a week with teachers and study at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the year, some people just stop showing up," program director Gabe 
McCurtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, Santa Paula, Simi Valley and Oak Park also reported slight increases 
in their dropout rates from 1992 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent increases in some districts, the overall dropout rates in 
most areas of the county have plunged since 1986, when the state began to track 
the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, the number of 10th- through 12th-grade students who left school 
without a diploma has fallen over the past eight years from 17.1% to 11.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Ventura, Simi Valley and Conejo Valley unified school districts 
failed to lower their dropout rates during the eight-year period. But Conejo's 
rate is already one of the lowest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this long-term improvement, officials said, is that schools are 
paying special attention to the needs of students with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, a wide array of alternative education programs have cropped 
up that offer smaller classes, flexible schedules and more individualized 
attention -- all aimed to serve students who have trouble succeeding at 
traditional public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age mothers in the Oxnard Union High School District, for example, are 
able to enroll in a Rio Mesa High School program that provides both 
baby-sitting and free transportation to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Without these amenities, Oxnard Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said, most of the 
200 teen-age mothers at Rio Mesa would have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oxnard has also invested in putting a school psychologist at every high 
school campus to meet with students who have serious family problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides reaching out to students whose family circumstances or academic 
problems may lead them to drop out of school, some districts are also paying 
special attention to the needs of Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, Latino students have for years had one of the highest dropout 
rates of any major ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 But California has dramatically reduced the dropout rate among Latinos over 
the past eight years from 35.1% to 22.3%. And many Ventura County districts are 
contributing to this improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Moorpark Unified School District, the dropout rate for Latino students 
fell from 22.8% to 14.1% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The progress came, school officials said, largely as a result of Moorpark High 
School's expansion of its bilingual program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dropout rate among Latino students has declined dramatically because 
we're meeting their needs," counselor Linda Muscarella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley, Santa Paula, Oxnard Union High and Ventura were the only 
districts in the county where the dropout rate for Latino students rose in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Conejo Valley's overall dropout rate of 5.2% is the second lowest in 
the county after Oak Park Unified, the dropout rate for Latinos rose from 14% 
to 17.5% in 1993. The rate for white students was only 4.0%. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for higher dropout rates among Latinos, school officials said, is 
that families of migrant workers often leave the area to get work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a larger amount of kids moving back and forth because of the job 
situation," said Joseph Studer, principal of Apollo Continuation School in Simi 
Valley, where 18.6% of all 10th- through 12th-grade Latino students dropped out 
in 1993. "They're leaving the district and leaving no forwarding address." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura district, the dropout rate among Latinos skyrocketed in 1993 
from 18.1% to 29.1%, part of the overall rise in the number of students leaving 
school before graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school officials said the overall dropout figures that they reported 
to the state for 1993 may be slightly inflated because they mistakenly counted 
28 students who went on to attend adult school. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with this adjustment, however, the district's dropout rate would have 
risen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the increase may reflect that, for the first time in 1993, the Ventura 
district included as dropouts students 18 years and older. The state counts all 
students up to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park district also reported an increase in its dropout rate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Oak Park students left school before graduating, causing the district to 
lose its 1992 distinction as one of the few districts in the state with a zero 
dropout rate.

SIMI AGENCIES GIVEN $231,000 FOR QUAKE RELIEF; RECOVERY: CITY EARMARKS MOST OF 
$5.5 MILLION FOR REPAIRING STREETS AND HOMES. NINETEEN GROUPS HAD ASKED FOR 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the Jan. 17 earthquake rocked through Simi Valley, causing more than $400 
million in damage, the city's social service agencies kicked into high gear, 
providing food, counseling and moral support for thousands of rattled 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, it was the agencies' turn to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours, dozens of community groups filed past the Simi Valley City 
Council, making pitches for a piece of the city's $5.5 million in earthquake 
relief funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is Simi Valley's share of $127 million in Community Development 
Block Grants paid by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
11 cities and two counties to help relieve earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's sizable allotment came as a surprise to city officials, who 
initially worried that they would not have enough projects to fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council began Monday's meeting by allocating most of the funding to 
city street repair projects and home repair programs, leaving just $231,000 to 
spread among local agencies seeking $1.7 million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups pleading for help included food pantries, counseling services, 
youth programs, historical preservation projects, and advocates for the elderly 
and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many really great projects," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "It's 
tough to pick and choose." 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of city staff, the council focused on projects that directly 
benefit earthquake victims or agencies that help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need to be careful with the way you hand out these funds," City 
Manager Lin Koester warned. "If you give earthquake money to a project that 
isn't earthquake related, the city could be responsible for paying it back." 
</P>
<P>
 The city selected eight of the 19 agencies that submitted applications deemed 
eligible by staff for earthquake relief funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those chosen was the American Red Cross, which operated a shelter and 
food pantry for earthquake victims at Royal High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the agency opened its second Ventura County office in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are grateful to be here and glad for any help you can give us," said Diana 
Grace, district manager of the Red Cross' Simi Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies that received aid include a Catholic Charities program for 
senior citizens; the Food Share food pantry; Lutheran Social Services, which 
provides counseling and support services; the Boys & Girls Club; the Simi 
Valley YMCA; the Simi Valley Historical Society; and the Samaritan Center, a 
homeless drop-in center scheduled to open in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also set aside a reserve of nearly $600,000 for future 
quake-related housing projects and other programs. They encouraged some of the 
agencies they had rejected for funding to work with city staff and reapply for 
the reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't necessarily a final no," Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "Anyone 
who would like another chance at this can talk to staff and come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest request rejected by the council came from Southern California 
Water Co., which asked for $600,000 to repair damaged water tanks. The private 
company supplies water to about 12,000 customers in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said the water company should have had adequate insurance to cover 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bid rejected by the council came from Bottle Village, a folk-art 
collection of buildings made of bottles, which has fallen into disrepair in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Wilson, caretaker at the village, submitted an application for $25,000 
to repair further damage caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members flatly refused, saying they did not want to spend any 
money restoring the village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we would be putting money into something that is not going to 
happen," Councilman Bill Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the city has given the village grants to make repairs. The 
village has remained closed to the public for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the council disbursed its regular $738,000 federal Block 
Grant allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that program, street repairs and ongoing home and commercial 
rehabilitation programs not related to the quake received the bulk of the 
funding, about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Simi Valley Soccer Foundation received $100,000 for 
installation of two soccer fields at Santa Susana Community Park. Earthquake 
Funding About $5.2 million of Simi Valley's share of federal Community Block 
Grant funds went for road and home repairs, leaving about $231,000 for local 
nonprofit and social service agencies. Here is how the City Council chose to 
spend that money: 
</P>
<P>
 Samaritan Center: $79,000 
</P>
<P>
 American Red Cross: $57,000 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities (OASIS): $26,000 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Historical Society: $20,000 
</P>
<P>
 Lutheran Social Services: $18,000 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley YMCA: $12,500 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Council on Aging: $10,000 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share: $5,000 
</P>
<P>
 Boys & Girls Club; $3,400

MEDIATION SUCCEEDS, THERE'S NO ARGUMENT; NEGOTIATING: JAMS OF ORANGE USES 
RETIRED JUDGES TO HELP DISPUTANTS SETTLE CASES OUT OF COURT, SAVING FEES, TIME, 
TROUBLE. 
</P>

 The Bay Area doctor and his wife lost everything in the 1991 Oakland fire. 
</P>
<P>
 They wrangled with their insurance company for three years and were 
considering a lawsuit -- but decided to try a less common strategy instead. As 
a result, they reached a settlement last week in only four hours, saving 
themselves thousands of dollars in legal fees and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit goes to JAMS -- Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services Inc., a 
private, Orange-based company that, for a fee, provides an alternative to 
taking disputes to the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor, whose name was withheld because of a confidentiality agreement, 
met with a representative of the insurance company, and "they just sat down and 
talked it out," said Edward A. Panelli, a recently retired state Supreme Court 
justice who joined JAMS in April. "They were motivated. They just needed the 
push." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no motions, no opening or closing arguments, no paid experts. And 
for using Panelli's services, the two sides spent a total of $1,200 to have the 
issue resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody felt like they were part of the process," Panelli said. "I told 
them about all the problems if they went to court. And they settled it 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The cases heard in JAMS offices range from personal-injury disputes to patent 
claims, company officials say. The most common cases recently, though, have 
involved environmental cleanup disputes and accusations of wrongful discharge 
or sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a sign of the times," said H. Warren Knight, a former Orange 
County Superior Court judge who founded JAMS in 1979 after taking early 
retirement. For the most part, he said, "the profile of our cases is pretty 
much the same as what you will see in court." 
</P>
<P>
 JAMS has seen its business boom recently. And with the hiring of Panelli as 
its chief judicial officer -- a coup for the Orange-based firm -- and a recent 
announcement that JAMS is merging with an East Coast mediation firm, the 
company foresees a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of JAMS with Washington-based Endispute in a stock swap will create 
the nation's largest arbitration and mediation service. The new firm will have 
offices in virtually every major city in nine states and will employ more than 
300 former judges and other mediators. Annual revenue is pegged at about $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 JAMS' success is rooted in the growing acceptance of the so-called alternative 
dispute resolution concept, in which companies and individuals agree to have a 
third party hear disputes and help settle them out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 For many lawyers, hiring a service such as JAMS has a big benefit: By 
resolving routine cases quickly, they have more time to prepare cases that will 
eventually end up before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawyer Robert Beswick said he has been using JAMS as an 
alternative for more than 10 years. "They have been very, very helpful," said 
Beswick, who represents corporate defendants such as insurance carriers. 
"Everyone saves money. And it gets the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The success rate at alternative dispute resolution shops such as JAMS is high, 
Beswick said, because of the mind-set of the attorneys and their clients when 
they seek third-party intervention. In the court system, he said, litigants are 
prepared for battle. In the ADR setting, by contrast, they are seeking a quick 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attorneys get more in the resolution frame of mind before they go there," 
Beswick said. "They are more inclined to settle because they don't have that 
combative attitude like they do in court." 
</P>
<P>
 And with most law schools now including ADR in their curricula, JAMS 
executives say, the company is well positioned for future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was not always the case, though. 
</P>
<P>
 When Knight started JAMS, he was looking for something to do after he stepped 
down from the bench. Knight recalls that he saw then what the court system was 
becoming: an overburdened operation in which fees would inevitably soar as 
cases took longer and longer to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 And, well aware that 95% of cases filed in court are settled before they reach 
trial, Knight saw the market potential of providing a venue for quick 
settlement. So he hung out his shingle in downtown Santa Ana and began 
encouraging local attorneys to bring their clients to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of alternative dispute resolution was still largely unknown at 
that time, though, so Knight's one-man operation limped along at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent $50,000 to make $13,000 that first year," Knight said. "It was not a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stuck to his new enterprise and slowly found growing acceptance in 
legal circles. He also expanded by finding silent partners to invest in his 
firm, which enabled him to buy out smaller competitors from San Francisco to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1985, JAMS posted annual revenue of $1 million. By 1989, the company's 
revenue was $15 million, and Knight had dozens of retired judges under contract 
as dispute mediators. Having outgrown its storefront office in Santa Ana, the 
business moved to bigger headquarters in Orange. Knight says that, since its 
inception 15 years ago, JAMS has heard more than 100,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for founder Knight, who is now 64, he is preparing to hand over the reins. 
Jack Unroe, hired two years ago as the company's chief executive officer, now 
runs the day-to-day operations and develops growth strategies. And recently 
former Supreme Court Justice Panelli took over as chief judicial officer, 
making him the highest-ranking ex-judge in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 As a recruiter, Unroe said, Knight has "gone after the best judges. . . . The 
company has a solid reputation now. I think we will continue to attract the 
best judges." Reaching an Agreement 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring an arbitrator is gaining popularity as a lower-cost, less combative 
approach to settling business disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW ARBITRATION WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 * Those involved in a dispute agree to try arbitration before taking the case 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * An arbitration firm is selected and an arbitrator assigned -- usually a 
retired judge or someone with a similar legal background. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both parties meet with the arbitrator to present their sides of the dispute 
and say what steps they expect other party to take toward resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 * The arbitrator evaluates the problem and helps negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those involved in the dispute then agree on a plan and carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 * If arbitration fails, the case is likely to end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 FINDING AN ARBITRATOR 
</P>
<P>
 * Arbitration firms are listed in Yellow Pages under "arbitrators." 
</P>
<P>
 * Some nonprofit social service groups offer low-cost arbitration or can 
recommend an arbitration firm. 
</P>
<P>
 COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Private arbitration firms charge about $300 an hour. Costs are divided among 
those involved in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nonprofit groups offer arbitration on a sliding-fee scale, based on client's 
ability to pay.

COURT RULING SEEN AS SETBACK FOR UNIONS IN NURSING FIELD; LABOR: THE LEGAL 
DEFINITION OF A SUPERVISOR COULD THIN RANKS OF LOCALS AND AFFECT OUTCOMES OF 
SOME ORGANIZING ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Union organizing in the nursing field -- one of the few industries in which 
organized labor has made deeper inroads in recent years -- has been dealt a 
serious setback by a new U.S. Supreme Court ruling, labor law experts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the high court's decision Monday also argue that, if the 
ruling is broadly applied by lower courts, it could chill union organizing and 
cooperative labor-management programs in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental legal issue in the case involves defining who is a supervisor 
versus a non-supervisory employee. The question is pivotal in some labor 
disputes because supervisors are not covered by the National Labor Relations 
Act, the 1935 law that protects union activities and "concerted" actions by 
groups of non-supervisory employees. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's Supreme Court ruling stems from a complaint filed by three nurses 
who were fired in 1989 after protesting working conditions at their Urbana, 
Ohio, nursing home. They challenged their employer's action, arguing that their 
protest was a "protected concerted activity" safeguarded by the NLRA for 
non-supervisory employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that rules on labor 
disputes, unanimously decided in the nurses' favor. The agency hewed to its 
longstanding view that nurses who make work assignments and exercise 
independent judgment can still be considered non-supervisory workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an appeal by the employer, the Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 
eventually brought the case to the Supreme Court. In its 5-4 ruling, the high 
court rejected the NLRB's stance, declaring that nurses who direct lower-level 
aides were supervisors and therefore could be fired for protesting job 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are especially concerned about this ruling as it comes at a time of great 
cost-cutting in the health care industry," said Virginia Trotter Betts, 
president of the American Nurses Assn. "Now is not the time to tell the 
front-line care-givers in hospitals that they can be fired for complaining 
about management decisions that are detrimental to patient care." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said the ruling, however, does not prevent supervisors from suing for 
wrongful dismissal under other labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court's majority, downplayed the 
notion that the ruling would have broad impact outside of nursing. "Any parade 
of horribles about the meaning of this decision for employees in other 
industries is thus quite misplaced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing the dissenting opinion, warned that 
the ruling could deny the protection of the NLRA to all but a few professionals 
in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor and management groups divided along similar lines in their assessment of 
the ruling, but both sides agreed it would narrow the number of nurses eligible 
for union membership.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, hospitals and nursing homes have been fertile territory for nursing 
unions. For example, the California Nurses Assn., the state's largest nursing 
union, has grown by 6,000 since 1989 to more than 25,000 members today. 
</P>
<P>
 The association represents mostly nurses working in private hospitals. Nurses 
in public health facilities, such as those run by the University of California 
system, are governed by separate state and local laws of collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public sector usually follows the private sector's lead, said James 
Eggleston, an Oakland lawyer who represents the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the persuasive effect of longstanding practice," Eggleston said. "The 
public sector usually follows NLRA precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, organizing efforts have often bent against the supervisor 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, the issue delayed a union election by 10 
months, which gave the hospital owners time to conduct an anti-union campaign, 
said Pat McCarthy, a Los Angeles-based labor representative for the California 
Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 At Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, a 1990 union election lost by four votes. 
In the three years before the next election, McCarthy said, the hospital moved 
nearly 40 employees into the classification of "clinical managers," and then 
argued that they were supervisors and not part of the nurses bargaining unit. 
</P>
<P>
 That election was won by the union -- by one vote. However, Desert Hospital 
has challenged the outcome, McCarthy said, and the NLRB in Washington is 
looking into the ballot procedure.

JOBLESS RATE INCHES UP TO 6.2% IN O.C.; UNEMPLOYMENT: EXPERTS FIND LITTLE 
SIGNIFICANCE IN THE SLIGHT INCREASE AND REMAIN CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite a slight rise reported Tuesday in Orange County's unemployment rate, 
economists counseled cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased unemployment rate does not darken the "slight but improving 
picture" that began to develop earlier this year, said Anil Puri, a Cal State 
Fullerton economics professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving in the right direction," Puri said. "I think that increase will 
continue through the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Employment Development Department reported that Orange County's 
jobless rate for April was 6.2%, up from 5.9% in March of this year and in 
April, 1993. The nation's unemployment rate was also 6.2% last month. 
California's average was 9.1%, and Los Angeles County's stood at 9.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The slight increase in the local unemployment rate isn't necessarily a sign 
that the local economy is in trouble, Puri said. "The unemployment rate number 
can be very cyclical," he said, "and it's affected a great deal by transitional 
factors. . . . I don't think you should give the increase too much 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
 The EDD noted that, though the construction and manufacturing sectors of 
Orange County's economy continued to lose jobs in April, services and retail 
businesses posted gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction lost 200 jobs, transportation and public utilities lost 100 and 
manufacturing employment was unchanged. Services posted the largest gain, an 
increase of 2,700 jobs, while retail added 600 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In non-agricultural jobs overall, we're making improvements," said Esmael 
Adibi, an economist at Chapman University in Orange. "From February to March we 
added 5,000 jobs, and in April we added another 4,000. But the problem is still 
two components of the economy -- construction, which is still not caught up to 
the level of . . . the late 1980s, and manufacturing, where we're still 
witnessing downsizing." Jobless Rate 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Orange County for April was 6.2%, slightly more than the 5.9% 
figure posted in March of this year and in April, 1993. The current rate is 
below the 1993 average of 6.7%. 
</P>
<P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; FOX NETWORK'S HISTORIC RAID REWRITES AFFILIATES RULEBOOK; 
TELEVISION: THE ACTION IS ALSO A REAFFIRMATION OF FAITH IN THE FUTURE OF 
BROADCASTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fox's historic raid on eight key CBS affiliates this week will profoundly 
affect the relationship between networks and their affiliates and could trigger 
a massive realignment of local stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes will also confound TV viewers, who are accustomed to stations 
remaining on the same channel for generations. And sorting out the winners and 
losers may take years. For instance, although CBS in the near term stands to 
lose the most stations, it may be third-place NBC in the long run that faces 
the most serious setback. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming realignment -- described as the largest affiliate switch in history 
-- was put in motion by a precedent-setting agreement announced this week 
between Fox Inc. and New World Communications Group. Under the deal, up to 12 
New World-owned stations will be converted to Fox affiliates in exchange for 
Fox investing $500 million in New World. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the television industry's focus is largely on cable TV 
operators and the race to build the information superhighway, the Fox-New World 
deal is also a bold affirmation of the continuing significance of broadcasting, 
which many experts have declared to be in decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, Fox and New World have driven executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of Fox parent News Corp., has pushed ahead 
with the expansion of the 7-year old Fox network despite skeptics who said it 
would never work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald O. Perelman, the Revlon cosmetics mogul who controls New World parent 
McAndrews Group, has been aggressively working to build a vertically integrated 
media empire over the last several years. Perelman, who is also close to former 
Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, recently consolidated his media holdings, which 
include Marvel Entertainment, TV syndicator Genesis Entertainment, a TV station 
group and infomercial producer Gunthy-Renker. 
</P>
<P>
 By entering into a broad alliance with Fox -- the deal also calls for New 
World and Fox to co-produce programming that will air on both companies' 
stations -- New World paves the way to enter the network business as well. 
</P>
<P>
 New World executives cited as one of the attractions of affiliating with Fox 
the fact that it would open up many time slots that are now filled by CBS 
shows. Fox schedules only 15 hours a week of prime-time programming, compared 
to 22 each for ABC, CBS and NBC. In addition, Fox does not schedule daytime 
programming such as soap operas and news. 
</P>
<P>
 New World wants to use the newly available slots on 12 TV stations it will 
eventually acquire -- it currently owns seven but is purchasing two other 
station groups -- as a "launch pad" for developing syndicated shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The New World shows, however, will be targeted to so-called fringe time 
periods, such as the late afternoon or early evening. While the competition to 
start a new prime-time network is too risky -- both Warner Bros. and Paramount 
are already in a race to establish a fifth broadcast network -- no one has 
tried to build a fourth network in daytime, a lucrative advertising market. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, New World could become a partner with Fox in building a daytime 
and fringe programming schedule. Fox, because of its start-up circumstances, 
has frequently been forced into innovative relationships that the major 
networks have eschewed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, it forged a relationship with cable TV operators around the 
country to give it coverage in areas where it did not have an affiliate, and it 
negotiated favorable channel positions higher up on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these actions boosted Fox's ratings, which have been hampered to some 
extent by the fact that most of its affiliates are UHF outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Murdoch took an important step to becoming a "full" network 
earlier this year when he paid $1.6 billion to acquire the new four-year 
contract to air National Football League games. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of broadcasting in the United States has rested on the peculiar 
relationship between the networks and their affiliates. Fox and New World have 
taken that relationship in a new direction, and the ripple effects are likely 
to be felt for years. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS will be losing affiliates in such key markets as Dallas, Detroit, 
Cleveland and Atlanta. It will need to find new affiliates to replace the ones 
it is losing to Fox -- perhaps with the undesirable former UHF Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that unwelcome prospect, however, things could be worse. CBS just came 
off its third consecutive prime-time season ratings win. Although many analysts 
doubt that CBS, without professional football and the Olympics, can win again 
next season, it still might appeal to certain NBC affiliates, who are 
frustrated with that network's perennial third-place standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, Fox's dramatic raid on CBS is, more than anything, a potent reminder 
that the network-affiliate relationship, long considered the bedrock of 
broadcasting, is at the mercy of sudden disruptions, like any other part of the 
business.

JAMES FLANIGAN: WHAT AILS THE DRUG INDUSTRY HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clintons are irrelevant to prospects for the drug industry. That's the 
blunt assessment of several Wall Street analysts as the President's 
year-and-a-half-long pursuit of health reform turns into the home stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized drug company 
prices and profits from the start, frightening investors and financial 
commentators. That's one reason the stocks of Merck, Pfizer, SmithKline Beecham 
and others are off one-third or more from highs reached in pre-Clinton 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the truth is emerging: Drug stocks are declining because market forces 
are driving the air out of drug prices, forcing the pharmaceutical industry 
into a historic restructuring. Powerful trends in the business show that drug 
companies will continue to merge and consolidate and important drug research 
will increasingly be done by smaller biotechnology companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have had little or nothing to do with those trends, even though 
their criticisms were on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more important has been the rise of discount drug distributors, firms such 
as Medco Containment Services and Diversified Pharmaceutical Services. These 
firms, known as prescription benefit managers, contract to supply health 
maintenance organizations and employers' insurance groups with prescription 
drugs. Then they go to the drug companies and negotiate steep volume discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The prescription managers have taken drug purchasing decisions out of the 
hands of 400,000 to 600,000 physicians and driven prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is well established. For example, even before Tagamet -- SmithKline 
Beecham's well-known ulcer remedy -- came off patent last week, discounters 
were buying the same compound under its generic name, cimetidine, at prices 60% 
below Tagamet's old price. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug patents no longer mean pricing control, says analyst Steven Gerber of 
Oppenheimer & Co.'s Los Angeles office. The prescription managers simply 
command drug manufacturers to sell at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Power has passed from manufacturers to distributors. "What is happening is 
classic capitalism," says analyst Christina Heuer of Smith Barney Shearson. 
"The drug companies were making 20% returns on sales while the rest of the 
Fortune 500 were making 5%. The market adjusts." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug firms for years have maintained that profits had to be high to help 
finance research, on which they lavished 10% to 16% of annual sales. If the 
flow of profits was disturbed, the companies and some economists warned, wonder 
drugs would go undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Wall Street noted that big companies brought out many me-too drugs 
and had to slim down because huge expenditures on marketing -- 25% of sales -- 
no longer made sense when a handful of discount buyers, rather than thousands 
of physicians, had become the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck acknowledged the new environment last year by paying $6.6 billion for 
Medco Containment, the biggest prescription manager, and SmithKline Beecham 
followed two weeks ago by agreeing to pay $2.3 billion for Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services. The drug firms' idea is that owning the distributor 
gets them closer to customers, giving their products at least a chance for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that is not the final chapter. The next step is for the drug companies to 
go beyond the middleman and make direct investments in health maintenance 
organizations and other hospital centers, says Dr. Schumarry Chao of SHC 
Associates, a Santa Monica medical consulting firm. With Merck moving on, 
Martin Wygod, who was running Medco, resigned from the company Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The drug firms would buy into hospitals and HMOs, goes the industry thinking, 
to be able to test their products on patients and show cost benefits to drug 
purchasing authorities. For example, Merck might want to present evidence that 
its cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor can significantly reduce heart attack and 
stroke risks and so is worth a premium price. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, pressure on prices from customers and competition will remain the 
overriding trend. As it happens, the big Swiss drug firm Sandoz Ltd. has just 
brought a cholesterol-lowering drug to the U.S. market at a 50% discount below 
Merck's Mevacor. 
</P>
<P>
 So analysts continue to predict lower profit margins for pharmaceutical firms 
but a bright future for biotechnology companies that have been producing the 
real wonder drugs in recent years. Chiron Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., has 
recently brought out betaseron for alleviating multiple sclerosis; Amgen Inc. 
of Thousand Oaks is doing well with Epogen, the genetic compound that helps 
dialysis patients by stimulating red blood cell production, and Neupogen, which 
stimulates white blood cell production in cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 And hopes for more effective cancer drugs lie now with the biotech companies, 
which are attracting investments to support research from big pharmaceutical 
companies in return for marketing rights to new drug discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 What's biotech's secret? "More focused energy than the big companies," says 
Jim McCamant, editor of Berkeley-based Medical Technology Stock Letter. That 
means lower costs and an ability to work simultaneously in several disciplines, 
from biochemistry to computer science, as the frontiers of medicine demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biotech companies provide value added," says analyst Gerber of 
Oppenheimer. Which is why investors generally give them higher relative prices 
than older drug companies. While government ponders health reform, the market 
adjusts -- and looks ahead.

GTE SEEKS APPROVAL TO OFFER VIDEO SERVICES; TECHNOLOGY: VENTURA COUNTY IS AMONG 
FOUR MARKETS THE TELEPHONE COMPANY PLANS TO PROVIDE WITH PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 GTE Corp. said Tuesday that it plans to build a high-tech network that will 
initially allow customers in Ventura County and three other markets to receive 
video programming from the phone company instead of their cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending approval from the Federal Communications Commission, GTE said it will 
begin construction this year on a system that will deliver programming as early 
as next March to 550,000 homes in Ventura County; St. Petersburg and 
Clearwater, Fla.; Honolulu, and northern Virginia. Over the next 10 years, GTE 
plans to make its video service available to about half its customers 
nationwide, or about 7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamford, Conn.-based GTE, the nation's largest local phone company, thus 
becomes the latest among several telecommunications firms in recent months to 
directly challenge cable TV companies. The phone companies will develop systems 
of fiber-optic lines and coaxial cable that can deliver broadcast, cable TV and 
interactive programming, such as movies on demand or home shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional phone companies are attempting to set up video networks as quickly as 
possible to head off impending competition in their core local phone markets 
while providing new sources of revenue. U.S. West and Time Warner's cable 
division, for example, have targeted Hawaii and Florida for a joint project to 
build "full service networks" that provide local phone service as well as cable 
and interactive video. 
</P>
<P>
 About 83,000 households in Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, Camarillo, Port 
Hueneme, Santa Paula and Oxnard will be among the first in California to have 
access to a television programming provider other than their local cable 
operator. The cable companies in the area that would face competition for the 
first time include Century Cable, Comcast Cable, Jones Intercable and Ventura 
County Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies have said they welcome the competition as long as they are 
allowed to compete in providing phone services. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell is awaiting FCC approval to build a similar network and hopes to 
have its first customers in San Jose, Reseda, Orange and San Diego connected 
later this year. Both GTE and Pacific Bell said they expect the investment to 
be recouped by revenue from the new services and will not ask for basic rate 
increases from phone customers to fund the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE said installing the network will cost $300 to $350 per home, plus the cost 
of a converter box in each home that decodes the digital information sent over 
the lines. It said the $250 million to build the system in the first four 
markets is in addition to the $2.7 billion GTE spends annually on upgrading its 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone company said it is selecting the communities to get the service 
first based on competition, population density and demographics. Robert 
Calafell, vice president in charge of video services at GTE's Irving, 
Tex.-based Telephone Operations unit, said consumers today spend an average of 
$31 a month on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at consumers who will in 10 years from now spend $75 to $80 a 
month on cable and cable-like (interactive) services, so that average has to do 
a little more than double," Calafell said. He and other GTE officials declined 
to say how much they would charge for their service. 
</P>
<P>
 But both GTE and Pacific Bell, along with local phone companies in other 
states that plan to dive into the video business, face a struggle to line up 
programming to send over their fiber webs. Pacific Bell has announced no 
programming deals since its announcement last November that it would spend $16 
billion over the next 7 years to deliver video service to 5 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE hopes to capitalize on the telephone industry's reputation for reliable 
service, compared to the spotty record of cable, Calafell said. And while 
conceding that his cable competitors may have the advantage in packaging 
programming, he said programmers of all kinds will be interested in the new 
distribution network his firm will be offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service could be especially valuable for regional-based programming, 
such as sports networks, which may not have the clout or national appeal 
necessary to get room on a cable operator's channel lineup.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no telling how many consumers are likely to sign up for "TV via 
telco." Of the 7 million homes that would have access to its video services by 
2003, GTE expects about 2 million to subscribe. But GTE's western area vice 
president, Mike Crawford, declined to estimate how many Ventura County 
residents would opt for GTE's service.  
</P>
<P>
 "Main Street" -- the interactive service GTE developed in Cerritos that 
includes movies on demand, long-distance learning and interactive games -- will 
be available in Ventura County. But Crawford said the Cerritos test, which got 
a lukewarm reception and is viewed by some as proof that consumers are not 
interested in interactive services, was about technology, not the consumer 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crawford: "If I had any good market research on that, I would give it to 
you, but we're just going to have to learn."

IBM MOVES ALL ITS ADVERTISING TO SINGLE FIRM; INDUSTRY REELS; MARKETING: THE 
MOVE MAY BE THE BIGGEST AD ACCOUNT SHIFT EVER. THE COMPUTER MAKER SAYS THE 
CONSOLIDATION WILL BRING CONSISTENCY TO ITS IMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. stunned Madison Avenue on Tuesday by 
consolidating responsibility for virtually all of its advertising at a single 
agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives said it was probably the biggest advertising account shift 
ever. Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide was given responsibility for work currently 
handled by more than 40 agencies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge computer maker refused to say how much it spends on advertising, but 
knowledgeable sources speaking on condition of anonymity said IBM spends 
between $400 million and $500 million a year on ads. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM said having Ogilvy as its lone agency will help it deliver clear, 
consistent messages more efficiently while getting more mileage out of what it 
said is one of the world's best-known brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said IBM is taking a big risk in putting a single agency in charge of 
such a large account all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM officials said it was equally risky to continue its old course. With 
its advertising divided among so many agencies, they said, the company had been 
projecting many images. Its ads for personal computers looked much different 
than those for big machines, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in the New York suburb of Armonk, has seen its profit and 
stock price sag in recent years as technology changed its cost structure and 
pressures mounted from a number of competitors in various segments of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM said the selection of Ogilvy resulted from an analysis over the past 
several months of its advertising and direct marketing strategy by a team of 
its worldwide advertising executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby F. Kohnstamm, IBM's vice president for corporate marketing, said the move 
to a single agency was a group decision. She said the group decided "we would 
be better able to maintain and increase brand awareness by having a single 
agency to leverage IBM and its products around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Ogilvy surprised some industry executives, particularly because 
Ogilvy is not on IBM's agency roster. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York-based agency has an international network of 270 offices in 
59 countries and impressive creative credentials. Its clients include American 
Express payment cards, Jaguar cars and Maxwell House coffee.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; DOWNSIZING THE MACHINE; 
NORTHROP LATEST TO DITCH MAINFRAME COMPUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KARON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times are hard in the aerospace business, hard enough that at Northrop Grumman 
Corp.'s venerable manufacturing facility in Hawthorne, management has taken a 
radical step. It decided to ditch the big iron. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say the plant will stop being the sole manufacturer of fuselages 
for Boeing 747 jets. The "big iron" being shed is a 20-year-old IBM mainframe 
computer, which the fuselage factory will leave for use by other Northrop 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place, the Hawthorne plant has adopted a state-of-the-art system of 
smaller, networked computers that will do everything the old machine did and 
much more, all for a fraction of the cost of living with the mainframe. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop is far from unique in the move away from mainframes. Much to the 
dismay of International Business Machines Corp., Amdahl and other "big iron" 
providers, the aerospace giant is joining waves of American companies that are 
trading in their old mainframes for webs of smaller computers in a "downsizing" 
process almost as pronounced as the corporate downsizing that has slashed 
employment at many big companies coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are realizing the kind of cost savings and flexibility they can get 
with these 'client-server' systems," said Nancy Stewart, a computer industry 
analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose market research firm. "That's certainly 
where we see the growth in the computer systems market." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northrop, it all started as a result of slumping demand throughout the 
aerospace and defense industries, coupled with increased worldwide competition 
in the fuselage business, which combined to step up the pressure for greater 
efficiency at the Hawthorne facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in 1992, Northrop's manager of business systems, Joseph Dugan, began 
putting together a plan for a new computer system that would help the company 
cut costs and modernize its manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to cut data-processing costs by two-thirds, and we knew we had to 
go to a client-server solution," Dugan said. "It just wasn't clear at the time 
that the systems could handle a manufacturing environment of this size." 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of Northrop's Hawthorne operation is daunting. There are 256,133 
parts in a single Boeing 747 fuselage, if you count every nut and bolt. Each 
fuselage must be assembled perfectly; Boeing won't even accept one if the 
polished surface of the outer aluminum skin is so much as scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the lure of smaller computing systems was so great that Northop's planners 
persisted. Moving away from mainframes, they knew, could save the company the 
enormous effort and expense of developing and maintaining the vastly complex 
software applications that run on mainframe computers. 
</P>
<P>
 It can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to write and 
periodically upgrade mainframe software. As a result, it was clear that the new 
system Northrop envisioned, once installed, would pay for itself in a few 
months just from these savings. (Northrop won't say what the new system cost, 
however.) 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Dugan and his colleagues made it a top priority of their new system 
that it would run on off-the-shelf software. The computers on desktops 
throughout the facility could be based on any one of several operating systems, 
including Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foundation of the system tying the computers together was to be a 
powerful operating environment known as Unix. Originally used primarily in 
scientific environments, Unix software applications were powerful but arcane. 
In recent years, however, a growing number of user-friendly software 
application packages have started to win Unix broader use in business settings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northrop system is anchored by eight Hewlett-Packard servers -- computers 
the size of a small refrigerator, with huge data-storage capacities. The 
servers are networked to clients -- personal computers such as Macintoshes and 
other personal computers, including Hewlett-Packard Unix workstations and 
low-cost Unix X-stations. All in all, the system will serve hundreds of users. 
</P>
<P>
 The many different sorts of computers on the system can work together through 
the Unix operating system, Dugan said, which makes it possible for the smaller 
computers to carry out mainframe-scale tasks. Also, Unix is an "open" system, 
meaning Unix is available from a number of different software companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the smaller computers were up to the mainframe's tasks and 
then some. Less than 18 months after planning started, it has become clear that 
the system can not only handle the workload, but has enabled the Hawthorne 
division to redefine almost every aspect of its business, from back office 
financial reporting to inventory management to the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the old days, various kinds of data existed separately, and 
couldn't be easily consolidated into revealing reports. The new system, Northop 
says, brings together all this data. Thus, for the first time, top managers can 
get a complete picture of every aspect of operations, from the status of 
materials coming from a supplier, to Northrop's own factory floor, until Boeing 
takes delivery of the products. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the advantages of this architecture is that it gives us the ability to 
use an integrated set of statistics, graphics, and engineering software 
application tools that is probably 10 times as powerful as what we were coming 
from," Dugan said. Just one example: under the old, mainframe-based system, all 
of the engineering drawings and schematics -- and there are thousands -- were 
on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 All the old drawings have been scanned into the new system, and digitized. 
Now, the Northrop engineers can find any drawing in seconds, said Ron Bourassa, 
project manager for manufacturing engineering systems. Viewing the drawings on 
the high-resolution color monitors, the engineers can zoom in and out to any 
part of the drawing on their screens without having to page through a lot of 
paper. Any changes they make are instantly recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already made a profound difference in our business," said Judy Jurdans, 
manager of general accounting and cash management. The system has permitted 
staffers to produce much more reliable financial information, she said, and in 
much less time than under the old procedures.

 Although large mainframe computers are still important in business, many 
companies are finding that smaller computers linked in client-server networks 
are more flexible and efficient. As a result, worldwide mainframe sales have 
been slipping, while shipments of server units, which support client computers,

 Hughes Wins Fees in Whistle-Blower Case: Hughes Aircraft Co. said a federal 
judge in Los Angeles ordered a would-be whistle-blower to pay the company more 
than $140,000 in legal fees because the plaintiff pursued his lawsuit even 
after it was rejected by the court in March. Don H. Haycock, a lawyer and 
former Hughes manager who filed the suit in 1990, continued to pursue the case 
"for no other purpose than to harass Hughes," U.S. District Judge David V. 
Kenyon said in his order. Haycock, who alleged that Hughes mischarged labor 
time at one of its engineering laboratories between 1983 and 1987, said he will 
ask Kenyon to reconsider his order, adding, "I'm quite sure it will be 
reversed."

 GM Recalling 207,000 Vehicles: The auto maker said it is recalling the 
mid-size cars and small sport utility vehicles to fix two unrelated safety 
defects. The first recall involves about 164,000 of the 1988-90 Pontiac Grand 
Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal cars and 1990 Chevrolet Lumina 
cars with base steel wheels.Those wheels will be replaced because they could 
crack and fall off the vehicle, General Motors Corp. said. In addition, 43,000 
of the 1993-94 Geo Tracker sport utility vehicles are being recalled to check 
for the possibility of a weld on the rear axle assembly being in the wrong 
place, which could cause reduced braking ability. The top U.S. auto maker said 
it is not aware of any related accidents or injuries.

 GATT Declares U.S. Tuna Boycott Illegal: A panel of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade has ruled again that U.S. efforts to end tuna fishing 
practices that endanger dolphins are illegal under GATT rules. The U.S. boycott 
of tuna caught with purse-seine nets, used now mostly by the Mexican fishing 
fleet, is required by the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. This ruling was 
seen by some U.S. environmentalists as less onerous than the 1991 case, 
however, because the GATT panel accepted the concept -- rejected in the earlier 
ruling -- that nations can enforce such environmental regulations outside their 
own territories. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the ruling will 
be appealed.

20TH CENTURY INDUSTRIES MAY GO ON THE BLOCK; INSURANCE: CEO TELLS SHAREHOLDERS 
THAT SALE OF THE QUAKE-RAVAGED COMPANY IS AN OPTION IF RATE INCREASES ARE 
REJECTED.

 The leadership of 20th Century Industries, in the aftermath of an earthquake 
that wiped out nearly two-thirds of its surplus, on Tuesday broached for the 
first time the idea of putting the 35-year-old insurance holding company up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing shareholders at the firm's annual meeting, Chief Executive Neil H. 
Ashley said management's goal is to try to "recharge" the capital base without 
going on the sales block. It would do this through a combination of hoped-for 
rate increases, plus a victory in its pending Proposition 103 legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But if those efforts fall short, Ashley said, "people are standing in line" 
for a chance to recruit potential investors to buy all or part of the Woodland 
Hills-based parent of 20th Century Insurance Co. The firm has not sought any 
buyout offers or hired an investment banker, but it has listened to proposals 
from investment bankers, a company spokesman said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk is surprising from a company that prides itself as being an 
independent, California-grown firm whose streamlined insurance business 
consistently ranks among the nation's most profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century has long been regarded as an attractive merger partner, but a 
sale or takeover seemed unthinkable while founder and Chairman Louis W. Foster 
was in control. However, Foster, 81, last year stepped down as chief executive 
and has since taken a less active role in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated $600 million in claims from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
caused 20th Century to declare a record $340-million first-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In an action that will save about $16 million, 20th Century directors voted 
Tuesday to suspend the dividend on the company's shares for the final two 
quarters of this year. The second-quarter dividend, already declared at 16 
cents a share, will be paid as scheduled June 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has yet to act on 20th 
Century's emergency request for a statewide 172% increase in its earthquake 
insurance rates. The rate hike is designed to generate an additional $36 
million in premiums and to discourage many customers from buying earthquake 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 At a May 11 hearing on the request, Insurance Department spokesman Bill Schulz 
said a decision would be made in about a week. On Tuesday, he said the request 
remains a high priority, but he could give no explanation for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 About 275 shareholders crowded a conference room at the Marriott Hotel in 
Woodland Hills for the 2 1/2-hour annual meeting. The venue seemed appropriate 
because of the huge crane parked outside the hotel to repair quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shareholders sharply criticized 20th Century's performance. Some 
questioned why it stays in the homeowners and earthquake insurance business 
when auto insurance provides the vast majority of its revenue and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley said it would be difficult to drop 240,000 homeowners policyholders 
(about 75,000 of whom also carry earthquake coverage) without inviting a 
backlash from the Legislature and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Shapiro, who described himself as a longtime shareholder, asked whether 
the board is too old to be "up to the challenge" of overseeing 20th Century. 
The all-male, 11-member board has an average age of 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, 71, defended the directors' capabilities. Ashley, who retired as 
president in 1989, was brought back as chief executive last year in what was 
meant to be an interim move until a new management team could be named. He said 
the quake has temporarily forced the board to put aside work on the succession 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One shareholder drew applause by suggesting that the board slash management's 
"bloated bonuses." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proxy statement, Foster was awarded a $500,000 bonus this 
year in addition to his salary of $507,250 and other compensation of about 
$130,000. Ashley drew a $200,000 bonus on top of his $215,000 salary. The next 
four highest-ranking officers received bonuses totaling $235,000.

 Blockbuster Says Viacom Merger Uncertain: Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne 
Huizenga said the status of its proposed $6.3-billion merger with Viacom Inc. 
is still in limbo. Blockbuster officials also said that the merger won't happen 
unless the value of the package of Viacom securities offered -- now about $23 a 
share -- reaches $31 a share by Sept. 30.Analysts have predicted that the deal 
will fall through. The plan, announced in January, calls for Blockbuster, the 
nation's largest video retailer, to buy 23 million of Viacom's Class B shares 
at $55 a share. But Viacom's shares have been under pressure; the New 
York-based company reported a first-quarter loss of $431 million due to the 
expected high cost to gain control of Paramount Communications Inc. Blockbuster 
helped Viacom finance the first stage of its $10-billion acquisition of 
Paramount.

FDIC FUND AT 10-YEAR HIGH AS BANK FAILURES GRIND TO HALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fund that insures depositors at defunct banks rose to its highest level in 
a decade in the first quarter, as bank failures halted for the first time in 16 
years, regulators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said its bank insurance fund had a balance 
of $15.2 billion at the end of March, up from $13.1 billion at the end of 1993 
and the highest level since $15.4 billion at the end of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, which protects depositors against losses of up to $100,000, had red 
ink of $101 million at the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A steep drop in failures has contributed to the health of the fund, which was 
depleted in the late 1980s and early 1990s after banks fell victim to the woes 
of the energy, real estate and farm sectors. Failures were then as high as 200 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the most recent quarter was the first time since the second 
quarter of 1978 that no banks went bust. Failures hit an 11-year low in 1993, 
when just 42 banks closed. Bank earnings, meanwhile, surged to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than the economic recovery," said banking analyst Bert Ely of Ely & 
Co. "We've had sharply improved real estate markets in New England and the 
mid-Atlantic states. At the same time, we haven't had any new markets fall into 
the tank and pull down banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The first-quarter level of the bank insurance fund was equal to 80 cents for 
every $100 in insured deposits, or 0.80% of deposits. The ratio was 0.69% at 
the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, the FDIC must boost the fund until it reaches 1.25% of deposits -- at 
which time banks could see a cut in the premiums they pay for deposit 
insurance. That could filter through to consumers via higher rates on savings.

FOOD POISONINGS PUT DENT IN SIZZLER'S FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS; FINANCIAL: LOS 
ANGELES-BASED RESTAURANT CHAIN TAKES $137.5-MILLION CHARGE AFTER QUITTING 
CHICAGO MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sizzler International Inc., still hurting from an outbreak of food poisonings 
last year, said it will take a $137.5-million pretax restructuring charge in 
its fiscal fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 About $70 million of the charge reflects the cost of exiting the Chicago 
market and disposing of about 50 restaurants where sales suffered because of a 
rash of illnesses linked to the E. coli bacteria last year, the restaurant 
chain said. 
</P>
<P>
 After taxes, the charge will reduce the steak-and-salad chain's earnings by 
$3.42 a share, resulting in a loss of about $3.26 a share for the year ended 
April 30, Sizzler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based company also said Richard P. Bermingham, its chief 
executive, will retire effective June 1. The firm said Kevin Perkins, who is 
president, will hold the additional title of chief executive upon Bermingham's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzler's sales dropped sharply last year after several diners at three 
Sizzler restaurants in Washington and Oregon were struck with food poisoning 
caused by E. coli bacteria, which can cause severe, bloody diarrhea and 
abdominal cramps. All of the diners recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases drew widespread attention in the West, where a similar case of E. 
coli poisonings at Jack in the Box restaurants caused two deaths and more than 
600 illnesses in Washington and Nevada in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzler has since changed its food handling procedures on the recommendations 
of health specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bermingham presided over the company for 14 years. Perkins is a former 
president of Sizzler's Asia/Pacific operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Jim Collins said the restructuring charge "will enable the company to 
maintain a tight strategic focus on developing our core businesses both in the 
United States and overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 About $35 million of the charge relates to the write-off of intangible assets 
from Sizzler's 1991 reacquisition of Sizzler Restaurants International and the 
related merger with Collins Foods International Inc., Sizzler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the charge is for "liquidation of surplus property and other 
associated costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Smith Barney Shearson continues to advise it on other 
alternatives to boost shareholder value, such as acquisitions, divestitures and 
joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzler also announced that its board of directors has agreed to declare a 
regular quarterly cash dividend of 4 cents a share, payable July 15 to 
shareholders on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzler has 648 restaurants worldwide and plans to open between 20 and 25 new 
restaurants in fiscal 1995, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizzler shares fell 12.5 cents to $6.875 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Tuesday. The announcements were made after the close of business.

U.S., JAPAN WILL TRY AGAIN ON TRADE TALKS; COMMERCE: THE AGREEMENT TO RETURN TO 
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE OVERCOMES KEY HURDLE OF NUMERICAL TARGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG and DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after U.S.-Japanese ties sank to their lowest point in the 
Clinton Administration, negotiators agreed Tuesday to resume trade talks, with 
U.S. officials painting a suddenly sunny picture of one of the country's most 
important, but troubled, relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can guarantee that these agreements are going to work," U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said, but he added, "I can tell you we have 
momentum and dedication and purpose and involvement at the highest level of the 
Japanese and U.S. governments." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Japanese officials said the accord, hammered out in five days of 
meetings, gets the two sides over a key hurdle involving how to determine 
whether the terms of any trade agreement are being met if numerical targets, to 
which the Japanese object, are not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripped of the diplomatic veneer in which it was cloaked, the breakthrough is 
little more than an agreement to return to the negotiating table. And it leaves 
the two trading giants not much closer to a substantive agreement than they 
were last July, when they first established a "framework" for their talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said in Tokyo, brings 
the two sides to the "starting line, not the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone conversation Tuesday between President Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, both "agreed that we can move forward now 
quickly," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said later that he is confident Tuesday's agreement will lead to a trade 
accord. "I am absolutely confident we will find a way," he said. "Japan is 
determined to open its markets, and the U.S. is just as determined to sell 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations are intended to increase foreign sales in Japan in four key 
economic sectors: government procurement of medical and telecommunications 
equipment, insurance, automobiles and auto parts. Kantor expressed hope that 
the talks can be broadened to include financial services, glass products and 
intellectual property rights, which covers an array of creative endeavors 
ranging from musical composition to pharmaceutical research. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, U.S. officials hope Japan will relax its barriers to foreign 
products and bring down its trade surplus, which last year reached $131 billion 
in goods and services. Its trade surplus with the United States alone was $59 
billion, and is expected to climb this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States offered a firm commitment to avoid specific numerical 
targets for foreign sales in Japan. Instead, the two sides agreed to place 
their focus on "results-oriented goals," which would include both "quantitative 
and qualitative criteria."  
</P>
<P>
 A quantitative measurement, Kantor said, could include "the prompt, 
substantial and continuous increase in sales" by foreign insurance companies in 
Japan, for example, or in the number of U.S. car dealerships there. 
</P>
<P>
 A qualitative measure, he said, could be the degree of cooperation between 
U.S. auto parts suppliers and Japanese car makers in research and development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the United States retained the option to use trade laws, 
including the imposition of tariffs and quotas on Japanese products sold in 
this country, if sufficient progress is not made in the resumed talks. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains uncertain is whether either government is strong enough to 
withstand pressure not to yield when compromise is required in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton faces a tough battle to gain congressional approval of a new world 
trade agreement, and he has only limited leeway in the concessions he can make 
toward Japan. Similarly, Hata is struggling against a powerful Japanese trade 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there is pressure on Hata to smooth the rough edges in 
Japan's relations with the United States because, political analysts believe, 
the turmoil contributed to his predecessor's fall from office this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, U.S. officials said there are no deadlines for achieving their goals. 
"It would be unfortunate, unnecessary and unreasonable to put any particular 
date on these agreements," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese official in Washington said his government hopes sufficient 
progress can be made to enable Hata to visit with Clinton in Washington before 
the two attend an international economic summit conference in July in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of hard bargaining left to do," a senior Administration 
official said.

SUPREME COURT DEALS BLOW TO NURSING UNIONS; LABOR: CRITICS SAY THE RULING ON 
SUPERVISORY STATUS, IF BROADLY APPLIED, COULD PUT A CHILL ON ORGANIZING IN 
OTHER TRADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Union organizing in the nursing field -- one of the few industries where 
organized labor has made relatively deep inroads in recent years -- has been 
dealt a serious setback by a new U.S. Supreme Court ruling, labor law experts 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the high court's ruling Monday also argue that, if broadly 
applied by lower courts, the decision could chill union organizing and 
cooperative labor management programs in other trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental legal issue in the case involves defining who is a supervisory 
employee and who is not. The question is pivotal in some labor disputes because 
supervisors are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the 1935 law 
that protects union activities and "concerted" actions by groups of 
non-supervisory employees. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's Supreme Court ruling stems from a complaint by three nurses fired 
in 1989 after they protested working conditions at an Urbana, Ohio, nursing 
home. They challenged their dismissals, arguing that their protest was a 
"protected concerted activity" safeguarded by the NLRA for non-supervisory 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that rules on labor 
disputes, decided in the nurses' favor. The agency hewed to its long-held view 
that nurses who make work assignments and exercise independent judgment can 
still be considered non-supervisory workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an appeal by the employer, Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 
eventually brought the case to the Supreme Court. In its 5-4 ruling, the court 
rejected the NLRB's stance, saying nurses who direct lower-level aides are 
supervisors and therefore can be fired for protesting job conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling "comes at a time of great cost cutting in the health care 
industry," said Virginia Trotter Betts, president of the American Nurses Assn. 
"Now is not the time to tell the front-line care givers in hospitals that they 
can be fired for complaining about management decisions that are detrimental to 
patient care." 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers said the ruling does not prevent supervisors from suing for 
wrongful dismissal under other labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, downplayed the notion 
that the ruling will have a broad impact outside of nursing. "Any parade of 
horribles about the meaning of this decision for employees in other industries 
is thus quite misplaced," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing the dissenting opinion, warned that 
the ruling could deny the protection of the NLRA to all but a few professionals 
in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 While differing on whether the ruling applies to other industries, labor and 
management lawyers agreed that it will narrow the number of nursing home and 
hospital nurses eligible for unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Nurses Assn., the state's largest nursing union, exemplifies 
the recent success organized labor has enjoyed in health care: Its membership 
has grown by 6,000 since 1989 to more than 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly will make it more difficult for unions organizing in nursing 
homes and hospitals," said Jerry M. Hunter, a St. Louis management lawyer who 
until last year served as general counsel of the NLRB.

CABLE TV REGULATOR GOES FENCE-MENDING; MEDIA: CHAIRMAN HUNDT TELLS INDUSTRY 
EXECUTIVES THAT HIS AGENCY HAS NO PLANS FOR FURTHER ROLLBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With the cable TV industry reeling from forced rate reductions of 17%, Federal 
Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt told industry executives Tuesday 
that he foresees no further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no evidence to support a further reduction . . . and we are not 
looking for such evidence," Hundt said, seeking to ease concerns of cable 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt said he has "sympathy and concern" for the plight of cable operators who 
complained that the rollbacks have handicapped them in the race to build the 
information superhighway. At the same time, he defended the rollbacks, arguing 
that the industry is extremely healthy and that the new regulations will help 
promote competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to eulogize at your wake," Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt also indicated that the FCC will not enact a so-called productivity 
offset that could have forced many cable company operators to scale back rates 
another 2%, largely wiping out increases they can pass along to subscribers 
because of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sort of offset is generally found in the regulations of a utility, but 
cable is not a utility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry has been vociferous in its complaints about the new 
rollbacks, claiming the cuts will cost it about $3 billion a year in cash flow. 
The reduction in cash flow will in turn prevent operators from borrowing money 
to invest the capital for the building of the broad-band, 500-channel TV system 
of the future that is supposed to offer customers a panoply of new home 
shopping services, movies on demand and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction among cable operators to Hundt's remarks was optimistic but 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good, but God is in the details," said Tim Boggs, a vice president at 
Time Warner Inc., the second-largest cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hundt offered few specifics about the kind of "refinement" the FCC has 
in mind for its implementation of the rate rollbacks mandated by Congress in 
1992. He acknowledged, however, that the FCC is looking for "programming 
incentives" that would encourage operators to add channels while keeping some 
flexibility in pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV stocks appeared to react favorably to the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Corp., the country's fourth-largest operator, saw its Class A stock 
jump $1.75 a share Tuesday to $17.125 in Nasdaq trading. Cable stock prices 
have been so depressed that Comcast last week reduced the price of a 
$200-million offering to finance its United Kingdom cable systems to a range of 
$14.50 to $15.50, down from the original asking price of $16 to $18 a share for 
11.7 million shares. The company may pull the offering altogether, or may sell 
8 million shares at $13 per share.

 North Slope Oil Production at 85% of Normal After Spill: Operations at 
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field have been scaled back since Saturday as British 
Petroleum transferred the remaining oil from the East Lion, a tanker chartered 
by BP America Inc. that leaked 200 gallons of oil at the Port of Valdez. The 
port, the southern terminus of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, was closed Saturday, 
then partially reopened Monday. Production was slowed to keep the pipeline from 
carrying more oil than could be stored at Valdez.

 Tobacco Industry Sued for Medical Costs to State: Mississippi filed the 
lawsuit in a state court, claiming cigarette makers owe its taxpayers hundreds 
of millions of dollars for the expense of treating tobacco-related illnesses. 
R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris and other manufacturers are among the 13 
defendants, along with the Washington-based Tobacco Institute lobby, the 
Council for Tobacco Research, and wholesalers and distributors. The suit also 
seeks an injunction against selling tobacco to minors.Attorney Edward Sweda of 
Northeastern University's Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston said the 
suit marks a new approach to tobacco litigation and could lead to similar 
actions elsewhere. A spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds said, "This is an 
unprecedented ploy for suing tobacco companies, but beyond that, it really 
changes nothing."

 Health O Meter Swallows Up Mr. Coffee: Mr. Coffee Inc. said it has agreed to 
be gulped by Health o meter Products Inc., a smaller company that makes 
medical, office and household scales, for $135 million in cash, or $15.50 a 
share.The announcement was a surprise to some in the appliance industry, who 
had expected that the Ohio manufacturer of coffee makers would be sold for a 
higher price to an established industry player. Health o meter had sales of 
$67.6 million last year, less than 40% of Mr. Coffee's $175 million. On Nasdaq, 
Mr. Coffee shares fell 62.5 cents to $14.50 and Health o meter rose 62.5 cents 
to $6.25.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHY BOND BULLS NEED TO WAKE UP, SMELL THE COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone trying to sell you a bond nowadays will tell you that the recent jump 
in long-term interest rates is a false alarm, at least as far as inflation is 
concerned. There is no inflation to speak of, the bond bulls insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, you're a coffee drinker. The price of a pound of coffee on 
futures markets has rocketed from 72 cents at the start of the year to $1.33 
now -- an 85% gain -- as bean production has fallen drastically in South 
America and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, General Foods just decided to boost the retail list price of a 
can of regular Maxwell House coffee from $2 to about $2.50, or 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities are the proverbial fly in the ointment of the no-inflation crowd 
this year. Though prices of crops, metals, wood products and other raw 
materials are constantly in flux, their general direction has been unmistakably 
up lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities shot up on Monday, 
causing a mini-panic in the bond market. On Tuesday the CRB fell 1.5%, but it's 
still near a 3 1/2-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB index is heavily weighted toward grain prices, so it has been surging 
in recent weeks as fears about a dry Midwest spring have driven crop futures 
higher. Meanwhile, another commodity index -- the Journal of Commerce 
Industrial index, which tracks prices of metals such as aluminum and zinc -- 
also has been advancing strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, rising commodity costs aren't translating into a higher consumer price 
index. The bond bulls argue that commodities' rally is a blip, and that the 
world economy isn't strong enough to support higher raw materials prices for 
long, let alone higher prices for finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contend commodities' recent gains are merely the work of professional 
traders, not the result of "real" demand. There is some truth to that. Caroline 
Van, analyst at hedge-fund tracker International Advisory Group in Nashville, 
says her firm is increasingly hearing from big investors who want to place 
money with hedge funds that trade commodities. "They're interested in 
commodities as a (new) asset class," Van says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, well-known hedge fund manager Mark Strome believes metals 
such as copper, nickel and aluminum are poised for dramatic price rises. "I 
think this is the opportunity" in financial markets in '94, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But for metals prices to surge, Strome concedes, real demand -- from busier 
factories churning out more goods -- will have to be there worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Genetski, who runs a Chicago economic advisory firm bearing his name, 
believes that stronger-than-expected demand for goods and services will in fact 
be the No. 1 surprise of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, Genetski argues, allowed money to be so loose for 
so long (1991 to 1993) that the seeds of robust future business and consumer 
spending are already sown. 
</P>
<P>
 While the conventional wisdom is that the Fed's interest rate hikes this year 
will slow the economy, Genetski points to the surge in bank loan demand from 
business borrowers in recent months as evidence that the economic expansion is 
gaining steam, not losing it. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding, 
which plunged from 1991 through '93, have jumped to $605 billion from $585 
billion at Jan. 1, even as loan rates have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher demand for goods and services -- not just in America, but also now in 
recovering Europe -- is what's behind the upward pressure on prices of many 
commodities, Genetski says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Jim Grant of Grant's Interest Rate Observer newsletter in New York 
has in recent months catalogued how depleted stocks of many raw materials have 
become over the past few years, as industrial and agricultural capacity has 
been slashed. Coffee is one example; and in grains, "Ratios of stocks 
(inventories) to usage stand at a severely low ebb" globally, Grant says. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory problem is key, because it is the rebuttal to the argument that 
increasing global competition will suppress commodity price hikes. 
Unfortunately, competition can't occur overnight in many depleted markets, 
Grant warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though raw materials account for just one-third of manufacturing costs 
(labor is two-thirds), Genetski sees enough of a push in commodities to lift 
annual inflation, now about 3%, to 5% in '95 and 6% in '96. There could be 
winners in the stock market under that scenario (see box below), but the bond 
market would be a goner. Commodity Plays 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks of companies tied to commodity industries, such as chemicals, energy 
and metals, have generally performed better than the broad market this year. A

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CASE STUDY: HOW 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A BUSINESS; CLIENT-SERVER COMPUTER SYSTEM STREAMLINES TITLE 
INSURANCE COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Title companies play an important role in the real estate industry, issuing 
insurance policies that verify ownership and guarantee there are no liens 
against a property. They also handle escrow proceedings when properties change 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But obtaining and combining the disparate information that goes into title 
insurance documents can be tricky. A property's ownership history -- its title 
chain -- is maintained in enormous handwritten title books, some dating back a 
century or more. Tax roll information is obtained from a computer at the county 
recorder's office. Property deeds are recorded on microfiche. 
</P>
<P>
 A truly integrated system should be able to quickly combine all this 
information, while taking title officers through each stage of the document 
preparation process. It should route documents from one worker to the next 
electronically. And it should coordinate the activities of the title department 
with the activities of other departments in the company, such as escrow and 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computers help with isolated tasks, such as calculating insurance premiums or 
estimating closing costs," says Devin Park, president of Trico Title. "But very 
few companies have put together integrated systems that can handle all aspects 
of the title and escrow process." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing so was the challenge facing privately held Trico. Its solution involved 
one of those Information Age buzzwords -- re-engineering -- that are repeated 
so often in business that they start to lose their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 To make its vision of a coherent work process a reality, Trico adopted an 
entirely new type of computer architecture known as client-server. 
Client-server gets its name from the way computers are connected in a network. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, desktop "clients," such as Macintosh computers or Windows-based 
PCs, share the resources of a common "server," a larger computer designed 
especially for storing lots of information. It serves files to the client 
computers connected to it, and runs central applications that all the clients 
can access. 
</P>
<P>
 Client-server architectures are attractive because of their flexibility: Users 
can share the resources of the entire computer network, yet each user has his 
or her own personal computer to perform distinct tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The real challenge is developing the applications that can run on these 
networks. Older computer applications are designed to process information and 
store data centrally, on one big computer. Client-server applications, on the 
other hand, divide up the processing load among many different computers.  
</P>
<P>
 Intensive database processing is handled by powerful servers. Report writing 
and spreadsheet analyses are done right on the client computer, so individual 
users have maximum control. Data can be stored on clients or server or both, 
depending on the computing task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Client-server applications must also be designed around the graphic user 
interfaces that are common on today's personal computers. These interfaces make 
working with computers an active, visual experience. Instead of typing cryptic 
commands in response to prompts, users take control and let the computer 
respond to them. They can navigate through colorful windows and perform actions 
by "pointing and clicking" with the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 To tie all this technology into a cohesive system, Trico needed special 
application development tools. After testing several products, the company 
selected Ideo from Sapiens U.S.A. Inc. of Cary, N.C. Ideo applications can 
access many different types of data and are designed especially for 
client-server networks. With Ideo, it took just eight weeks to create the 
preliminary version of Trico's Integrated Title and Escrow System. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 Workers begin by clicking the New Order button on-screen with the mouse, or 
calling up an existing order by customer name, customer number or parcel 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the property address has been entered, the county tax roll is 
automatically consulted for information about the current owner and property 
values. When the purchase price of the property is entered, information from a 
set of rate tables is automatically consulted, enabling the system to determine 
the title insurance fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The system then selects an appropriate title officer to perform the title 
search, based on each person's unique skills and preferences, and routes the 
open documents to his or her PC. 
</P>
<P>
 Title officers see images of the actual deeds and maps displayed on their 
screens, just as they are accustomed to seeing them in the parcel maps and 
title books, along with the starter information, tax roll information (updated 
daily from the county recorder's office) and property index information (from 
an off-site mainframe). Having all the information in one place makes it easy 
for them to complete the process and quickly issue the title insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the title insurance documents are completed, electronic-mail messages are 
automatically sent to other escrow officers and accounting personnel to 
complete the escrow process, with all pertinent information routed 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Trico selected its Santa Maria office as a test site for the new client-server 
application. After some initial training, productivity increased almost 
immediately. Other title companies in the area average six or seven policies 
per person per day. Trico's Santa Maria group is now churning out 35 to 40 
orders per person per day, with a reduction in support people for routine 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put data in a form that everyone can use," Park says, reflecting on the 
recent flurry of activity. "Ultimately, we hope that usefulness will extend not 
only to title companies, but to lenders, real estate offices, county recorders 
and tax assessment offices."

 What Magellan was at sea, what Roald Amundsen was to Antarctica, what Chuck 
Yeager was to the sound barrier, Carl Malamud is to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, pushing out the envelope of cyberspace is a little less treacherous 
than reaching the South Pole by dog sled, but in his own way, Malamud is no 
less intrepid an explorer. Among his innovations: He was the first to broadcast 
a radio program via the Internet, he was the driving force behind the project 
to bring Securities and Exchange Commission filings to the Internet, and he was 
the developer of "an experiment in remote printing" that lets you send a fax 
halfway around the world -- free -- simply by sending electronic mail to a 
special address. 
</P>
<P>
 Malamud, who refers to his nonprofit Internet Multicasting Service as a 
"cyberstation," is also a respected consultant and computer networking guru. We 
caught up with him in Las Vegas at the recent InterOp trade show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you doing here in Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, we run the first radio station on the Internet. We send audio out. 
This isn't newspaper, this is people sitting in front of their computers and 
listening. People listen on any personal computer that has multimedia 
capability, so that's any Macintosh or any PC with a sound card or any high-end 
workstation. They listen to national press club luncheons, they listen to 
famous poets reading their own work. We do original programs -- for example, 
I'm the host of "Geek of the Week," a very technical interview show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't "Geek of the Week" available on cassette in bookstores? Why would 
anyone want it on their computer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you have to go to the store and get it, whereas you've already got 
your computer on your desk. We're not going to replace audiotapes and we're not 
going to replace $10 radios. On the other hand, our programming stays around 
forever. You can listen to it whenever you want. You can stop it when a phone 
call comes in. You can pull the piece out that you like and ignore the rest. 
And so in that sense it is a new medium, and there are occasions in which it 
makes the most sense to actually listen to something on your computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I tried to download one of your radio shows. After an hour and a half, I 
had about 12 megabytes, which was not quite half the show. I thought, "There's 
something wrong with this picture." 
</P>
<P>
 A: You know what's wrong? You're trying to run it over 9,600-baud modems. And 
I'm not saying there's something wrong with the 9,600-baud modem, but if you're 
trying to get a 35-megabyte file, it doesn't make a lot of sense. It's like 
driving a huge truck down a little country road. On the other hand, there are 
roads out there that are big. There are literally 2 to 3 million people on the 
core of the Internet, people that have dedicated links, their network manager 
goes out in the middle of the night and brings it in, and in turn you have a 
10-million-bit-per-second link into your corporate network. All of a sudden it 
takes a few seconds to get that file instead of six hours. So you can't look at 
something and say, "Gee, this isn't universal." 
</P>
<P>
 When CNN started cable TV and satellite-based systems, people in the country 
couldn't do it, and people in many areas couldn't do it. But you have to start 
someplace. What's interesting about our medium is the audience that can receive 
text on the Internet is now 30 million people. And the audience that could 
receive audio is 2 to 3 million. We're not trying to reach everybody, but we do 
have an audience of about 100,000 people in 30 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have put the Washington, D.C., restaurant Red Sage on the Internet by 
providing images from its menu and even a way to make reservations by fax. What 
was the point of that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is the beginning of trying to get as many of the restaurants in D.C. 
as we can on the Net. The real reason we're doing it is, we're a public 
cyberstation. We're a nonprofit. Most of what we do is global in scope -- 
things like SEC documents and U.S. patents. But we feel that as a 
Washington-based organization, we have to begin having local roots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's interesting, because usually the whole idea of something like a 
cyberstation is that it is no place. It's virtual. Net "citizens" can reside 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A: People think of the Internet as a replacement for real life, and I think 
that's wrong. Electronic mail is part of the arsenal of things we do as human 
beings. It doesn't replace the phone, it certainly doesn't replace human 
contact. In fact, it makes human contact easier and better.  
</P>
<P>
 The same thing with our cyberstation in D.C. Just because we're on the Net and 
anyone in Japan can get to us doesn't mean that we're not still human beings 
and a part of our community. It's not a replacement for the real world, and 
that's really important.

Environmental declined to identify the company it purchased, saying only that 
it had 1993 revenue of $1.8 million.

US FACILITIES INVESTORS EXPECTED TO BACK FIRM'S SALE; INSURANCE: BIGGEST 
SHAREHOLDER DECIDES TO SUPPORT PROPOSALS BY HOSTILE SUITOR FIDELITY NATIONAL IN 
VOTE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The fighting words that have spewed forth in news releases and letters to 
shareholders of US Facilities Corp. during a monthlong hostile takeover bid 
should end today, with investors expected to back a proposal to put the company 
up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest shareholder, money manager SC Fundamental Inc. in New York, 
decided Tuesday to throw its 9.8% stake behind two proposals sponsored by 
hostile suitor Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine, which owns 9.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, is asking shareholders of 
US Facilities to vote at the annual meeting today to put the company on the 
market to the highest bidder and to put two Fidelity nominees on the Costa Mesa 
insurance company's board. 
</P>
<P>
 While the vote appears to be going Fidelity's way on the sale issue, it is a 
much closer call on whether Fidelity's candidates will be elected as directors, 
according to large shareholders and sources keeping track of shareholder votes 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity has offered $79 million for the company, though a sale to Fidelity at 
that price isn't before the shareholders yet. The bidder's hope is that 
consistent earnings of US Facilities will help to level out the cyclical nature 
of its real estate-related business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would win the shareholder vote if SC Fundamental votes with us," William 
P. Foley II, Fidelity's chairman, said in a brief interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity is believed to have about 2.4 million shares, or about 41% of the 
shares outstanding, committed to its sale proposal. Management is believed to 
have about 1.7 million shares committed to its effort to derail Fidelity's 
march toward a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Those among the 2,850 shareholders who have signed over proxies -- the right 
to vote their shares -- still can revoke them and turn the votes over to the 
other side or appear in person to vote their shares. But only the shares 
present at the meeting can vote, and as much as 25% of the shares may not be 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by SC Fundamental to give its proxy to Fidelity was a blow to US 
Facilities' management. 
</P>
<P>
 SC Fundamental is voting to put Fidelity's two nominees on the board to 
"ensure" that US Facilities will act in the best interests of its shareholders, 
partner Gary N. Siegler said. Of Fidelity, he said, "We think that their offer 
is serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley charges that George Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman, is simply trying 
to save his job by urging a vote against Fidelity's proposals. Kadonada denies 
it, contending that Fidelity hasn't made a firm offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadonada, who has urged slow going but refused to delay the annual meeting for 
any negotiations, would not comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities has a basic value of about $11 a share, according to major 
stockholders. But they think the firm's potential growth could send the sale 
price as high as $20 a share. Fidelity is offering $15 a share, still above the 
$13 to $13.75 closing stock prices of the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock closed Tuesday at $13.50 a share, up 43.75 cents, in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 After only one meeting between Foley and Kadonada early this year, Fidelity 
caught the Costa Mesa firm off guard April 26 with a strongly worded proposal 
to buy the company. If directors didn't act by the end of that week, Foley said 
in a long letter, Fidelity would begin to solicit votes from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a surprise to me," Kadonada said in an interview earlier this month. 
Directors of US Facilities met that Friday but delayed any action until 
mid-May, opening the door to Fidelity's effort to win over shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening salvo May 3, Foley wrote to shareholders that turning down 
Fidelity's bid would leave them with "an under-performing company and an 
under-performing stock" that reflect "chronically lackluster performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadonada lashed back in a letter that questioned the credibility of the 
proposal, which technically had expired, and the financial ability of Fidelity 
to pay for the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake," he wrote, "Mr. Foley's sole motivation is to exploit your 
company to advance his own interests and those of other Fidelity National 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley responded by saying his company had "reiterated" the offer and pointed 
out that it had picked up $104 million in a recent public debt offering to pay 
for the purchase. He said the slow procedures set up by Kadonada to review the 
offer were a "sham" designed to create a temporary illusion that US Facilities 
directors were truly evaluating the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, the rhetoric intensified as news releases and letters 
sometimes came out twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, a research firm that advises large institutional companies 
involved in proxy fights recommended that shareholders support Fidelity's sale 
proposal and its director nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional Shareholder Services in Bethesda, Md., also charged that 
Kadonada had misled shareholders about Fidelity's actions by grabbing at straws 
to discredit the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities responded by saying that Fidelity was "on a fishing expedition" 
and had made no firm offer to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Major shareholders, though, appear to be backing Fidelity, at least on the 
sale proposal. And they think that a vote to put the company on the market is 
essentially a vote to sell it to Fidelity if the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Fidelity loses, the stock price will go down," said one money manager who 
controls about 2% of the stock. "I don't understand (US Facilities') case." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shareholders say Kadonada has made some mistakes that have cost them 
money. Among those are the acquisition of a company that reviews medical bills 
and the move to increase business in the risky property and casualty insurance 
area when the company had been doing so well selling less risky medical 
stop-loss coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "US Facilities is a well positioned company with a lot of potential," said 
Michael Halpern of Dorchester Advisors in Los Angeles, which controls about 1% 
of the stock. "Only some of the potential is reflected in their recent income 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
 He wants the company to be sold to the highest bidder, and he thinks it could 
fetch as much as $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of shareholders are splitting their votes, favoring the sale proposal 
but backing management's director candidates. Siegler at SC Fundamental thinks 
that's unwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we don't have reason to believe that (the company's slate) won't act in 
the best interests of shareholders," he said, "voting for Fidelity's 
resolutions will ensure that that process ensues."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: DIGITAL SENDS 250 COSTA MESA WORKERS TO IRVINE IN 
COST-CUTTING MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Digital Equipment Corp., the Massachusetts-based computer maker, has moved 250 
employees from its Costa Mesa office to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which happened over the weekend, was made to save money, said 
officials from Digital, which has been cutting costs for about two years. 
During the past 18 months, it has laid off 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa employees were moved to a building next door to Digital's 
Irvine facility at 22 Executive Park. In the past, the two sites had performed 
different functions. Now both sales and service will be handled from a single 
office, said Stephen Georgoulis, the company's site services manager for the 
western states.

BRIEFCASE: TOURISM; PROPOSED WEEKLONG GATHERING WOULD END IN COLLEGE TITLE GAME

 The Walt Disney Co. has enlisted the county's top business executives to help 
sell the idea of Disney Classic Week, a proposed gathering of scholars, 
musicians and athletes that would culminate in a mid-January matchup between 
the nation's two top-rated college football teams at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a real opportunity to showcase the county, more of a chance to 
bring the county together," said Robert Fluor, chairman of Partnership 2010, a 
business group trying to encourage economic development into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents are painting Disney Classic Week as a boon to tourism. The ABC 
television network would build 22 hours of broadcasting around the week, much 
of which would focus on Orange County. Backers add that a study by Chapman 
University shows that the event would pump $125 million a year into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 While continuing efforts to get the county to rally behind the idea, the 
backers need to persuade a majority of the 106 presidents of colleges that play 
NCAA Division IA football who have collectively never shown much interest in a 
national championship of college football. 
</P>
<P>
 To entice the reluctant, the game is being sold as a package along with events 
that would bring in top scholars, artists and musicians from all the schools -- 
not just those with the two top football teams. The game would also generate a 
guaranteed minimum of $70,000 for every college in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about a football game," said former Disneyland President Jack 
Lindquist, who is heading the Disney Classic efforts. "We're talking about 
bringing in 1,200 to 1,500 students, of which (about) 200 will be football 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Lindquist said, 35 college presidents have endorsed the idea and five 
said they oppose it. The matter will likely be taken up at a NCAA meeting next 
January.

SUNSOFT'S ZIMMERER QUITS POST; VIDEO GAMES: FIRM'S EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT WAS 
AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HIGHEST-RANKING WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rita Zimmerer, one of the highest-ranking women in the male-dominated video 
game industry, has resigned as executive vice president and general manager of 
Sunsoft of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerer, who joined the company in 1989 as director of sales, was responsible 
for obtaining the rights for Sunsoft video games to use characters based on 
Warner Bros.'Looney Tunes cartoons as well as Walt Disney Co. and Hanna-Barbera 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartoon-like games such as Rabbit Rampage, based on the character of Bugs 
Bunny, helped Sunsoft to expand rapidly, growing under Zimmerer's leadership to 
$40 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Tad Shimamoto, vice chairman of the Japanese-owned company, said Tuesday that 
Sunsoft has changed its corporate strategy recently and is scaling back earlier 
expansion plans because of declining demand for Nintendo and Sega video games 
in anticipation of new technology. The company is focusing its resources 
instead on coin-operated arcade games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Video games are a tough market this year because everyone is waiting," 
Shimamoto said. "After Christmas, we'll have a much better idea where the 
industry is going." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerer could not be reached Tuesday for comment. Shimamoto, who has run 
U.S.-based computer companies for 30 years, praised Zimmerer's accomplishments. 
He said he will assume her duties.

 Disneyland Hike: After a year without an admission increase, Disneyland is 
getting more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has raised prices by $1 to $31 for adults and $25 for children.The 
local discount program that has shielded Southland residents from higher prices 
-- they pay a flat $22 -- ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike can be interpreted as good news for the local economy because it 
shows that Disney has confidence that tourists will pay more to enter the Magic 
Kingdom. It comes, too, when Disneyland has no major new rides for summer. Its 
prime new attraction will be a parade down Main Street promoting the animated 
movie "The Lion King" due for release next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland also keeps searching for other ways to make money. The latest twist 
is a chance to watch the Fantasmic water show from the balcony of an apartment 
that Walt Disney had built for himself in New Orleans Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime viewing comes with coffee and dessert at a cost of $25. 
</P>
<P>
 In another cost-saving move, Disneyland will not open as early this summer. 
For the first time, the park will open daily at 9 a.m., instead of 8 a.m., to 
reduce payroll. As usual, it will close at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are always trying things out to see how they can best use their 
manpower," Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said.

2ND CARRERA FOUNDER LEAVES TO START COMPETING BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Faust, one of four founders of Carrera Computers Inc. in Laguna Hills, 
has left the computer design company to start a competing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Frye, president of Carrera, said Faust left because of "philosophical 
differences" among the founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Both young companies focus on designing computers based on so-called "reduced 
instruction set computing," or RISC chips, which run faster than conventional 
computers by using pared-down instructions to perform tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust started NEKOTech Inventory Conversion Inc. to build "speed demon" 
computers based on chips made by Digital Equipment Corp. NEKOTech is showing 
its first computers this week at the Comdex computer trade show in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust and several other Carrera employees left Carrera to start NEKOTech in 
February. He started Carrera in May, 1991, to build computers that are based on 
high-performance chips made by MIPS Technologies and DEC. Mark Perry, another 
co-founder of Carrera, left in January to join a family business. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Carrera's two remaining founders, Brad and Rod Frye, have hired 
replacements and are showing their own competing computer hardware at the trade 
show as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Brad Frye said Carrera reported sales of about $1 million since its computers 
hit the market last August.

PILLOW FIGHTS; DOES HE LIKE TO HOG THE COVERS? DO HER FREEZING FEET AWAKEN YOU? 
SUCH VIOLATIONS OF 'BED-IQUETTE' NEED NOT TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE, O.C. EXPERTS 
SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Life with your significant other has never been better. You love spending free 
time together, your differences are few and far between, the sex has been 
great, there's nothing to complain about -- except around 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you're perpetually miffed about the way he pulls all the covers to his 
side as soon as he drifts off, or maybe she gets up and turns on the light to 
go to the bathroom, shaking you out of REM. This is the realm of bed-iquette, 
the unwritten manners by which two people form a sleeping relationship. And 
when one partner begins to tread on the other's sleeping patterns, problems 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to bed makes a lot of people recall their childhood," says Theresa 
Lavenau, a marriage, family and child counselor in Huntington Beach. "It's hard 
to let go of your consciousness; it's your most vulnerable time, and people can 
be very picky about what they need to go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Art and Brenda Perry of Mission Viejo have a classic bed-iquette dispute. He 
likes to sleep in a warm room with a top sheet and a light blanket. She prefers 
a cool environment with two blankets and a comforter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Michigan; I have a permanent aversion to being cold," says Art, 41. 
"For years I went to bed in cold rooms and shivered all night. Now that I'm in 
California, I don't want to shiver anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda, 39, a California native, wouldn't mind a little of those Michigan 
winters. "I love being under covers and breathing in the cool air. There's 
nothing worse than waking up hot in the middle of the night and finding that 
Art has turned the furnace on." 
</P>
<P>
 When they began sharing a bed six years ago, the Perrys didn't realize that 
their temperature differences would lead to arguments later. "When we started 
living together, there were priorities other than sleeping in bed," Art says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a relationship is still in its early stages, there's usually more of a 
congruence with sleeping," says psychologist Karyn Sandburg of Santa Ana. "The 
behavior and habits of each partner is tolerated. But at some point, as the 
relationship continues, that capacity for making compromises about bed habits 
can be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 After many arguments that turned sleep time into a nightmare, the Perrys 
worked out a compromise. Art would wear pajamas to bed to keep from being 
chilled and he wouldn't insist on turning the heater on. Brenda, in turn, 
promised to keep the window closed. "Once in a while we might have a 
temperature problem, but most of the time our compromise works," Brenda says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's not the climate outside of bed, it's the temperature under the 
covers that causes controversy. "My hands and feet are always cold, which is a 
problem for my husband," says Sandy Miller, 44, of Newport Beach. "I'm the only 
woman I know who's been told to wear socks to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, John J. Miller, 47, a physician, says, "We spend a little time 
cuddling before going to sleep, which helps Sandy warm up. And I'm usually very 
warm, so I'll let her touch me so she won't freeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides temperature (which can be regulated by dual-control electric 
blankets), another touchy point in bed is space. There appear to be people who 
sleep comfortably on their half of the bed without veering over into their 
partner's territory, while others consider the entire bed shared space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lucked out," says Sandy Miller. "My husband and I talked about sleeping 
preferences during one of our first dates, and we both agreed that when it's 
time to sleep, we rolled over to our separate spaces. We knew we were 
compatible from that moment on." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Drews of Huntington Beach, however, the issue of separate space was 
one of many bedtime problems. "We had a large king-size bed, and Ed just liked 
to sprawl all over it," says Caroline, 58. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always start out in one place, but in my sleep I'd just move around a 
lot; it was never intentional, but I just got in her way," says Ed, 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a nightly battle for territory, the Drews have had arguments during 
their 28 years of marriage over Ed's desire to stay up and watch the 11 o'clock 
news and Caroline's passion for a "neat" bed, even while asleep. "I have to be 
fully tucked in at all times," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, their nighttime relationship has never been so great. There are 
no arguments and no hard feelings in the morning. Around 10:30 p.m., both get 
ready for bed, they kiss good night, then Ed walks down the hall to their son's 
old room and sleeps there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our son moved out, I said jokingly that one of us should try sleeping in 
his room," Ed says. "I gave it a shot, and it's worked out fine; our 
relationship hasn't lost anything. You don't have conversations when you're 
asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lavenau, the marriage, family and child counselor: "If the relationship 
is truly good, then maybe they've made it better by sleeping in separate rooms. 
They can relate and enjoy each other at different times, and the bedroom's not 
important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a stigma in our culture about the bed. If you can't sleep 
together, people assume there's something wrong," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon to see older couples sleep in different bedrooms, says 
psychologist Sandburg. "Their differences at night become so great, they can't 
be bridged, so they work out a different solution." 
</P>
<P>
 As in most relationship issues, the key to sleeping in harmony is meeting each 
other half way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's usually lots of room for compromise in bedroom disputes," Sandburg 
says. "If one partner likes to watch TV late, maybe they can get earphones. If 
another likes to read, they can get a small book light. One person likes a lot 
of covers? What about putting more covers on one side of the bed. It just takes 
a little thought and consideration to work out solutions like these. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides have to have an attitude that they're going to solve a dispute 
over this," she says. "They both have to bend, but not too far. Too much 
bending by one person can lead to resentment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Perry, who describes herself as a "cuddler," wasn't thrilled when she 
learned that her future husband didn't like any touching at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caused some problems for us during the day too. I didn't feel truly 
accepted by Art because he didn't want me in his space. Some nights, as it got 
closer to bedtime, I'd just get very tense. I used to put a lot more blankets 
and pillows on the bed to kind of compensate for what I saw was his lack of 
attention," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Differences in a relationship can be much more pronounced at night," Sandburg 
says. "During the day, you can avoid each other. But at night, there's no 
escape, you're together. When there's a problem between a couple sharing a bed, 
it's not uncommon for one to sleep with a lot of stuffed animals or pillows or 
blankets to get the nurturing they're not feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lavenau, "When a couple comes to me with a problem like, 'He insists on 
having a warm bedroom, and I want it cold,' my first question would be whether 
they're arguing about something else. Are you really saying, 'My needs aren't 
important to him'? You need to see if these problems at night translate into 
problems during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 It took some long talks, but Brenda now accepts Art's desire for his space in 
bed. "I told her and showed her how much I loved her, but I couldn't sleep with 
the two of us wrapped up like a pretzel," Art says. "Instead, we just hold 
hands."

TWO WOMEN, TWO ERAS, TWO ROLE MODELS; FIRST LADIES: IN THE '60S, WE ADORED 
JACKIE. IN THE '90S, WE ANALYZE HILLARY. WHAT A DIFFERENCE THREE DECADES MAKES 
IN OUR PERCEPTION OF THE 'IDEAL WOMAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One was the perfect hostess who charmed the world and redefined the title of 
First Lady with her style, elegance and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, a driven professional who wins admiration with her eloquence, 
intellect and unflinching determination, is revolutionizing the role of 
presidential spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades separate the reigns of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, and no two women better illustrate the sea change in public 
perception of the "ideal woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very different image," said Brenda Castro, 50, one of hundreds of 
longtime Jackie admirers who assembled at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday 
to bid her farewell. "Jackie's from an era of grace and elegance, when women 
were supposed to be charming hostesses and adoring wives. Hillary is from a 
different era. She's from an era when you should get an education and go out 
and make change and be very verbal about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But both women stand apart from other First Ladies because they epitomize -- 
Jackie for the 1960s and Hillary for the 1990s -- what a woman "should be." 
</P>
<P>
 As she waited for the motorcade carrying Jackie Kennedy Onassis' body, Jenifer 
Lucas, 48, of Arlington, Va., said the difference between the two First Ladies 
reflected the amazing metamorphosis American women have made in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young woman in the early 1960s in Topeka, Kan., she said, she aspired to 
be like Jackie Kennedy. "She epitomized so much of what girls of our age were 
brought up to think we should be," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as an attorney for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, she 
looks to Hillary Clinton as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up in a time when women were expected to be educated but not have 
careers," she said. "You were supposed to be a supportive wife, a gracious 
hostess and a good mother. That was Jackie. Now women are expected to have 
successful careers. That's Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, Lucas and other women gathered along the avenue leading to the 
cemetery recalled the impact Jackie Kennedy had on American women of all ages, 
ethnic backgrounds and economic classes, starting with the 1960 presidential 
campaign. She showed them that a woman could be a supportive wife and mother, 
dazzle people with her looks and still have an identity of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember voting for her," Castro said enthusiastically, making it clear 
that in her view, casting a vote for JFK was casting a vote for Jackie as well. 
"It was John and Jackie, not just John." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the Clintons started campaigning did Castro again feel that she was 
supporting a couple and not just a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 With her pillbox hats, command of foreign languages and dashing, accomplished 
husband, Jackie was the standard of a successful woman in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hillary does that now for people my age and younger because she speaks on the 
issues we care about," Castro said. "But she's a totally different woman, and 
we admire different things in her. She's intelligent, forceful without being 
aggressive, focused, directed, accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hillary Clinton's unprecedented 66-minute news conference in April, she 
presented herself as a "transitional" First Lady. Dressed in pink to highlight 
her traditional femininity, she expertly defended her role in making unusually 
successful investments for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author of "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," argues 
that Jackie Kennedy was also a transitional First Lady. Although she was 
praised for being ladylike and having unrivaled fashion sense, she helped in 
her own way to open the door for the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an independence in the way she approached the first ladyship," 
Goodwin said. "Even though she was doing traditional feminine interests -- art, 
culture and fashion -- she was independent in how she pursued them. She was a 
symbol of the coming independence of women to do as they like." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin stressed that it was much easier in the 1960s, when the media 
spotlight did not shine so relentlessly, for a First Lady to become a public 
idol. People saw Jackie when she wanted to be seen, and they hardly ever heard 
her speak. To most Americans, she was the silent, dignified image that she 
projected on television screens and in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of Jackie's majesty depended on her mystery," Goodwin said. "I'm not 
sure that kind of political celebrity can exist today. We know so much more 
today about everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Kennedy, for instance, was never pressed by reporters about her 
husband's infidelities. But Hillary Clinton had to face such questions before 
and after her husband came to office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton, who has described herself as a very private person, clearly 
envies the distance Jackie Kennedy was able to create between her family and 
the press. The morning after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died, Hillary Clinton 
told CNN how grateful she was for conversations that the two First Ladies had 
had about "how she had managed so well to carve out the space and privacy that 
children need to grow into what they have a right to become." 
</P>
<P>
 To be a role model in the 1990s, Goodwin said, takes a woman like Hillary 
Clinton, who can dazzle the Senate with her intellect rather than her wardrobe. 
"What Hillary has going for her is a whole generation of women trying to do 
what she's doing -- balancing a career and a family life." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jackie Kennedy the world knew in the 1960s was in the White House 
today, "she would not have a connection to young women of today's generation 
the way Hillary does," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Costello, deputy press secretary for former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, 
said the two First Ladies are also exceptional among the women who have held 
that title because they changed the job description for the spouse of a 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every First Lady since Jackie Kennedy has been judged by the standard of 
style and elegance that she set in the White House," Costello said. "Every 
First Lady post-Hillary will be judged by her standard of substance." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agrees that Hillary Clinton represents the ideal woman of the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way a First Lady would more accurately reflect the evolution of the role 
of a woman would be to leave the White House every day and go to a job that is 
not dependent on her husband," said Sheila Tate, press secretary first to Nancy 
Reagan and then to George Bush's successful 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hillary Clinton's role is really no different from any other First Lady's 
because she has borrowed her husband's power. Very few women in America have 
had authority handed to them. They have had to earn it."

'90S FAMILY; REAL LIFE; CAN DIVORCES BE CIVILIZED FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lately, more voices are being raised in favor of staying together for the sake 
of the children. The notion of a "good divorce" when children are involved 
seems a selfish rationalization left over from the human potential movement of 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as the average length of marriage has dropped to six years and serial 
monogamy becomes more popular, many individuals and some jurisdictions are 
pursuing a '90s definition of the good divorce -- also for the sake of the 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many divorced parents, Geoff, now 35, and Barbara Lipscomb, 37, couldn't 
see past their own emotions in the beginning. Married for five years, they 
separated three years ago. At the time, their son, Colin, was only 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bitter and angry in the beginning," recalled Barbara, who had planned 
a future for herself as a stay-at-home mom. "I was angry he left and shocked, 
rejected and hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 There were practical things to take care of: lawyers, moving, a new preschool, 
a new job, new child-care arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
 And there was Colin. "I think it's heartbreaking for the child. The hardest 
part was to hear him say, 'I wish you and me and Daddy all lived together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It took nine months before she would even agree to talk with Geoff. With the 
help of a court-appointed mediator, they ironed out custody and visitation 
disagreements and now talk about their son's needs and development at least 
three times a week. They attend school events together. They say they never 
criticize each other in front of their child. They have even spent Christmas 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people, I think, are surprised," Geoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, a number of parents have learned ways to continue 
to raising their children together effectively, said Constance Ahrons, 
associate director of the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, 50% of divorces do not do long-term damage to children or 
adults," said Ahrons, whose book "The Good Divorce" (HarperCollins) is 
scheduled to be published in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahrons said she studied 98 families in the Midwest that she found through 
court records. She interviewed them three times over five years, the last in 
1985. The children were not interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% fell into what is the negative stereotype," she said. "They were 
still angry or litigating. But 50% were not doing that. They got on with trying 
to resolve it, finding ways to effectively handle their parenting.  
</P>
<P>
 "The research clearly indicates the damage done to children is done in bad 
marriages prior to divorce, not so much the divorce itself," said Ahrons, who 
struggled to attain a civilized divorce herself. Although she and her 
ex-husband never became friendly after the divorce, they did manage a holiday 
dinner or two and when their daughter married, walked her down the aisle 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessening the impact of divorce is complicated. The overriding rule is that 
children should never become caught in the cross-fire between the parents. They 
need to be reassured that they are not the cause of the divorce and that while 
there will be changes, both parents will still love them and take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more important tools in a good divorce, Ahrons said, is compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin sees his father every other weekend plus Wednesday nights. Barbara 
learned to consult Geoff on arrangements she made, such as changing preschools. 
Geoff sends the child support check on time. When Colin is sick, sometimes he 
takes the day off to stay with him.  
</P>
<P>
 More parents can have civilized divorces if society expects them to, Ahrons 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several jurisdictions are experimenting with mandating "parenting plans" when 
couples with children divorce. Under the state of Washington's 1987 Parenting 
Act, divorcing parents must file a parenting plan that delineates a dispute 
resolution process, allocation of decision-making authority and residential 
provisions for holidays, birthdays, vacations and other special events. 
Exceptions are allowed in cases of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 While mandated parenting plans resemble the old joint custody and visitation 
arrangements, supporters believe that the new language will help parents see 
their roles in terms of responsibility rather than of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff said that in some ways, a good divorce is not that much different from a 
good marriage: "It takes a lot of work." 
</P>

'90S FAMILY; THE REALITIES OF FOSTER PARENTING; IT ISN'T AS EASY AS IT LOOKS. 
TAKING IN NEEDY CHILDREN IS OFTEN REWARDING, BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF CHALLENGES 
AND HEARTBREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A family of four, three or even two children is more than enough challenge for 
most frazzled parents. But how about six or eight kids? Or 48? 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many foster children John and Dorothy Leicester took into their 
sprawling seven-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades during the 15 years that 
their own six children were growing up and vacating their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything for them that we did for our own," said Dorothy, 66. "John 
helped them with homework, and I drove them to football and trumpet lessons. I 
made lunches and did laundry and cooked dinner every night. The only thing I 
wouldn't do was pick them up from the police station downtown when they got 
into trouble. John had to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays when the Leicesters serve Thanksgiving dinner, they preside over a 
gathering that includes their offspring and spouses, and some of the foster 
children, now adults, who have kept in touch over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although foster parenting can provide plenty of warm fuzzies, the job is 
always challenging and often punctuated by heartbreak, say those who have tried 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective foster parents need to remember that they're taking in a child 
with a history, said Elias Lefferman, director of community services at Vista 
Del Mar Child & Family Services, a licensed private agency in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This child is not a clean slate that you can mold," he said. "You're taking a 
person into your family who has his or her own parents, siblings and special 
set of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The task of parenting a child while remembering that you are only a temporary 
caregiver can be so confounding that the state requires would-be foster parents 
to complete a training course and be licensed. The free courses, which focus 
not only on parenting techniques but also on the special needs of foster 
children, are offered by the state and private foster family agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each private agency designs its own courses, the material covered is 
similar. A certification from Vista Del Mar includes a two-hour orientation, 12 
hours of classes, six hours of home study and a one-day CPR and first-aid 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Westside Children's Center in Santa Monica, would-be foster parents 
take 10 weeks of evening classes based on a program called MAPP, or Model 
Approach to Partnerships in Parenting. The classes are followed by a home study 
evaluation and one day of CPR and first-aid training. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjects such as bonding and attachment, loss and separation, and working with 
birth parents not only provide the groundwork for successful adult-child 
relationships, but also tend to eliminate people who aren't really qualified, 
said Gaylyn Thomas, director of the Westside Children's Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our classes include 14 different techniques of discipline that parents need 
to manage the kids and keep communicating," she said. "Spanking won't work, 
because it's against the law to use physical punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond rules against spanking, other licensing regulations are stricter than 
they used to be. Now foster parents have to be fingerprinted, cleared through 
the Child Abuse Index in Sacramento, fence-in swimming pools, lock all medicine 
cabinets, prepare a disaster plan, have their cars inspected and provide a 
room, bed, bureau and closet space for each foster child (two children can 
share a room). Some agencies even require vaccinations for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Most private agencies offer 24-hour hot-line support and counseling services. 
This first level of support -- buttressed by a network of counselors, social 
workers, church, family and friends -- is one of the keys to success in foster 
parenting, said Robert Allen, supervisor of the foster care program at Five 
Acres in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foster parents need to be humble and realize they are part of a team," he 
said. "These are special-needs children, and parents have to reach out and 
accept professional resources and not try to solve all the problems 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Greene, a single mother and foster parent who has worked with Vista Del 
Mar for the last seven years, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'm on the phone to them every week, besides the regular 
twice-a-month home visits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene now has three girls in her home, two foster children ages 3 and 6, and 
an adopted 8-year-old, who started out as Greene's foster daughter and then 
became available for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 51, himself a foster child who "got into every kind of trouble you can 
imagine," credits the unconditional love and faith of Leah Hamilton, his foster 
mother, with his eventual success. "She told me I was special and constantly 
reinforced the good in me, until I finally began to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the licensed private agencies, which have the tools and time to provide 
support services, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services is 
so overloaded with cases that most social workers say privately that there 
simply isn't time to provide the same in-depth follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
 And as more families are adopting children, the pool of foster parents is 
shrinking. In February, 1994, there were 40,165 children in Los Angeles in what 
is called "out-of-home care," but not enough families to take them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Leicester recalled the time when her seven bedrooms were full and a 
social worker from the state telephoned and asked her to take in, or at least 
meet with, a homeless 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have absolutely no space, and we're really not supposed to have more 
than six children here," Leicester recalled protesting. Twenty minutes later, 
"the social worker arrived with the girl and all her clothes and possessions, 
and a rosy boa snake and a kitten." Leicester took her in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the fundamental underpinnings of foster care, Vista Del Mar's Lefferman 
said, is its legally mandated goal of reunification -- that is, to provide 
"nurturing care and parental supervision on a temporary basis with the eventual 
goal of reuniting the child with its natural family." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the worst things you can do is to try to separate a child from its 
real family. You expect the child to love you and appreciate what you're doing. 
They don't, at least not right away," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not happy to leave their birth parents, even if they've been abused. 
They want to go home to Mom and Dad. Leaving means feelings of guilt and 
uncertainty, and they blame themselves. How would you feel if a stranger 
knocked on your door, whisked you away with a bag of clothes and took you to 
live somewhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, most foster children act out their unhappiness by 
refusing to talk, sulking, biting, bed-wetting, lying, stealing and even 
running away, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed in gaining their trust, foster parents must avoid dividing the 
child's loyalties between the birth family and the foster family, and resist 
the desire to sabotage the natural parents' efforts to call or visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The reunification policy has been criticized by some social workers and others 
in the field, who say some birth parents are incapable of caring for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at a time when judges are getting tougher on birth mothers who 
give up their babies then change their minds, the courts are showing more 
leniency in returning foster children to less-than-suitable birth parents, 
Lefferman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foster parents tell stories of being ready to adopt a child, only to have 
the birth mother suddenly reappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional roller coaster," Greene said. "When they took away my first 
(foster) child, it was heart-wrenching. Now I've gotten more used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Greene, who had cultivated a friendly relationship with the birth mother, 
has stayed in touch with the girl. She is now 12 and in another foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 Various parenting styles seem to work, but everyone agrees on one constant: 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that the child isn't there to serve your needs," Westside Children's 
Center's Thomas said. "Don't take a child because you're lonely, or never had 
children, or your own child wants a playmate, or you think it's a way to make 
money. Your job is to serve the child's best interests." Where to Go for

DOS AND DON'TS OF FOSTER PARENTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you want to be a foster parent? Parents and experts working in the field 
offer these dos and don'ts: Do's 
</P>
<P>
 1. Do evaluate your lifestyle and your strengths and weaknesses to determine 
which age and sex of child best matches your interests, skills and job 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Do remember that your role is temporary; the child for whom you provide a 
loving home hopes to go back to Mom and Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Do try to be adaptable. Your foster child has grown up in an entirely 
different home environment. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Do prepare for family relationships to change, especially if you already 
have children. Don'ts 
</P>
<P>
 1. Don't do it for the money. The $400 to $700 per month you receive for each 
child (depending on age and needs) will go in a hurry for clothes, school 
supplies, meals, sports equipment, dancing and music lessons, tutoring, 
allowances, movies, food and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Don't do it to adopt. The best foster parents want to help, not possess, a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Don't do it for love or praise. You're not likely to get either from the 
child or his parents -- at least not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Don't ever force the foster child to choose between you and his birth 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Don't feel hurt when your foster child cries, throws a tantrum in public, 
lies, swears or steals. He is testing your commitment to stick by him, in 
effect saying, "How many times can I do this before they give up and send me 
back?" ANNE Z. COOKE

<TEXT>
<P>
 I like to go to the mall. It's a fun place to hang out with my friends after 
school. It gives me something to do. There are places to go shopping, there's 
just a lot of stuff you can do there so you won't get bored. 
</P>
<P>
 We walk around, talk about stuff, meet people. My friend's mom owns a shop at 
the mall, so sometimes we hang out there. Sometimes, if we get bored, we go to 
the formal section and try on all the dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But my mom has all her little rules and I think that's stupid. I mean, how 
much trouble can you get into at the mall? Her keeping in touch thing, I guess 
that's understandable. She needs to know where I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's hard, though, if I have to say, "Hold on, I have to call my 
mom." Then I have to rush out of the store. Other than that it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know why she doesn't think the mall is safe. I see cops around there 
all the time so I know they're going to protect me if something happens. There 
are always people around. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure not everyone at the mall is perfect, but they're not all out to get 
you. If you stay clean, nothing should happen. It's not like someone is going 
to come up to me at the mall and pull a gun out and ask me for money. 
</P>
<P>
 That's crazy! 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry I have to say this, but I think she's being overprotective. Like, 
come on, I'm 14. I think they should trust me more. I'm their own daughter. It 
just bugs me that they're so overprotective. 
</P>
<P>
 They know me and I know they love me. All that little speech thingie about 
they trust me but not other people. Well, I am old enough to handle these 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm getting up there in the big world. I have to learn sooner or later how to 
take care of myself. She's not going to be with me every step of the way. They 
might as well get it over with right now and let me do things on my own.

 I don't mind if Christina goes to the mall to do some shopping, have lunch 
with a friend or go to a movie. I just don't want her hanging around in the 
middle of the mall with a group of kids who are doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I have gone to the mall in the morning, come back late in the afternoon for 
some reason, and seen the same kids still there. 
</P>
<P>
 If Christina goes to the mall, she has to have a reason. And I set limits. I 
want to know where she is going, who she is going with and what time she will 
be back. We always have a meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a pager and a cellular phone so she can always call me. Sometimes I 
give her my pager. We've got a system so I'm not going through 90 different 
shops looking for her. 
</P>
<P>
 This is my concern: There was that shooting last summer at a mall in Panorama 
City. Some kids got into an argument and someone pulled out a gun. We're not 
even safe in a mall anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I think she understands it deep inside. I know that she's old enough and that 
I've got to loosen the reins. But, I don't think there's any reason to leave a 
teen-ager at the mall from the moment it opens to the moment it closes. 
</P>
<P>
 They do need their space and they do need their friends. I'll drop her off for 
a movie, but I will be there when the movie ends. If she wants to get something 
to eat afterward, I'll give her an hour, not five. 
</P>
<P>
 I think she may feel a little like Mom and Dad are a little too protective, 
but we're doing things the best way we know how. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina is a good judge of character. All her friends have been very, very 
nice kids. They all seem to have a positive attitude and to be respectable. 
It's the kids that have no guidance that I don't want her hanging around with. 
But I wouldn't even have to tell her that. She knows.

UNION'S ENDING? YOU KEEP THE GIFTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all of you whose impulse marriage was followed quickly by an impulse 
dissolution, here is today's social brain-scratcher: 
</P>
<P>
 What do you do with all the loot? 
</P>
<P>
 If people bring gifts to your hey-honey, let's-get-married wedding ceremony, 
or if they send presents soon thereafter, what happens when the union ends 
unhappily ever after? 
</P>
<P>
 Etiquette guru Judith Martin (also known as the author and syndicated 
columnist Miss Manners) says, basically, once you're married, the stuff is 
yours. "I do," in short, translates to "I keep" -- the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Martin adds: "This is not to discourage anyone who may be gracious enough 
to return the gifts." ELIZABETH MEHREN

STREISAND SHOW: THE WARMEST TICKET IN TOWN; TOUR: ALTHOUGH HER SIX-NIGHT 
ENGAGEMENT IS LIKELY TO SET SINGLE-VENUE SALES RECORDS, DEMAND FOR THE STEEPLY 
PRICED SEATS HAS FALLEN SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS IN THE RESALE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barbra Streisand arrives at The Pond tonight, poised to set box office records 
with a six-night gross that is likely to top $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to rankings kept by Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine, the 
record for a touring performer in a series of concerts at a single venue is 
$11.6 million, set by the Rolling Stones in 1989 with a six-show engagement at 
Shea Stadium in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's unprecedented ticket prices -- a scale of $350, $125 and $50 is 
standard throughout her five-city tour -- should enable her to eclipse that 
record. Promoters of the shows here are not releasing estimated grosses, but 
the $12-million mark appears within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim dates are expected to draw about 12,500 paying fans each night. 
Given an average ticket price of $172.30, Streisand would siphon $2.15 million 
out of The Pond each night and $12.9 million over six nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would certainly be a record for any touring artist," said Pollstar 
editor Gary Bongiovanni, "a record that for the moment looks untouchable, 
unless she decides to break it herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for people who bought Streisand tickets not as fans but as investors, the 
financial picture may not be so bright. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tickets went on sale on March 27, all 75,000 sold out in a three-hour 
frenzy in which Ticketmaster received an estimated 1 million calls. As always 
with major shows, a chunk of the tickets was gobbled up by brokers and 
individual speculators who thought there would be a bonanza in the scalpers 
market. Streisand herself directed some 2,000 prime-location tickets to six 
Southern California charities, specifying that the $350 seats be sold for 
$1,000 as an aid to fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket brokers say that while demand for Streisand seats in the resale market 
has been good, it hasn't come close to initial expectations that one broker 
described as "hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the charity tickets went unsold and were returned to be put on sale at 
face value through regular outlets. As of Tuesday afternoon, you could still 
drive to the arena box office or call Ticketmaster and get $125 or $350 tickets 
at the face price -- bad news for those hoping the Streisand tickets would, at 
this point, be rare and much bid-upon items. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the current O.C. Recycler classifieds list 112 parties selling 
Streisand tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial announcement that Streisand was coming "turned Los Angeles into a 
city of scalpers," said Fred Ross, a ticket broker in Los Angeles and a 
director of the California Assn. of Ticket Agencies, the brokers' trade group. 
"So many people bought tickets -- not (just) ticket brokers but (regular) 
people who thought they could resell the tickets and make money. And that 
hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are going to lose money. I get 10 calls from people wanting 
to sell Barbra Streisand tickets for every one person wanting to buy a ticket. 
That isn't to say there isn't a lot of interest in the show, but the ticket 
price has gone beyond what people are willing or able to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carroll, a 55-year-old high school teacher from Anaheim, was among those 
who were caught up in the speculative bubble for Streisand tickets and who now 
are trying to unload them via the classifieds. Carroll thought he got lucky 
when he was first in line to buy tickets at an outlet in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to buy any of the $350 seats, but there I was, and I thought 
maybe I could buy them and make a little profit on them," Carroll said over the 
weekend. "Now I'm just trying to sell them at face value." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, brokers on Monday were quoting prices as high as $750 for Streisand 
tickets in the first few rows and as low as $110 for nosebleed seats with a $50 
face value. At the same time, though, they were asking $550 for prime locations 
for the Eagles' upcoming sold-out stand at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said the top Eagles seats (face value: $115 each) are scarcer and in 
greater demand for resale than the $350 Streisand tickets. "We get lots of 
calls from buyers for the Eagles, hardly any calls from sellers. People bought 
Eagles tickets with the idea they were going to the shows. People bought 
tickets to Barbra Streisand with the idea they were going to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
 And that created lots of competition for those charities, which also are 
trying to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this was first considered, there was 100% unanimity that these tickets 
would sell faster than Manhattan Island did," said Al Meyerhoff, senior 
attorney in charge of the pesticide campaign of the National Resources Defense 
Council, one of the groups Streisand is trying to help. "I've learned a lot 
since then. The market was saturated." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyerhoff said his organization would be able to sell only 100 or 150 of its 
initial 500-ticket allotment. That also was the pattern for the Alliance for 
Children's Rights, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Operation USA's 
earthquake relief fund. Officials at those agencies said they initially took 
250 to 450 tickets but were able to sell only about 100 of them at the 
specified $1,000. The United Friends of the Children would not release figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucking the trend was Girls' Voices/Women's Lives, a program of the Hollywood 
Policy Center. Executive director Kathy Garmezy said the agency "tried to hit 
the ground running right away and be really creative in reaching out" and 
managed to sell virtually all of its 350-ticket allotment. Garmezy said the 
ticket sales would net the program nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The six charities were not given tickets outright but, in a paper transaction, 
had to buy them at their $350 face value before reselling them. They incurred 
additional expenses for advertising and other marketing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garmezy and officials of some of the other nonprofit groups said they 
typically turn to Los Angeles' entertainment community for donations. This 
time, "we knew that community would be a less likely source than usual," 
Garmezy said, because many in Hollywood would have access to Streisand tickets 
through other channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who were less successful said the Streisand tickets had netted 
them a good chunk of money for their programs, as well as helpful publicity and 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Schwartz, development director for the Alliance for Children's Rights, 
said his agency sold about 100 tickets and will net about $50,000. 
"Expectations were so high, and sometimes when expectations are so high, you 
scratch your head and say, 'It wasn't what I expected.' But it will be a very 
nice sum, and the value in terms of putting us on the map has been fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Tabankin, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Streisand 
Foundation, the outlet for Streisand's giving, said the attempt to sell charity 
tickets for $1,000 "was an experiment. We were trying to direct those people 
who would pay scalpers to nonprofit organizations." Of the various tour stops, 
"Detroit was the biggest problem (in terms of selling the $1,000 tickets). D.C. 
was fair, San Jose is good, and Los Angeles is in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York (where Streisand will play five tour-concluding concerts starting 
June 20) is fabulous. The Gay Men's Health Crisis Center in New York sold 1,000 
tickets and called for another thousand. New York is more insane. People are in 
total Barbra hysteria in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, according to ticket broker Ross, some tougher realities may 
have kept the initial, record-setting run at the box office from touching off 
the voracious resale demand that speculators both charitable and profit-seeking 
had been counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they didn't think of the earthquake having a big effect in Los 
Angeles," he said. "Maybe they didn't think of the economy in Southern 
California being in as bad a shape as it really and truly is. Maybe there were 
too many shows. As phenomenal as she is, maybe there just isn't that big a 
demand for her tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondent Jim Washburn contributed to this report. 
</P>

 Charities still selling $1,000 tickets: for tonight's show, the National 
Resources Defense Council, (310) 996-1188); for Friday, the Alliance for 
Children's Rights, (310) 393-5600; for Sunday, Girls' Voices/Women's Lives,

A DRAMA-HEAVY FALL LINEUP UNVEILED BY FOX; TELEVISION: FIVE DRAMAS AND TWO 
COMEDIES ARE ON THE NETWORK'S SCHEDULE. THIRTEEN SERIES, INCLUDING THE 
VENERABLE 'IN LIVING COLOR,' ARE CANCELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fox Broadcasting Co., newly armed with National Football League games that 
helped the network land a dozen stations in a landmark deal this week, on 
Tuesday announced a drama-heavy prime-time lineup for fall in its latest bid to 
achieve parity with CBS, ABC and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, known for dropping bombshells in late announcements of its schedules -- 
in 1990, it switched "The Simpsons" in a successful move to counterprogram and 
neutralize NBC's "The Cosby Show" -- disclosed the coming acquisition of its 
latest affiliates in time for the presentation of the new schedule to 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 For nostalgia-prone couch potatoes, Fox also announced that one of its back-up 
series for the 1994-95 season is an updated version of the famous 1960s sitcom 
"Get Smart," reuniting Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as secret agents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox Entertainment Group, the 
youth-oriented network will have the new version of "Get Smart" focusing on 
their son, who is in his late 20s and, like his incompetent father, is a 
"bumbling agent." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Fox is using its flair for showmanship to dilute 
the impact of serious setbacks in the past season. It flopped in two key areas: 
late night, where Chevy Chase's show folded quickly, and news, where its 
magazine series "Front Page" failed in the ratings and now is canceled, to be 
replaced eventually by a new effort called "Assignment," Grushow said in a 
phone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fox, known for its outpouring of series featuring black 
performers last season, has canceled five of them, including the prestigious 
"Roc," the controversial but much-praised and ambitious "South Central" -- 
which reportedly is seeking a home elsewhere -- and "In Living Color," "Sinbad" 
and, previously, "Townsend Television," which starred Robert Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 Several returning series, including "Living Single" and the racy "Martin," 
star black performers. Grushow maintained, "We're not walking away from our 
commitment to program black television series." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that one of the new one-hour dramas, a police show called "Uptown 
Undercover," pairs two officers, one African American, the other Latino. In 
addition, he said, another drama, "M.A.N.T.I.S.," is about a "black superhero." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roc" and "South Central," however, were known for attempting to focus, in 
both serious and comic tones, on black family life. Grushow said that in 
"Uptown Undercover," a "significant amount of the show" deals with the black 
officer's "personal life. He has a son, and their relationship is positive." 
</P>
<P>
 With the cancellation of "In Living Color," Fox is losing one of its trademark 
series, an irreverent collection of sketches from a black viewpoint. Said 
Grushow: "We felt it was pretty well played out. Obviously it was a landmark 
series for our company. For years, it defined who we were and what we were 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has scheduled as another back-up series a new sketch comedy called "House 
of Buggin'," which stars Latino comedian John Leguizamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow said "Sinbad," which features the comedian of the same name, was 
canceled because it "had a huge 'Simpsons' lead-in and was unable to capitalize 
on it." As for "Roc," although its quality rarely diminished, it has had a 
difficult time in the ratings, finishing near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 In another negative development this season, Fox canceled 13 series. In 
addition to longtime key players such as the high-profile "Roc" and "In Living 
Color," other Fox shows from this season that got the ax include "The 
Adventures of Brisco County Jr.," "Bakersfield P.D.," "Daddy Dearest," 
"Herman's Head," "Monty," "Code 3" and "Comic Strip Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another series, "The George Carlin Show," failed to make the fall lineup 
but is expected to return as a back-up entry, as is "The Critic," an animated 
program canceled by ABC but picked up by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Fox estimated it will take 1 to 1 1/2 years before all of the 
new stations that were reeled in this week are lined up for the network. With 
Fox going to seven nights a week this past season and now upgrading its 
affiliates in such major cities as Cleveland, Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee and 
Dallas, the ratings of the 8-year-old network will certainly go up, but just 
how much depends in great part on the new programming, which consists of five 
dramas and two comedies. 
</P>

 Grushow said the deal with New World Communications to land the stations will 
have "no effect whatsoever on the programs. These New World stations are 
jumping into bed with us because they like our business plan. They're 
interested in the 18-to-34 and 18-to-49 demographic."

 "The Simpsons" now will return to Sundays at 8 p.m., where Fox hopes that it 
and "Fortune Hunter," a new, James Bond-style spy adventure that precedes it at 
7 p.m. -- and will challenge "60 Minutes" -- can benefit from the lead-in of 
the NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Spelling is also becoming a bigger player at Fox, where his "Beverly 
Hills, 90210" and "Melrose Place" will be joined by another hour drama from his 
company, "Models Inc." It stars Linda Gray, formerly of "Dallas," as the head 
of a Los Angeles modeling agency. It gets an early start June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new Fox series: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Party of Five," a drama in which five brothers and sisters "forge new lives 
following the sudden loss of their parents" in a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hardball," a "rowdy" sitcom that takes "a locker-room look" at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wild Oats," a Generation X sitcom about "a group of out-all-night 
20-somethings in search of romance and friendship."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: TV'S DRAMA ABOUT BLACKS IS ALL BEHIND THE SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an old story -- television's ultimate blacklisting or brownlisting. 
</P>
<P>
 Black sitcoms appear indelibly affixed to prime time, yet getting a family 
drama about blacks, or Asian Americans or Latinos, on the air remains the 
hardest of hard sells. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of current prime-time ratings champ CBS. It has vowed to widen 
its audience beyond Norman Rockwell folk to include more of the nation's urban 
young, but in picking new series to open the 1994-95 season, the network 
omitted the worthy "Under One Roof," a weekly drama that was developed by its 
own production arm and may lack only one prerequisite for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't passed on it," said CBS spokeswoman Susan Tick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pessimistic," said executive producer Thomas Carter ("Equal 
Justice"). 
</P>
<P>
 Television's minstrels appear in multiple shades, and Fox's new fall lineup 
includes an action show, "M.A.N.T.I.S.," whose hero is black. When it comes to 
drama, however, TV seeks to seduce a rainbow of Americans with mostly a single 
color. Implicit here is that most programmers are ethnocentric, believing that 
non-whites will be riveted to whites in non-comedic situations, but not vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Black families have been nearly invisible in family drama, a situation "Under 
One Roof" could help remedy. Its protagonists are the Langstons, a 
middle-of-the-middle-class black family living in Seattle. No drugs, no 
violence, no gangs, not even an absentee father. No major dysfunction, just a 
highly appealing family. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not faultless, the pilot for "Under One Roof" ripples with more 
promise than 90% of what presently passes for drama in prime time. Its humor is 
unforced, its conflicts between generations are genuine, and its interesting, 
endearing characters relate in ways that likely would earn them the empathy of 
real-life families. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the cast is first-rate. Joe Morton is Ron Langston, a former career 
military man trying his hand at business. Vanessa Bell Calloway is his wife, 
Maggie, who resumed school to get a nursing degree. James Earl Jones is Ron's 
father, Neb, a cop who lives downstairs with a street youth he and his late 
wife took in. Joe and Maggie have two kids of their own, and Ron's younger 
sister is also part of this likable extended brood. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Martha Williamson, Michael Henry Brown and Paul Aaron (the latter 
two wrote HBO's "Laurel Avenue"), the pilot's teleplay has an edge while also 
projecting the kind of warmth and even teary poignancy that usually has network 
programmers bawling all the way to the bank. If ever a contemporary black 
family drama was going to make the schedule in the '90s, you'd think this would 
be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under One Roof" is not only absent from the fall lineup, however, it also 
received no backup order from CBS, said Carter, making it questionable even for 
mid-season emergence. 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS has not written all of its 1994-95 backup orders, and "Under One Roof" 
could still get one, spokeswoman Tick said. "It's still in play here," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their first concern is about the characters being black," said 
Carter, who directed the pilot. "I think they're also concerned that this is a 
very honest show. They're a slave to gimmicks. We would have had a better 
chance to get it on the air if we had a tragedy that brings the family 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said that it was CBS Entertainment President Peter Tortorici who (when 
still the division's No. 2 executive) approached him about doing a "black show 
-- he would have accepted a comedy -- with a strong male figure" for CBS 
Productions. Carter said that when "Under One Roof" was screened for CBS 
executives in Los Angeles, "they loved it and thought the show was a slam 
dunk." But when the pilot was viewed by network management in New York, he 
said, the attitude changed and "everything went askew." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally askew is an industry that rarely finds room for blacks who live in the 
real world and don't speak the language of one-liners. 
</P>

 FOOD FOR THOUGHT: "Mmmm, I love garlic," Katie Couric said last Wednesday 
morning, starting a cooking segment for NBC's traveling "Today" program at a 
Boston seafood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 For Couric and "Today," the grotesquely sadistic act that followed was just a 
big laugher. Inadvertently, though, they provided an educational service by 
erasing the abstraction and graphically showing the process by which some of 
the animals we eat arrive on our plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare was lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not a lobster boiled alive in a pot of water, but something even yummier 
and rather more exotic. After heating the garlic in a pan and adding some 
crushed red pepper, the chef picked up the entree -- a live lobster -- and 
twisted off its claws as it writhed. A wincing Couric quickly turned away. "I 
can't look. Hurry!" 
</P>
<P>
 But fine cuisine can't be hurried. The chef then selected a large knife and, 
as Couric cringed, sliced the still-moving lobster in half. "Oh, what a way to 
go," Couric said fliply. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the chef took the upper half of the still-moving lobster and began 
sauteing it in the pan. "Oh, it's still moving," Couric said, then wittily 
joked: "Can't you give him sleeping pills or something before you cut him up?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the mirth subsided, it was time to add wine and tomato sauce in 
preparation for cooking the lobster for 10 to 12 minutes. Couric: "And we'll be 
back in a moment to hear some music from the Boston Pops." 
</P>
<P>
 Bon appetit. * 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: Although he does some goofy things from time to time, Phil Donahue 
can usually be counted on to be an effective devil's advocate. On Monday's 
episode of "Donahue," though, he was overwhelmed and rendered inept by 
controversial Nation of Islam lecturer Khalid Abdul Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, a disciple and suspended aide of National of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan, was the hour's only guest. The invective-spewing verbal barrage by 
him and his boisterous followers, who were packed into the front of the studio, 
targeted all whites in general, all Jews in particular. Donahue and a few 
doddering audience members made some feeble attempts at rebuttal, but were no 
match for the relentless assault, and Donahue, in particular, ultimately 
appeared to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine Donahue not asking a loony white guy what he meant by urging 
God to erase all blacks? Or Donahue letting Ku Klux Klan members slander blacks 
virtually at will? It wouldn't happen.

DANCE; UNCOVERING MEANING IN THE ABSTRACT; THE BROCKUS PROJECT WILL PERFORM 
'HUH,' A COMIC ODE TO THE OBSCURE ON A MIXED BILL. THE 12-MEMBER TROUPE BLENDS 
JAZZ, MODERN DANCE AND BALLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever feel like muttering "huh?" during some abstruse modern dance performance? 
Deborah Brockus has. She's even choreographed an ode to the obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my satire on inaccessible art -- my piece about all the bad shows I've 
seen in the past 10 years," says Brockus, whose troupe performs at the Orange 
County High School for the Arts in Los Alamitos this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huh -- The Odyssey" is done in a deadpan sort of way. "But it's definitely 
comical, and we do it very quickly," quipped the choreographer, who also dances 
with the company. "Unfortunately, the (bad) concerts I've been to took hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-member Brockus Project Dance Company will perform a mixed bill. Brockus 
teaches jazz dance at the school and heads the dance sequence of its musical 
theater department. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hybrid movement style blends jazz, modern dance and ballet, she said 
during a recent phone interview from her Huntington Beach home, and her 
creative philosophy eschews the approach that "Huh" lampoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The era I trained in," said Brockus, 32, "was one in which choreographers 
were just beginning to break away from the nothingness in dance -- the 
abstract, the no-emotion, pedestrian movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have non-narrative works that invoke a mood or feeling," she continued, 
"but I never create pieces that are completely abstract, and my choreography 
always has a human element to it, and a very technical, dancing manner. When 
you do the style I've inherited, it feels like flying, it feels awesome, and 
when the dancer feels that, it transmits to the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Still Waters," to music of jazz singer Dianne Reeves, is one premiere the 
Brockus troupe will be transmitting to the audience. A symbolic treatment of 
the old saw, still waters run deep, it "celebrates women," including herself, 
"and the quiet strength women have," Brockus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the piece arose after Brockus was looking at media photographs of 
Bosnia and other war-torn regions, "and seeing women standing there, very 
strong, in the midst of all the horrors going on around them." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a feminist piece; it's not aggressive or anti-anything, it's just 
about 'This is who I am, and I'm proud of it.' It sounds funny to everybody who 
knows me, but only in the last four or five months have I started to think of 
myself as an artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Also new are the two final movements of "Four Corners Suite." Danced to music 
by Copland, Ferde Grofe and Dvorak, this work was inspired by the geographic 
splendor of Four Corners, U.S.A., where the borders of Utah, Colorado, Arizona 
and New Mexico meet, "the most enchanted, mystical land," Brockus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mountains" is intended to evoke the breathtaking grandeur of the Rockies, she 
said, and "Clouds" alludes to the beauty of the puffy whites and the 
life-giving as well as destructive power of rain and erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Tustin, Brockus is a 1984 alumna of UC Irvine, where as an 
undergraduate she studied ballet primarily with Jillana, a former Balanchine 
ballerina. She subsequently studied modern dance, mostly with San Diego's Tim 
Weingard, a former Martha Graham company principal, and jazz with Jamie Rogers 
of Los Angeles, who danced in several Broadway shows choreographed by Jerome 
Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, she took choreographic workshops with Judith Jamison, former 
principal and now artistic director of the Alvin Ailey dance troupe, and with 
UCI dance professor Donald McKayle. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops "taught me about the importance of detail, of nuance, expression 
and intent," Brockus said. ". . . I had been trained in steps and patterns and 
spatial designs; they took me almost to the haiku poetry level." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after stints with such small troupes as Lula Washington's Los Angeles 
Contemporary Dance Theatre, Brockus founded her own company with young dancers 
from the arts high school and Dance Factory, a private Los Alamitos facility, 
where she teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 She has big dreams for the troupe, among them national and international 
touring eventually, but her immediate concern is to secure nonprofit status in 
order to be eligible for state and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 She also plans to move out of Orange County, where county government provides 
no direct financial support to arts groups, to L.A. County, which, like the 
vast majority of the state's counties, does. 
</P>
<P>
 While discouraged by a climate that she says drives out local talent, Brockus 
is working with others to establish an Orange County Dance Alliance. It would 
function as a chapter of L.A.'s Dance Resource Center and focus efforts on such 
objectives as audience development and educational outreach in order to 
strengthen the artistic scene throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we can put the arts into the community," she said, "the better the 
community is going to be in terms of people understanding each other and 
themselves. It's a binding thing that's very much needed; without that, the 
community infrastructure breaks down." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brockus Project Dance Company appears Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m. at 
the Orange County High School of the Arts, Margaret A. Webb Performing Arts 
Center, 3591 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. $6 to $10. (714) 962-1329 or (310) 
531-8949.

WHAT TO EXPECT -- BESIDES BABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barbra-watching at The Pond will involve some extra expense, some unusual 
acoustic amenities and security measures associated more commonly with airports 
or concerts by punk-metal bands and hard-core rap acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of its usual $6 parking charge for cars, management at The Pond 
decided to jack up the fee to $8 for the Streisand shows. Parking for buses and 
limousines will be $15, up from $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking increase, "due to the exclusivity of the engagement," was the idea 
of the building's management, not Streisand, according to John J. Nicoletti, a 
spokesman for the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Once parked, concert-goers will find they must pass through metal detectors. 
In a standard procedure for all Streisand tour dates, both walk-through and 
hand-held detectors will be used, according to her manager, Martin Erlichman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unique. Maybe unusual, but not unique," Erlichman said. "It's for 
what it implies: Security." Apparently, the legendarily stage-shy star wants an 
extra measure of assurance that no armed crazies will crash the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent representatives to the Detroit show, watching to make sure everything 
went smoothly, to see how they approached getting people into the building and 
into their seats," Nicoletti said. "As far as anybody has told me, there hasn't 
been a problem along the tour" with delays or undue inconvenience because of 
the metal detectors. "It will be a somewhat minor inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand also is taking measures to ensure that those more typical concert 
villains -- echo and extraneous noise -- will be barred, or at least held in 
check. At her behest, the entire arena floor will be carpeted, and 
sound-dampening fabrics will be hung in other areas to enhance the building's 
acoustics. Hard surfaces in an arena cause sound waves to bounce out of 
control; covering those surfaces with sound-absorbing material, such as 
carpeting, helps enhance crispness and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The color of the carpet is silver-gray," reported Nicoletti. "It's deep 
plush. It's a nice carpet, thicker than the carpet we have in our offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Streisand concert-goers will be first-time visitors to arena, which could 
make for a slower traffic flow than usual, Nicoletti added. Arena officials are 
advising fans to arrive early for the concerts, which start at 8 p.m. MIKE

 Spoleto's New Era: The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. opens a scaled-down 18th season 
today -- without Gian Carlo Menotti, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who 
established the prestigious Charleston, S.C., festival in 1977 as a companion 
to a similar Italian festival. Menotti, 82, left last fall in a dispute over 
festival finances and who would head the annual event after he retired. This 
year's festival -- with a reduced budget of $4.2 million -- will run only 12 
days instead of the traditional 17. While opera, dance and chamber music remain 
the festival's mainstays, new General Manager Milton Rhodes has also booked 
more mainstream fare this year, including country star Roseanne Cash and jazz 
singer Cassandra Wilson, as well as music composed by the late Frank Zappa. 
"We're beginning a new era built on a foundation of 17 years," said Charleston 
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.

South Coast Repertory's Mainstage Oct. 14-Nov. 20. The script took top honors 
in last year's California Playwrights Competition. Also announced Tuesday for 
SCR's 31st season are Mainstage productions of Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" 
(April 7-May 14) and Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" (May 26-July 2, 
1995), and Second Stage productions of A.R. Gurney's "Later Life" (Sept.

 Soap Bubbles: NBC's "Days of Our Lives" will honor the memory of original cast 
member Macdonald Carey with a funeral for his character, Dr. Tom Horton, 
beginning on June 20. Carey, who died in March at the age of 81, created the 
role of the Horton family patriarch when "Days" debuted in 1965. Several former 
"Days" stars will return for the funeral, including Marie Cheatham (who played 
Marie Horton), Bill Hayes (Doug Williams) and Susan Seaforth Hayes (Julie 
Williams), Patsy Pease (Kimberly Brady Donovan), Christopher Stone (Bill 
Horton) and Lisa Trusel (Melissa Anderson). Meanwhile, "Days' " executive

 Riddle Solved: Comedian Jim Carrey, one of Hollywood's most sought-after 
actors since the unexpected box-office success of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," 
has landed the role of the Riddler for Warner Bros.' next Caped Crusader 
sequel, "Batman Forever." Producers passed over Robin Williams, who had long 
coveted the role of the villain, reportedly causing a rift between Williams, 
his agency -- Creative Artists Agency -- and the studio. Already committed to 
the project is Tommy Lee Jones, who will portray the other villain in the 
movie, Two Face. Michael Keaton, who has played Batman in prior films, will 
likely star but nothing has been finalized, sources said.

 * An American Takeover?: The victory at Cannes of controversial American 
director Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" has sparked fears that the world's 
top film festival has turned its back on traditional foreign "arty" fare and 
sold out to Hollywood. American actor-director Clint Eastwood, himself a 
controversial choice as president of the festival's 10-member jury, brushed 
aside these suggestions, but French newspapers on Tuesday put the blame 
squarely on Eastwood's shoulders, saying that he had done his utmost to defend 
U.S. colors. Eastwood called the voting a "democratic decision" but said he was 
bound by festival rules not to discuss the prizes. Festival director Gilles 
Jacob also dismissed the suggestions, saying the festival had no tradition to 
stick to. "We've always had some juries which go for more popular films or for 
more art films. There's no law," he said. POP/ROCK

 Virgin Inks Body Count: Rapper Ice-T's hard-rock band Body Count -- which left 
Warner Bros. Records in early 1993 after protests over its song "Cop Killer" -- 
has signed with Virgin Records, confirming earlier reports in The Times that 
the label was pursuing a deal with the band. An album is due in September. 
After "Cop Killer" was released in 1992, several police associations and public 
figures, including Charlton Heston and Oliver North, launched boycotts of 
Warner Bros.' parent company, Time Warner. A Virgin executive says that the new 
album is "no retreat" from Ice-T's harsh stances, but that the company does not 
expect any similar controversy to arise. QUICK TAKES

STREISAND TICKETS STILL ON SALE FOR ANAHEIM SHOWS; POP MUSIC: DESPITE A LIKELY 
RECORD BOX-OFFICE TAKE, SOME SEATS ARE UP FOR GRABS AT OR NEAR FACE VALUE.

 Barbra Streisand arrives at the Anaheim Pond tonight, poised to set box-office 
records with a six-night gross that is likely to top $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to rankings kept by Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine, the 
record for a touring performer playing a series of concerts at a single venue 
is $11.6 million, set by the Rolling Stones in 1989 with a six-show engagement 
at New York's Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's unprecedented prices should enable her to eclipse that record at 
the Pond, where tickets are $350, $125 and $50. Promoters of the Anaheim shows 
are not releasing estimated grosses at this point, but the $12-million mark 
appears to be within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would certainly be a record for any touring artist," said Pollstar's 
editor, Gary Bongiovanni. "A record that for the moment looks untouchable, 
unless she decides to break it herself." 
</P>
<P>
 For people who bought Streisand tickets as investors, the financial picture 
may not be so bright. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all major shows, a chunk of the 75,000 tickets was gobbled up by 
brokers and individuals looking for a bonanza in the resale market. Streisand 
directed 2,000 prime tickets to six Southern California charities, specifying 
that the $350-seats be sold for $1,000 as an aid to fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket brokers say demand has been good, but hasn't come close to initial 
expectations that one broker described as "hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the charity tickets are still for sale and some were returned to be 
put on sale at face value through regular outlets. As of Tuesday afternoon, you 
could still drive to the arena box office or call Ticketmaster and get tickets 
at the face price for at least some of the shows. That was bad news for 
speculators hoping Streisand tickets would, at this point, be rare and much 
bid-upon items. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial Streisand announcement "turned Los Angeles into a city of 
scalpers," said ticket broker Fred Ross, a director of the California Assn. of 
Ticket Agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many people bought tickets -- not (just) ticket brokers, but (regular) 
people who thought they could resell the tickets and make money. . . . I get 10 
calls from people wanting to sell Streisand tickets for every one person 
wanting to buy a ticket. That isn't to say there isn't a lot of interest in the 
show, but the ticket price has gone beyond what people are willing or able to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carroll, an Anaheim high school teacher, was among those who got caught up 
in the speculative bubble and are now trying to unload Streisand tickets via 
the classifieds. Carroll thought he got lucky when he was first in line to buy 
tickets at an outlet last March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to buy any of the $350-seats, but there I was, and I thought 
maybe I could buy them and make a little profit on them," Carroll said. "Now 
I'm just trying to sell them at face value." 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers on Monday quoted prices as high as $750 for Streisand tickets in the 
first few rows, and as low as $110 for nosebleed seats with a $50 face value. 
At the same time, brokers were asking $550 for prime locations for the Eagles' 
upcoming sold-out stand at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross said that the top Eagles seats, with a face value of $115, are in 
greater demand for resale than the $350 Streisand tickets. "People bought 
Eagles tickets with the idea they were going to the shows," he said. "People 
bought tickets to Barbra Streisand with the idea they were going to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
 That created lots of competition for the charities that received tickets to 
sell at the $1,000 price mandated by Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this was first considered, there was 100% unanimity that these tickets 
would sell faster than Manhattan Island did," said Al Meyerhoff, senior 
attorney in charge of the pesticide campaign of the National Resources Defense 
Council, one of the charities. "I've learned a lot since then. The market was 
saturated." 
</P>
<P>
 * Charities with $1,000-tickets available: Natural Resources Defense Council, 
(310) 996-1188; Alliance for Children's Rights, (310) 393-5600; Girls' 
Voices/Women's Lives, (310) 478-3002; Legal Aid Foundation, (310) 477-0672; 
Operation USA, (800) 678-7255.

APPRECIATION; JOE PASS, THE GIANT OF JAZZ GUITARISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few musicians of whom it can be said that they cannot be replaced. 
Guitarist Joe Pass (Joseph Anthony Passalaqua), who died Monday at the age of 
65, was such a man. 
</P>
<P>
 His was a sharply separated career. His first decade, mainly the 1950s, was a 
maze of problems in which drug addiction and incarceration kept him from 
achieving the recognition he deserved. The turning point came with a record he 
made in 1961 during a stay at the Synanon Foundation, a drug treatment center. 
Soon afterward, his life straightened out, he became a welcome figure both in 
jazz clubs and in the studios for commercial dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass' technique was so dazzling that he was compared to pianist Art Tatum; his 
ideas came in a constant flow. He enjoyed working with fellow guitarists, 
spending many memorable evenings at Donte's in North Hollywood, in tandem with 
Herb Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 The impresario Norman Granz discovered him in 1972; from then on he was 
ubiquitous, graduating from the nightclubs of Hollywood to the concert stages 
of the world, and recording as a virtual member of the Granz jazz family on 
Pablo Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo albums, duets with Ella Fitzgerald, dates with Oscar Peterson and live 
performances at Montreux and other festivals followed one another in such 
profusion that by the end of the 1980s he was the most recorded guitarist in 
jazz history, and arguably the most gifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass' adaptability was legendary. Singers worshiped him; he provided 
accompaniments for Frank Sinatra, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae 
and Joe Williams. His partnership with pianists first came to prominence during 
two years on the road with the George Shearing Quintet, and later in 
international tours with various Peterson groups. His intuitive grasp of 
harmonic nuances made him the ideal foil for Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 He had become less of a local presence in recent years after a divorce and 
subsequent marriage to a German citizen. Though living part time in Hamburg, he 
maintained his home in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If he seemed withdrawn and somewhat introverted, his personality still showed 
flashes of ironic humor. His modesty was such that he once said of his 
partnership with Ella Fitzgerald: "Although she's so relaxed and easy to play 
for, I feel nervous, out of place with her -- I mean, she's a legend, like 
Louis Armstrong. She's a part of history." 
</P>
<P>
 So, now, is Joseph Anthony Passalaqua.

MIGHTY BIG SPLASH FOR THE POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, the upstart Mighty Ducks of Anaheim beat the Los Angeles Kings in the 
hockey standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Barbra Streisand comes to The Pond, the Ducks' home base, having turned 
up her famous nose at the Forum, the famed Inglewood venue that is home to the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Score another one for the new arena on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the Forum tried very hard to get those (Streisand) dates," said 
Alex Hodges, vice president of Nederlander Concerts, The Pond's concert 
promoter, last week. "I get a sense it was very close. Probably the pendulum 
swung back and forth a number of times." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hodges sees it, the Forum had its long history on its side, as well as 
geography -- a location more convenient for the entertainment business 
multitudes who will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond had newness going for it, and at least one tangible economic 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Forum, more than 3,000 seats, known as Senate seats, are reserved for 
season ticket holders who would have been exempt from additional charges to see 
Streisand. The Senate seats are in prime side locations that otherwise would 
have fetched the top $350 Streisand ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond's equivalents are the season-reserved Club seats and luxury suites. 
Together they will account for about 1,800 tickets to Streisand shows, 
according to arena spokesman John J. Nicoletti. Some of the locations are at 
the far end of the arena, occupying areas that would sell for $125 per seat 
rather than $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's manager, Martin Erlichman, said the disparity in seats blocked off 
for season ticket holders "was part and parcel of the decision making -- not 
all of it, but part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Streisand's decisions about where to play revolved primarily on how 
the contending buildings would impact her performance. "For what we want, which 
is to deliver the best sound and sight lines possible, we thought (The Pond) 
was the best bet," Erlichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond, which opened in June, has already been honored with best-new-venue 
citations by concert trade publications. Nicoletti says he sees Streisand's 
stand as an important opportunity to confirm and extend the arena's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact we were given six nights lends us a tremendous amount of 
credibility," he said. "Other performers who may not have been sold on Orange 
County as a place to hold an event had to stand up and take notice. This 
concert will draw a tremendous amount of press and music industry executives to 
this building, probably for the first time. If things go as smoothly as 
possible, we'll see some future bookings" as a result. MIKE BOEHM

BROWN, GARAMENDI CLASH AS HAYDEN ACTS AS MEDIATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB and RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their sharpest confrontation yet, Democratic gubernatorial candidates 
Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi clashed bitterly in a debate Tuesday night 
while underdog state Sen. Tom Hayden sought to bring them together in a 
broad-based effort for government reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 90-minute forum -- the only one to be televised in most of the 
state before the June 7 primary -- Brown and Garamendi exchanged acrimonious 
charges about each other's alleged misconduct in statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown and Garamendi also were agreeing more with the positions staked out 
by Hayden, the anti-war radical turned legislator who entered the race to make 
a statement but now says he is in it to win. Most notably, Brown endorsed 
Hayden's call for raising taxes by closing what he says are loopholes that 
benefit big business and the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate was the second of three being held this week. The final match is 
scheduled for today in Los Angeles on the Michael Jackson radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates seemed to have benefited Tuesday night from what amounted 
to a dress rehearsal the night before in Sacramento. Their messages refined, 
the candidates dropped tactics that had bombed and added new flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown, who is leading Garamendi and Hayden in every public 
opinion poll, continued to showcase her criticisms of Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson. But she engaged in more direct exchanges with Garamendi than she had 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, abandoned the line borrowed from 
a car rental ad -- "Not exactly" -- that he had used to underscore his point 
that Brown waffles on important issues. But he added new weapons to his arsenal 
of charges against Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, meanwhile, seemed to be playing the role of mediator as he returned 
time and again to his theme that virtually every problem plaguing the state is 
the result of undue influence of special interest groups in the Capitol. 
Positioned on the stage between his two better-financed rivals, the senator 
from Santa Monica sounded somewhat like a family counselor trying to keep a 
failing marriage together. 
</P>
<P>
 "John and Kathleen should not attack each other," Hayden said. "These are good 
people in a bad system." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden clearly was delighted as he watched his rivals move toward his 
positions on taxes and campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, while still declining to provide specific ideas for balancing the 
state's budget, sketched a plan that was more detailed than any she had offered 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would favor extending a temporary income tax increase on the 
wealthy as long as the Legislature also agreed to continue a freeze on 
cost-of-living increases for welfare mothers. Brown said a thorough performance 
review of Texas state government had yielded $5 billion in savings and 
predicted that as much could be found in California. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Brown said her first budget principle would be "no new taxes," 
she also told Hayden: "I support closing those tax loopholes." She did not say 
which ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has stated flatly that he would extend the tax hike on upper-income 
wage-earners and said he would close the loopholes that "make no sense." He 
also said he was sure the state could cut 2% from overall spending -- about $1 
billion -- a number that Hayden has been using for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Garamendi both say they are longtime supporters of campaign reform, 
but they were not talking much about the issue before Hayden pressed them on 
it. Now both say that as governor, they would sign legislation to limit 
campaign contributions and allow limited taxpayer financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontations between Brown and Garamendi had more to do with their 
records in office than their positions on issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, continuing to take the offensive against Brown in the hope of 
tarnishing her image, accused the treasurer of investing more of the state's 
pension funds in Japan than in California. Mimicking Brown's campaign slogan 
that she is "America's best treasurer," Garamendi said, "Perhaps you are 
Japan's best treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance commissioner twice accused Brown of improperly extracting $1 
million in political campaign contributions from bond firms that do business 
with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shall we talk about the million dollars that you have received from the bond 
houses as you have shaken them down to finance your campaign to become 
governor?" he asked at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Launching her sharpest counterattack yet against Garamendi, Brown charged that 
five audits have found "waste, mismanagement and abuse" in his office and that 
national business journals have described his takeover of a failing insurance 
company was "botched, bungled and dumb." She also charged that the insurance 
commissioner has not lived up to his promise to deliver rebates under 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's talk about your record where you have been reckless as well," she said. 
"Two-thirds of the (rebate) money you promised hasn't been delivered. I'll put 
my record against yours any day." 
</P>
<P>
 The one issue on which the candidates differed the most was capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown repeatedly evaded the panel's attempts to get her to say why she is 
personally opposed to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will enforce the law of this state," Brown said. When pressed on the basis 
for her personal beliefs, which she has never explained publicly, Brown instead 
said she would have denied clemency to murderer Robert Alton Harris, who was 
executed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said she supported the "three strikes" sentencing bill recently 
enacted by the Legislature and the governor, wants more boot camps for 
first-time offenders and favors a total ban on assault weapons. But she 
steadfastly refused to discuss her personal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of the death penalty is being used as a smoke screen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other candidates answered the question directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he was "divided" on the issue. One side of him, perhaps his "Irish 
side," he said, wants the death penalty as an option. But Hayden said his 
"temperate side" sees the ultimate punishment as flawed and irreversible and he 
would prefer to use life imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he was not at all torn about capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand firmly in support of the death penalty," he said. "There's no 
ambivalence about where I stand."

DENNY'S RESTAURANTS SETTLE BIAS SUITS FOR $54 MILLION; CIVIL RIGHTS: BLACKS 
COMPLAINED OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE CHAIN. CASE MARKS NEW PUSH FOR JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. government officials and civil rights advocates, hailing a "new 
partnership" dedicated to weeding out racism in commercial establishments, 
announced a record $54.4-million discrimination settlement with the Denny's 
restaurant chain Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, which earmarks $28 million for victims of discrimination at 
California Denny's restaurants, closes the book on two class-action lawsuits 
that became a modern version of the lunch-counter protests of the civil rights 
movement's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the help and cooperation of private counsel, the Justice Department and 
Denny's have entered into the largest, most-sweeping nationwide settlement of a 
public accommodations case in history," said Deval L. Patrick, assistant 
attorney general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be approved in U.S. district courts in San Jose and 
Baltimore, ends a painful chapter for Flagstar Cos. of Spartanburg, S.C., which 
owns the chain. The firm was accused in the lawsuits of fostering a 
discriminatory corporate culture and refusing to serve blacks at some of its 
1,400 Denny's restaurants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some black customers, for example, said that they were asked to prepay for 
meals or to pay cover charges before they were seated. One former restaurant 
manager said he was told by superiors to close his restaurant if "too many" 
black customers approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the arrangement, Flagstar did not admit wrongdoing. 
Nevertheless, Justice Department officials said, the settlement represents a 
landmark in civil rights enforcement: the largest agreement ever negotiated in 
a case involving discrimination at restaurants, hotels or other public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement resolves separate lawsuits filed last year in California and 
Maryland. The California plaintiffs include Rachel Thompson of Vallejo, a 
15-year-old black who went to Denny's in late 1992 to celebrate her 13th 
birthday but was refused the restaurant's customary free birthday meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland lawsuit was filed by six U.S. Secret Service officers who stopped 
at a Denny's in Annapolis in May, 1993, amid preparations for a speech by 
President Clinton at the U.S. Naval Academy. The black agents said that they 
sat for nearly an hour without being served, even as they watched white 
colleagues served several times. Their lawsuit was expanded to include 
claimants in 48 other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Flagstar will pay $28 million in damages to California 
customers, plus $6.8 million in attorney fees. The chain will pay $17.7 million 
to customers in Maryland and other states, along with $1.9 million in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who feel they were treated unfairly at Denny's can request claim 
forms and apply for a portion of the damages by calling the company toll-free 
at (800) 836-0055. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims will be screened by an independent claims administrator and the 
Washington Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, which filed 
the Maryland lawsuit. Damages will be prorated among victims whose claims are 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides paying damages, Flagstar will be required to retain an independent 
civil rights monitor to ensure the company's compliance with the settlement. In 
addition, it agreed to feature blacks as customers and employees in 
advertisements, train its employees in racial sensitivity and allow 
representatives of a civil rights group to make random spot checks for bias at 
Denny's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar officials said that the company already has begun satisfying many of 
the agreement's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for plaintiffs in the class-action suits said that the settlement 
could become a precedent for future discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, noting that the Justice Department is pursuing 20 other cases 
involving alleged discrimination at public accommodations, issued a pointed 
warning to any companies that still practice racial discrimination: "We are 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement "symbolizes what I think is a return of the finest moments of 
the civil rights struggles, in which the Department of Justice locked arms with 
civil rights lawyers and the private bar to win relief for victims of 
discrimination," said John P. Relman, an attorney for the Washington Lawyer's 
Committee. "We hope and believe that this is the beginning of a new 
partnership. . . . We want the Justice Department by our side." 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar still faces a handful of individual discrimination lawsuits. A 
spokesman said that the company hopes to settle those cases separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a separate press conference Tuesday, Flagstar Chief Executive 
Officer Jerome J. Richardson insisted that the chain, which has $3.8 billion in 
annual sales, never had a policy of discriminating against blacks. But, he 
conceded, "clearly, these plaintiffs did not feel that way, and I regret that." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who owns the National Football League's new Carolina Panthers 
franchise, said he was concerned last summer that the allegations of racial 
bias would hamper his bid for a team. But he said he was even more worried 
about damage to his personal reputation and that of the company, which suffered 
another blow Monday when two gunmen burst into an Indianapolis Denny's, seized 
hostages and killed one. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Flagstar entered a "fair share" agreement with the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People and agreed to expand minority ownership 
of its franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company has no black-owned franchises, a Flagstar spokesman said 
that 28 potential owners are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Denny's hired a civil rights monitor who works out of the company's 
regional office in Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph P. Russell, most recently a consultant in San Diego, was hired as part 
of a consent decree signed with the U.S. Justice Department in which the chain 
agreed to monitor business practices to ensure that discrimination does not 
occur.

RWANDA REBELS ADD CHAPTER TO AFRICAN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of them are only boys, 14 or 15 years old, wearing sheepish grins and 
raggedy uniforms that make them appear no more threatening than toy soldiers. 
They smile easily, but the smile does not reach their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Already these boys are wartime veterans, warriors who have no rank, collect no 
pay and travel on foot, lugging an odd assortment of French, Belgian and Soviet 
weapons. They sleep on the ground, stuff bullets in their pockets and have not 
yet learned to salute or field-strip a rifle. "It's not a bad life," said one 
of the boys manning a checkpoint here on the road to Kigali, the capital. "One 
day I go back to my father's farm. Today I fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys are part of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a guerrilla group 
whose roots go back to 1959 but which remained virtually unknown to the world 
at large until its members launched a major offensive April 6 after President 
Juvenal Habyarimana and the leader of neighboring Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira -- 
both Hutus -- were killed in a suspicious plane crash. The rebels have now 
chased government soldiers out of half of this beleaguered, impoverished 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the front has become part of Africa's post-independence 
legacy. Page by page, over 40 years, guerrilla groups from Angola to Kenya have 
rewritten the history of the continent. The results have not always been 
beneficial for the people in whose name the rebellions were launched. 
</P>
<P>
 The first guerrilla wars, like Jomo Kenyatta's Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya in 
the early 1960s, were undertaken to drive out the European colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Each succeeded, and from bloodied Angola and Guinea-Bissau in the west to 
Mozambique in the east and Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and 
Zimbabwe) in the south, power was transferred to the Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent election of Nelson Mandela to South Africa's presidency, all 
47 sub-Saharan African countries are now governed by the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the purpose of guerrilla groups such as the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- 
and others that have fought in Mozambique, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia and 
Djibouti -- is to dislodge a ruling African elite in the name of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Under whatever banner they may fight, the rebels' ultimate purpose is always 
the same -- power: economic, political and sometimes tribal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this African history, and I swear to you we are different," said an 
RPF officer who requested anonymity. "We are fighting to install a government 
of national unity. We want democracy and reform. The first thing we will do is 
get rid of the cards identifying your ethnic group that the government makes 
everyone carry." 
</P>
<P>
 Although such lofty ideals are heard often in Africa, the RPF, composed mostly 
of members of the minority Tutsi tribe, has proved itself a more disciplined, 
organized military force than the Rwandan army and its fearful Hutu-dominated 
militias that have run pell-mell through the countryside, massacring untold 
thousands of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers cheered the arrival of RPF troops along the road to the Tanzanian 
border last month, but many Rwandans, especially Hutus, remain deeply skeptical 
about the rebels' ultimate goals and feel that they may begin a new round of 
bloodletting to avenge the massacres they have endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never return to Rwanda if the RPF is in power," said Eliachim 
Mulindandabi, a 20-year-old Hutu refugee in Tanzania's Benaco camp. "It would 
not be safe. For me or any Hutu. They are killers, and they would hunt us 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 The RPF fighters are mostly Rwandan Tutsi refugees whose families escaped to 
Uganda after a 1959 revolution that ended 400 years of Tutsi domination over 
the Hutus, who represent 90% of Rwanda's more than 7 million people. 
Historically, the Tutsis formed the intellectual and professional core of 
Rwandan society. Until the revolution, they held the Hutu farmers in a form of 
feudal serfdom surpassed only in Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Uganda, many of the Rwandan refugees were recruited as mercenaries in the 
Uganda National Liberation Army that, with the help of Tanzanian soldiers and 
Ugandan dissidents, overthrew Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1979. The rebel 
leader, Yoweri Museveni, became president of Uganda in 1986 and has not 
forgotten his debt: Uganda provides the RPF with its lifeline of weapons, 
ammunition and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many RPF rebels speak English learned in Uganda, while the Zairian-supported 
Rwandan army speaks French or Kinyarwanda, the language shared by both Hutus 
and Tutsis. Some of the rebels wear Ugandan uniforms, and more than a handful 
have returned to join the battle from jobs abroad as accountants, teachers and 
a variety of middle-class positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deal with the RPF every day, and I found them very responsible," said a 
French doctor who works in rebel-controlled territory. "But they're having a 
lot of trouble doing all the things you have to do when you administer civilian 
authority. That I don't think they're prepared to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The RPF says it is unwilling to negotiate with the interim government that has 
set up office in Gitarama, 25 miles southwest of the capital. It also has said 
it has no objections to the dispatch of 5,500 U.N. troops to Rwanda as long as 
their mission is solely humanitarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Hutus began demanding political reform in 1957, there have been 
outbreaks of fierce violence between the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and 
neighboring Burundi. Thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda were massacred in 
Hutu-organized slaughters in 1959 and 1963. The most recent unrest began Oct. 
5, 1990, when fighting broke out in Kigali between the rebels and the army that 
has since become a civil war.

SMUGGLERS FIND LOOPHOLE TO SAIL THROUGH IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five of them sit at the pier, ships of all measure, varying from 70 feet to 
seven times that size. Some fly the Haitian flag, one the British ensign, and 
some fly no flags at all. They all have one thing in common: They defy the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Leo, an anchorless rust bucket recently pulled from the beach where 
it had run aground, to the British-flagged Oakleigh, all have run a U.N. 
embargo to bring in tens of thousands of gallons of banned fuel oil -- even, in 
at least one case, in the face of warning shots from U.S. enforcers. Pentagon 
officials said Tuesday in Washington that 14 ships heading for Haiti had been 
diverted since the embargo went into effect over the weekend. But other ships 
keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacmel, a resort created as a faux French seaside village by early 
19th-Century coffee magnates, has become the center of the Haitian military's 
effort to break the international sanctions ordered to force the army from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The border is still a serious problem," a diplomat said of the frontier 
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, "and lots of gas comes through, but 
the biggest threat is now the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 Under threat is the strategy by the United Nations and the United States to 
use a near-total embargo to end military rule and restore exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was driven from office Sept. 20, 1991, after seven 
months as Haiti's only democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't stop smuggling, especially from the D. R., then the embargo is 
not only a failure, it is stupid," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ships come all the time," said a foreign resident who has lived here for more 
than 20 years. "They unload barrels of gas, or they just pump it out into truck 
tankers, all in plain sight of the choppers." 
</P>
<P>
 The choppers are U.S. naval and Coast Guard helicopters flying from the 
10-ship international flotilla that is supposed to enforce the embargo, which 
was widened at midnight Saturday to include all goods except food and 
humanitarian items. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jacmel residents, who have little else to do but monitor the 
comings and goings of the little harbor here, only one ship has been 
successfully turned back here, a vessel that made it into the harbor but fled 
when the Coast Guard radioed that it would be seized if it sailed out empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ship received the same warning but unloaded its cargo anyway. The 
captain, who called himself Dirty Harry, simply anchored the ship in the bay 
and abandoned it. He and the crew returned to the Dominican Republic overland, 
residents here said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a 70-foot freighter called the Sea Search also ignored that warning 
-- as well as two cannon bursts across the bow from a Coast Guard cutter -- and 
tied up at the pier. The Pentagon officials said that another ship sailing near 
Haiti's north coast was intercepted and boarded by U.S. officials Monday and 
was still being searched Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Search, however, was unloading barrels of fuel Monday under the 
supervision of at least two Haitian army officers and in full view of reporters 
and other guests at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the sieve-like blockade and a U.S. policy not to use deadly 
force, diplomats and other experts say, Jacmel receives upward of 40% of the 
estimated 4 million gallons of gasoline being smuggled into Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notorious ship is the Oakleigh, a 500-foot tanker that lists its home 
port as Aberdeen, Scotland. Monitors say it comes from the Dominican Republic 
every other day to unload at least 50,000 gallons each time. 
</P>
<P>
 One day over the weekend, nine tanker trucks lined up in broad daylight in 
Jacmel to offload fuel to be taken to the capital, Port-au-Prince, a two-hour 
drive to the southwest. There it is sold on the street for about $10 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the smuggling, diplomats and Haitian business people say, is 
controlled by Gerard Caroli, a local businessman and close associate of Lt. 
Col. Michel-Joseph Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Francois link to the smuggling is an army major known as Oiseau -- 
French for Bird -- who commands the Jacmel police and uses the force as his 
personal booty-gatherers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oiseau recently salvaged the wrecked Leo from the beach in front of one of 
Jacmel's many sleazy seaside bars, got it running and joined in the parade to 
and from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 While far and away the most important aspect of the smuggling, fuel is not the 
only product unloaded here. One ship this past week brought in thousands of 
bicycles, another a load of televisions and stereo equipment, "all from Miami," 
according to one witness.

COLUMN ONE; BITTERSWEET REUNION IN GAZA; A FAMILY SPLINTERED BY EXILE AND 
OCCUPATION WILL FINALLY COME TOGETHER UNDER SELF-RULE. THEY WILL SHARE HOPES 
AND MEMORIES -- AND MOURN A BROTHER KILLED JUST MONTHS AGO. 
</P>

<P>
 As they began to reunite from throughout the Arab world with tears of joy and 
loss -- a catharsis that was a quarter-century of occupation and separation in 
the making -- the Danaf family of Gaza City had much to catch up on last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawky Danaf had to break the worst of it to his half brother, Arafat, who 
arrived in an Iraqi paratrooper's uniform along with hundreds of other 
Palestinian police officers in newly autonomous Jericho. After four years of 
war and isolation with the Palestine Liberation Army brigade based in Baghdad, 
the news was hard for Arafat to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Their brother Mohammad was dead, Shawky told him by phone in a voice choked 
with pain. He had been shot and killed by Israel's occupation army three months 
short of this greatly anticipated reunion -- the coming together of a family 
long divided, like so many in the occupied lands. Just before his death, 
Mohammad had spoken of this reunion as a dream more distant only than the dream 
of living together with his exiled father and four half brothers in a liberated 
Palestinian land. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of their conversation, both Shawky and Arafat were in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Danafs' saga speaks volumes about the events unfolding at ground zero of 
the Middle East conflict, as Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
finally have begun the first concrete steps toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a family of simple poverty among hundreds of thousands of Palestinian 
refugees who are beginning the long process of erasing the distance and pain of 
exile and occupation. And like the peace process itself, the Danaf reunion is 
far from complete. In fact, it has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's father, a former Palestinian fighter named Hassan, fled to Gaza 
with his first wife from their Arab village in southern Israel in 1948, when 
the Israeli state was carved out of British-ruled Palestine. Nineteen years 
later, he fled again after the Arabs lost the 1967 Middle East War. He left his 
wife, three sons and two daughters in Gaza, bounced from Arab land to Arab land 
and finally settled with a second wife in Egypt, where he fathered two sons and 
two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the surviving half brothers -- two in Gaza and two in the Palestinian 
brigades destined to serve the autonomous zones -- anticipate their imminent 
reunion, it is Arafat and the slain Mohammad who best symbolize both the 
decades of Israeli occupation and the peace-building task now at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Danafs' complex story was gleaned in more than a dozen visits to their 
home and to a Gaza City cafe that Mohammad had opened last year while 
unemployed -- to keep from going mad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the story of the splintered and often confusing relationships that 
typify Gazan families, of lifetimes of desperation and fading hope now turned 
to bittersweet joy. And it is a story that demonstrates the human impact of the 
beginning of both the end of Israel's 27 years of occupation in the former 
Palestine and of the effort still needed to restore enough hope to build Gaza 
and Jericho into the core of a future Palestinian land. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawky, 32, and Arafat, 19, spoke for the first time in years when Shawky 
delivered the news of Mohammad's death in the phone call to Arafat's military 
post. Gaza and Jericho, the two autonomous Palestinian zones, are still divided 
by dozens of miles of Israeli territory. A promised route for Palestinian safe 
passage is still weeks -- or months -- away. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Arafat's mother, Rida Wahbeh Abdul-Rasoul, who traveled from Cairo to 
Gaza two weeks ago to begin the reunion, can see him yet. The Egyptian second 
wife of Hassan came to Gaza not only to meet the other half of her husband's 
family but also to see her own sons, Arafat and Sabar, for the first time in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week, on the day Palestinian extremists gunned down two Israeli 
soldiers near the Gaza border, Israel sealed off Gaza for at least nine days, a 
further obstacle to the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad and Shawky's mother -- Halima Abu Obeid -- had little time last week 
for the problems of her husband's second wife. After all, Hassan had abandoned 
her when Mohammad, Shawky and the eldest brother, Ibrahim, 36, were children, 
fleeing into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Halima said, Rida was living with her in Gaza now. Arafat and 
Halima's other stepson, Sabar, 25, are almost home after serving in exiled 
Palestinian brigades in Iraq and Libya both during and after the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabar, due to arrive in Gaza any day with his delayed brigade from Libya, was 
"a carbon copy" of Mohammad, Halima said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my husband called this morning from Cairo, he asked how I was feeling 
now with the boys coming home," she recalled. "With him, I can still speak 
freely. I said, 'I still feel a great sadness. My hand is not complete. Still a 
big finger is missing. Our son Mohammad is gone. We have lost him. And nothing 
can bring him back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An amateur poet, cafe owner and singer in a local band, Mohammad was hardly 
known outside his gritty neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan. Even his half brothers 
had met him only once, years ago when they played together as children. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the flurry of hugs, kisses and tears as thousands of Palestinian 
families continue to reunite here and in Jericho, Mohammad's life and death do 
much to set the stage for this bold step toward peace. They also say much about 
the desperate land Israel has just set free. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad's coffee shop appeared suddenly in December as a battered beacon of 
hope on Gaza's grim landscape. He named it "The Goal Coffeehouse and 
Restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 It stood in an empty field, surrounded by Gaza City's smoldering garbage and 
soiled sand. Mohammad was 26 when he opened the shop with Shawky; that was just 
10 weeks before Mohammad became one of the last Palestinian casualties of 
Israeli occupation in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Mohammad and his open-air cafe stood as small symbols of 
Gaza's irrepressible entrepreneurial spirit and uncanny capacity for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 He had bought a scrapped bus for $200, the last of his savings. It had been 
torched by angry Jewish settlers, who remain on the strip despite autonomy. He 
painted it. He banged out the dents, and it became his kitchen and service 
counter. He borrowed seats from one of the dozens of movie theaters that 
Israeli authorities shut down in Gaza six years ago after the uprising known as 
the intifada brought 8 p.m. curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, the cafe opened for business, selling falafel and other items for 
half a shekel each (about 15 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working in Israel making about 150 shekels a day in construction. When 
the Israelis sealed the border nine months ago, that was it. I sat around for 
months," Mohammad said then in one of several visits with a reporter. "Finally, 
I had to open this place. We were going broke, and with nothing to do all day I 
was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of tens of thousands of Gazan refugees whose families depended on 
jobs in Israel. They had become unemployed when the government, citing rising 
anti-Israeli violence, closed the border to most Palestinian workers in April 
last year. Overnight, Gaza's unemployment rate soared from 20% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 After the closure, the Danaf family lived on Mohammad's savings. For Mohammad, 
it was one more injustice that helped fuel a lifetime of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what I know of the Jews," Mohammad said. "I know that since 
birth, when I was growing up, I remember asking where my father was. Everyone 
said the Jews forced him to flee our land. He left, they said, when Israel 
occupied the Gaza Strip. And that was the year I was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a refugee from the village of Hammama, one of dozens of Arab 
villages incorporated into Israel when the Jewish state was formed, Mohammad's 
father had been one of the Palestinian soldiers who fought against the Israeli 
army in the 1967 war. 
</P>
<P>
 When Israel conquered Gaza that year, Hassan left with a Palestine Liberation 
Army brigade that went to Damascus, Syria; Aden, then-South Yemen; Beirut and 
finally Cairo, where it has served under the Egyptian armed forces. It was one 
of half a dozen such brigades that scattered throughout the Arab world. These 
units took over in Gaza and Jericho last week to form the core of the 
Palestinian security force -- brigades that Hassan's two sons from his second 
marriage would join after him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad knew in December that his half brothers, Arafat and Sabar, were among 
the Palestinian fighters who would return to a homeland they never knew. He 
learned that news from his father, in the same way many Gazans kept up with 
relatives in Egypt after occupation. They would travel to the divided city of 
Rafah that straddles the Egyptian border in Gaza's south and, at prearranged 
meetings, shout to each other through barbed wire across 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the time, Mohammad stressed the significance of this promised reunion 
-- a small but powerful step in the reuniting of more than 2 million 
Palestinian relatives still separated by occupation and exile. It was, he said 
then, almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we have self-government in only one small piece of Gaza, it will be 
better for us, of course. But I fear for the future," he said. "I'd love to see 
the Palestine police force take control of this region, but I doubt it will 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It did happen, but he didn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of its opening, Mohammad's cafe was trashed. It happened during 
an armed clash with another Palestinian family over ownership of the land. 
Desperate, Mohammad illegally crossed into Israel and took back his old 
construction job. After two months, Israeli authorities caught him. He was 
deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mohammad came home about midnight on Feb. 24," Shawky recalled. "He was angry 
and exhausted. When he woke up about noon the next day and heard what had 
happened that morning, something just snapped in him. He left the house in a 
fury. The next time we saw him, he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the day in February when a Jewish settler opened fire inside a Hebron 
mosque, killing about 30 Palestinian worshipers and nearly destroying the 
autonomy plan for Gaza and Jericho. The killings touched off demonstrations and 
riots throughout the occupied lands. Mohammad joined one of them, outside the 
Israeli military camp near his home. He was shot in the right side of his 
chest. He died in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sat outside the remains of the cafe last week, Shawky was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we will be happy when we finally see our two (half) brothers. But 
we are still in mourning for Mohammad, so there will be no celebration," he 
said. "After a time, I will try to reopen this cafe. That was Mohammad's dream. 
. . . But you must understand, we already have paid the full price of this 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was haggard last week. His time in Iraq had aged his face far beyond 
his 19 years. And his eyes were wet as he reflected on the news of his half 
brother's death. He sat inside the new Palestinian military camp in Jericho, 
which he and 450 fellow members of the Iraq-based Al Aqsa Palestinian brigade 
will use as a base to build a future Palestine. Shawky had just called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met (Mohammad) just once, and we had fun together. I was 8 at the time," 
Arafat said, recalling the one brief time Israeli officials allowed the other 
half of the Danaf family to visit. "There was something special about Mohammad, 
the way he saw things and the way he never gave up hope. He was the only one of 
the brothers in Gaza whose face I could remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Arafat told the brief story of his life, and that of the other half of 
the Danaf family that lived as political nomads while Mohammad and Shawky's 
family lived as subjects of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, I went to the Egyptian Embassy in Baghdad to renew my passport," Arafat 
said. "The man at the desk asked me where I was born. 'Damascus,' I said. 'Why 
do you have an Egyptian passport?' he asked. 'My mother is Egyptian, and I grew 
up in Cairo,' I said. 'And where do you live now?' he asked. 'Baghdad,' I said. 
The man just shrugged and said, 'That's nice.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what our lives are like, we Palestinians. I joined the Palestinian 
brigade when I was 14. There was no way to earn money on the streets of Cairo, 
and my brother (Sabar) had joined and said the pay was good -- $62 a week. And 
yes, I suppose we did have the feeling we were doing something for Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
 But for both boys, the decision would isolate them from their family for 
years. Iraq invaded Kuwait soon after Arafat arrived in Baghdad and Sabar in 
Tripoli, and in the following months alliances shifted sharply in the Arab 
world. For many analysts, that invasion and the ensuing Gulf War forced the 
peace process ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 When the subject turned to politics, Arafat had far less to say than his half 
brothers. His father, who has decided to remain in Cairo for now to raise his 
two daughters, spoke occasionally about Gaza and the occupation, Arafat said. 
It was only in Iraq that Arafat was lectured each week on the origins and 
implications of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can tell you is I really do believe this new peace is a great thing," 
Arafat said. "I never believed it myself until I put my foot on the soil of 
Jericho. And soon, . . . I will see Gaza again. I want so much to see the sea 
of Gaza, to know that I really do have a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not the most important thing right now. The first thing I am going 
to do is go to the grave of my brother Mohammad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shawky stood beside that grave as he awaited the arrival of his half brothers 
last week. He stared at the inscription from the Koran that read, "Do not think 
he who was killed fighting for God is dead. They are alive and living in 
paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud of him," Shawky said. "All of us will die one day, and we would 
like to die as he died. We miss him, but he is still in our hearts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Many times, we imagine he is coming to us in our dreams, speaking with us 
about his feelings. And when our half brothers finally do arrive, and we sit 
finally altogether as all families should, I believe he will be there with us 
to enjoy the moment he dreamed of for so long."

L.A. UNIFIED CRITICIZED OVER GRANTS HANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cash-short Los Angeles Unified School District has drawn fire for its 
handling of two financial windfalls, bungling the application for a $15-million 
National Science Foundation grant and causing the donor of an unprecedented 
$10-million gift to high school athletic programs to question the district's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, which submitted an application that one expert said was shoddily 
written and lacked focus, was one of only two urban school districts rejected 
by the National Science Foundation. New York and Chicago were both awarded up 
to $15 million to help revamp the way math and science are taught, one of the 
largest education aid packages in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials with the Food 4 Less Foundation, which last year 
pledged $10 million for athletics, have withheld payment on the second 
installment of the donation after discovering that the district had let about 
$260,000 sit unused for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that is what we had in mind," said Darius Anderson, vice 
president of government and communications for Food 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's handling of the two grants shows a lack of coordination and 
sophistication among top administrators, who are scrambling to salvage the 
relationship with their biggest donor and rushing to save face with a rewritten 
application for the science grant, said several key education leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another example of what happens when things are assigned 
bureaucratically," rather than turned into "red alert" priority issues, said 
Mike Roos, president of the LEARN reform effort. He said district leadership 
often lacks "strategic vision" when it comes to handling such major projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Supt. Sid Thompson accepted responsibility for what 
he called "a major mistake" in the handling of the National Science Foundation 
grant, saying he should have more closely supervised the application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, if I have to take a hit, then go for it," Thompson said. "The facts are 
the facts and I'm not going to find an alibi." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thompson firmly denied that the district mishandled the Food 4 Less 
donation and suggested that foundation officials may be questioning the 
district as a way to renege on their pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there are some problems in terms of trying to meet the commitment," 
Thompson said. "They owed us the second installment in January and they asked 
for a delay until March. They didn't tell me they wanted to delay because 'we 
don't trust what you are doing.' . . . They didn't give us the second 
installment, and what does that tell you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Denial of the prestigious science grant, at a time when the district is in the 
midst of reform efforts partly aimed at boosting the teaching of science and 
math, is an embarrassing blow, some sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we didn't get this grant is a serious concern," said school 
board President Leticia Quezada. "As far as I'm concerned there is no reason 
why we should not get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials would not discuss the official reason for rejecting the 
district's 32-page application. The National Science Foundation plans to send 
the district a detailed analysis of the proposal's weaknesses and has assigned 
consultants to help Los Angeles get it right the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials said they are confident that Los Angeles will be awarded 
the money despite the setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foundation has a very rigorous review process," said Madeleine Long, the 
foundation officer supervising the grants. " . . . What we are after is 
difficult business. We are asking for total school reform in math and science." 
</P>
<P>
 Four grant-writing experts who have seen the Los Angeles application said the 
document did not clearly present innovative ideas for improving math and 
science classes for the district's 640,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was: Give us the money, we'll convene meetings and out of the meetings a 
plan will emerge and all good things will follow from that. . . . My feeling is 
that is not good enough," said George Castro, a scientist with IBM who was 
selected by the foundation to work as a grant consultant for school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 A former grant writer for the district who is now a private consultant to 
school districts across the country was more blunt: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking -- it was like a salad with a lot of ingredients mixed 
together that don't taste well," said the expert, who requested anonymity. "It 
was a shabbily presented document and it was very disorganized. . . . And (it) 
was turned in to a gold-plated organization that wants to see good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had been given a $100,000 stipend from the science foundation to 
research and write the grant. In an effort to bring talented teachers into 
policy-making circles, Thompson said, he allowed two math and science 
instructors to write the grant. Although highly respected for their classroom 
know-how, they had no background in the art of big-time grant writing. In 
retrospect, Thompson said Tuesday, he should have used professional grant 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the Food 4 Less donation, a historic pact between the district 
and a private donor, remains muddled. Last year the foundation pledged nearly 
$10 million over three years to breathe new life into high school athletic 
programs that were about to fall victim to the budget-cutting ax. 
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less officials said Tuesday that they are unhappy with the way their 
money has been handled and are asking for changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handed over a significant amount of money, and then there wasn't any 
client management," said Anderson, who is overseeing the grant for Food 4 Less. 
"We're still committed, but it's going to be in a different manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the foundation in no way intends to renege on its financial 
obligation but is waiting to iron out details on a new program, which will be 
broadened to include other needy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation had agreed that half of its annual $3-million donation would 
cover the major share of the district's $3.7-million athletic budget for 
1993-94. That money was earmarked to cover extra transportation costs, added 
police security and the rental of outdoor bleachers. The other half of the 
contribution was to be split among the schools and be used for equipment, 
uniforms and other essentials for 22 sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said that when he began evaluating the "Save Sports" program in 
January, he found that the schools had not received their shares. Principals 
and athletic directors began calling his office asking about the delay, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, however, said the district did not delay the money and used part of 
it to fund winter sports. The rest was waiting to be distributed to schools 
until principals and coaches could figure out how to fairly divide the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem proved to be the distribution of Food 4 Less patches to be 
worn on game jerseys. Anderson said 14,000 patches that were supposed to be 
sent to schools were left in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district should have put someone in charge of managing the largest 
corporate account it had ever received and did not follow through on its pledge 
to attract other corporate donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many things were falling through the cracks that shouldn't have," he 
said.

ISLAMIC MILITANTS GIVEN LIFE TERMS IN N.Y. BOMBING; TERRORISM: JUDGE SAYS THE 
FOUR 'VIOLATED THE LAWS NOT ONLY OF MAN, BUT GOD' IN KILLING SIX AT WORLD TRADE 
CENTER. GROUP SOUGHT TO PUNISH U.S. FOR BACKING ISRAEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shouting their defiance, four Islamic militants were sentenced Tuesday to 
spend the rest of their lives in prison without parole for last year's bombing 
of the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In imposing the maximum possible punishment for what the government has termed 
"the worst act of terrorism in U.S. history," U.S. District Judge Kevin T. 
Duffy called the defendants sneaks and cowards. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you sought to do in the name of Islam . . . " he admonished them, 
"violated the laws not only of man, but God." Each was sentenced to serve 240 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The noontime explosion on Feb. 26, 1993, killed six people, injured more than 
1,000 and filled the 110-story twin towers with smoke and flames. It also 
shattered America's sense of post-Cold War invulnerability and the belief that 
terrorism is an overseas phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence presented during the trial showed that the defendants had sought to 
punish Americans for their support of Israel by targeting one of the nation's 
best-known landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no remorse shown, merely arrogance and nothing else," Duffy 
said as he sentenced the principal defendant, Mohammed A. Salameh, 26, who 
rented the van that carried the 1,200-pound bomb into the trade center's 
underground garage. "Somehow, you have a sense of achievement. Perhaps you feel 
you are a martyr." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities broke the case last year after tracing the rented van to 
Salameh through an identification number found on a piece of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "You chose a site to kill the greatest number of people possible," the judge 
told Salameh. If the bomb had been placed at the base of the trade center's 
north tower, he said, "as many as 10,000 deaths could have resulted." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the federal courthouse, where a jury had convicted the defendants on 
March 4, dozens of New York police stood behind barricades to guard against any 
violent demonstration or perhaps another bombing attempt. No trouble ensued and 
by late afternoon some patrol officers were slumped over the wooden barricades 
as if dozing. 
</P>
<P>
 Salameh, like the other defendants, said before sentencing that the 
months-long jury trial had been infected with bias because of unfair treatment 
by "the media in the United States and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his accomplices also objected that, after they fired their 
court-appointed lawyers two months ago, Duffy prohibited them from retaining 
famed civil rights lawyer William M. Kunstler to handle their appeals. Duffy 
ruled against Kunstler on grounds that he already is representing one or two 
defendants in a related bombing conspiracy trial next fall, involving a 
militant Egyptian sheik and a dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government would like Salameh and two other convicted bombers to 
testify at that trial, Salameh told the court in a booming voice: "The 
government wants us to testify falsely in the name of cooperation. I will not 
testify in that other case against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to his own case, he said, "I am not going to plead for mercy. I will 
not beg." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, regarded by Salameh and the others as their spiritual 
leader, and 12 co-defendants are charged with conspiring not only to bomb the 
World Trade Center, but also to blow up the U.N. building and the Lincoln and 
Holland commuter tunnels linking New York City with New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy reserved his harshest condemnation for the second defendant, Nidal 
Ayyad, 26, a chemical engineer who helped finance the bombing and ordered 
chemicals and hydrogen gas for the homemade explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are clearly the most culpable of the defendants. You had the best 
breaks," Duffy told him, referring to his U.S. college education. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said Ayyad had violated the oath he took upon becoming a U.S. 
citizen "and turned your life into a total lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayyad also was convicted of sending an anonymous letter to the New York Times 
threatening further acts of violence unless the United States cut off all 
assistance to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayyad responded defiantly to Duffy: "You are only a judge. You can put me in 
prison for five or 10 lives. But God is more powerful than America." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ayyad complained that "human rights advocates" had not monitored his 
treatment during months in detention, Duffy interjected: "Did human rights 
organizations monitor the people whom you killed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Smith, a New Yorker who lost his pregnant wife, Monica, in the blast, 
addressed the court before sentencing to urge harsh punishment for the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my wife and I will never get to see my son grow up," Smith said in a 
choked voice. "We lost all this because of an act of terrorism against the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The other two defendants, Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, and Ahmad Mohammad Ajaj, 28, 
claimed that they were victims of American injustice, repeatedly invoked the 
name of God and said they would rely on divine law over human law. 
</P>
<P>
 Abouhalima, who was pictured as "field general" of the bombing, helped 
construct the bomb and purchased gas for the delivery van the morning of the 
crime. Ajaj was convicted of carrying bomb-making manuals into the country 
several months before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 All four defendants, speaking through an Arabic interpreter, were dressed in 
loose-fitting brown dungarees issued by the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, 
Pa., where they had been held pending sentencing. It was unclear if they would 
serve their sentences at Lewisburg or at an even higher-security institution at 
Marion, Ill., where many convicted mobsters and drug traffickers are 
imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the defendants testified at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy said 180 years of each sentence was based on the life expectancies of 
the six people who died in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 He also imposed fines of $250,000 on each defendant to be used as restitution 
to families of the victims. Federal sources said they did not know if the fines 
ever can be collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said outside court that the 
sentences "send an unmistakable message that this country will respond 
decisively to terrorist acts."

MANDELA OUTLINES HIS VISION FOR SOUTH AFRICA; DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT SETS HEALING 
TONE IN STATE OF NATION SPEECH. HE BALANCES BLACKS' NEEDS, WHITES' FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a sunny day of pomp and pageantry, President Nelson Mandela outlined a 
soaring vision for the new South Africa on Tuesday in his first State of the 
Nation speech, a carefully crafted address that tried to balance the needs of 
poor blacks with the fears of rich whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationally televised speech before a joint session of the multiracial 
National Assembly and Senate in the Parliament building in Cape Town set a 
healing tone and a moderate course for the new democracy as it struggles to 
shed the social and economic inequities of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, Mandela repeatedly vowed, is a "people-centered society." The 
government's aims are nothing less than "freedom from want, freedom from 
hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from 
suppression and freedom from fear." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us all get down to work," he said, to a standing ovation from the 490 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded for reconciliation and an end to racism. And in perhaps the most 
moving section, he read a poem linking the growth of an African child to the 
demand for freedom. The author was Ingrid Jonker, who committed suicide in 1965 
after breaking with her father, a conservative Afrikaner legislator, over the 
injustice and indignity of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "To her and others like her, we owe a commitment to the poor, the oppressed, 
the wretched and the despised," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inspiring rhetoric, Mandela's initial programs and policies were 
unexpectedly modest for a country in which nearly half the black majority is 
unemployed, illiterate and without proper health care or housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited scope reflected the reality of a government based on a 
still-untested power-sharing formula and an economy emerging from a four-year 
recession and a decade of capital flight. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most specific pledge, Mandela promised to start a 100-day crash program 
under his personal supervision to provide immediate health and nutrition 
services to impoverished families. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, children younger than 6 and pregnant women will receive 
free medical care in every state hospital and clinic. Supplementary feeding 
programs for malnourished children also will begin in every primary school 
"where such need is established," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, he pledged to invest "substantial amounts" to provide nine years 
of free compulsory education. And he said he had given instructions "as a 
matter of urgency . . . to empty our prisons of children and place them in 
suitable alternative care." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has said that up to 25,000 children and juveniles are held in 
detention and prisons, but government leaders and corrections officials have 
strenuously denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mandela conceded that "many details . . . remain to be discussed, 
agreed (to) and put in place," he also pledged to start a public works program 
to "rebuild our townships, restore services in rural and urban areas" and 
create millions of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave no overall cost but said his government would allocate $735 million in 
its first budget for the so-called reconstruction and development plan. He said 
the money would come from savings and redirected spending in the anticipated 
$36-billion budget, which will be announced next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the plan, which formed a key campaign pledge of Mandela's African 
National Congress, will grow each year until spending exceeds $2.9 billion in 
their fifth and final year, he said. The government also will exert "maximum 
leverage" with business leaders and foreign aid donors to coordinate private- 
and public-sector efforts toward helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign aid to the former pariah state, now about $500 million a year, will 
grow to more than $2 billion if the government uses loans available from the 
World Bank and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela clearly hoped that the speech would reassure the still-nervous 
business community, both at home and abroad, which is awaiting clear signals of 
intent and policy from a coalition government that includes Joe Slovo, the 
chairman of the Communist Party, and many other ANC leaders trained in the 
former Soviet Union and other East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to create a favorable investment environment, Mandela said he is 
determined "to contain general government consumption at present levels and to 
manage the budget deficit with a view to its continuous reduction." 
</P>
<P>
 But he offered something less than a no-new-taxes pledge, saying that the new 
coalition Cabinet was "agreed that a permanently higher general level of 
taxation is to be avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's speech was partly overshadowed by a controversy over the 
surreptitious hand-over by the former government of about 7 million acres of 
state land to a trust controlled by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The transfer 
was signed by then-President Frederik W. de Klerk a day before the elections 
and was revealed by a local newspaper Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both De Klerk and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi have denied 
wrongdoing in the last-minute transfer of nearly one-third of the land in the 
new province of KwaZulu-Natal. The deal has raised suspicions because it was 
completed just as Buthelezi and the king ended an election boycott. The boycott 
was ostensibly based on demands for an autonomous Zulu homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, who has said he was unaware of the transaction, has ordered a Cabinet 
commission to look into the arrangement. He did not mention the issue, or his 
campaign promises for land reform, in his address. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the speech, thousands of supporters lined Cape Town's neat streets to 
clap and cheer as scores of white-helmeted motorcycle outriders slowly led the 
new president's bulletproof Mercedes-Benz through downtown and up the 
cobblestoned path to the Parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop a red carpet leading to the building once limited to whites, Mandela 
placed his right hand over his heart -- no longer holding a clenched fist in 
the air, as he did for so many years -- while a military band played the two 
national anthems. A 21-gun salute boomed from nearby Signal Hill, scores of 
white-gloved soldiers stiffly saluted and six fighter jets roared overhead 
trailing plumes of colored smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lawmakers -- 400 from the National Assembly and 90 from the Senate -- 
stood and applauded as Mandela entered the chamber led by an usher and a 
traditional bare-chested praise singer, who waved a shield and bellowed tribal 
tributes to Mandela in his native Xhosa. 
</P>
<P>
 The two legislative bodies also make up the Constitutional Assembly, which 
will draft a permanent constitution within two years to replace the interim 
charter used to guide the country through last month's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's secretary general, was elected without opposition 
earlier Tuesday as the Constitutional Assembly's chairman. Ramaphosa, who was 
widely acclaimed as the ANC's chief negotiator for the interim constitution, 
declined to join Mandela's Cabinet after he was passed over as deputy 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 In another announcement, the new defense minister, Joe Modise, said he has 
reappointed the former government's military chief for a five-year term. He 
said Gen. Georg Meiring would run the new South African National Defense Force, 
which will include both regular troops and former anti-government guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela praised the defense force in his speech, but he has spoken before of 
cutting military spending to help fund his reconstruction program. Modise, the 
former head of the ANC's guerrilla army, warned that the defense force would 
become "inadequate" if cuts are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament is scheduled to adjourn at the end of this week and then 
reconvene June 22.

5 QUESTIONED IN SHOOTING OF TOURISTS; CRIME: TIPS AND INVESTIGATIVE WORK LEAD 
TO A POSSIBLE BREAK IN THE CASE. THE GERMAN COUPLE WAS ATTACKED NEAR IDYLLWILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN and NIESON HIMMEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were being questioned Tuesday night as "possible suspects" in a 
shooting last week near Idyllwild that left a German tourist dead and her 
husband critically injured, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mark Lohman said tips from the public, coupled with investigative work 
by homicide detectives, led to the most significant break yet in the May 16 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The five people were taken to the Hemet substation for questioning that lasted 
into the night. Lohman said investigators also were poring over evidence taken 
when more than 30 law enforcement officers executed search warrants 
simultaneously at four houses in Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 That city is at the base of California 243 leading to Idyllwild, near where 
the shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the five had been arrested. Lohman said that if the investigation pans 
out with major developments, a news conference will be held today. He refused 
to identify the five or even to disclose their sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning Police Sgt. Marshall Palmer said the car investigators believe was 
used in the getaway is among the evidence obtained by county detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Execution of the warrants, issued after sheriff's investigators told a 
Riverside judge that they had good reason to search the houses, was the first 
indication that investigators were on the trail of possible suspects in the 
shootings near a viewpoint parking lot in the San Bernardino National Forest 
overlooking Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gisela Pfleger, 62, was fatally shot in the head. Her husband, Klaus Pfleger, 
a retired customs worker in Germany, was shot twice in the face and once in the 
shoulder and apparently was left for dead by the assailants. He drove about 
half a mile to a nearby lake, where he attracted the attention of passersby who 
summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering from his wounds at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Pfleger 
provided investigators with the only eyewitness account of the shooting. He 
described the assailants as three men between the ages of 17 and 20, wearing 
dark clothes. Robbery was the apparent motive, and only one of the attackers 
wielded a gun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfleger is expected to be hospitalized for more than a month for 
reconstructive jaw surgery. Because of difficulty speaking, he has communicated 
with investigators through written notes translated into English by a hospital 
staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pflegers had arrived in Southern California only days before the attack to 
visit a daughter and to go sightseeing. Authorities do not believe that they 
were targeted as foreign tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said that none of the five people taken in for questioning resisted the 
officers and that they would be questioned "for as long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bakersfield police and the California Highway Patrol questioned the 
occupants of a car that generally matched the description of the getaway 
vehicle. But they were later released. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to fielding tips from the public, the Sheriff's Department set up 
a roadblock along the mountain highway for a few days after the shootings to 
question motorists who regularly travel the route.

PAROLED RAPIST ARRESTED IN MURDER; CRIME: SUSPECT IS RETURNED TO ORANGE COUNTY 
FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FACE CHARGES IN THE DEATH OF A HUNTINGTON BEACH 
WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A paroled rapist with a long history of sexual assaults was returned to Orange 
County on Tuesday to face charges that he murdered a 23-year-old Huntington 
Beach woman he met at a local nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 100 onlookers jeered and booed as Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 
28, of Orange shuffled off a chartered airplane at Fullerton Municipal Airport, 
wearing a jail-issued jumpsuit and shackles. He was guided to a patrol car by 
the Orange police officers who had gone to Quincy, Calif., to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to elude a statewide manhunt, Morgan had fled to the small Northern 
California town where he was hiding out with a longtime girlfriend and a former 
cellmate from Folsom State Prison, both of whom were arrested on suspicion of 
harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is arraigned today, Morgan, already convicted of three rapes, could be 
charged with murder punishable by death if prosecutors determine that the woman 
he is suspected of murdering also was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors have declined to say whether they have evidence that 
Leanora Annette Wong had been the victim of a sexual assault before she was 
beaten to death across the street from the Orange nightclub where she went with 
a girlfriend last Thursday. Her battered body was discovered in a nearby 
parking lot early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Lt. Tim Browne said investigators have fingerprint evidence 
against Morgan and that witnesses have said they saw him with the victim. 
Browne said a video security camera near the nightclub also captured some 
information that might be helpful, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has angered Morgan's prior victims and some police officers, who 
believe he is a sexual predator who took advantage of a criminal justice system 
that seemed to give him the benefit of the doubt at nearly every turn. They are 
calling for tougher punishment of sexual offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach woman who says she was the victim of an unpunished rape by 
Morgan said Tuesday the slaying would not have occurred if Orange County 
prosecutors had been more vigorous in pursuing her case. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was arrested by Huntington Beach police in 1993 after the woman 
reported being raped, but the Orange County district attorney's office declined 
to file rape charges against him, preferring to let parole officials send him 
back to prison for the remaining year of a sentence for his third rape 
conviction.

 The clue that led to Morgan's capture was a postcard from Sonya Marvin, 22, 
inviting him to visit her in Quincy that investigators found in his Orange 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him. That's all you need to know," said Marvin, as she was released on 
her own recognizance Tuesday from a Quincy jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested was Marvin's brother-in-law, Travis Burhop, 21, who was Morgan's 
former prison cellmate.

MEXICAN OFFICIALS LINKED TO COLOSIO ASSASSINATION, SUSPECT'S FAMILY SAYS; 
INVESTIGATION: RELATIVES OF ACCUSED KILLER NOW SAY HE MET WITH TWO FEDERAL 
SECURITY AGENTS BEFORE THE SLAYING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN TIJUANA.

<P>
 The father of the accused assassin of Mexican presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio has given a potentially explosive new account of the case that 
could implicate two Mexican federal security officials, family representatives 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused assassin's father now says that his son knew the two security men 
and met with them weeks before the March 23 assassination, according to the 
family spokesmen, Peter Schey, the family's Los Angeles lawyer, and Jorge 
Mancillas, a UCLA professor and family adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The two spoke Tuesday with the family of Mario Aburto Martinez in Los Angeles 
two days after Aburto's mother and five other relatives crossed the border 
illegally from Tijuana and requested political asylum, alleging that they had 
been harassed and threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto, a 23-year-old factory worker charged with gunning down Colosio at a 
Tijuana campaign rally, told his father in January that he was friendly with a 
man later identified as a security guard for Colosio, said the family 
representatives. Mario Aburto also told his father, Ruben, that the guard was 
going to introduce him to an "important person" -- who turned out to be an 
agent in Mexico's Interior Ministry -- at a meeting in a Tijuana gymnasium, the 
family spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two security men have been the focus of intense investigation and 
speculation because of their mysterious actions at the assassination; the 
Interior Ministry agent was arrested as he ran from the scene with a 
bloodstained shirt. But neither has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations by Aburto's family appear significant because there have been 
few developments and many conspiracy theories since the arrests of Aburto and 
three alleged accomplices, all volunteer security guards at the rally. But the 
new account comes after weeks in which the family's public statements have 
changed several times, causing Mexican officials and others to question their 
credibility privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican authorities did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's representatives said Ruben Aburto and other relatives in Los 
Angeles had been reluctant to speak until now because they feared retaliation 
against their relatives in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been very scared," Mancillas said of the father. "He believed they could 
kill his family in Tijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives call the accused gunman -- who authorities say has confessed to the 
killing -- a scapegoat for unknown conspirators behind the sensational 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto and other relatives of the accused assassin are willing to meet 
with Mexican investigators to disclose what they know, said Schey, who heads 
the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los Angeles. Aburto's 
mother and other family members in Tijuana have been questioned by Mexican 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family wants the truth of the assassination to come out," Schey said. 
"The family is willing to accept the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Before talking to investigators, however, the Aburtos want the Mexican 
government to let Ruben Aburto visit his imprisoned son near Mexico City and 
permit visits by attorneys from the United States and a doctor selected by the 
family, Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother and other Aburto kin who crossed the border Sunday have been 
released while they seek political asylum or temporary residence based on 
humanitarian grounds. In the last month, the family has been followed, 
frightened by a series of attempted break-ins and had the windows of their 
Tijuana house shattered by gunfire, Schey said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. immigration officials say the case will receive no special treatment. 
They said diplomatic sensitivities -- a political asylum case would force U.S. 
authorities to pass judgment on Mexico's handling of the Colosio case -- are 
not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements connecting Aburto to other figures in the case provide the 
strongest potential indication of a conspiracy in a secretive, much-criticized 
investigation. The case appears to be based largely on videotapes and on the 
confession of Aburto, who insists that the three alleged accomplices were not 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In various statements to reporters, Aburto's father has said his son went to a 
shadowy political meeting in March with two of the accused accomplices, former 
Baja police officers who worked in the volunteer crowd control team provided by 
the Tijuana branch of Colosio's political party. The two are charged with 
obstructing Colosio's military bodyguards, enabling the gunman to advance 
through a crowd and shoot the candidate at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's revelations are particularly sensitive because they involve two 
other security men whose roles have never been fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the two family spokesmen, Ruben Aburto says he was visiting 
Tijuana in January when his son told him that his friend, Salvador Hernandez 
Tomasini, was going to introduce him that night to Jorge Antonio Sanchez 
Ortega, the federal agent later arrested when he ran from the assassination 
scene with a bloodstained shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was hired for another, somewhat mysterious campaign security squad 
for Colosio. Videotapes show Hernandez crouched to the left of Colosio just 
before the fatal shots were fired. He initially was named as a suspect, but has 
not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Sanchez has been a major source of intense speculation involving a 
possible second gunman and purported government involvement in the plot. 
Authorities say Sanchez was assigned to monitor the campaign rally secretly for 
the Interior Ministry. Police arrested Sanchez as he left the scene immediately 
after the assassination; his hands later tested positive for gunpowder residue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez told interrogators that he had not fired a gun and said his shirt 
was bloody because he brushed against one of the men who helped carry the 
wounded candidate. Sanchez was later released.

STATE DROPOUT RATE FALLS 38.8% IN EIGHT YEARS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE 
THE DECLINE TO SPECIAL SCHOOL PROGRAMS TARGETING THE PROBLEM AND TO GENERAL 
REFORMS. ALL MAJOR ETHNIC GROUPS IMPROVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California is steadily chipping away at its once abysmal high school dropout 
rate, reducing it by 38.8% in the eight years since the state began tracking 
the numbers of students who left school before graduating, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Department of Education report to be released today shows that 15.3% 
of the Class of 1993 dropped out between 10th grade and graduation day, down 
from the 16.5% of students lost from the Class of 1992. Eight years earlier, 
one-fourth of all California high school students failed to earn a diploma or 
its equivalent. However, the state dropout rate remains above the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements were registered in all the major ethnic groups, although the 
rates for African Americans and Latinos, about 22% for each, remain above the 
state average. (For the Class of 1986, dropout rates for both groups were more 
than 35%.) 
</P>
<P>
 The report, based on data collected annually since 1986 from each of the 
state's secondary school districts, provided a dose of good news for a 
department that has been battling controversies, the most recent of which is 
the furor over its pioneering but problem-plagued testing system. 
</P>
<P>
 The progress came despite several years of tight budgets and at a time when 
increasing proportions of the state's 5.2 million public school students live 
in poverty or speak little English, placing them at higher risk of dropping 
out. The rate, calculated over a three-year period, is based on the number of 
students who leave during grades 10, 11 and 12 and do not transfer to another 
school or enter an alternative diploma program. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials credit small but aggressive anti-dropout programs in growing 
numbers of school districts, as well as a decade of reform efforts to overhaul 
curriculum and teaching, improve textbooks, encourage more students to take 
tougher courses and reorganize schools to make them more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is a tremendous number of people in California working 
incredibly hard to improve what's going on in public schools, and they are 
doing it despite incredible odds and with about 80% of the national average 
funding per child," said William D. Dawson, acting superintendent of public 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's biggest school district, the 640,000-student Los Angeles 
Unified, where 42.7% of the Class of 1986 failed to graduate, the dropout rate 
fell to 29.1% for the Class of 1993, a reduction of nearly one-third. Officials 
credit a two-pronged effort, begun in 1987 with a state grant, which aims to 
keep students in school and to get dropouts back into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other urban districts with formerly high dropout rates also posted 
significant gains in their efforts to keep students in school. They include San 
Francisco Unified, which whittled its rate from 30.5% in 1986 to 9.6% in 1993, 
and San Diego Unified, which went from 32.1% to 14.3% during the same period. 
About a dozen California districts registered 100% improvement, and several had 
no dropouts at all last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all districts have shared in the success. For example, Oakland's rate 
grew, from 19.7% to 28.9%, during the eight-year period. Locally, rates jumped 
in several districts, including Culver City, Long Beach, Pasadena and even 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was sobering news for officials in Culver City Unified, which saw 
an 85.5% increase in its dropout rate, to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very concerned when I saw that number," said Supt. Curtis Rethmeyer, 
who, while questioning the accuracy of the report, acknowledged that it 
indicated "we are not as successful as we would like to be." Beverly Hills 
officials could not be reached for comment on their dropout rate, which climbed 
from 6.1% in 1986 to 11% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When compared with other states, California still has a long way to go in 
solving its dropout problems. Although the federal government compiles data 
differently, making direct comparisons difficult, 1990 census data provides 
some idea of how the state ranks nationally. Nationwide that year, 11.2% of 
those ages 16 through 19 had left school without earning a diploma; for 
California, the number was 14.3%, lower only than Nevada among all the states. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the districts that have made big strides in solving their 
dropout problems showed that most -- including Los Angeles and San Diego -- 
stretched relatively small amounts of money to create individually tailored 
programs for clearly troubled students. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,500-student Duarte Unified School District, where the dropout rate once 
hovered near 60%, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which is 58% Latino and 14% African American, parlayed a 
$240,000 state grant into a program designed in 1987 with the help of parents, 
teachers, counselors and others, to create a "school within a school" at Duarte 
High. It began with 50 students identified as most likely to drop out. With the 
help of the students and parents, a team of school staff members created 
individualized, computer-assisted learning programs that mirror the state 
curriculum but allow students to work at their own pace and during hours that 
mesh with jobs or child-rearing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first year, students who had initially showed up only 20% of 
the time were reporting to class 80% to 90% of the time and making steady 
academic progress, said Alan Johnson, the district's deputy superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, the district set up off-campus sites for those who had already 
dropped out, including some in their 20s. About half the 60 to 100 students a 
year taught at those sites earn diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the district's dropout rate fell to 18.9%; at Duarte High it was 
just 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know some kids flat don't want to come to school, don't want to try," 
Johnson said. "But many of them do. What we have is a way to help those kids."

EX-FBI AGENT SAYS HE GAVE CHECK TO HILL; COURTS: UNDERCOVER OFFICER TESTIFIES 
IN STATE SENATOR'S POLITICAL CORRUPTION TRIAL. HE SAYS THE LEGISLATOR WAS GIVEN 
$2,500 IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS INFLUENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former undercover FBI agent testified Tuesday that he handed a $2,500 check 
to state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) in exchange for the legislator's help in 
persuading then-Gov. George Deukmejian to back a 1988 special interest bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The check was specifically for his (Hill's) influence with the governor," 
George W. Murray told jurors at Hill's federal political corruption trial. 
</P>
<P>
 When Murray gave the check to Hill, the agent was posing as an Atlanta 
businessman seeking passage of a bill that would help him locate a shrimp 
processing plant in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors called Murray to the stand in an effort to back their 
contention that Hill, then an assemblyman, was part of a conspiracy to 
illegally extort money from the bogus businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has pleaded not guilty to charges of extortion, conspiracy and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray described Hill to the jury as his "facilitator" who would get the bill 
"past the governor's veto." Alerted that it was part of an FBI sting, 
Deukmejian had vetoed a similar bill two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Murray, now in private industry, said the $2,500 
check to Hill was not made payable to anyone. He acknowledged that by leaving 
the payee space blank, he was testing to see what Hill would do with the money 
and whether he would disclose the payment to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 When the check was cashed, it had been made out to "Frank Hill -- honorarium." 
Murray testified that Hill failed to give a speech even though the money was 
purportedly for a speaking fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill received the funds in June, 1988, during an hourlong meeting with Murray 
at his suite in the Hyatt hotel near the Capitol. Hill was accompanied at the 
meeting by Karin L. Watson, a special assistant to then-Assembly Republican 
Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 In a soft drawl, Murray, who spent 24 years with the FBI, told jurors he was 
concerned during the session that questions from Watson about his background 
might blow his cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it scared me to death," Murray testified. So, the retired agent 
said, he mixed real-life events as military service in Vietnam with fiction to 
make Watson believe he was really an entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors sought to use Murray's testimony to corroborate statements by 
Watson, who pleaded guilty to felony extortion and is cooperating with the 
government in exchange for a light sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Watson wrapped up seven days on the stand as the government's 
central witness against Hill and co-defendant Terry E. Frost, a former 
legislative aide who is charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson acknowledged that when the investigation surfaced publicly she 
complained about how the FBI grilled her and called the agents "bastards." But 
Watson said she was upset, stung at becoming immersed in an investigation that 
cost her her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a wonderful career that I very much loved," she said. "I lost all that 
and my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial resumes today.

DMV PROBE OF COMPUTER DEAL RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An internal investigation into the Department of Motor Vehicles' $44-million 
computer debacle has found that DMV officials were swayed by overly optimistic 
sales pitches from manufacturers, ultimately selecting a computer technology 
without properly evaluating whether it could handle the agency's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem was the decision by high-level DMV management to 
essentially relinquish its authority over the project once it was under way, 
according to a special report made public this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The management staff deferred to the agency's technical staff and 
unquestioningly accepted their explanations for an array of problems that 
delayed the multimillion-dollar project, drove up the costs and eventually led 
to a decision to abandon it, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cultural condition has developed over time within the department, namely 
that technical projects . . . are owned, controlled and operated by the 
technical staff," the report said. "No one was questioning how long the project 
was taking, how much it was costing, what were the benefits to be derived, (or) 
when it would be completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Pierce, who headed the department when it launched the project and now 
serves as state lottery director, said he has not seen the DMV report and could 
not second-guess its findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal assessment of the computer project failure appears in a special 
report to the Office of Information Technology, the arm of the Department of 
Finance that oversees state computer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Written in part to justify a decision to abandon the project, the report is 
highly critical of the way the new computer system was designed and managed by 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Wilson, manager of DMV's information system, said the report is much 
more detailed than it normally would have been because "we wanted to close the 
financial books on the old project and start a new set of books." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the department's criticisms are similar to those contained in 
legislative analysts' reports on the debacle, its assessment provides the first 
detailed examination of key internal decisions which DMV officials now say led 
to the project's failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles had embarked on the computer project in the 
mid-1980s, during the Administration of Gov. George Deukmejian. The prime goal 
was to provide a "one-stop shopping center for information" by merging into a 
single system the giant databases that provide driver's license and motor 
vehicle registration information. 
</P>
<P>
 The major contracts for the project were awarded to Tandem Computers Inc., a 
computer hardware company based in Cupertino, and Ernst & Young, a software 
vendor. After one year, Ernst & Young left the project by mutual agreement with 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was envisioned to cost $28 million, but as problems mounted, the 
costs soared and it fell further and further behind schedule. In 1991, when 
Frank Zolin was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson to head the DMV, he ordered a 
review of the project and an assessment of the best way to salvage it. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he was presented with rescue proposals that carried price tags of 
more than $100 million, Zolin told a legislative committee that he "decided to 
pull the plug on it." At that point, $44 million had been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal investigation cited two major factors that caused the failure: a 
critical technological decision that was made in the initial stages of the 
project and an upper-level management system that generally maintained a 
hands-off philosophy toward technical projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, when the project was being designed, the report said, the "latest, 
hottest technological advance" was something called relational technology. 
Believing that this technology would provide a much more flexible way to 
retrieve data, the department early on locked itself into using relational 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It now appears that DMV management succumbed too readily to industry hype," 
the report said. "The practicalities of what was being promoted by the 
technical industry was overly optimistic, which is often the case. Management 
should have taken a more cautious approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Although relational technology had been used successfully in other states, 
there was little experience in using it in a system as large and complex as the 
DMV's. The driver's license database contained more than 30 million records; 
the vehicle registration more than 40 million. The system had to process at 
least 1 million transactions in a typical workday and remain in operation 24 
hours a day without breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding on the relational technology, the report said the department never 
properly considered whether it would work with its old system for retrieving 
data, which it did not want to change. As it turned out, the report said, that 
retrieval system did not lend itself easily to relational technology. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the report said, the DMV grossly underestimated how much 
work it would take to rewrite programs for the new system and clean up data 
that was in the old system. The old system, for example, was cluttered with 
data collected for laws and regulations that no longer existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental technical strategy developed for the project back in 1987, 
set (it) down an impractical path, which doomed the project," the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 It said a steering committee, which might have questioned the direction of the 
project, was dominated by the technical staff and representatives of Tandem 
management. "The technical management was too closely involved in the success 
of the project to take a critical view of it," the report said. Likewise, it 
said Tandem officials "were not about to make a hard-line assessment which 
might jeopardize continuation of the project original technical strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Tandem was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the DMV had to submit an annual report to the Office of Information 
Technology, that also was prepared by the technical staff. "Most any story 
presented by the project team seemed to be readily accepted," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its examination, the report focused only on the department's actions and 
did not touch on any of the conflicts of interest that have been alleged by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Katz has criticized Office of Information Technology Director Steve Kolodney 
and a former DMV project director, Dennis Walker for relationships they had 
with the Tandem Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1989, Kolodney left his job as head of the Office of Information 
Technology and became a partner in a consulting firm that later did business 
with Tandem. Kolodeny left the consulting firm after a year and went back to 
his old job at the Office of Information Technology, which had responsibility 
for monitoring the DMV project. Walker served as director of the project and 
then left DMV to to work for Tandem. He later returned to state service.

CLINTON TO PRESS CONGRESS ON DRAFTING HEALTH BILL; REFORM: PRESIDENTIAL 
LOBBYING COULD PROVIDE BREAKTHROUGH. TWO SENATE AND THREE HOUSE PANELS REMAIN 
BOGGED DOWN OVER KEY POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With all five congressional committees working on health care legislation now 
certain to miss their self-imposed Memorial Day deadline for producing bills, 
President Clinton will go to Capitol Hill this evening to prod them personally 
to finish their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, it appeared that at least one of the panels -- the Senate Labor 
and Human Resources Committee -- stood a chance of passing a bill to overhaul 
the nation's health care system before Congress adjourns for the weeklong 
recess. However, Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) announced late in the day 
that it would be "unwise" to rush to meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed at least part of the delay on "unforeseen events" -- an apparent 
reference to the death and funeral of his sister-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is also a larger sense that in this situation, haste right now 
would make waste," Kennedy said. "The more time we spend, the more progress we 
are making. It would be foolish to jeopardize further cooperation by forcing 
too many decisions prematurely." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Kennedy has been more successful than expected in winning GOP votes 
for various aspects of his bill. All but two Republicans joined Democrats 
Tuesday in beating back efforts to weaken his proposals for expansion of 
coverage for long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite Kennedy's optimistic stance, the fact remains that, in varying 
degrees, all five committees -- two in the Senate and three in the House -- 
have bogged down over the most fundamental choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest issue involves finding a way to reach the President's most basic 
goal of assuring that every American and legal resident has health coverage. 
Clinton's proposal to require all employers to provide it has proved to be the 
most controversial element of his bill, with opponents contending that the 
additional cost would cause the smallest and weakest firms to fire workers or 
shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his allies thought they had made a breakthrough last week, when 
Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), previously one of the most influential opponents 
of the so-called "employer mandate," had said he would support a modified 
version that exempted the smallest firms. However, Breaux said Tuesday that he 
is not finding much support for that approach, particularly from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Breaux said, he is testing sentiment for a proposal under which employer 
mandates would be put into force only if companies did not expand coverage on 
their own under a reformed health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in what appears to be the most dramatic effort to date to bridge 
party lines on the issue, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), the committee's ranking 
Republican, will work together in drafting the initial version of a health care 
bill to be presented to their committee after the Memorial Day break, Packwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bipartisanship is more of a necessity on the Finance Committee than anywhere 
else in Congress. Democrats command an 11-9 majority there and it is an even 
more fragile party front, given the fact that the Democrats on the committee 
include several conservatives such as Breaux. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a growing sense in Congress that some sort of breakthrough 
must happen -- and happen soon -- to preserve any chance of sweeping 
legislation this year. Otherwise, lawmakers might pass only a set of marginal 
changes in the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why some were viewing Clinton's visit with particular interest, 
despite efforts by both the White House and Democratic leaders to downplay its 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggested that he might use the trip to Capitol Hill as an opportunity to 
put forward new proposals that might elicit support from Republicans and more 
conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said that would be precisely the wrong tactic. Instead, they 
said, Clinton should stand firm behind his bill.

WITH WHISPERS AND TEARS, VISITORS VIEW ONASSIS GRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some fought back tears, a few brought flowers and many snapped pictures 
Tuesday at the grave of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Mrs. Onassis was buried at Arlington National Cemetery next to her 
first husband -- the 35th President of the United States -- the Kennedy grave 
site was reopened to the public and thousands of visitors flocked to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were tourists. At times when two or three bus groups arrived 
simultaneously, the crowds around the hillside plot where John F. Kennedy, two 
of his four children and now his widow are buried were eight to nine people 
deep. At other times throughout the day, fewer than two dozen people gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the visitors spent a few moments in front of the grave, any 
comments to companions reverently whispered. A few lingered for several 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Sullivan of Atlanta knelt down and gently placed four carnations on the 
irregularly cut Cape Cod granite that a cemetery crew had spent the night 
carefully re-laying atop the graves. She had trouble breaking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis died of cancer Thursday at 64 at her home in New York, where she 
had lived since the 1975 death of her second husband, Aristotle Onassis. But it 
was with her first husband, the assassinated young President, with whom she 
wanted to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 She had picked the site for his grave below a mansion that was Robert E. Lee's 
home and overlooking the Lincoln Memorial across the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
 The only formal indication Tuesday that the grave was hers was a 5-by-7-inch 
printed card in a plastic holder, with the name "Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy" 
typed on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent slate marker over President Kennedy's grave bears only his full 
name under a cross and the years of his birth and death. A Kennedy family 
spokeswoman said Mrs. Onassis' children had not yet relayed what would be 
written on their mother's marker.

INTENSE TALKS REPORTED IN ROSTENKOWSKI CASE; CONGRESS: PLEA NEGOTIATIONS DON'T 
HINGE ON KEEPING HIM OUT OF JAIL, SOURCES SAY. A TENTATIVE DECISION WOULD HAVE 
LAWMAKER QUIT THE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Efforts to reach a plea bargain in the federal fraud case against Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) intensified Tuesday, with agreement no longer hinging on 
keeping the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee out of 
jail, sources familiar with the negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentatively decided is that Rostenkowski, who has been expected to play a 
central role in President Clinton's health reform efforts, would resign from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under discussion is how much time U.S. Atty. Eric Holder would recommend that 
Rostenkowski serve in prison and whether U.S. District Judge Norma H. Johnson 
would be bound by that recommendation, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations grew from a traditional meeting with prosecutors at which 
defense attorneys are given an opportunity to argue why their client should not 
be charged. They have been under way since it became clear that Holder intended 
to ask a federal grand jury to indict Rostenkowski on charges of misusing his 
office for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in and out of government estimated the chances that a plea bargain 
would be reached at 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grand jury to which Holder would present any proposed charges is 
scheduled to meet Thursday, but the plea discussions, if they continue, could 
push the matter over to next week, one source said. Another, describing 
Rostenkowski as headstrong, said the discussions could collapse, clearing the 
way for action Thursday or next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage to the government in a plea bargain would be avoiding a long and 
expensive legal process with no certainty of conviction, while achieving the 
"symbolically important" goal of putting in jail, even for less than a year, a 
lawmaker who admitted corruption as part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rostenkowski, the agreement would offer a chance to avoid the humiliation 
of a public trial and the prospect of a possible conviction and long sentence, 
which could result even if he were convicted on only one of possibly multiple 
felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing reports that the plea negotiations still focus on whether 
Rostenkowski would step down as chairman and would have to serve time, one 
source said that the chairman's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, is engaged in 
"damage control," trying to ensure that his client's time behind bars would be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's resignation from the House appears to be a "very live option," 
one well-placed Democrat said. His departure would avoid the possibility of a 
censure resolution and foil attempts by Republicans to force the House Ethics 
Committee to investigate Rostenkowski and others allegedly involved in misuse 
of the now-defunct House post office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ways and Means chairman is alleged to have converted $22,000 in postage 
stamps from his office accounts into cash for his personal use through the post 
office. Rostenkowski also is alleged to have paid employees for work they did 
not do. He has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rostenkowski is indicted on felony charges, rules of the House Democratic 
Caucus would require him to step down as chairman, although he could continue 
as a member of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But associates said Rostenkowski would resign from Congress if he had to give 
up his chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a control freak," one Democratic aide familiar with Rostenkowski's views 
on the subject said. "He wouldn't want to stay around if he wasn't in control 
of the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department guidelines for federal prosecutors state that resignation 
from office is among "appropriate and desirable objectives in plea negotiations 
with public officials who are charged with federal offenses that focus on abuse 
of the office involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Although resignation "shall not be imposed involuntarily against the will" of 
a member of Congress, an offer of resignation "may be incorporated into plea 
agreements," the guidelines state. 
</P>
<P>
 The high political stakes and spillover from the Rostenkowski case were made 
clear Tuesday by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who noted that 
defense lawyer Bennett also is representing Clinton in a sexual harassment 
complaint brought by former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, when you have the President's lawyer negotiating with the Justice 
Department over a national health care leader," Gingrich said, "the American 
people have some cause to wonder what's going on." He said the great concern 
among Republicans is that White House political interference with 
Rostenkowski's case would prevent justice from being done. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're concerned about is some sort of strange plea-bargaining taking 
place in which political pressure could be brought to bear," Gingrich said. 
"You can't have one of the most powerful members of the House having the same 
lawyer as the President at this critical moment being involved in a plea 
bargain and not say anything about it. This is a very serious matter of public 
ethics and it needs to be dealt with in a manner that restores public 
confidence, not undermines it further." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski "doesn't want to go to prison," said a Democratic colleague, 
indicating why it may be difficult for Rostenkowski's lawyers to reach a plea 
bargain with federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a plea bargain that does not include prison time or a 
resignation would trigger demands from Republicans, and some Democrats, for a 
tough censure resolution and demands for an Ethics Committee investigation that 
probably would be approved by the House.

GOP PUSHES FOR 5 HEARINGS ON WHITEWATER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers stepped up pressure on Democrats Tuesday to schedule 
congressional hearings on the Whitewater controversy, as special counsel Robert 
B. Fiske Jr. wound down the initial phase of his investigation of President 
Clinton's role in the failed Arkansas land venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending what had been an extended respite from GOP criticism over Whitewater, 
more than 90 House Republicans led by a Californian, Rep. John T. Doolittle 
(R-Rockland), introduced a resolution calling for concurrent hearings by five 
congressional committees. The hearings would begin no later than Aug. 15, the 
resolution states. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Republicans were threatening to force a vote on hearings before 
the end of the week if behind-the-scenes negotiations between party leaders 
fail to resolve a long-running partisan dispute over the timing and forum for a 
congressional investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP sources said that "some progress" was made after a meeting Monday between 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). But the two sides continued to disagree over ground rules. If no 
agreement is reached by today, the GOP sources said, Republicans might try to 
force a Whitewater vote before lawmakers leave town for a weeklong Memorial Day 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the House and the Senate voted last March to recommend that Congress 
conduct hearings on Whitewater, provided Democratic and Republican leaders 
could structure them in a way that did not interfere with Fiske's criminal 
investigation. Since then, Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of 
stalling in hopes that public interest in Whitewater would subside. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, several developments have given Clinton's GOP critics what 
they see as an opportunity to renew their calls for public hearings. One 
involves charges of sexual harassment filed against Clinton by Paula Corbin 
Jones, a former Arkansas state employee. Another is the anticipated indictment 
of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) on felony 
charges. Both situations, while unrelated to Whitewater, have provided GOP 
sharpshooters with new ammunition to use in their ethics attacks on Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Paula Jones thing makes Clinton more vulnerable on Whitewater, and vice 
versa, because they both address the character question," said one Republican 
leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, meanwhile, is nearing the end of the first phase of his investigation 
into the Whitewater Development Corp., in which Clinton and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton were partners, and its possible contribution to the failure of a 
Little Rock savings and loan. Fiske has repeatedly stated that, while he would 
prefer no public hearings at this stage, he would not object to a limited 
congressional inquiry once the first phase of his investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) plans to meet with Fiske Thursday to 
"sound him out" on possible hearings, a Democratic aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Doolittle and other Republicans charged that the Democrats still are 
playing for time, hoping that health care reform and other concerns once again 
will submerge questions about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two months have elapsed since the House passed" a resolution recommending 
Whitewater hearings and "those hearings have yet to materialize and no 
timetable has been set," Doolittle said, adding that, "it's time we do 
something about it."

JURISPRUDENCE; EX-TEAMSTER CHIEF'S LEGACY IS BIG TROUBLE FOR FAMILY; JACKIE 
PRESSER'S WIDOW ADMITS MISUSING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF 
$4.2-MILLION ESTATE. HIS CHILDREN FILE CIVIL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters President Jackie Presser was one of the nation's most controversial 
union chiefs when he died in 1988. At the time, he was under indictment on 
racketeering charges, a case his attorney had staved off by citing his role for 
more than a decade as a secret informant for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a dispute over his surprisingly large $4.2-million estate has surfaced in 
state court. It is Presser's ironic legacy: The case has divided his family and 
involves potential criminality on the part of his wife, Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
 The court proceedings have arisen from the lavish lifestyle that characterized 
the old-guard Teamster chieftain, and a widow who refused to change that style 
after he succumbed to brain cancer. Cynthia Presser -- his fifth wife -- has 
admitted misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the estate and 
violating her duties as its executor. 
</P>
<P>
 So blatant has been her conduct that a probate judge recently asked the 
Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office to investigate Cynthia Presser for possible 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The case occurs at a time when frugality in the nation's largest trade union 
is being stressed by a new Teamster president, Ron Carey, who was elected on 
his pledge to reduce spending, cut costs and stamp out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over the estate started with a civil proceeding filed by John R. 
Climaco, Jackie Presser's former attorney and confidant, and by Presser's two 
children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deposition filed in the case, Cynthia Presser said she has spent $369,227 
on clothes, decorating and furniture during her term as executor of Presser's 
estate. Another $225,000 went to an ex-husband and other relatives of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know these look like exorbitant expenses," she said in her sworn statement. 
"But my life with my late husband provided me a life like that, and I continued 
to live that life and that contributed to these expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was bequeathed a substantial sum by her late husband, Cynthia 
Presser acknowledged she went beyond her inheritance by dipping into funds that 
were set aside for her stepchildren, Gary and Bari Presser. 
</P>
<P>
 In her sworn statement, Cynthia Presser said her living expenses have averaged 
$10,000 a month. In addition, she said she bought a $10,000 diamond engagement 
ring for her son by a previous marriage to give his fiancee and purchased a 
$629,000 lakefront home for herself outside Cleveland. She told of buying a fur 
stole worth $3,000 in 1989 and spending $2,900 to have a larger closet built 
for her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She flew frequently to Arizona in the winter, she said. In addition, she gave 
untold thousands of dollars -- in outright gifts or loans -- to her parents, 
other relatives and friends, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the lifestyle the Pressers enjoyed, a one-time close associate of 
the late Teamster chief said in an interview: "They lived in a Washington condo 
paid for by the international union. It was fully furnished and decorated in 
style, along with fine china, silverware and crystal provided by the union. 
There were expensive paintings on the walls and other artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and Jackie got used to all-expense-paid vacations and frequent business 
trips to California or Florida in the winter. The union footed the bill for 
their accommodations at the finest hotels and resorts, and they were picked up 
by limousine anywhere their Teamsters' Gulfstream jet landed." 
</P>
<P>
 How did Jackie Presser amass an estate of more than $4 million while holding 
union posts his entire adult life? 
</P>
<P>
 Court records are silent on the matter, the ex-associate said. "Jackie spent 
union funds lavishly but was frugal with his own money. He had what amounted to 
an unlimited expense account and, therefore, could save most of his union 
salary, which was considerable." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years leading up to his death, Presser drew about $800,000 annually in 
pay. This included his $250,000 salary as general president of the Teamsters, 
as well as pay from union posts he held. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates said he also made a profit of more than $1 million from his 
investment in the 1970s in Cleveland's Front Row Theater. He earned no fees 
from the 10 years he served as a secret informant for the FBI, providing 
information on mobsters and Teamster rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The court records show that Cynthia Presser also is engaged in a legal dispute 
with current union officials over the whereabouts and ownership of some 
expensive furnishings that once adorned their Washington condo. She is facing 
allegations that she shipped many of these union-provided items to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 She agreed several months ago to pay $350,000 into Presser's children's trust 
funds, as well as $200,000 in overdue legal fees. But -- unable to do so -- she 
filed for personal bankruptcy and was removed as executor of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is facing possible indictment in state court on grounds that she 
embezzled more than $570,000.

HEALTH CARE; FEDERAL REFORMS PUT FUTURE OF LOUISIANA HOSPITAL IN DOUBT

 Past midnight in the crowded emergency room lobby of historic Charity 
Hospital, Marie Johnson is standing near a sign warning that guns, knives and 
other weapons are not allowed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only place I could go," said Johnson, 36, who works as a maid in 
a local hotel and makes less than $15,000 a year. "We don't have any money, and 
if you don't have money you don't have insurance. Charity is the only place 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had come to the hospital with her mother, who was experiencing 
dizziness. If any medical attention is necessary beyond a brief examination, 
Charity will provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's mother needed only a prescription. But others arriving that night at 
the hospital -- constructed when Huey Long, Louisiana's populist governor and 
senator of the 1930s, was in power -- were not as lucky. Some had gunshot or 
stab wounds. One man said he was HIV-positive and was coughing up blood. None 
would be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extraordinary place when you think about it," said John Salvaggio, 
vice chancellor for research at the nearby Tulane University Medical Center. "A 
hospital that is truly open to anyone and has been for decades now, long before 
all this talk about the Clinton health care plan." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is because of the push in Washington to pass some sort of health reform 
that many here are wondering about Charity's future, particularly given its 
ongoing funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of confusion right now," said Democratic state House Speaker 
John Alario. "Everyone knows that Charity needs money and upgraded facilities, 
but no one wants to do anything until they see what's going to happen with 
Clinton's program." 
</P>
<P>
 State health department figures illustrate Charity's importance: More than 25% 
of Louisianians are currently without health insurance, compared to 17% 
nationally, and up to 500,000 people a year are admitted to Charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely important institution to this state and will continue to 
be so despite its problems," said Arnold Lupin, a New Orleans physician who 
heads the Louisiana Health Care Authority, which operates Charity. "We've had 
funding and accreditation problems in the past, that's true, but we're working 
to correct those." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Charity treat almost exclusively the fastest-growing segment of 
the state's population -- the unemployed or underemployed living in poverty -- 
it has done so in a building so in need of structural repairs that one estimate 
said it could cost as much as $270 million to bring the hospital up to minimal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And Charity frequently has suffered from the prevailing political winds. 
</P>
<P>
 In a state where politics oftentimes is everything, populist leaders like Long 
and current Gov. Edwin W. Edwards have supported lavish programs for the 
hospital, while the more conservative reform governors and the Louisiana 
Legislature usually cut such spending. Last year, lawmakers stripped the 
hospital of more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Charity also frequently has come out on the losing side in its quest to retain 
its accreditation, an industry seal of approval that hospitals need if they 
expect to receive federal Medicaid and Medicare funding. Because of the 
deteriorating state of the building and the elusive funding necessary to 
maintain it, Charity has lost its accreditation four times since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lupin is optimistic about the hospital's future. "This is the last time 
we're going to have a problem with accreditation," he said of the decision 
several weeks ago by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations to accredit Charity for another three years, as long as the 
hospital makes at least $1.1 million in immediate improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupin said he is particularly hopeful about Charity's prospects in the wake of 
a decision by Edwards to purchase a newer hospital for Charity's use. 
</P>
<P>
 Charity "has always served those no one else would take in," Salvaggio said, 
stressing that the proposed upgrades won't matter unless the hospital's mission 
is maintained.

 A bacterium that eats human flesh in a form of "galloping gangrene" has 
reportedly killed at least five people, causing near-panic in an area of 
western England.British doctors believe a mutated form of the streptococcus 
bacterium, a usually harmless organism that can cause strep throat, is 
responsible. An epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said 
among the symptoms of infection by the bacterium is necrotizing fasciitis -- a 
condition that rapidly eats through fat and muscle. "This is not something that 
is untreatable," Dr. Benjamin Schwartz said. However, lawmakers from Gloucester 
said there was anxiety in the area about what one called a "galloping gangrene 
type of disease."

ARAFAT CANCELS ORDERS FROM ISRAELI OCCUPATION; MIDEAST: GAZA AND JERICHO REVERT 
TO LAWS THAT WERE IN EFFECT BEFORE 1967. PLO CHAIRMAN'S AUTHORITY IS 
QUESTIONED, BUT PALESTINIANS HAIL MOVE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and head of 
the Palestinians' interim government, Tuesday canceled most of the military 
orders issued by Israel over its 27-year occupation of the Gaza Strip and this 
West Bank town. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that both asserted Palestinian authority in the two regions and 
promised to affect everything from retail sales to taxation, from traffic 
regulations to street crime, Arafat restored all the laws in force prior to the 
1967 Middle East War and Israel's capture of Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israeli officials questioned Arafat's authority in issuing so 
sweeping an order, saying that he needs their approval for all legislative 
actions, Palestinians hailed the move as another step in their liberation from 
an occupation that pervaded almost all aspects of their lives for a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Establishing our own laws is an essential part of our emancipation," said 
Saeb Erekat, a political scientist nominated to serve on the interim 
Palestinian Authority. "Legally, most of the 2,500 military orders issued by 
the Israelis became null and void with their withdrawal last week, and so 
Arafat re-established the legal framework for everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority, which will administer the Gaza Strip and eventually 
most of the West Bank under the autonomy agreement with Israel, will soon be 
faced with the task of adopting a basic law and then extensive civil and 
criminal codes after elections planned for October. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the military regulations that have governed life here were preserved 
as part of the agreements establishing Palestinian self-government and the 
economic relations between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat restored 1967 Jordanian law in Jericho and Egyptian law in Gaza, 
both to provide a familiar legal framework for the start of Palestinian 
autonomy and to "give people the sense of being masters in their own home," 
Erekat said. "It's better to have some legislative gaps than to have Israeli 
military orders plugging them." 
</P>
<P>
 Freij abu Midan, a Gaza lawyer and another member of the Palestinian 
Authority, described the move as "the first step toward consolidating our 
national authority on the ground in Gaza and Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 But Abu Midan added that "every day will bring scores of new questions, 
especially to the police, for which the law will have no immediate answer. We 
are feeling our way legally as well as politically." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, the Israeli military commander in the West Bank closed 
Jericho for 24 hours to all but its 15,000 residents in cooperation with the 
new Palestinian police commander, who reportedly asked for a "breather" to get 
a firmer grip on the town and to brief his officers on regulations governing 
Israelis traveling through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel contends that its agreement with the PLO enables Jewish settlers to 
carry weapons in Palestinian-governed areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
Palestinians assert that Israelis coming into the autonomous areas may not 
carry weapons, and Palestinian police in Jericho briefly detained five armed 
settlers Tuesday before releasing them, reportedly with apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, visiting new Israeli positions along the border 
with Gaza, at once praised the cooperation between Palestinian police and his 
forces in the hand-over of the region and again warned Arafat that Israel will 
not turn over administration of more of the West Bank until it sees how 
self-government works in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Still angered by the fiery rhetoric of Arafat's recent speeches, Rabin told 
reporters at Nahal Oz on the Gaza border: 
</P>
<P>
 "We will insist that it be clear the continuation of the process beyond Gaza 
and Jericho will be tied to the Palestinians' proving their ability to fulfill 
their commitments in Gaza and in Jericho and to a pointed reaffirmation of this 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 In taking his first close look at Gaza since Israel handed the territory over 
to the Palestinians, Rabin stood a few yards from a sign identifying the area 
as Palestinian-ruled and informing Israelis they need special permits to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 After touring the fence of electronic sensors going up between Israel and the 
Gaza Strip, Rabin said he was pleased about the way the turnover had been 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had serious fears about everything relating to the way . . . in which 
things would be done," Rabin said. " . . . (But) on the main issues a 
relationship was created . . . that allowed for the correct, smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an opening that gives hope, allows an opportunity for the 
transition . . . to orderly control by the Palestinians if they indeed fully 
use their capabilities."

 Officials said Tuesday that 250 Muslims died in a stampede a day earlier 
during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, but witnesses, doctors and a senior 
Asian diplomat put the death toll above 1,000. The faithful were on their way 
to take part in a symbolic stoning of the devil when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pilgrims died when they were knocked off a crowded overpass. Others were 
trampled to death. In the panic, some survived by tying their clothes into 
ropes and escaping to the ground below. 
</P>
<P>
 People "were yelling and screaming for mercy from Allah," Osman Taj, a pilgrim 
from Sudan, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of pilgrims, jammed together on the pedestrian overpass, were 
inching toward the sacred cavern where the ritual stoning takes place when a 
new wave of people came surging through, Pakistani pilgrim Talaat Sharif said.

 Two jumbo jets, one from Los Angeles, came within seconds of colliding head-on 
28,665 feet over the Pacific Ocean after an air traffic controller mistakenly 
put them on a collision course, Japanese aviation officials said. Northwest 
Airlines Flight 6 from Tokyo to Chicago avoided the disaster Sunday by veering 
out of the way of oncoming Cathay Pacific Airways Flight 881 from Los Angeles 
en route to Hong Kong, the officials said.The planes were 198 miles off the 
coast of the Japanese island of Hokkaido. In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific 
spokesman C.F. Kwan denied that the two planes had come within a few hundred 
yards of each other. Kwan said automatic warning systems worked in both 
aircraft when they were 40 miles apart. The Cathay Pacific plane's system 
instructed the pilot to ascend, the Northwest system told its pilot to descend, 
and both pilots obeyed, he added. The Northwest jet was carrying 248 passengers 
and a crew of 18; the Cathay plane had 389 on board.

RUSSIA TO JOIN NATO PARTNERSHIP; MILITARY: AFTER A SERIES OF FLIP-FLOPS, MOSCOW 
SAYS IT WILL ACCEPT AUXILIARY STATUS IN WESTERN ALLIANCE. BUT IT HINTS AT NEW 
DEMANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Russia said Tuesday that it will join NATO's new Partnership for Peace program 
for former East Bloc countries despite its earlier reservations, but it hinted 
that it still may seek some political concessions in return. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers, Russian 
defense chief Pavel S. Grachev told reporters that President Boris N. Yeltsin 
"instructed me that I should make it clear that Russia will join the . . . 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that Russia will demand a formal side agreement providing it 
with more status than other countries in the program, as Moscow had suggested 
earlier. "We are not going to set forth any conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Western officials continued to be wary, mindful of earlier indications 
that Moscow would demand that NATO agree to some sort of new protocol that 
would give Moscow more authority beyond the Partnership for Peace program. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters after Grachev's news 
conference that he still does not know precisely what demands Moscow will make. 
"I don't know anything more than you heard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev's appearance followed a series of Russian flip-flops over the issue of 
whether to join the program. Moscow had been expected to apply for membership 
last month but balked in protest over NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian defense minister is scheduled to provide details today about what 
demands, if any, Moscow will make. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of Russia's membership is important because its establishment of a 
formal relationship with NATO is viewed by the West as an important step in 
strengthening ties between the two former foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western officials fear that if Moscow chooses not to join the program, it 
could bolster the influence of hard-liners in Russia who want the government to 
keep the West at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts believe the issue of special status is mainly symbolic and 
that Moscow is looking primarily for a political gesture that will help counter 
complaints by nationalists that post-Cold War Russia is not getting due 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev appeared to be working to that end Tuesday when he made a point of 
declaring that the NATO ministers had been "listening to me carefully" and were 
"sympathetic" to Russia's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace program was adopted at a NATO summit in January as a 
way to strengthen ties with former East Bloc countries by giving them a sort of 
auxiliary status involving consultations and some joint exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, 18 former Soviet satellites and republics, from Poland to 
Kazakhstan, had formally joined the program, and the Netherlands has announced 
that it will hold military exercises with the Poles this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The West's major objection to providing any special status for the Russians is 
a fear by some other former East Bloc countries that Moscow will dominate the 
new program -- eventually regaining control over their affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Western and former East Bloc countries also are fearful of Moscow's 
recent assertions that Russia should have the right to send troops to former 
Soviet republics, such as Georgia, in which large numbers of Russians live. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and other key NATO ministers made it clear Tuesday that they recognize 
that Russia's relationship with NATO is likely to be broader than that of other 
countries because of its size and the fact that it is a nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia and NATO need a solid partnership," German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe said. "Russia must be treated and perceived to be treated as a great 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sergio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general, told reporters that the 
Western ministers had already decided that Moscow's membership in the program 
must adhere to the same rules as do other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Grachev and the ministers reach agreement in principle today, 
officials say it is unlikely that NATO will act on the application before early 
June, when NATO's foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Istanbul, Turkey.

OVERHAUL OF FEDERAL POLICE STARTS IN MEXICO 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just 10 days after taking office, Mexico's new attorney general announced a 
radical reorganization of the Federal Judicial Police on Tuesday, starting with 
the firing of five top commanders and the elimination of special details within 
the force. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions were taken, according to a statement from Atty. Gen. Humberto 
Benitez's office, "to make the force more efficient and to avoid illegal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican police at all levels have come under increasing pressure in the past 
year to restore public order in the wake of the unsolved assassinations of a 
Roman Catholic cardinal, the leading presidential candidate and the Tijuana 
police chief, in addition to a wave of kidnapings and audacious gun battles 
between rival narcotics gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez cracked down especially hard on the department in charge of 
investigations, eliminating it and firing its five commanders.

NEW RUSSIAN ECONOMIC REFORMS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia is entering a new phase in its economic reforms and will now 
concentrate on fighting its disastrous industrial slump and bringing order to 
its tax system, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call this the beginning of the stabilization period," Economics 
Minister Alexander N. Shokhin said, "although the statistics don't bear that 
out yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics show that in Russia's stumbling transition from centrally 
planned socialism to a market-driven economy, it is managing to dampen 
inflation -- the main task of recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 But its industry is on the verge of collapse, with production plummeting 25% 
in the first quarter compared to last year; its tax system is a mess, and it is 
desperately short of investment money. The Economics Ministry has warned that 
if unemployment mounts, it could lead to a "social explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of pleas for change from factory directors and pressure from his 
industry-oriented prime minister, President Boris N. Yeltsin has made the 
troubled economy his focus in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 The results appeared Monday. Six presidential decrees rolled off the presses, 
all of them aimed at bringing some order to the Russian economy, at introducing 
enough control so that, as presidential adviser Alexander Livshits put it, 
"there will be a little less robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 The decrees introduce harsh penalties for tax evaders and require factories to 
register all their bank accounts if they want to receive government subsidies. 
They also provide a whole panoply of ways of controlling factories' finances 
better while lifting some of the crushing tax burden from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of measures taken by the government have allowed the economy to be 
stabilized to some extent," Deputy Economics Minister Sergei Vasilyev 
optimistically told a conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 One decree also sharply reduces export tariffs on oil and other goods and does 
away with the system of special export licenses that had provided the basis for 
massive red tape and bureaucratic corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important decree of the package is the decree on doing away with 
export quotas and licenses," said Mikhail Berger, economics columnist for the 
newspaper Izvestia, "because it will destroy the entire structure of massive 
bribe-taking, a structure that includes armies of corrupt officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Shokhin said obstacles to the export of oil and other fuel had to be lifted 
because the industry is on the verge of a shutdown; domestic prices have risen 
so much that demand for oil has dropped sharply. Export, meanwhile, was limited 
by licensing, so producers had nowhere to sell their oil and were beginning to 
stop drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to come are promised presidential decrees on procedures for going 
bankrupt -- Yeltsin is finally beginning to accept that monstrous loss-makers 
must be allowed to go under -- and on limiting salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian media largely welcomed the decrees, with the Kommersant business 
newspaper trumpeting that "Boris Yeltsin has once again undertaken reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin enjoyed another economic victory this month when Parliament gave 
preliminary approval to a relatively tight budget proposed by his government 
for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he needs more success in the actual economy. According to a recent 
national survey, more than 80% of Russians said their salaries don't cover 
their expenses, and 65% said they were financially better off five years ago.

RWANDAN CLASHES HALTED AFTER U.N. ENVOY ARRIVES

 Rebel and army gunners clashed in Rwanda's capital Tuesday despite a 
cease-fire but stopped the shelling shortly after a U.N. special envoy arrived 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The envoy, Iqbal Riza of Pakistan, flew into Kigali's airport Tuesday morning 
and moved into the city in an armored personnel carrier amid gunfire and 
exploding mortar shells. 
</P>
<P>
 The guns fell mostly silent after Riza reached U.N. headquarters. U.N. 
officials pleaded with both sides to extend the shaky cease-fire a day to allow 
Riza to complete talks with government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials had requested a truce for Monday and Tuesday to allow Riza to 
meet with army and government officials about U.N. plans to take complete 
control of the airport and send 5,500 new peacekeepers to Rwanda. There are 
about 450 peacekeepers now in the Central African country. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side responded to requests to extend the truce beyond its 6 p.m. 
deadline. U.N. officials said both sides had used the cease-fire to prepare for 
new hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people, fearful the rebels would resume their offensive to take 
Kigali, took advantage of the lull to flee the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Abdul Kabia said Riza held discussions with rebel leaders 
Monday at their stronghold in Mulindi, just south of the Ugandan border. Riza 
met Tuesday with the commanders of the army and was scheduled to meet with 
ministers from the interim government today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kigali's airport is key to Riza's mission because the United Nations plans to 
use it for relief flights and as a staging area for bringing in peacekeepers. 
However, his mission appeared to have been complicated when rebels overran the 
airport and the adjacent Kanombe army camp Sunday.

 California should increase education funding, make teaching a higher-paying,

the education summit hosted in February by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's report Tuesday called for an increase in the state's per-pupil 
spending to at least the national average within five years, using state and 
local taxes.California spends about $4,660 annually for each student, below the 
national average of $5,805. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown staff member estimated that the increase would cost between $5 billion 
and $6 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations included increasing schools' use of technology in 
teaching, preparing students to enter the work force after high school 
graduation, providing more health and social services on campuses, raising 
academic standards and making schools safer.

HOUSE BACKS C-17 PROJECT, IN BOOST FOR SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision crucial to the future of the C-17 cargo jet program, the House 
voted, 330 to 100, Tuesday to authorize production of six McDonnell Douglas 
C-17 planes, restoring production of two aircraft that had been deleted in a 
previous committee action. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 6,000 jobs in Southern California would have been lost if the two 
additional aircraft were not restored. In addition, the House action blunted 
efforts to force the Pentagon to buy existing commercial jets as an alternative 
to the C-17, which would have seriously undercut the future of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Undersecretary Rudy de Leon said in an interview that the House vote 
was an important endorsement of the Pentagon's plan to put McDonnell Douglas on 
probation and measure over the next two years whether the company can correct 
longstanding problems at its Long Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to put the C-17 on a solid profile so we can judge whether 
McDonnell Douglas can produce at cost and on schedule," de Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders for the extra aircraft came on an amendment offered by a California 
congressman, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey). A member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, she has lobbied for the planes this week with help from 
McDonnell Douglas, organized labor, defense officials and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The House vote also marked one of the first times that the California 
congressional delegation formed a voting bloc to support a defense program in 
the state, a major departure from past years when weapons programs attracted 
weak support from California Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-17 is assembled at McDonnell Douglas' massive complex in Long Beach, 
supporting 10,000 jobs at the plant and another 8,000 at subcontractors around 
Southern California. Nationally, about 30,000 jobs are tied to the aircraft's 
production, now the Pentagon's largest program. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who overcame opposition to the C-17 from Armed Services Chairman 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), said that the House vote represents an important 
victory for California's tattered defense industry and makes sense for national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-17 has long been controversial. McDonnell is an estimated $1.6 billion 
over budget on the aircraft program and has experienced a long series of 
embarrassing technical problems, including the failure of C-17 wings to meet 
strength requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a complex settlement dealing with those problems, the Pentagon said it 
would put McDonnell Douglas on probation for two years but agreed to increase 
production of the C-17 aircraft so the company could prove that it had improved 
its efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 With Dellums support, the Armed Services Committee voted earlier this month to 
cut the Pentagon's request for six aircraft to four and ordered that the money 
be used to begin purchases of an existing cargo jet, such as the Boeing 747, 
the Lockheed C-5B or the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision would have derailed the settlement and possibly plunged the 
Defense Department and McDonnell Douglas into a protracted legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harman amendment Tuesday, however, did not include $348 million needed 
under the settlement to pay McDonnell for its claims against the government. It 
also did not include legislative language approving the settlement. De Leon 
said that those issues will be dealt with in Senate legislation and in 
conference later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the House rejected an amendment that would have delayed the next 
round of military base closings by two years.

IRAQ ROCKETS BATHED U.S. TROOPS IN CHEMICALS, SENATOR REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. troops were directly exposed to chemical agents, mostly from rocket 
attacks, on more than a dozen occasions during the Gulf War, a congressional 
report claims in concluding that such agents are a cause of illnesses 
afflicting thousands of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160-page report, to be released today by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. 
(D-Mich.), includes testimony from 30 Gulf War veterans who say that apparent 
Iraqi missile attacks were followed by chemical agent detectors sounding, the 
air filling with fumes and burning sensations on their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all now suffer from the debilitating symptoms of what has come to be 
known as Persian Gulf Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, holds hearings today with 
Pentagon and intelligence agency officials on the report. Defense officials say 
there is no evidence of Iraqi chemical or biological attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes that, despite Pentagon claims to the contrary, "there is 
substantial evidence supporting claims that U.S. servicemen and women were 
exposed to low-level chemical warfare agents and possibly biological agents and 
toxins from a variety of sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Riegle said his yearlong investigation included interviews with 600 American 
troops, many of whom corroborated reports of chemical exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 One soldier stationed in Saudi Arabia reported a loud explosion early in the 
morning of Jan. 17, 1991, followed by a sounding of alarms and a burning 
sensation on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later in another part of Saudi Arabia, witnesses reported a sharp 
odor of ammonia after a "real bad explosion" and more alarms going off. 
</P>
<P>
 A soldier based near King Fahd International Airport on Jan. 20, 1991, said he 
saw what he believed to be a Scud missile shot down by a Patriot missile. He 
experienced "a very strong raunchy taste, like very bitter burnt toast" in his 
mouth. He now suffers from bleeding, dizziness, hair loss, joint pain, insomnia 
and blurred vision, symptoms common to many returning from the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the numerous chemical alerts, troops were told by their commanding 
officers that the explosions came from sonic booms.

GOP WINS LATE REP. NATCHER'S SEAT IN LONG-DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A conservative Republican won a special election for the seat of the late Rep. 
William H. Natcher on Tuesday in a Kentucky district that had sent Democrats to 
Congress for 129 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second such victory for the GOP this year, and Republicans were 
quick to see the results as a referendum on President Clinton. Earlier this 
month in Oklahoma, Republican Frank D. Lucas won the seat of Democratic Rep. 
Glenn English, who retired. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kentucky's 2nd District, spanning central and western portions of the 
state, Ron Lewis, a minister and owner of a fundamentalist Christian bookstore, 
benefited from an outpouring of national Republican money and expertise. His 
media blitz portrayed Democrat Joe Prather as a clone of Clinton. Prather, a 
former legislator and state party chairman, emphasized his experience in 
politics and his role in electing two governors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I went through the district there were people upset," Lewis said 
in acknowledging victory. "They actually were mad . . . . They felt like they 
needed to do something and say something that would change lives." 
</P>
<P>
 With 100% of precincts reporting, Lewis had 40,040 votes, or 55%, and Prather 
had 32,595, or 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional 
Committee, declared that the results are "a big defeat for the President and 
the Democrats in Congress, and a warning message to Democrats that 1994 is 
going to be a Republican year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis becomes the first Republican ever sent to Washington from the district. 
He will fill out the remaining months of Natcher's term and then run again in 
November for a full term. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Arnett, executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said he 
wasn't surprised by Lewis' victory because of the influx of national Republican 
and special-interest money. "We'll get the seat back in November," Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another election Tuesday, Idaho Atty. Gen. Larry EchoHawk won the 
Democratic nomination in his bid to become the nation's first Native American 
governor. EchoHawk's likely opponent for November was former Lt. Gov. Phil 
Batt. Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus is retiring.

$2 MILLION FOR KING HOLIDAY PANEL BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation authorizing the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Commission to spend 
$2 million over five years and directing it to use the holiday to promote 
community service passed the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The House approved a similar bill on a routine voice vote in March, but the 
Senate debated it for two days as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) pushed an amendment 
that would have stripped the commission of its federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate defeated Helms' amendment, 70 to 28, and then passed the bill, 94 
to 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the money in this bill . . . better spent on a King parade in Atlanta 
(and) having the King commission staff travel first class on airlines . . . or 
is it better spent on the war on drugs or cleaning up crime in public housing?" 
Helms asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by Sens. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) and Carol Moseley-Braun 
(D-Ill.), also directs the commission to link celebration of King's birth with 
community service projects, such as cleaning up parks.

SUIT CLAIMS CHURCH KNEW OF ALLEGED MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two attorneys claim Roman Catholic Church officials knew that three priests 
had molested nine youngsters in incidents dating back to the 1960s but failed 
to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine alleged victims, now men, filed a lawsuit Monday in San Francisco 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal injury suit named Msgr. Patrick O'Shea of St. Cecelia's parish in 
San Francisco; the Rev. Austin Peter Keegan, formerly of St. Eugene's parish in 
Santa Rosa, and the Rev. Gary Timmons, founder and counselor at Camp St. 
Michael in Mendocino County. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are seeking unspecified damages against the priests and from 
Archbishop John Quinn and the archdiocese of San Francisco; Santa Rosa Bishop 
G. Patrick Ziemann and former Bishop Mark Hurley; the Santa Rosa diocese, and 
Robert Bailey, director of Camp St. Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys Maja Ramsey and Mike Meadows say they have evidence that the church 
knew the men were abused as youngsters, failed to report the incidents to 
authorities and urged people to remain quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in Mendocino County and San Francisco are reviewing possible 
criminal charges against two of the priests. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco church officials said Keegan has been listed as an inactive 
priest since 1976 and could not be located for comment. Timmons has been placed 
in an unnamed residential care home, Ziemann said. O'Shea has been placed on 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the archdiocese of San Francisco and Archbishop John R. Quinn 
declined comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Shea's attorney, James P. Collins, said: "There is no merit to the 
allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Pavelka accused Keegan of throwing him to the ground, removing his 
clothes and fondling and molesting him at the church school and rectory, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Cubero said O'Shea fondled him in 1969 during a camping trip to Lake 
Berryessa in Napa County. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco police are investigating allegations that O'Shea molested 11 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmons was relieved of his duties as pastor of St. Bernard's Church in Eureka 
in February after two men came forward with claims that he had molested them at 
a summer camp nearly two decades ago.

UNIVERSITY MURAL OF MALCOLM X TO BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco State University's president on Tuesday ordered the removal of a 
mural honoring Malcolm X that depicts Stars of David with skulls and 
crossbones, dollar signs and the phrase "African Blood." 
</P>
<P>
 President Robert Corrigan said his strong convictions about the need to combat 
anti-Semitism led him to demand the removal of the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to allow the mural to remain as it is, we would be contributing to 
a hostile campus environment, one which says to students: 'We tolerate 
intolerance; we are silent in the face of bigotry,' " Corrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Union Governing Board on Tuesday failed twice to vote on whether 
to continue displaying the artwork, which was defaced last week and later 
repainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Senay Dennis, the artist who created the 10-foot-square mural, insists his 
work is not meant to offend Jews but instead represents Malcolm X's anti-Israel 
sentiments.

GUNMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ASSAULT DURING MOVIE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A part-time security guard with a history of emotional problems has pleaded 
guilty to firing a handgun and wounding a woman as she watched the movie 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 James Kirby pleaded guilty to assault Monday in connection with the Jan. 6 
shooting of Ellen Campbell as she sat in front of him at a downtown theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should go to prison," said Campbell, who is recuperating from the 
bullet wound to her back. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plea bargain, Superior Court Judge John Thompson will decide Kirby's 
sentence July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Raymond Vecchio, who contends that the shooting was 
accidental, said he will ask the judge to grant probation to Kirby, 46. But 
prosecutor Daniel Lamborn said Kirby deserves a prison sentence of up to nine 
years. He has a history of threatening behavior, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Kirby told police that his handgun discharged during an 
emotional scene from the Oscar-winning movie, during which Nazi soldiers were 
chasing Jews.

ASSEMBLY BILL WOULD MAKE GRAFFITI A PADDLING OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill requiring juvenile graffiti vandals to be punished with up to 10 whacks 
of a wooden paddle by a parent was introduced Tuesday by an Orange County 
assemblyman, who declared that the public is "sick and tired" of the way such 
offenders are "coddled" by the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to take pride in your neighborhood when everything you see is 
covered with graffiti," said Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). "That is why 
paddling is so important." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy said public opinion polls show overwhelming support for his idea. Those 
polls were taken in connection with a highly publicized case in which an 
American teen-ager was caned in Singapore for spray-painting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy also said he has received about 200 letters and telephone calls from 
around the country supporting his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti abatement cost Orange County $1.2 million in Santa Ana last year and 
the Orange County Flood Control District spent $500,000, according to Conroy, 
who said the state spent more than $30 million on graffiti removal last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's measure, AB 150X, ran into immediate opposition from Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at a Capitol news conference about the bill, Brown said he would not 
vote for the legislation. "A harsh penalty must be imposed," Brown said, "but I 
don't think it has to be a whipping." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he does not believe that the Assembly Public Safety Committee, the 
first stop for Conroy's bill, will agree with Conroy's views on paddling. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Conroy, any juvenile convicted of graffiti vandalism would be 
given four to 10 whacks with a wooden paddle in addition to any other sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The paddle would be made of three-quarter-inch hardwood, 18 inches long and 
six inches wide. The whacks would be administered on the outside of clothes, 
not bare buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The paddling would be administered by the minor's parent. If the parent 
declines or paddles too lightly, the judge can order a bailiff to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy said paddling would survive a court test and not be declared cruel and 
unusual punishment.

REPEAT RAPIST RETURNED TO FACE O.C. MURDER RAP; CRIME: WOMAN WHO REPORTED 1993 
RAPE SAYS LAST WEEK'S VICTIM WOULD BE ALIVE IF PROSECUTORS HAD PRESSED CHARGES.

<P>
 A paroled three-time rapist was brought back to Orange County from his 
Northern California hide-out Tuesday to face charges that he murdered a 
23-year-old Huntington Beach woman he met last Thursday at a local nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 100 onlookers jeered and booed as Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 
28, of Orange shuffled off a chartered, twin-engined airplane at Fullerton 
Municipal Airport, wearing a jail-issued jumpsuit and shackles, and was guided 
to a waiting patrol car by the Orange police who had gone to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Huntington Beach woman who says she was the victim of a fourth, 
unpunished rape by Morgan said Tuesday that last week's slaying would never 
have occurred had Orange County prosecutors been more vigorous in pursuing her 
case. "I feel like somebody is dead because of this," said the woman, who asked 
that her identity not be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was arrested by Huntington Beach police in 1993 after the woman 
reported being raped, but the Orange County district attorney's office declined 
to take the rape case to court, preferring instead to let parole officials send 
him back to prison for the remaining 12 months of his sentence for his third 
rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has angered many -- including Morgan's other victims and some police 
officers -- who say he is a sexual predator who took advantage of a criminal 
justice system that seemed to give him the benefit of the doubt at nearly every 
turn. It has also renewed calls for tougher punishment for sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to elude a statewide manhunt that was launched after the murder was 
discovered last Friday, Morgan fled over the weekend to the small Northern 
California town of Quincy, where he had gone into hiding with an old girlfriend 
and a former cellmate from Folsom State Prison, both of whom were taken into 
custody for harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is formally arraigned in court today, Morgan could be facing a capital 
murder charge, if prosecutors have determined that the 23-year-old woman he is 
accused of murdering was also raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors have declined to say whether they have evidence that 
Leanora Annette Wong was the victim of a sexual assault before she was savagely 
beaten to death at the rear of a parking lot across the street from the Orange 
nightclub where she went with a girlfriend Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne said Morgan has been linked to the crime by 
fingerprints and witnesses who saw him with the victim. He said a video 
security camera near the club also captured some information that might be 
helpful, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Mason, co-coordinator of the Newport Beach chapter of NOW, said the 
whole case "makes me so sick. Sex crimes against women are not taken 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 But one woman who plans to remain on Morgan's side is Sonya Marvin, 22, of 
Quincy, Calif., whose postcard inviting Morgan to visit her in Quincy was found 
in his Orange apartment and gave police the clue that led to his capture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him. That's all you need to know," blurted Marvin, as she was released 
on her own recognizance from a Quincy jail Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, speaking through the screen door at the white clapboard home where she 
allegedly helped hide Morgan, Marvin said she could not believe the charges 
against Morgan. No, he never struck her. Yes, he was always kind to her. No, he 
never showed signs that he preyed on women. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had even talked of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had no idea Morgan tried to evade police and would not discuss 
the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested was Marvin's brother-in-law, Travis Burhop, 21, who was Morgan's 
prison cellmate. Marvin said he is wrongly being dragged into the case. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and Morgan have been in close contact since meeting about a year 
ago. She and her sister, Sabrina, visited Morgan and his cellmate in prison. 
Sonya Marvin said she once visited Morgan in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by those who know her as a "churchgoing, good kid," Marvin said she 
is "scared and confused" but has no plans to abandon Morgan. She said she loves 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of what happens, you can't turn your back on love. You can't. I'm 
going to stand by him," she said, adding, "But I'll take care of myself, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's history of sexual assaults dates back to 1984, when he pleaded guilty 
to two unrelated rape cases, one a rape involving "force and fear," and a 
second that was reduced to a statutory rape charge of unlawful sex with a 
minor, because the victim was 16 years old, as was the first victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allowed Morgan to plead guilty to less serious charges in the 
second case after questions were raised about their ability to win a conviction 
at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was again convicted on a reduced charge of statutory rape in 1991, 
after being arrested for raping and beating a 16-year-old La Palma teen after 
meeting her at a party several months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The system worked to Morgan's benefit again in March, 1993, when he was 
arrested on the complaint of the Huntington Beach woman, who told police that 
Morgan had handcuffed her to a tree in a public park and raped her. Instead of 
charging Morgan with the rape -- which could have brought him a 12-year prison 
term because of his previous convictions -- Orange County prosecutors elected 
to let parole officials send him back to prison to complete the unfinished 12 
months of his third rape sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Middleton, who made the decision not to prosecute 
in the 1993 case, said Tuesday that rape cases are among the most difficult to 
prosecute. The defense typically makes an issue of the victim's credibility 
when the defendant claims sex was voluntary -- as Morgan did. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Morgan's first victims in the early 1980s was a former girlfriend who 
acknowledged having consensual sex with him previously. In the case of the 1993 
arrest, the victim willingly accepted a ride in Morgan's car, drank beer with 
him in a public park, and the two took turns lying with their heads in one 
another's lap before the alleged rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such circumstances, "there is automatically a question for the jury 
whether she is credible or truthful," Middleton said, adding that Morgan's 
background would likely be barred from coming before a jury as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we do not believe these women, but we have to analyze this on a 
case-by-case basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said prosecutors will reopen the 1993 case for a possible criminal 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who has authored "one strike" 
legislation to put first-time violent sex offenders away for 25 years to life, 
said habitual sex criminals like Morgan can rarely be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, not all, of those who commit serious sex crimes simply must be taken 
off the street, where the question of parole would never be an issue," she 
said. "I believe a tragedy like this might never have happened if we had ('one 
strike' legislation)."

SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE FALLS IN O.C. AND STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mirroring a statewide trend, Orange County's high school dropout rate 
continued to fall last year, but most local districts -- including the county's 
largest -- saw increases in their dropout rates from the previous year, new 
data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 3,022 students in Orange County's Class of 1993 left school before 
graduation day; that is 10.8% of the total, which is just over half of what it 
was in 1986, when the state began keeping track. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the rate is 15.3% -- down from 16.5% last year and 25% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Satisfied customers keep coming back," Orange County Supt. John F. Dean said. 
"But I'm not going to stop until it's 0%. I want every single kid in this 
county to graduate from high school. We're trying to convince every student 
that he or she controls their own destiny -- more of them are learning all the 
time that the message is 'Stay in School.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to a state Department of Education report scheduled for release 
today, Orange County now has a lower dropout rate than all but 21 of 
California's 58 counties. And only three of Orange County's districts -- Santa 
Ana, Orange Unified and Tustin Unified -- had higher dropout rates than the 
state average for the Class of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the Class of 1993 lost 20.4% of its students, and the 
state's largest district, Los Angeles Unified, had a dropout rate of 29.1%, the 
state's data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, dropout rates declined this year for every ethnic group except 
Pacific Islanders. For the first time, Latinos have a higher dropout rate 
(22.3%) than African Americans (22.1%), but both groups have enjoyed a steady 
fall in the dropout rate since 1986. Asian Americans statewide have an 8.2% 
dropout rate and Native Americans have an 18.3% dropout rate, the data shows. 
(Comparable data for Orange County was not available.) 
</P>
<P>
 Boys are more likely to quit school in California than girls, according to the 
data, which shows a 16.6% male dropout rate compared to a 13.9% rate for 
females. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is a tremendous number of people in California working 
incredibly hard to improve what's going on in public schools, and they are 
doing it despite incredible odds," said William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The state calculates dropout rate for a graduating class by looking at a 
three-year trend of students leaving school in 10th, 11th and 12th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Orange County, eight of the 15 districts that include high schools had 
more dropouts in the Class of 1993 than 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest rate came in the county's largest district, Santa Ana Unified, 
where dropouts shot up after several years of steady decline. With 680 dropouts 
in the Class of 1993, Santa Ana has a 22.9% dropout rate, up from 16.2% last 
year but far from the district's 41.8% dropout rate in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is steadily downward. Although the rate is up a little from last 
year, it really is a part of a continuing downward slope," Santa Ana Unified 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. "We're certainly headed in the right direction 
and we know that we need to continue in that direction. We're not through yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Supt. Rudy M. Castruita praised the district's at-risk youth, 
stay-in-school and volunteer mentor programs for bringing dropouts down over 
the past few years, but said the ailing economy increases pressure on poor 
students to leave school early and go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working real hard to keep the rate down," Castruita said. "I don't 
know why it's jumped up. We'll have to take a real serious look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Santa Ana, the largest increases in Orange County came in tiny 
Brea-Olinda Unified and Laguna Beach Unified. While the 1993 rates show huge 
hikes from 1992 -- Brea-Olinda more than doubled from 3.5% to 7.4% and Laguna 
jumped from 3.4% to 6.1% -- the actual number of dropouts remains small: 29 in 
Brea-Olinda and 11 in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure why it is," Laguna Beach Supt. Paul M. Possemato said. "With so 
few kids, there are times when some particular happenstance occurs and we lose 
three or four and the rate shoots up. It's always a concern to us -- any kid 
dropping out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Irvine Unified cut its dropout rate to just a third of what 
it was in 1992, and now enjoys the county's lowest rate, 3.2%. "It's great to 
be last," said Supt. David E. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Other successes came in two of the county's most urban areas, Anaheim and 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Garden Grove Unified had the county's highest dropout rate, 17.7%; 
now the district is exactly even with the county rate of 10.8%, ranking fourth 
among the 15 districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Union High School District, once second only to Santa Ana in 
dropouts, now has a lower rate than all but five Orange County districts, with 
7.1% of the Class of 1993 leaving school early. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Supt. Cynthia F. Grennan credited her district's flexible alternative 
high school program with helping more and more students graduate each year. The 
storefront schools are open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. each day, plus Saturday 
mornings, allowing students to pursue employment or other responsibilities 
while earning a diploma largely through independent study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can accommodate them anytime," Grennan said. There's really not an excuse 
of 'I can only come to school in the morning' or 'I can only come to school in 
the evening. We say, 'Well, that's fine kid, come on down!' 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are seeing that we're not going to pick at them all the time," she 
explained. "If they can come for a few solid hours we'll move them as fast as 
we can. We're cheering them on." 
</P>
<P>
 When contrasted with other states, California still has far to go in solving 
dropout problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 Census data, 11.2% of 16- to 19-year-olds nationwide left 
school without earning a diploma; for California, the number was 14.3%, making 
it 49th, ahead of just Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the one-year dropout rate, California lost 5.6% of its students in 
1992 while the national average for that year -- the latest available -- was 
4.4%. In 1993, California's one-year dropout rate fell slightly, to 5.2%.

 Orange County's overall high school dropout rate continued to decline last 
year, mirroring a statewide trend. Nevertheless, more than half of the 
districts in the county had rising dropout rates from 1992 to 1993. A 
district-by-district look: 06,31,07,07,07,10,10 No. of dropouts % change

DENNY'S RESTAURANTS SETTLE BIAS SUITS FOR $54 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. government officials and civil rights advocates, hailing a "new 
partnership" dedicated to weeding out racism in commercial establishments, 
announced a record $54.4-million discrimination settlement with the Denny's 
restaurant chain Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, which earmarks $28 million for victims of discrimination at 
California Denny's restaurants, closes the book on two class-action lawsuits 
that became a modern version of the lunch-counter protests of the civil rights 
movement's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the help and cooperation of private counsel, the Justice Department and 
Denny's have entered into the largest, most-sweeping nationwide settlement of a 
public accommodations case in history," said Deval L. Patrick, assistant 
attorney general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm was accused in the lawsuits of fostering a discriminatory corporate 
culture and refusing to serve blacks at some of its 1,400 Denny's restaurants 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's would not say how many cases of alleged discrimination in Southern 
California would be affected by the settlement. "There are 3,000 claims in 
California and 4,300 in the nation, and we're not able to break them out," 
spokeswoman Karen Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jerry Steering, a lawyer who represents five clients who alleged 
discrimination at Denny's restaurants in Costa Mesa, Orange and Yorba Linda in 
1992 and 1993, described the agreement as "good news for my clients because it 
represents another option for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Steering said his clients have the option of continuing to pursue their 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Diego -- or accept $35,000 each from the 
settlement fund. "I don't know what they'll decide to do," Steering said. "I 
will say that the quality of our cases is such that they can probably get a lot 
more money if we go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The five customers alleged that Denny's either refused to serve them or 
demanded that they pay for meals in advance, even though white customers were 
not being asked to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego resident Leon Youngblood alleged that a Denny's restaurant on 17th 
Street in Costa Mesa made him wait for a table while white customers were 
quickly seated. Youngblood called the Costa Mesa Police Department to lodge a 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department settlement, which must be approved in U.S. district 
courts in San Jose and Baltimore, ends a painful chapter for Flagstar Cos. of 
Spartanburg, S.C., which owns the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some black customers, for example, said that they were asked to prepay for 
meals or to pay cover charges before they were seated. One former restaurant 
manager said he was told by superiors to close his restaurant if "too many" 
black customers approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the arrangement, Flagstar did not admit wrongdoing. 
Nevertheless, Justice Department officials said, the settlement represents a 
landmark in civil rights enforcement: the largest agreement ever negotiated in 
a case involving discrimination at restaurants, hotels or other public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement resolves separate lawsuits filed last year in California and 
Maryland. The California plaintiffs include Rachel Thompson of Vallejo, a 
15-year-old black girl who went to Denny's in late 1992 to celebrate her 13th 
birthday but was refused the restaurant's customary free birthday meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland lawsuit was filed by six U.S. Secret Service officers who stopped 
at a Denny's in Annapolis in May, 1993, amid preparations for a speech by 
President Clinton at the U.S. Naval Academy. The black agents said that they 
sat for nearly an hour without being served, even as they watched white 
colleagues served several times. Their lawsuit was expanded to include 
claimants in 48 other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Flagstar will pay $28 million in damages to California 
customers, plus $6.8 million in attorney fees. The chain will pay $17.7 million 
to customers in Maryland and other states, along with $1.9 million in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who feel they were treated unfairly at Denny's can request claim 
forms and apply for a portion of the damages by calling the company toll-free 
at (800) 836-0055. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims will be screened by an independent claims administrator and the 
Washington Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, which filed 
the Maryland lawsuit. Damages will be prorated among victims whose claims are 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides paying damages, Flagstar will be required to retain an independent 
civil rights monitor to ensure the company's compliance with the settlement. In 
addition, it agreed to feature blacks as customers and employees in 
advertisements, train its employees in racial sensitivity and allow 
representatives of a civil rights group to make random spot checks for bias at 
Denny's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar officials said that the company already has begun satisfying many of 
the agreement's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for plaintiffs in the class-action suits said that the settlement 
could become a precedent for future discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, noting that the Justice Department is pursuing 20 other cases 
involving alleged discrimination at public accommodations, issued a pointed 
warning to any companies that still practice racial discrimination: "We are 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement "symbolizes what I think is a return of the finest moments of 
the civil rights struggles, in which the Department of Justice locked arms with 
civil rights lawyers and the private bar to win relief for victims of 
discrimination," said John P. Relman, an attorney for the Washington Lawyer's 
Committee. "We hope and believe that this is the beginning of a new 
partnership. . . . We want the Justice Department by our side." 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar still faces a handful of individual discrimination lawsuits. A 
spokesman said that the company hopes to settle those cases separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a separate news conference Tuesday, Flagstar Chief Executive 
Officer Jerome J. Richardson insisted that the chain, which has $3.8 billion in 
annual sales, never had a policy of discriminating against blacks. But, he 
conceded, "clearly, these plaintiffs did not feel that way, and I regret that." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who owns the National Football League's new Carolina Panthers 
franchise, said he was concerned last summer that the allegations of racial 
bias would hamper his bid for a team. But he said he was even more worried 
about damage to his personal reputation and that of the company.

FOR STREISAND, EAGLES FANS, TICKET PRICE IS NO PROBLEM; MUSIC: MULTITUDES WAIT 
EAGERLY FOR APPEARANCES THAT MARK THE BIGGEST WEEK IN O.C.'S POP CONCERT 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Frank Groff of Laguna Beach bought his $350 Barbra Streisand ticket without a 
qualm. "It's a historic event, and you want to be a part of that." He said he 
would have been willing to spend $1,000. He actually did spend that much once, 
to see her at a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Karyn Vogt of Costa Mesa vied for hours with some 300 other fans to buy an 
Eagles ticket and was ready to spend the top price of $115. She ended up eighth 
in line, but still had to settle for a more distant (though still pricey) seat. 
It has hardly dampened her enthusiasm: "Have I been waiting for this? You bet! 
I've been waiting since there was the first hint of a tour, but I never thought 
it would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Groff and Vogt are among some 140,000 fans who will hear Streisand and the 
Eagles in Orange County this week -- the splashiest week that anyone can 
remember in the county's pop music history. Streisand's shows at The Pond of 
Anaheim will be part of her first tour in 22 years, a tour she claims will be 
her last. The five Eagles shows starting Friday at Irvine Meadows will be the 
band's first live concerts anywhere since a rancorous breakup in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have the ticket prices for these shows set records, but the security 
is out of the ordinary: Before Streisand ticket-holders can take their seats, 
they'll have to pass through metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? Streisand and Eagles ticket buyers, it turns out, are a 
varied -- and not mutually exclusive -- lot. Some want nostalgia. Some want 
surprises. Some just hope that, after all the hoopla, the shows actually 
happen.

 "I have one friend," Vogt recounted, "who said he's seeing the Eagles on 
opening night because he's worried, 'What if they get mad at each other again 
and cancel the rest of the tour?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old marketing assistant noted that her husband won't be joining 
her at the Meadows. He's going camping in Yosemite instead. "He said no way was 
he going to pay that much for a ticket. I said, 'Fine with me. I'll just spend 
all that money.' I don't care how much it is." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine where she works, Vogt has been running 
a lighthearted contest to see who gets to use her spare ticket: "In 100 words 
or less, who's the biggest Eagles fan and the most fun at concerts?" 
</P>
<P>
 For all the kudos accorded them over the years, to Vogt the Eagles mean fun, 
as if they had been the Beach Boys of the '70s. "I was in high school back 
then, and it was good partying music. We're all going to go and pretend we're 
young again. I hope I remember all the words, because I'm going to be singing 
along with everything." 
</P>
<P>
 They make a mighty fine lemon caper charbroiled swordfish at the Cafe Zoolu in 
Laguna Beach, but don't expect to eat there next Tuesday night, no matter what 
credit card you carry. Owner-operators Michael and Toni Leech say they'll be 
hanging a "Gone to the Eagles" sign in the window. 
</P>
<P>
 For Michael, 45, and Toni, 42, Eagles music conjures images of the California 
coastline, but it also reminds them of when they were starting out together in 
marriage and business. "It might not sound very romantic, but we listened to 
the 'Hotel California' album all the time while were remodeling our second 
restaurant (the Dana Point Quiet Woman). It was right after we'd married, and 
we were also remodeling the apartment above the restaurant to live in. We 
constantly played the album, and those were great, fun times for us," Michael 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have continued listening to the Eagles over the years while he has cooked 
and she has hosted in the restaurants they have owned. 
</P>
<P>
 To let off steam, they occasionally used to shell out hundreds to a ticket 
broker and go unwind in the front rows of a rock show -- a luxury the economy 
hasn't allowed them in some time. They now say they couldn't imagine shutting 
down the restaurant to see anyone, short of Jim Morrison coming back from the 
dead. Or the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to worry about the financial ramifications," Michael said. 
"In the summer we don't close on Mondays, so we're going to work about 90 days 
straight, day and night. So this is our last hurrah, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Leeches, Tim and Mitzi Carroll of Anaheim had not been accustomed 
to shelling out hundreds for concerts. They spent $700 to see Streisand, "but 
the last time we saw her I think it cost us something like a $6 cover charge, 
and that included a couple of drinks," recalled Tim, a 55-year-old high school 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was at the Hungry i nightclub in San Francisco, around 1963. We sat 
within 20 feet of her and, you know, we were impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 But not so impressed that he doesn't claim to be more of an Eagles fan these 
days. He and his wife (who still favors Babs) are going to both shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Freudenberg of Orange says she and husband Jerry would like to take 
daughters Brandi (who at 16 has been the Times Orange County girl high school 
tennis player of the year for two years running) and Holli to see Barbra but 
they think the ticket price precludes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the money, Donna said Jerry, 50, invested some legwork. An ex-high 
school coach, "he went (to The Pond) the night before, stayed all night and 
when they finally opened the gates he sprinted in front of everyone, running 
like an idiot, and was at the top of the line, little to know that it meant 
absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Freudenbergs have learned, it is a common practice at ticket sales for 
priority numbers to be distributed at random, removing any advantage of being 
first in line. Jerry's number was so far down the list as to be beyond hope. 
Eventually, an older couple with a better number agreed to buy tickets for the 
Freudenbergs. The sad outcome, Donna said, was that the couple -- who wanted 
tickets to celebrate a wedding anniversary -- got the Freudenbergs' tickets but 
none for themselves, because the $50 ones they could afford had sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Groff of Laguna thinks Streisand is "an extraordinary vocalist and all 
that, but for me it's more what she represents. To me, and to a lot of people I 
think, she represents the underdog, this kid who really wasn't very attractive 
(but who) made it to superstardom. It's one thing for Paul Newman or Marilyn 
Monroe, these figures of beauty. But she is no conventional beauty, and she 
broke convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was a little different when I was younger. I wasn't good at 
sports or the other popular things. And to see her kind of fight convention was 
an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Groff has been a fan ever since he saw "Funny Girl" in 1970. "I thought, 'Oh 
my God, who is this bizarre woman?' I was only 10 years old, but it spoke to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Groff is 34, runs a successful public relations company in Long Beach, 
owns a home there as well as one in Laguna, and says he's able to afford most 
things he wants, including that $1,000 ticket he bought a while back to see one 
of Streisand's rare, and brief, public appearances at an AIDS benefit. But if 
you think he's a fan, he says you should talk to his friend Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old fire equipment sales rep of Foothill Ranch, Bill Short also was 
hooked by "Funny Girl" at an early age. "I was kind of notorious for watching 
nothing but football or baseball. Then one year when I was 13 I was getting 
away from the adults one Thanksgiving, wandered into the back room and watched 
'Funny Girl' on TV and got mesmerized." 
</P>
<P>
 He was almost literally mesmerized by Streisand once, on an occasion he has 
related so colorfully to Groff that Groff, he now says, tells the story better 
than he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Groff recounted: "Bill went to the Broadway Grill (in Santa Monica). He loves 
Streisand so much he'd pick through her garbage. And he saw her in the 
restaurant! He tried to send her a drink, but the waiter wouldn't. So he gave 
him a $20 tip to do it. So he buys her a drink, and he was all excited because 
she accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted a closer view so he slips a peek her way while walking to the 
bathroom. He comes out and she's gone. He's beating himself up. 'She's gone, 
why didn't I just say something? I missed my golden opportunity.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And all of a sudden he feels hands on his shoulder, and he looks up and it's 
her. He couldn't get any words out. He was in shock. She starts laughing and 
says, 'I wanted to thank you for the drink.' And he's still unable to say 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many of Short's peers share his interest in her. "People go through my 
records and see Nirvana and the Gin Blossoms and all this current stuff. Then 
they see this huge stack of Streisand stuff and go, 'Where did that come from?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's the music that defines almost every time in my life. Every time I 
try and relate to any experience, I always can pick a Streisand song to almost 
exactly describe what I'm thinking, every emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 While his and Groff's admiration for Streisand began in adolescence, Georgia 
Dorney's love of the Eagles is practically a case of prenatal nostalgia. "Hotel 
California" came out two years before the 16-year-old Laguna High School 
student was born; the group had broken up by the time she was 2. Still, the 
Eagles' music is some of the first she remembers hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad (defense attorney Gene Dorney) was always playing music and the Eagles 
were always on. They're like the sounds of my childhood. It gives me a great 
feeling listening to them. You can listen to them in any mood: You can either 
dance or mope." 
</P>
<P>
 She also likes Alice in Chains, Bob Marley and the Stone Temple Pilots, but it 
was the prospect of Eagles tickets that got her to wake dad at 7 one morning to 
go get tickets. She and her father, who is divorced from her mother, are going 
to the show together. "I'm going to be jumping up and singing," she predicts.

WOMAN WHO REPORTED 1993 ATTACK 'HORRIFIED' BY MURDER; CRIMINAL JUSTICE: SHE 
SAYS COUNTY PROSECUTORS SHOULD HAVE KEPT REPEAT RAPIST MORGAN OFF STREETS WHEN 
THEY HAD THE CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old Huntington Beach woman who says she was handcuffed to a tree and 
raped by the man suspected in last week's beating death of a young woman 
outside a popular nightclub said Tuesday the slaying never would have occurred 
had Orange County prosecutors been more vigorous in pursuing her case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like somebody is dead because of this," said the woman, who agreed to 
be interviewed on the condition that her name not be published. "I feel like 
this shouldn't have happened. He never should have been out on the streets so 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 But Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., a three-time convicted rapist, was on the loose 
only 12 months after the Orange County district attorney's office declined to 
push for a fourth rape conviction, and opted instead to let parole officials 
send him back to prison for the one-year remainder of his term for rape No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Police now believe that Morgan savagely beat to death Leanora Annette Wong, 
23, of Huntington Beach last Friday after meeting her at a bar. Police have 
called the 28-year-old Morgan "a predator" with a frightening history of sexual 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Some law enforcement officials have likewise said Wong's death might have been 
avoided had authorities taken a harder stand on the March 22, 1993, rape 
complaint made against Morgan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible this happened," the woman who filed last year's complaint said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office looked into the woman's allegations but 
declined to prosecute the case on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Had 
they sought a rape conviction, Morgan -- who already had one forcible and two 
statutory rape convictions -- would have been facing as many as 12 years in 
prison. In light of Wong's murder, however, prosecutors now say they will take 
another look at the case with a view of possibly filing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who says Morgan raped her last year testified against him at his 
parole revocation hearing but said she was under the impression that he was 
being charged with rape, not just a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what the procedures were," said the woman, who still lives in 
Huntington Beach and works as a data processor. "I thought he was being 
prosecuted for a longer term." 
</P>
<P>
 When she learned that Morgan was suspected of killing Wong just a year after 
he allegedly attacked her, she was "horrified." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she hopes the district attorney's office will follow through on 
its pledge to take another look at her case to see if a case could be brought 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
 For that to happen, however, Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Middleton said more 
evidence is needed. He defended the office's decision not to file charges last 
year on several grounds, including the fact that there were no witnesses, that 
Morgan claimed their sex was consensual, that the woman had consumed six beers 
earlier that evening, and that her story had several damaging inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said the woman initially lied to police about the incident, claiming 
that two men had pulled her into a car against her will while she was walking 
along Pacific Coast Highway near Warner Avenue. She claimed the men handcuffed 
her a tree and raped her and that she managed to escape from her attackers by 
slipping out of the handcuffs and running away. 
</P>
<P>
 When police pressed her about contradictions in her story, she admitted she 
lied because she was afraid they would think she was to blame for the rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was embarrassed by the whole thing," the woman recalled Tuesday. "I was in 
the hospital and the police were relentless. I was hysterical at the time. . . 
. It was a blow to my ego and pride." She also said that she feared for her 
life, thinking her attacker could find her again and kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that same evening, the woman changed her story and gave an account of 
the incident that police found believable. In that version, Morgan drove by the 
woman a couple of times and asked her if she needed a ride. At first she 
declined, but then she accepted when he persisted. They then bought beer and 
drove to Huntington Central Park to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came across as a really nice guy, then his personality changed in a 
second," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the park, she said, Morgan handcuffed her to a small tree before she 
realized what he was doing. "The handcuffs came out of nowhere," she said. 
Morgan then raped her, the woman said, despite her efforts to fight him off. 
"He was very violent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he had finished raping her, Morgan spotted the headlights of an 
approaching car and started to flee, she said. At that point, the woman said 
she was able to bend the tiny tree enough to slip the handcuffs over the top 
and she started running. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan chased after her, tackled her and forced her into his car, the woman 
said. Because he did not have a key for the handcuffs, he drove her to a 
Westminster apartment complex where he was able to remove them. Once the cuffs 
were off, the woman tried to run away again but to no avail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're going to kill me,' I said. He said, 'Stop saying that.' That's when 
he broke down and cried," the woman recounted. "He said he would marry me. He 
was acting crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she tried to console him to protect herself and prevent him 
from going berserk. She said she calmed him down by giving him a phony 
telephone number and asking him to call. Then he drove her to a friend's house, 
where she called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton, the prosecutor in the case, said there were too many problems with 
the woman's story to win a rape conviction before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not faulting the victim, because we realize the trauma that victims go 
through in this type of case," Middleton said. "The problem is trying to 
overcome these . . . inconsistencies and problematic events in front of a 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the case "would have been impossible to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, however, said the district attorney's office didn't try hard enough 
to prosecute Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are many victims who get rattled by what happened to them and 
don't have their stories straight. My emotions were reeling," the woman said. 
"I wonder how many times somebody gets off because a story isn't perfect the 
first time. I feel like somebody is dead because of this."

FUGITIVE'S ARREST GIVES LITTLE TOWN BIG JOLT; REACTION: BEFORE ACCUSED KILLER'S 
CAPTURE, QUINCY'S BIGGEST CRIMINAL WAS A TRASH-SPILLING BEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nestled among the pines in the northern Sierras, this cozy mountain hamlet is 
known for its hiking, fishing and logging. It may be the last place one expects 
to find a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Edward Patrick Morgan came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, darn near all of Plumas County was abuzz about the arrest of 
Morgan, who fled to Quincy when police in Orange County declared him the prime 
suspect in the brutal weekend murder of a 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the arrest, which came after a short but dramatic chase along the only 
two streets serving downtown Quincy's business district, the biggest news 
around here was the grand opening of the region's first fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Riley, 18, a senior at Quincy High School, put it succinctly: "This is 
crazy. We're in the middle of nowhere. Just a small, quiet town. The big 
happening was Taco Bell coming to town. Until this, that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Quincy -- population 5,000 -- just isn't the sort of place where felony murder 
busts are supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had this much excitement in town since I can remember," said Kim 
Steites, a longtime resident who keeps an eye on Quincy from behind the 
checkout counter of a gas station convenience store. "Probably the closest 
thing was when they supposedly sighted Big Foot last winter. Turned out to be a 
college student in a gorilla suit." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a town where residents take pride that the quality of life hasn't 
changed all that much in the 140 years since pioneer H.J. Bradley came upon the 
verdant alpine valley that harbors Quincy and named it after his hometown in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals routinely leave their car keys in the ignition when shopping at the 
market. They don't think twice about leaving doors unlocked at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood Watch? Who needs it? Everyone pretty much knows everyone else. 
There's no worries about allowing teen-agers to ride their bikes across town or 
swim in the river with a bunch of young friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Many worry more about the spotted owl's effect on the timber industry than 
about the arrival of big-city crime. Last week's crime blotter, printed by the 
weekly Feather River Bulletin, was topped by a woman concerned that her TV set 
was going to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to live, a good place to raise kids," said Fred Krueger, 
timber management officer for the Plumas National Forest. "The biggest crime 
I've had is my garbage can getting turned over because I have a bear that lives 
in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Steites said residents invariably get lulled into a sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very, very trusting up here," she said. "We are so lucky. We take 
it for granted nothing bad is ever going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But when something does happen, word spreads fast. Gary Miller was working at 
a construction site 20 miles out of town, but he had heard about Morgan's 
apprehension within a few hours of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gossip runs faster than the telephone in this county," said Pat 
Schmierer-Rottenkolber, an administrator at the local courthouse. "You'd be 
amazed how things get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect the talk to die down soon. "The story that's this big now," 
Steites said, spreading her hands wide as a pine cone, "will soon be this big." 
She stretched her arms enough to hug an old-growth evergreen. "By now people 
may think he's a mass murderer and killed 25 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the intrigue is a juicy tidbit: A young local woman -- 22-year-old 
Sonya Marvin -- is involved in the case. Marvin, who was having a long-distance 
romance with Morgan, was arrested for harboring a fugitive in her Main Street 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents said their impression of Marvin was of a sweet young woman, 
an unlikely candidate for such a charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of disbelief that this little girl could be involved in 
something this heavy," said Schmierer-Rottenkolber. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers are even more disbelieving. In recent years, retirees and refugees 
from the Bay Area and Los Angeles have acquired land and built houses, buying 
into a slow-lane lifestyle amid the pines. Morgan's arrest doesn't sit well 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It proves, unfortunately, that you can never get completely away from all the 
bad stuff in the world," lamented George Erdesz, an erstwhile architect who 
moved up from the Bay Area six weeks ago after buying the Ranchito Motel with 
his wife, Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking it was middle America, old values. But I guess it's the 
impact of the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some old timers like Jack McLean, a retired plumber and Quincy partisan 
for the past four decades, acknowledge that nothing short of blocking the two 
roads that lead into and out of town is going to stop the dark side of America 
from occasionally spilling through the rugged mountain passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Petty crime, drugs, I guess that's everywhere, including Quincy," he said. 
"Now there's this. Sure makes me glad I've got a shotgun for self-defense."

A CRITIC'S VIEW; STREISAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all her musical accomplishments, Barbra Streisand would have amassed an 
even more valuable body of work had she recorded during the pre-rock era, when 
the creative heart of pop music was focused on the sophisticated stage and film 
songs so ideally suited to her dramatic instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most commanding pure pop vocalist of her generation (and then 
some), Streisand was still in her 20s three decades ago when she brought a 
breathtaking sense of individuality and passion to such tunes as "Happy Days 
Are Here Again" and "People." As the years passed, however, it was difficult to 
come up consistently with songs of equal ambition and scope. 
</P>
<P>
 There were moments of glorious exception, but nothing has been quite as 
revealing as her presence on this tour: She has chosen songs that are 
meaningful to her, and is singing them with an intimacy and grace that give her 
voice a warmth both chilling and comforting. THE EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' ability to turn out Top 40 hits (16 of them between 1972 and 1980) 
initially caused the band from Southern California to be viewed with suspicion 
by some rock 'n' roll hard-liners, both the '60s crowd that grew up on the 
radical sounds of underground radio and the emerging punk revolutionaries who 
equated commercial success with pop corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles' music was filled with the kind of social realism and 
observation that had characterized the best work of such earlier American bands 
as the Byrds and Creedence Clearwater Revival. The songs, mostly written by Don 
Henley and Glenn Frey, combined tuneful melodies and pleasing harmonies with 
penetrating and provocative examinations of the American character. 
</P>
<P>
 Such hits as "Hotel California" and "Life in the Fast Lane" defined the 
challenges and weaknesses of a generation that was struggling to resolve the 
idealism of the '60s with the "me" generation impulses that eventually would 
dominate the '80s social climate. ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic

NEWS ANALYSIS; ANGERED L.A. POLICE UNION GETS TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police union, eager to reflect the anger and discontent of the 
officers it represents, revamped its contract negotiating team this week to 
include some of its most vocal hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief negotiator will be an outspoken motorcycle officer whose nickname is 
"Get in Your Face." Also on the Police Protective League's side will be the man 
who posed as the ominous gunman in the union's controversial carjacking 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were in Vietnam, these are the kind of guys you'd send on 
search-and-destroy missions," union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield said. "They are 
tough and are prepared to represent the frustration of the members in no 
uncertain terms." 
</P>
<P>
 That frustration was made abundantly clear last week when officers voted by a 
3-1 margin to reject the contract negotiated by the city and union leadership. 
Startled by the defeat, union leaders decided they had to assemble a tougher 
negotiating team to head off a rebellion within their ranks and to squeeze a 
better deal from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, the union has called on its 7,000 members to refuse to 
sign up for any voluntary overtime and has asked officers to wear their badges 
upside-down to protest what they consider to be City Hall's mixed-up 
priorities. Now the new leadership is talking about taking stronger action in 
the weeks ahead, including a sickout during the upcoming World Cup soccer 
tournament, or a work slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's tough stance may head off a recall campaign organized against 
league President Danny Staggs by disgruntled officers. But it carries the risk 
of alienating the city and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 City negotiators have said they will not be bullied into a deal and that they 
would immediately go to court to have any job action declared illegal. Most 
city officials took the change in negotiators in stride, saying they did not 
think it would significantly affect the dynamics at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting with the union's negotiators Tuesday, City Administrative 
Officer Keith Comrie said: "They didn't draw their weapons or put their pieces 
on the table. They just argued their case." 
</P>
<P>
 The new union team was selected Monday during a strategy session convened by 
the league's nine-member board of directors. They emerged late in the day to 
announce they had adopted a new get-tough policy and had chosen four veteran 
patrol officers to carry it out -- Bill (Get in Your Face) Harkness, Fred 
Tredy, Dave Zeigler and Sgt. Dennis Zine. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkness, head of the new team, is a gruff motorcycle officer known to speak 
his mind. He criticized Police Chief Willie L. Williams -- whom he calls 
"Willie" rather than the customary "Chief" -- in the union newsletter and 
exchanged stern words with Williams at a recent union meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Harkness lived up to his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Mayor Richard Riordan "a double-crosser" for courting the union's 
support during the mayor's race and now refusing to give officers a better 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Deputy Mayor Bill Violante "sold out" the union when he left his post 
as league president last summer to join Riordan's office. 
</P>
<P>
 He mocked Councilman Marvin Braude, who is pushing for further concessions 
from the union, because Braude sometimes wears shoes with Velcro closures 
instead of shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no political aspirations," said Harkness, who is close to retirement. 
"If I rub a few noses in the dirt, so be it. . . . I'm just going to get the 
best thing I can for this membership. We don't want the moon and the stars -- 
just the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Public reaction to the union's aggressive posture is difficult to gauge, but 
interviews with a variety of community leaders indicate that opinion ranges 
from support to condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Patsy Carter said she plans to bring dozens of cookies to 
Southwest Division officers today to lend support. "Before we can get on with 
some of the other issues between the community and police, we need to get a 
contract signed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself in complete sympathy with the Police Department," said Don 
Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people said the union is going too far with its threats of sickouts 
and slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, we file charge charges against people who threaten us," said Tammy 
Bruce, president of the National Organization for Women's local chapter. "When 
it's the LAPD that's doing it, where do you turn?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some fear the contract dispute could damage the goodwill among the public that 
the LAPD has built up in the last year. Confidence in the department plummeted 
after the Rodney G. King beating and the resulting riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the union contends that police morale has not similarly rebounded, largely 
because officers have been working without a contract for two years. One reason 
they rejected the city's final offer -- a $40-million package that included a 
3% raise for each of the next two years -- was that it did not provide 
retroactive pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Alienating some members of the public is inevitable and a risk the union is 
willing to take, one union official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are different publics out there," said Garfield, a political consultant 
who is helping to guide the union strategy. "There's a public out there that is 
very supportive of police and that is the public we're trying to activate. 
There is also another public that is anti-police and we couldn't get them on 
our side if we paid them money." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the union has taken some controversial actions. It held a sickout in 
November that the city quickly stopped with a court order. Then in March, the 
union erected billboards throughout the city that showed a woman being 
carjacked by a masked man and urged residents to support the union's case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new members of the negotiating team posed as the gunman, though the 
union will not say which one. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fatal carjacking of two students in San Pedro, an angry Riordan 
briefly called off negotiations and union leaders ordered the billboards taken 
down. Some officers argued at the time that the union gave in too quickly to 
pressure from the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The new union negotiators say they do not intend to make that mistake. They 
say they will keep the pressure on the city until a contract is signed. New

15 OFFICERS DISCIPLINED IN INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigation that began with an anonymous letter signed "Suzi Q." has 
resulted in one Inglewood police officer being fired and 14 being suspended for 
their alleged roles in an illegal bookmaking operation involving an outside 
bookie and thousands of dollars in sports betting, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office will decide whether to file any criminal 
charges in connection with the alleged gambling ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over as far as our investigation is concerned," said Inglewood Police 
Chief Oliver M. Thompson, head of the 209-officer department. "It (the 
investigation) definitely has had a negative impact. Now it's time for the 
healing process to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson did not disclose the names of the 14 officers and one sergeant 
disciplined, saying that none has been charged with a crime. The officers will 
be suspended without pay for one to 30 days, and the suspensions will be 
staggered to reduce their effect on officer deployment, Thompson said. Some of 
the officers could be transferred within the department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary actions can be appealed, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began in December when Thompson received an anonymous typed 
letter, signed "Suzi Q.," alleging that a betting ring was being run by 
officers and including several names. Two officers were cleared of any 
wrongdoing, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after the anonymous letter was received, eight Inglewood police 
officers were placed on paid administrative leave as a result of the internal 
investigation. Search warrants were obtained for locations in Inglewood and 
Simi Valley, including some officers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and officers were tight-lipped about details of the inquiry, pending 
a decision by the district attorney's office on whether anyone will be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the gambling occurred on duty and involved sports betting 
connected to a professional bookie outside the department. He declined to 
identify the alleged bookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he believes that thousands of dollars in bets were placed over a 
three-year period. City-owned cars and telephones were reportedly used by some 
officers in connection with the betting. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who were involved are apologetic about the incident, Thompson 
said. "They wish it had never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The duration of the suspensions was based on the extent of their involvement, 
personal history and work performance, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Norman Cravens said that the fired or suspended 
officers represent a small percentage of the department's work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less than 10%," Cravens said. "It's an alarming number, but not a 
shocking number. We have an outstanding Police Department. They do a lot of 
good work, and now we just want them to get back to it."

BAD RAP?; DESPITE CRIME IMAGE, L.A. FAILS TO MAKE LIST OF WORST 15 CITIES, BUT 
SAN BERNARDINO DOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN and TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles residents may be shellshocked by drive-by shootings, carjackings 
andhome invasion robberies, but the city's reputation as one of the lawlessness 
leaders of the Free World apparently does not meet the reality. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that is the conclusion of a Money magazine study that ranked the 15 
most dangerous cities in the country. Los Angeles didn't make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials, however, said they were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some extremely violent crimes grab the headlines, but the fact of 
the matter is crime has not gone up over the past year or two," said Los 
Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin of the press relations office. "It's not as 
dangerous a city as it's been portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Money magazine rankings are based on violent crimes per 100,000 
residents, a number of small cities are listed as being more crime-plagued than 
the nation's more notorious homicide leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino, with 82 homicides last year, is ranked in the study as the 
sixth-most-dangerous city in the country. New York City, with about 2,000 
murders, was 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more crime news emanating from the nation's largest cities, 
criminologists contended, but not necessarily more per capita crime than 
smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the gang situation, the crack explosion and the riots, the public 
perception of Los Angeles is distorted," said Malcolm Klein, a USC sociologist 
who has written extensively about street gangs and crime. "There's no reason to 
think L.A. has worse violent crime problems than most other major cities." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles residents should not take too much comfort in the findings. 
The city just missed the bottom 15 with a rank of 17th. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles ranks behind a number of cities in per capita crime, in 
absolute numbers the city still is among the nation's leaders. With almost 
1,100 homicides in 1993, Los Angeles ranks No. 2 in the country for murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many were surprised by Los Angeles' ranking, San Bernardino residents 
say they have known for some time about crime problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Filson, president of the San Bernardino Police Officer's Assn., said the 
crime statistics are not lost on local police. More than 70% of the city's 
police officers live outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear from people on the street all the time, saying, 'Hell, we moved from 
Los Angeles to get away from all this crap, and it's following us out here,' " 
Filson said. "We've had LAPD officers on ride-alongs with us who say our 
activity level is worse than what they see in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The study only tracks crimes within city limits, so it does not give an 
accurate representation of a metropolitan area such as Los Angeles, Klein said. 
Areas such as Lynwood, Inglewood, Compton and sections of what is considered 
East Los Angeles -- which are in an unincorporated area of the county -- were 
left out of the Los Angeles survey area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine proclaimed Irvine as the nation's safest city, among cities with 
populations of more than 100,000. And five other California cities are among 
the nation's 15 safest in terms of the violent crime rate, the magazine 
reported. Simi Valley ranked fourth, Sunnyvale was fifth, Thousand Oaks was 
10th, Rancho Cucamonga ranked 11th and Glendale was 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Money magazine study, published in its June issue, cites FBI statistics 
and the magazine's own research to debunk various myths about how bad crime is. 
It noted that despite public perception, a person's chance of being a victim of 
crime is 9% less than it was in 1981, based on national statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was based on an analysis of the FBI's 1993 crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine added up the incidents of four violent crimes -- homicide, rape, 
burglary and aggravated assault -- and listed them per 100,000 residents. The 
magazine said residents living in such reputation-sullied cities as Detroit, 
Chicago, Washington and Oakland were in fact less prone to be victims of 
violent crime than people living in San Bernardino, where the violent crime 
rate was 3,190 per 100,000 population in 1993. In Los Angeles, the rate was 
2,332 per 100,000 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta was ranked the most dangerous city in the United States, with 4,123 
crimes per 100,000 residents. In contrast, Irvine experienced only 114 violent 
crimes, Money reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Fisher Sr., owner of a San Bernardino shooting range, said he recently 
learned firsthand of the city's crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you how bad it is, when my indoor shooting range gets robbed at 
gunpoint and they take away 40 guns, that tells you it's getting bad," said 
Fisher, who owns the San Bernardino Magnum Range, a place where judges, 
doctors, lawyers and homemakers practice their shooting. "These people are 
getting so bold out here, they don't care if they're coming into an indoor 
shooting range and you have a gun too. They still got the drop on us, and took 
off with 40 handguns." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Minor, who spent nearly 30 years as a San Bernardino police officer -- and 
is now the city's mayor -- blames the crime problems on geography. San 
Bernardino is the first major California city encountered by people motoring to 
the Golden State for a better life -- but then are confronted by a lousy 
economy and scant job offerings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an easy stopping point for them," Minor said. "Anyone coming from 
Nevada or Arizona or elsewhere who comes to California seeking to improve 
themselves, are looking for jobs that aren't here. So they want (financial) 
aid. We're a county seat, and they hunker down here to be close to the county 
welfare office." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he feels safer here than, say, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go into L.A., I want eyes on the back of my head so I can see who's 
behind me," he said. "I don't feel that way out here." Talk of the Town 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the safest and the most dangerous communities in the United States 
with more than 100,000 people, according to a study of FBI crime statistics by 
Money magazine:

SEISMIC SCIENCE FAIR; QUAKE GIVES STUDENTS A REAL-LIFE THEME FOR THEIR PROJECTS 
AND THEY USE SOME UNUSUAL TOOLS TO CAPTURE MOTHER NATURE'S WRATH

 She used cement blocks, water pipes, an alarm clock and a No. 2 pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 He used a laser, an electronic amplifier and a computerized graph recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Maritza Alvarado and Wiyanto Alamsyah had a lot more in common than it 
first seemed Tuesday when they found themselves standing next to each other in 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were finalists in this year's $40,000 California State Science Fair. Both 
were waiting nervously for judges to come down the Sports Arena aisle and 
evaluate their work. Both had designed and built seismographs as high school 
science class projects. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were not the only ones with earthquakes on their minds. It turns out 
that the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor shook teen-agers throughout the state into 
thinking about seismic mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen of the record 862 students competing in the fair tackled 
earthquake-related projects. That is apparently a record too, fair organizers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to do some dumb bacteria-sample thing. But then the earthquake 
came and I saw pictures of all the structural failures," said eighth-grader 
Peter Kazanjy of Tustin. He used a piston-like device to simulate the effect of 
a quake on walls reinforced with plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Fischetti, 14, of Santa Barbara got the idea to experiment with 
reinforced concrete beams after looking at a huge rafter in his school gym Jan. 
17 and wondering if a closer quake would have bent it. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake jolted Heather Broersma of Moreno Valley into action too. "I'd 
waited to the last minute to start a project and then along it came," said the 
15-year-old, whose study of aftershocks showed that all were centered north of 
the Northridge epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers used unusual tools to simulate the ground-wrenching wrath of Mother 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Data, 13, of Redwood City used a battery-operated screwdriver, Kenny 
Bonnefin, 13, of Lone Pine borrowed his father's power drill, and Kristopher 
Cox, 15, of Ridgecrest salvaged a record player motor from the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-grader Stephanie Pichel of Half Moon Bay used a vibrating back 
massager to simulate a quake's effect on various types of reinforcement that 
she used inside handmade adobe bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 A backpack's elastic bungee cords attached to wooden blocks created the 
slamming motion that Denise Tung, 14, of San Diego needed to test the effect of 
base-isolation beneath buildings. For the "buildings" in her test, she used a 
stack of her mother's mah-jongg game pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 When 12-year-old Sarah Hoffman of Bakersfield discovered that there were no 
earthquakes to test the seismograph she had made out of a tin can, springs and 
a felt-tip marker, she put the device in friends' cars and measured the 
effectiveness of their shock absorbers. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the earthquake projects emerged as top winners. Those honors went to 
an oil contamination experiment by Clovis senior Lalia Abdelal, ocean research 
by senior Lulu Wang of Alhambra High School, and an aerodynamics study by 
eighth-grader Jennifer Bruno of St. Paul the Apostle School in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismograph-makers Alamsyah and Alvarado emerged with their confidence 
unshaken, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamsyah, 16, of Pebble Beach, used electronic gear from his boarding school 
for his experiment. He said he intends to pursue seismic work with a career in 
petroleum engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado, 14, of Pasadena, plans to place her homemade device in her back yard 
so she can keep track of aftershocks. She hopes to become a heart surgeon. But 
first she wants to write a thank you note to the guys at Home Depot in 
Monrovia. 
</P>

 "They were really angels. They drilled and cut all the pipes to my 
specifications. I couldn't have done my project without them."

SUPERVISORS BAN CURBSIDE JOB SOLICITATION; WORK: THE COUNTY'S ACTION, WHICH 
GOES INTO EFFECT IN JULY, IS SEEN AS A SEVERE BLOW TO DAY LABORERS. BUT 
GARCETTI SAYS HE WILL NOT PROSECUTE THE CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a resounding defeat for day laborers and their representatives, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a law that criminalizes 
curbside job solicitation in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the ordinance was a major victory for homeowners and anti-immigrant 
groups, who failed to muster support for a similar proposal in March.  
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance, which goes into effect in July, makes curbside job-seeking 
a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. It 
is modeled after an Agoura Hills law that survived a crucial legal challenge 
last month by the American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of immigrants 
rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the success of the Agoura Hills law, Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
reintroduced a measure originally proposed by Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke. It was approved 3 to 1, with Supervisor Gloria Molina opposed. 
Supervisor Ed Edelman was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the county's top prosecutor has said he will not enforce the law, 
although he will continue to prosecute day laborers who violate existing laws, 
such as urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have limited resources," Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said. "Not only that, 
but it would be difficult for me to prosecute someone for simply trying to get 
a job." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters said that as long as sheriff's deputies ticket or arrest the 
job-seekers, the ordinance would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour hearing was marked by passionate attacks on and defenses of the 
measure, which will affect the 10% of county residents who live in 
unincorporated areas, including Ladera Heights, East Los Angeles and portions 
of the San Gabriel, Santa Clarita, Antelope and San Fernando valleys. But the 
measure's symbolic impact will be far more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "This empowers the community to protect itself and its public rights of way," 
Antonovich said. "And it eliminates the incentive for people to break the law 
by coming to this country for work."  
</P>
<P>
 But Molina, who suggested that the county follow the example of the city of 
Los Angeles and set up hiring sites for day laborers, excoriated the board for 
making what she characterized as a politically expedient decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a disgraceful day for the Board of Supervisors and a shameful act," 
Molina said. "This ordinance will be used against people -- especially people 
of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners from the Ladera Heights neighborhood north of Inglewood said the 
measure is necessary to rid their neighborhood of unsightly throngs of day 
laborers. They reiterated that their opposition had nothing to do with the fact 
that many of the job-seekers are Latino immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 But their voices were drowned out by representatives of several anti-immigrant 
groups, who turned out to champion the law in the hopes that it will discourage 
illegal immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the federal government won't do its jobs and control its borders, we'll 
have to do it on the local level with laws like this," said Ira Mehlman, a 
spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure said it would drive job-seekers deeper into poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish you wouldn't treat us like criminals when we are only looking for work 
to feed our families," said Juan Carlos Ruiz, a day laborer who spoke on behalf 
of a dozen other men who attended the hearing at the County Hall of 
Administration. "If you believe in God, why are you doing something against 
humanity?" 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition that challenged the Agoura Hills ordinance said it may mount a 
legal challenge against the new county law, arguing that it would violate 
speech, assembly and travel rights guaranteed in the state and federal 
constitutions.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, 
said the chances of success are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss in Agoura Hills was a severe one," Ripston said. The courts are 
clearly not very hospitable places when it comes to protecting civil liberties 
and civil rights, she added.  
</P>
<P>
 In April, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that Agoura Hills has the 
right to regulate the activity of day laborers as it relates to local traffic 
safety standards. The city blamed a day laborer's death on the traffic 
disruption caused by men rushing up to vehicles and contended that the law was 
necessary to prevent traffic accidents. The measure passed by the board lays 
out the same rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 The board considered the same ordinance in March, but adopted a much narrower 
measure that allowed day laborers to continue soliciting work everywhere but in 
commercial parking lots where owners post signs prohibiting the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came after Burke agreed to water down her proposal in response to 
objections by immigrant rights advocates. At the time, Burke also expressed 
concern about the legality of the Agoura Hills measure. The appellate court 
decision that upheld that ordinance was pending at that time.  
</P>
<P>
 But Burke, who cast the swing vote Tuesday, said she changed her mind and 
became an advocate of the tougher measure because her constituents continue to 
complain about the day laborer problem.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; JUDGE OKS 
COLLEGE HEARING FOR STUDENT ACCUSED OF RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that Pomona College may proceed with a 
disciplinary hearing that was stalled last month when a student accused of rape 
sued the school over its disciplinary procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a female student filed a complaint with the school's disciplinary 
panel, accusing a graduating senior of date rape 2 1/2 years before.Although 
she conceded she never indicated any objection to sex, school rules against 
sexual assault require explicit consent for intercourse, and provide a maximum 
penalty of expulsion for students "convicted" by a disciplinary panel made up 
of 10 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was scheduled for April 22, but Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne 
issued a stay that postponed the hearing and allowed the student to graduate 
May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wayne ruled that the hearing may proceed. But she decided that the 
accused man is entitled to legal representation during the proceedings, despite 
school rules that bar attorneys from student hearings. The judge left open 
whether the attorney may cross-examine witnesses and speak on the accused 
student's behalf, or merely be an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona College spokeswoman Nina Ellerman said school officials have not 
decided when the hearing will take place, but added that it will not happen 
until after students return from summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused student's attorney, Howard Rosen, said his client will appeal to 
the court again if the panel finds him guilty. He is also seeking monetary 
compensation from the school for emotional and academic damage from the stigma 
of the rape charge.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PLAN TO 
GIVE RIOT AID TO GARMENT DISTRICT DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan has backed off a plan to spend $150,000 in riot recovery 
funds to spruce up the Downtown garment district, a neighborhood that was not 
as badly damaged as other areas in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office reached an agreement Tuesday with Councilwoman Rita Walters 
to instead obtain the $150,000 for the Downtown Property Owners Assn. from a 
city program that assists small businesses.The funds will be used to start a 
special assessment district that will charge business owners a fee and use the 
funds for neighborhood improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters had angrily opposed the use of riots funds for the 
improvements, noting that neighborhoods devastated by arson and looting are 
still waiting to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin had justified the use of riot funds in the 
neighborhood, saying that businesses there "lost a tremendous amount of 
business because of people's fear to come down here after the riots."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ACLU TO FILE SUIT OVER 
PASADENA CITY COUNCIL'S 'COURTESY CODE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1992 Pasadena ordinance aimed at requiring City Council members to be more 
civil to one another has inspired nothing of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, then-Mayor Rick Cole told Councilman Isaac Richard: "You're full of 
poison." Richard countered by calling Cole "a narcissistic, pompous hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the code -- prompted partially by the volatile Richard and his bickering 
with council members -- is provoking troubles of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 American Civil Liberties Union officials say they will file a federal civil 
rights lawsuit today against Pasadena, saying its courtesy ordinance is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a muzzle on free speech by elected officials," said Mark Rosenbaum, 
legal director for the ACLU of Southern California. "The clear import of this 
case is that the 1st Amendment is not alive and well in Pasadena. Their 
courtesy code is a throwback to the sort of codes that Southern legislators 
used against outspoken officials." 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU officials said the ordinance may be the most restrictive of its kind in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a bickering City Council approved the "courtesy code" ordinance, with 
rules that might be posted on any kindergarten wall: Be courteous. Be 
cooperative. Be fair.  
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena City Atty. Victor Kaleta said he could not comment because he has not 
seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum said that ACLU attorneys, and co-counsel Dan Stormer, got involved 
at Richard's request. Richard's stormy three-year tenure has included two 
censures by his colleagues for allegedly using abusive language. He has been 
denied perks, such as free Rose Bowl tickets and a brief chance that council 
members had to greet President Clinton at a Pasadena stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who has tangled often with Richard, said courtesy was not the problem 
with his colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Council member Richard wasn't censured for being discourteous," Cole said. 
"He was censured twice for abusive behavior and threats against the city staff 
. . . this deals not with speech but behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said the lawsuit is being filed on behalf of his constituency's right 
to fair representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lawsuit is not about Isaac Richard," he said. "It's about the 
constituency's right to elect who they want to elect and have them advocated 
and represented in a way that they want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard was censured in August, 1992, after city Housing Administrator Phyllis 
Mueller filed a sexual harassment complaint against him for cursing and 
threatening her during a council meeting. In June, 1993, he was censured for 
cursing a roomful of city officials, including City Clerk Maria Stewart, who 
also filed a sexual harassment complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a Superior Court judge ordered Richard to keep his distance from 
Councilman Chris Holden for the next three years. In a court petition, Holden 
said Richard threatened him and tried to provoke a fight in the Rose Bowl press 
box in a dispute over the city's complimentary tickets to the Rose Bowl game.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WOMAN SAYS 
ATTORNEY WILL TURN OVER MENENDEZ TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Virginia woman who claims to have recorded phone calls with Lyle Menendez 
turned four audiotapes over to her lawyer Tuesday and said it was with the 
intent of delivering the tapes to Los Angeles authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 After being called into court Tuesday morning in Spotsylvania, Va., and told 
that she owes hundred of dollars in unrelated fines, Martha (Marti) Shelton, 
30, of Falls Church, Va., said she turned the tapes over to attorney Anthony J. 
Corizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said she handed over the tapes after she was told she would owe no 
fines if she cooperates with authorities searching for new evidence in the 
Menendez murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 At their first trial, separate juries deadlocked between murder and lesser 
manslaughter charges for Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, the Beverly 
Hills brothers who shot their parents to death Aug. 20, 1989. A new trial date 
is to be set June 27 in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The older brother's trial deadlocked Jan. 28. That night, according to a court 
affidavit, Lyle Menendez allegedly told Shelton, with whom he had been talking 
for months: "I snowed half the people this time. . . . All I have to do is snow 
the other half the next time." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, according to the affidavit, Lyle Menendez referred to photos 
of his dead parents in telling her: "The pictures of my parents will seem like 
a birthday party in comparison to what I will do to someone who crosses me." 
</P>
<P>
 A search two weeks ago of Shelton's house turned up three audiotapes, but none 
with those comments.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said Tuesday that those remarks can be found in the four tapes she 
gave her lawyer, and said: "I'm sick of the whole thing. I'm really sick of it. 
I'm sick of everybody. I'm sick of the entire thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Corizzi, who has offices in Washington, D.C., and Manassas, Va., could not be 
reached for comment.

 Drooling through college: Santa Monica College is exploring the idea of 
allowing instructors to bring their babies into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion, which would also apply to other employees, came from college 
trustee Ralph Villani, who said a similar arrangement had proved a success at a 
bank in San Jose. The bank allows workers to bring in babies "up to the age of 
six months or when they begin to crawl, whichever comes first," said Bruce 
Smith, a spokesman for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that several details remain to be worked out. "We'll have to bounce 
the idea off the unions," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 As for classroom disruptions by a crying baby, Smith said: "The bank employees 
apparently help each other out with their children. Perhaps if a baby gets 
fussy he could be passed from student to student."

 The new college try: It shouldn't come as a surprise that a school in the

 Santa Monica College President Richard Moore came up with the idea of setting 
aside half an hour every Wednesday morning (10 to 10:30) to allow employees to 
indulge in any type of reading they prefer. Even the telephone operators get a 
break, with a recording

 Moore also arranged for language lessons in French, Spanish and Japanese to be 
broadcast over the P.A. system in the restrooms of some buildings. "I heard a 
story about one person who was using the restroom when he suddenly heard a 
voice say, 'I have diarrhea,' " Smith related. It was the translation of a 
language lesson, he explained, adding: "A lot of the phrases are for 
travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Moore who gave the best graduation speech we've ever read -- so 
good that we memorized it. Appearing at the end of an overly long high school 
commencement, Moore strode to the dais and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Feelings. Adventures. Ideas."

 Several years ago, we were asked to do a weekend sports commentary on a local 
television station. We had dreams of glory -- of our own show, perhaps 
("Harvey's Heroes?"). Following our second witty piece, the station happened to 
conduct an interview with Jones, the defensive end who was once part of the 
Rams' "Fearsome Foursome." Asked his ultimate dream, Jones responded: "To knock 
a quarterback's head off."  
</P>
<P>
 He paused and added: "And watch it roll over to the sidelines."

<P>
 Everyone at the station was convulsed with laughter. Numerous viewers wrote in

commentary and our TV career had been beheaded. miscelLAny:

REALLOCATION OF MANUFACTURER SALES TAXES SOUGHT; SPENDING: TAXPAYER AND 
BUSINESS GROUPS SAY THE REVENUES SHOULD GO TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY ARE 
GENERATED. CURRENTLY, THEY ARE POOLED AND DISBURSED STATEWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manufacturers and taxpayer groups are fighting a state policy that they say is 
depriving some cities of millions of dollars in sales taxes that they should 
receive for playing host to big manufacturing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayer and business organizations have joined several cities in a 
campaign to overturn a State Board of Equalization policy so that the taxes can 
be directed to manufacturing companies' home communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 132 cities statewide would gain substantial tax windfalls under such a 
policy change, according to a private firm that has researched the question. 
Los Angeles would gain $19 million a year or more, according to advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers would be more than 300 other cities that now get a share of taxes 
generated outside their borders through tax pools. They would be limited in the 
future mostly to sales taxes generated within their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is "this is a zero-sum game," said Larry Micheli, supervisor 
of the Board of Equalization's local tax section. "Some cities are going to 
win. Some are going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the sales tax to cities and unincorporated areas has become 
increasingly contentious since property tax revenues were limited by 
Proposition 13 in 1978. The fight for the $3 billion that goes to localities 
has escalated in recent years as the recession has eroded most government 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 8 1/4% tax charged on sales in Los Angeles County, 6% goes to the 
state, 1 1/4% goes to transportation programs and 1% goes to the county's 88 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the 1% share is usually simple. Retail sales produce most of 
the sales tax revenue and that money goes directly to the city where the sales 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Board of Equalization currently throws many sales taxes -- from 
mail-order sales, long-term equipment leases and manufacturer-to-manufacturer 
transactions -- into "pools" in each county. The pooled money is distributed to 
all cities in the county, regardless of the point of sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate centers on this pooled money and a proposal by the tax administrators 
that would formalize the pooling policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including the state's largest cities and those with many 
manufacturers, say the pools rob them of taxes that are rightly theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Taxpayers Assn. agrees, saying that less money should be 
pooled, leaving more of taxes to the cities that generated them. "If the cities 
don't get a fair share of the revenue they are less likely to approve growth 
and development in their communities," said Dave Doerr of the taxpayers group. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers have become less welcome because their host cities do not get 
the full benefit of the taxes they generate, said Chris Micheli, general 
counsel to the 800-member California Manufacturer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities that support industry often complain that they must put up with dirty, 
smelly and noisy plants -- and provide extra street repairs and fire protection 
-- but without receiving sales taxes that the plants generate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those taxes paid by that manufacturer should be directed as much as possible 
back to that host city because that city has to provide many services," Micheli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been that cities have skewed their land-use development 
decisions to favor sales tax juggernauts such as auto dealerships and shopping 
malls to the exclusion of manufacturers, said Dave Elder, a former Long Beach 
assemblyman who is running for the Board of Equalization. "It makes 
manufacturers second-class citizens," Elder said. "It just continues their 
death spiral in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Resource Consultants, a firm paid by cities to root out sales tax 
discrepancies, has estimated that up to $220 million in manufacturing taxes is 
being diffused through the pools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, at Elder's behest, estimated that a site-based distribution of the 
taxes in Los Angeles County, for example, would benefit about a quarter of the 
cities, which are home to at least 58% of the area's residents. Los Angeles 
would gain at least $19 million, Long Beach $5.2 million, Torrance $3.2 
million, Glendale $2 million, Santa Fe Springs $1.8 million and Santa Monica 
$1.7 million, according to the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more cities would lose money they get from the tax pools. Most losers 
would be suburban cities with little or no manufacturing, such as Malibu, Palos 
Verdes Estates and Glendora. The consultant did not calculate how much those 
cities would lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Equalization officials say that the question of the pooled funds has 
been oversimplified by opponents and that pooling was created by cities because 
of the difficulty of distributing many funds. 
</P>
<P>
 They said, for example, that it would be onerous and damaging to business to 
require mail-order companies to break their sales tax receipts into 469 
municipal increments, instead of into the current 58 county pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the amount of pooled money were reduced, it is unclear how much would 
be shifted between cities and how much the additional accounting work would 
cost, Larry Micheli, supervisor of the board's local tax section. 
</P>
<P>
 Micheli, who is not related to the manufacturer's association official, also 
suggested that firms such as Municipal Resource Consultants stand to gain if 
money is taken out of the pools. The firms would then be paid by cities to 
fight for the funds, Micheli said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Austin, a partner in Municipal Resource Consultants, said his firm will 
receive no direct benefit if the state changes the way it disburses sales 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Equalization discussion comes less than a month after the state 
Assembly suspended another proposal that would have changed the way cities 
divide sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma) had proposed that the current sales tax 
distribution remain the same, but that any future increases be distributed 
based on population. Brown argued that this would help all cities maintain 
services better and reduce the drive to build auto and shopping malls and other 
big tax generators that she said have been built at the expense of more 
necessary developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Sherman, chairman of the Board of Equalization, has also proposed a 
fundamental reconfiguration of the state's sales tax distributions. Sherman, 
who is facing Elder and four others in the June primary, said the taxes should 
be disbursed based on the size of cities' populations and their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should get away from where a sale takes place and pay attention to city's 
expenses," which typically grow along with population and working population, 
Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said his proposal would require legislative changes and perhaps a 
state constitutional amendment. He said the shift would be worthwhile in 
helping promote housing, manufacturing and other developments that are 
typically not big sales tax producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder argues that the goals can be achieved more simply by reining in the 
current tax pooling system. Taking Back the Taxes

 Taxpayer and manufacturer groups say several California cities would gain 
millions of dollars in sales taxes each year if a state policy were changed to 
allow the funds to be directed to manufacturers' communities. Here are some 
estimates of how much some cities in Los Angeles County would gain: 02,14,16

BILL BOYARSKY: A LESSON IN COMPROMISE OVER CONFLICT

 When Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg was in the middle of the 
recent budget fight, she remembered something her mother once told her: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't always assume you have all the answers and that other guy is just 
stupid. Because frequently, you don't have all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the liberal first-year legislator, threading her way through the 
thicket of City Council egos, helped win modest increases for parks, libraries 
and other social services despite a budget weighted heavily in favor of Mayor 
Richard Riordan's promise to put more cops on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, we sat in her second-floor City Hall office and talked 
about this small victory. Goldberg is a warm, friendly woman who received rough 
lessons in political combat on the Los Angeles Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned after a very bad start in my first year in office in the school 
district that you are much better off working things out with your colleagues," 
she said. "Winning and losing is not the best way to get something done. Make 
people not feel they've lost, but there's more than one approach to achieve 
similar ends. And that was what I was trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her biggest challenge involved a controversial $5-million mayoral request for 
Hope in Youth, an anti-gang organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its innocuous name and noble purpose, Hope in Youth has become 
synonymous with political trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is strongly backed by Protestant, Jewish and Catholic 
religious leaders, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. In addition, Hope in 
Youth musters support in poor, gang-ridden neighborhoods from several community 
organizations based in Catholic parishes. These groups are affiliated with the 
Industrial Areas Foundation, which organizes poor people to raise hell with the 
rich and powerful, whether they run big corporations or are elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was an early Hope in Youth backer. I remember when he was running for 
mayor last year, he appeared before the Industrial Areas Foundation group in 
the San Fernando Valley. When the organization leaders demanded that he give 
Hope in Youth $2.5 million in city funds if he were elected, he said no. Boos 
echoed through the Cal State Northridge auditorium until Riordan, looking smug 
as a rich uncle, said he'd make it $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth operates from churches and synagogues, with four-member teams 
that counsel the entire family, rather than just the gang member. And rather 
than concentrating its efforts in one area, as do many anti-gang organizations, 
Hope in Youth is extending throughout L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's request was soon in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the enterprise and the big appropriation drew opposition from 
older anti-gang organizations who wanted the money for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also religious and racial factors. Although Hope in Youth is a 
multiracial organization, Latinos predominate. Thus African American/Latino 
rivalry became part of the dispute. And although leaders of several religions 
are involved in Hope in Youth, the Catholic Church is the dominant force. This 
turned off council members worried about the church having too much power. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountability was another factor. Critics demanded proof of what Hope in 
Youth had accomplished since last year, when the council gave it $2.5 million. 
Hope in Youth said it was too early to provide the reports that council members 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a number of council members didn't like the heavy lobbying by Hope in 
Youth advocates. Although council members put up with lobbying from the worst 
sort of campaign-contributing sleazebags, let a priest make a phone call for 
Hope in Youth and they're offended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Goldberg proposed was a solution that her mother might have devised. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than joining Hope in Youth's fierce critics on the council, she urged 
her colleagues to give the organization a chance to compete with other 
anti-gang groups for the money. "I am not hostile to Hope in Youth," she said. 
"My motion said . . . you can have more money if you win the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Her proposal passed despite Hope in Youth's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Mayor Riordan may veto her proposal, along with the Goldberg 
measures to increase parks, library and social service funding. But maybe not. 
For she gets along pretty well with the mayor. "I think there are some people 
who have wanted me to go out of my way to be critical of him. I don't see any 
value in that, although I was certainly critical of things in his budget. But I 
assume goodwill on his part and I haven't seen anything to make me think 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 To a hard-ass politician, this may sound like a wimp talking. But to me, it 
sounds like smart politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual meeting of the Fired Managers of the California Angels Assn. is in 
session. A group of middle-aged men are sitting in rocking chairs, gathered 
around a large television screen, watching the Angels play the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them laugh. Others curse. A couple shoot spit wads at the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 All of sudden, there's a knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookie Rojas: "Hey, that must be Buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Rader: "Well, how about that. Let's hear it for Cookie Bleeping Rojas, 
Rocket Scientist. Of course it's Buck, fungo head. Who else is it gonna be? 
Marcel Lachemann?" 
</P>
<P>
 The room falls silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Naw. No way. You guys are crazy if you think . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Garcia: "You never know. There's a Bavasi in charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "But it hasn't been a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Moose Stubing: "I only lasted eight games." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Yeah. And how many did you win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stubing: "Um, none." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Well, there you go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fregosi: "Moose, what the hell are you doing here? You know the rules: No 
interim guys allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubing: "They hired me to tend bar this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "Oh good. I'll have a V.O. and 7, Moose." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubing: "I was 0 and 8." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Williams: "We know, we know." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rigney: "I'll have a sherry." 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Sherry: "Somebody call me?" 
</P>
<P>
 There's another knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Winkles: "Will somebody get that already?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Yeah. But let's make him say the password, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "Oh, this'll be great. I love this part." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader and Fregosi tip-toe to the door and crouch beneath the peephole. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader (calling out): "What's the secret password?" 
</P>
<P>
 Voice from the other side of the door: "C'mon, you guys. Let me in. You know 
who it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "Not until you say the secret password." 
</P>
<P>
 Voice from the other side of the door (sighs): "I can't bleeping believe this. 
. . . Oh, all right. 'I Wanted This Job For Only One Reason -- To Win One For 
The Cowboy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Hee, hee, hee. That always slays me. . . . OK, let him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi (opening the door): "Why, Buck. What a surprise. What kept you so 
long?" 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers: "Everybody's a wise guy. Don't you have a game to manage or 
something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "Not today. We're idle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "I know. I've seen the standings." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams: "Come on in, Buck. Man, I haven't seen you since the annual meeting 
of the Fired Managers of the Montreal Expos Assn. What you been up to, big 
guy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Aw, you know. Trying to find a cure for cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The room erupts in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "So we've heard. Which reminds me. The guys chipped in and got you 
this. It's nothing, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "It's a blank piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "I know, I know. Now look on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers (reading aloud): " 'Everything I Know About The Game Of Baseball. By 
Richard Brown.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Hee, hee, hee. Isn't that great?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: "Mike Port helped us with that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "Have a seat, Buck. We've got the game on the big screen, Moose is 
mixing drinks, we're just getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Who's winning?" 
</P>
<P>
 Winkles: "We are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry: "You mean they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: "Angels, 1-0. Langston's pitching a helluva game." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams: "Criminy. I still can't believe it. That weenie has a job, Buck, and 
you and I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Baseball's a funny game, Dick." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams: "Ain't that the truth. . . . Oh, sorry, Buck. Sore subject, I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Why do you have that huge photo of Gene Mauch hanging over the 
fireplace?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "He's our hero. Did two tours of duty, lived to tell about it, was 
never fired. Resigned both times. Went out on his own terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Wow." 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: "He won two division titles, too. And lasted 711 games, more than 
anyone here except Rigs. And, he recommended me to replace him in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "Two out of three ain't bad, Cookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "OK, you guys. Everybody's here. Time for 'What's My Crime?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Oh good. I love this part." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "We do this every year, Buck. It's always a hoot. We go around the 
room, and every guy has to give the quote-unquote 'reason' he was fired. OK, 
Buck, we'll start with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: " 'Too honest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: " 'Too stubborn.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 Winkles: " 'Too nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams: " 'Too tough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry: " 'Too nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: " 'Too tough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia: " 'Too nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: " 'Two trips to the mound in the same inning without realizing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The room erupts in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "I still can't believe that one. Way to go, Cookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubing: "He also let one game start with only eight guys on the field. Devon 
White was on the phone in the clubhouse. Mike Witt threw the first pitch before 
he realized he had no center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "How many games you last, Cookie?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: "154. Hey, that's more than Sherry. Garcia, too. So get off my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "OK. OK. How many guys here were fired by a Bavasi?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia: "I was!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "I was!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "I was!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "Hee, hee, hee. I love these meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "You know, you really got to change that password. Win One For The 
Cowboy? Hell, the Cowboy claims he didn't even know he fired me. I got the ax 
on a Tuesday, Cowboy says he didn't find out until Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "He always says that. It's never his decision. You ought to know that 
by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "But, he said I was like a son to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi: "He said the same thing about me. And I won a division title for him. 
The first one he ever had. Eighteen months later, I'm outta there. History." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "Poor Lach." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "That reminds me. Moose, we need to order another rocking chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubing: "How soon?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "Hmmm. How long did you last, Buck? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers: "2 1/2 seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "And you, Doug?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: "2 1/2 seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigney: "August, 1997, ought to do it then. You can practically set your watch 
to those bozos." 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas: "I sure hope Lach knows about that too-many-trips-to-the-mound rule. 
Maybe I better give him a call."

MERCEDES HITS GASOLINE ALLEY; INDY 500: PARTNERSHIP WITH PENSKE AND ILMOR PUTS 
TWO CARS ON FRONT ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last six Indianapolis 500s, Chevrolet Indy V-8 engines, designed and 
built by Ilmor Engineering of Brixworth, England, have powered the winning car. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Chevy is gone, having taken its name and its bow-tie insignia from 
the nameplate of the Ilmor engines. Its one-quarter partnership in Ilmor with 
Roger Penske and engineers Mario Illien and Paul Morgan went up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes-Benz, seeking to expand its luxury car market in the United States by 
participating in the world's largest single-day sporting event, bought in. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate result? The silver star nameplate is on two-thirds of the front 
row for Sunday's race. Al Unser Jr. is on the pole and defending champion 
Emerson Fittipaldi on the outside of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely predicted sweep of the front row by Penske's red-and-white cars 
failed to materialize when the third driver, Paul Tracy, crashed on May 13, the 
day before qualificationruns began, and was unable to participate in pole 
qualifying. He will start 25th. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chevrolet and Mercedes-Benz have taken the glory, the operative names 
in the engine programs are Ilmor and Penske. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske put together the original Ilmor team in 1984, with financial support 
from General Motors, and he came up with the idea of building a one-race engine 
for this year's Indianapolis 500, an idea he sold to Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a one-race engine can be traced to Indy car racing's separate 
governing bodies. Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) sanctions all Indy car 
races except the Indianapolis 500, which remains under the control of the U.S. 
Auto Club (USAC). So when it comes to the Indy 500, the rules are different. 
One Indy 500 rule allows stock-block engines 10 more inches of manifold 
pressure -- called boost -- from the turbocharger than conventional 
double-overhead cam racing power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Buick, with its V-6 power plant, had demonstrated that 
stock-block engines were fast, having put Roberto Guerrero and Pancho Carter on 
the pole with record speeds. But those engines had shown a distinct lack of 
reliability over 500 miles. Only once has a Buick completed 500 miles, when Al 
Unser finished third in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buicks had been highly modified versions of passenger car stock-block 
push-rod engines, put in racing trim by Jim Wright of Brayton Engineering in 
Coldwater, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske, known for seeking the "unfair advantage" since his early days with 
engineer-driver Mark Donohue, decided to go one step farther. He would have 
Ilmor design and build a push-rod engine within USAC regulations for the Indy 
500 only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Penske, Illien and Morgan) sat down after last year's race and discussed 
the idea of building a push-rod engine for this year's race," Penske said. "We 
knew we would be taking a calculated risk -- Indy has not been kind to new 
engines -- but we felt the potential to gain an edge was enough to take the 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 1107 in the USAC regulations, allowing a 209 cubic-inch displacement 
stock-block push-rod engine, had been in the books for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the rule and knowing that we had companies such as Honda and 
Toyota and certainly Ford going forward in this business, (we knew) there was 
going to be an innovation and someone had to get there first," Penske said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloaked in secrecy, the project went from the discussion stage to drawings to 
castings and onto the dynamometer -- a device that measures an engine's power 
-- in 25 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started work, it was imperative that word not get out or one of the 
other manufacturers might have followed suit," Penske said. "I sat down with 
the team in small groups and said, 'Guys, if you talk about this to anyone, 
it's just like cutting a piece of your paycheck off.' They got the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the castings started last September and the first engine was fired up 
on the dyno in January. In midwinter, the engine was tested in a chassis at 
Penske's Michigan and Nazareth, Pa., raceways. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, there was no Mercedes-Benz involvement. Although Chevrolet had 
been part of the Ilmor team when the project was started, the GM company had no 
interest in it because the decision had since been made to drop out of Indy car 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes got into the picture -- although not the stock-block project -- last 
November, through Formula One. The German Sauber team hired Ilmor to produce a 
V-10 "Mercedes" engine for this year's Grand Prix season. Then when 
Mercedes-Benz assumed General Motors' one-fourth equity in Ilmor Engineering, 
it also meant that the German nameplate would be used on the four-valve Indy 
car engine to be built by Ilmor for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven cars -- driven by Arie Luyendyk, Teo Fabi, Stefan Johansson, Bobby 
Rahal, Mike Groff, John Paul Jr. and rookie Adrian Fernandez -- will be powered 
by Ilmor racing engines in this 500. Two other Ilmor-powered cars, driven by 
Fittipaldi and Unser Jr., were winners in CART-sanctioned races at Phoenix and 
Long Beach, respectively. Last year, they would have been called Chevrolets. 
Next year they will be Mercedeses. But in this transitional year they are 
Ilmors. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last month, Penske went to Mercedes-Benz headquarters in Stuttgart, 
Germany, and convinced CEO Helmut Werner that his company should be part of the 
1994 push-rod project and on April 13 it was announced that Penske, Ilmor and 
Mercedes-Benz were jointly launching a program for Indy. 
</P>
<P>
 The words were barely out of Penske's mouth when the howling started. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a brainless idea that is (to allow Penske such an advantage)," said 
Nigel Mansell, the PPG Cup Indy car champion who nearly won last year's Indy 
500 in his first try. "I mean, how the hell can you give them 10 inches more 
turbo boost. That guarantees them 150 to 200 horsepower more." 
</P>
<P>
 When the three Penske cars were running 230 m.p.h. or close to it during the 
first week of practice, it was widely speculated by other teams that they were 
holding back, sandbagging, until the time trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Unser's 228.011 m.p.h. was the best speed they could muster on 
qualifying day, there were rumors that Penske was still not showing his hand, 
waiting until race day to unleash all the new-found power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the rule was put in to create a prototype, and that's what 
Penske has done," car owner Derrick Walker said. "Roger is the only guy on the 
pit lane who has the resources to develop a project like that. The rule is 
absolutely the dumbest thing we've got. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Penskes will be running a mile or two faster than the rest of us in the 
race. I know it's the first race for the Mercedes engine, but Roger wouldn't be 
putting all his eggs in it if he weren't sure of its reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure the reliability of running 500 miles at 200 m.p.h., Penske and Ilmor 
have pushed the project to its limits. On May 8, the day the Speedway opened 
for practice, Unser was at Michigan, running a 520-mile full-race test under 
the watchful eye of Penske. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run what we call a 'probe test,' " Penske said. "That's where you run 
something harder than you have to run it in a race. We've run the new engine in 
probe testing many times over 400 miles. When Junior ran those 520 miles at 
Michigan with no yellows -- you fill it up with fuel and run full tanks down to 
empty and just keep doing that until you finish it -- that's pretty tough on 
the motor, and it came through it perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi raised a few eyebrows last week when he had a trap speed of 245 
m.p.h. during a lap of only 226 m.p.h. It even raised Fittipaldi's eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two forty-five?" he said with a surprised look. "That's faster than I ever 
expected to go. Please don't tell me what it was in kilometers. It might scare 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The defending 500 champion then explained the problems faced by the Penskes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important, the handling," he said. "The engine is very good and the 
horsepower is there, but the power is good only if you can get it through the 
corners. There has been so much attention paid to the motor that now we must 
find the perfect chassis." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Penske chassis had already been developed when it was decided to 
build the push-rod engine. Because of different engine configurations, the 
chassis had to be modified and a different transmission built to handle the 
209-c.i.d. engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could come out of here with some pretty long faces come race day," Penske 
said. "But I'm proud of what we're trying to accomplish. I'm not sure we'll win 
the race but we've got a plan. That's where we want to be."

WORLD CUP '94: 23 DAYS AND COUNTING; ROMANIA'S UNTAPPED TREASURE; SOCCER: HAGI, 
A TEMPERAMENTAL STAR, HAS ONE FINAL CHANCE TO PROVE HIS ABILITY TO THE WORLD. 
</P>

<P>
 It is a rainy-misty morning in late spring and at the Stadio Comunale a 
mongrel puppy is racing around the soccer field where Brescia's second division 
team is practicing. The players are halfheartedly stretching on the grass, and 
-- grateful for the diversion -- allow the puppy to clamber over them with his 
muddy paws. 
</P>
<P>
 The brown and black dog, Rocky, belongs to someone who works at the stadium 
and the players accept him as a mascot, boxing his ears and playfully tugging 
his wagging tail. 
</P>
<P>
 One player does not join in. He is small and dark and wiry, and wears a wool 
headband that covers the tips of his ears. He is off to the side, kicking a 
soccer ball very hard toward a goal from extreme angles. And he is hitting the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Gheorghe Hagi, the best player ever produced by Romania. He has been 
nicknamed "the Maradona of the Carpathians" for his superb dribbling skills. At 
29, he has been a part of the Romanian national team for a decade. Romania will 
play in Group A with the United States in the World Cup and it is Hagi whom 
defenders on the U.S. national team will chase on June 26 when the teams meet 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Hagi is being chased by Brescia's Romanian coach, Mircea Lucescu. 
Hagi is in Lucescu's doghouse and the new accommodations don't suit him. 
Lucescu benched him in a league game a few days ago and Hagi is pouting. In two 
years with the Italian club, he had never sat out a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-suffering Lucescu has about lost patience with his star, whose talent 
is undeniable but whose temperament gives coaches fits. A week before, Brescia 
had generously released Hagi to attend a Romanian World Cup warm-up game in 
Bucharest. The club's gesture was all the more indulgent, given the fact that 
Hagi -- who is the Romanian captain -- was not eligible to play because he had 
been expelled from a previous match for spitting at an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even given his spectator status, Hagi managed to return to Brescia a day late 
and skipped a practice. Lucescu decided to teach him a lesson, but Hagi chose 
not to learn it. So they are squabbling. And today there is a new source of 
tension. Even though Hagi had previously agreed to sit for an interview, now he 
doesn't feel like it. Nothing personal -- it's been four months since he's 
spoken to local reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucescu has talked during the brief practice and now it's Hagi's turn. The 
coach calls to Hagi and the player ignores him. Lucescu yells at Hagi in 
Romanian and Hagi fires back. Hagi starts down a flight of stairs and Lucescu 
gives chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi has been told that if he does not give the interview he will be fined. 
That threat, and another angry confrontation, brings Hagi to a small room under 
the stadium to discuss his brilliant but enigmatic career. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a compact man whose black jeans and leather jacket complement his 
closely cropped black hair and dark glowering eyes. The interview begins 
uncomfortably, but Hagi relaxes and -- once -- even smiles and laughs. Under 30 
but a professional since he was 13, Hagi understands that this World Cup will 
be his last chance on such an international stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucescu, who was captain of Romania's 1970 World Cup team and a national 
coach, has been using every coaching trick he knows to motivate the stubborn 
and, he says, lazy Hagi to raise his game to the level most of the soccer world 
believes he can achieve. Lucescu is candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great player without much of a work ethic," Lucescu said. "He could 
be the best player in the world, after (Diego) Maradona. If he changes his mind 
set, he could be one of the best players in the World Cup. I've tried to 
motivate him. I've tried to anger him. I want him to react. It is his last 
chance to be seen as a great player. We are trying to get him to understand 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi is familiar with the criticism. Romania's loss in the second round in the 
1990 World Cup was considered a failure and, in the public mind, much of the 
responsibility was Hagi's. The midfielder never appears to give on the field as 
he seems to be able. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Romania's soccer history, Hagi's generation of players has been given 
little guidance and precious little sense of continuity. Ultimately, Hagi's 
development might have been retarded by the lavish attention paid to soccer by 
Romania's former dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. Ceausescu and his son, Valentin, 
adopted certain teams and saw to it that they were successful. Valentin's club 
was the powerful army team, Steaua Bucharest. Together, the Ceausescus acted as 
informal heads of soccer in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi was a star player who didn't work hard," Lucescu said. "He was a 
favorite of the Ceausescus. The team did well without having to try hard. They 
always won. (Because of this) he didn't improve. Here, he has difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 In a corrupt system where results were a foregone conclusion, Hagi never 
explored his potential. Why put out the effort when it isn't necessary? One 
commonly heard story about that era of Romanian soccer concerns a team in 
Ceausescu's hometown vying for promotion from the third to second division. The 
team needed an improbable 17 goals in its final game to earn the promotion. It 
scored 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin knew how to cultivate players. Steaua's players were well trained and 
well cared for, afforded privileges that few in Romania's crumbling economy 
could afford. The club enjoyed three undefeated seasons and had nine players on 
the 1990 World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi was snatched up by Steaua when Valentin Ceausescu determined he needed 
the rising star for a European Cup match in 1986. According to Lucescu, Steaua 
got Hagi on loan from Sportul Studentesc, and never gave him back or paid the 
club for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of soccer from that era is still being felt in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Ceausescu regime, soccer players were viewed as national treasures 
and were not allowed to be exported. No one in the government wanted young 
players exposed to other systems, lest their "new ideas" infect the rest of 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ceausescu's overthrow and execution in 1989, a new attitude developed. 
Soccer players were still seen as natural resources, but as such, they were 
valuable commodities to be sold on the now-open market. After the country's 
return to the World Cup finals in 1990 for the first time in 20 years, many of 
the most promising young players in Romania were sold in a frenzy of profit 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi was sold to Real Madrid for $3.5 million in 1990. Hard currency was a 
higher priority than sports development. But money wasn't the only objective. 
Some players were transferred for food or commodities that could be resold. One 
club swapped a player for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-sighted policy may have yielded immediate profit to club owners, but 
the talent drain bankrupted Romania's development programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change came when they sold all of those players," Lucescu said. "There 
were no players left behind. It's difficult to build a national youth team if 
all the players are abroad. So our young players have little experience because 
all the old players come back (to play on the national team) and there is no 
place for the young ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucescu estimated that 200 Romanian players from all levels were sold in the 
chaos after Ceausescu's assassination. With the best players playing abroad, 
the standard of the game in Romania began to drop. So did the sport's 
popularity. Lucescu said that Romanian league games used to draw 40,000 fans. 
Now, the figure has dwindled to about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has to do something important in the World Cup, otherwise the 
future of the sport is not good," Lucescu said. "If the national team does well 
in the United States, it can get young people interested in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Romanian World Cup team gets mixed reviews with this being the standard 
critique: talented individual players who don't work well together and who, 
although capable of brilliance, don't always give their best effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have good days and bad days," Hagi acknowledges. "We must try to 
develop a mentality where we play on a consistent level. We know we are a good 
team, but we are not the kind of team the other teams are frightened of. We 
have to show this in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to play this rough-tough football. We want to play in a 
pleasing style. We don't want this problem where you don't score goals, 
especially in the United States. Americans love a show, don't they?"

MIKE DOWNEY: ARUM ON BOXING: NO PUNCHES PULLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Arum is a busy guy. The boxing promoter keeps busy . . . uh, promoting. I 
have seen him do one-on-ones this week with everybody but Ricki Lake and Chuck 
Woolery. 
</P>
<P>
 He is hawking a pay-per-view prizefight night -- a good one, I must admit -- 
with Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones and others coming up Friday from the MGM 
Grand. Word-of-mouth is vital to Bob and to boxing. Viva voce Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it turns out Arum's organization, Top Rank, also is delving into 
something new -- basketball. Top Rank of Louisiana boxed out all the other 
bidders to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves of the NBA, who will be moved lock, 
stock and jocks to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great boxing town, too, New Orleans," Arum mentioned in passing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great anything town. A guy I know has this theory that every sporting 
event on earth should be held in New Orleans. Not only the Super Bowl or NCAA 
basketball, but I mean everything -- the British Open, the Iditarod sled-dog 
race, Wimbledon, the Indy 500, everything.  
</P>
<P>
 Works for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what it means to miss New Orleans. I used to go to NBA games there, 
back before the Jazz moved to the town that most everyone in the music business 
naturally associates with be-bop, Dixieland, rhythm, blues and progressive 
jazz, yes, Funkytown itself, Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans is hot stuff. It was made for basketball. I even have a name 
picked out for its new team, the Louisiana Gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Bob Arum is concentrating on boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love team sports, but in team sports, no one ever takes the blame for 
anything," Arum said. "It's always, 'Somebody didn't pass me the ball enough.' 
'Somebody was hurt.' 'Somebody didn't guard his man.' That's why I prefer 
boxing. You're all alone out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, maybe, Bob. But at least in basketball, when the action stops, you know 
who won. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing is beset with BS, as usual. Judging is a joke. Had one injudicious 
judge not taken it upon himself to score a round 10-10 in which there had been 
a knockdown, Evander Holyfield would still be heavyweight champion of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum said: "I've been in this business a long time and I've never seen 
anything like that. There's not even a consensus on how to score any more. Guys 
are inventing new rules as they go along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been happening in boxing to turn the public off. It's having a 
horrible effect on many fronts, especially with the TV networks. We've had 
horrid decisions, several items of chicanery, the attempt to take Buster 
Douglas' title away from him after he beat Mike Tyson fair and square, the 
Chavez-Whitaker decision, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I see these bad things happening, the more determined it makes me to 
do things the right way. We've got to give the public fair fights." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Arum is counting on a controversy-free show this week. It 
probably will be, Julio Cesar Chavez not being on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio Campanella, an unbeaten Italian stallion -- well, maybe more of a 
Shetland -- figures to be the toughest test yet for De La Hoya, the 
junior-lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, Rafael Ruelas and Danny Romero also will put their middleweight, 
lightweight and flyweight belts on the line. Ruelas is still eager to face De 
La Hoya in a bout between men who have L.A. in both their backgrounds and 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 But what, no heavyweights? 
</P>
<P>
 "The heavyweight division is in complete disarray," Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, there's not enough talent. No. 2, the fighters, because they don't 
have to make weight, let themselves get completely out of shape, with a very 
few exceptions such as Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riddick Bowe isn't charismatic. Lennox Lewis is ponderously slow. Michael 
Moorer is very, very suspect. Holyfield is history. Nobody young is showing me 
much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 I thought this over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, Bob, give me your opinion on something," I said. "You've been in boxing 
awhile. In your opinion, who will be the next heavyweight champion of the 
world?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arum thought this over, but not very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really want to know?" he asked. "OK, I'll tell you. The next heavyweight 
champion of the world will be a 46-year-old man with a rather large frame." 
</P>
<P>
 "George Foreman?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Foreman," Arum said. "I think George is going to fight Moorer sometime 
in November and I think George is going to take him. That should give you some 
idea of what shape heavyweight boxing is in today."

TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND; CAPRIATIS' AGE-LIMIT VIEWS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati and her parents have been asked to testify next month before 
a special panel considering whether to increase the minimum age on the women's 
tennis tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's Age Eligibility Commission, chaired by UCLA sports-medicine 
specialist Carol Otis, also has solicited views from Tracy Austin, Andrea 
Jaeger, Steffi Graf, Gabriela Sabatini, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and 
Billie Jean King. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would very much like to hear from Jennifer, but we're not sure that will 
happen," Anne Worcester, Women's Tennis Council managing director, said Tuesday 
at the French Open in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's arrest for alleged marijuana possession last week in Florida has 
resulted in a debate on the handling of young tennis stars. Capriati, 18, 
turned professional at 13 but has been off the tour since August. She is 
undergoing treatment at a drug rehabilitation clinic in Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly Jennifer's decision to take a leave of absence from the tour and the 
most recent incidents have heightened the visibility and exposure of the age 
issue," Worcester said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Capriati was allowed to play her first professional tournament three 
weeks before her 14th birthday when WTC officials made an exception to their 
guidelines. The panel is debating the merits of increasing the minimum age from 
13 years 11 months to 15 or older. It also is considering restricting the 
number and level of tournaments a player can enter each year. The panel hopes 
to make recommendations for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just looking at the age minimum, but the whole issue of promoting 
career longevity and minimizing the effects of over-training,' Worcester said. 
"There are no foregone conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Worchester also said Capriati would not be sanctioned for her recent actions, 
even though the sport's broad conduct rules could be applied to her situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supporting Jennifer and glad she's seeking help," she said. "Suspension 
would be absolutely out of the question. We're not happy it happened and it 
doesn't reflect positively on women's tennis. We've never had a case like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Venus Williams, widely heralded as the next big star of women's tennis, is 
expected to make her WTA Tour debut in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles Aug. 
8-14 at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Richard, said he will seek a wild-card entry for his daughter if 
she maintains high marks in her schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6-feet-2 and 130 pounds, was born in Long Beach and grew up in 
Compton before moving with her family to Florida almost three years ago. She 
will turn 14 on June 17.

PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR ROCKETS' OLAJUWON; PRO BASKETBALL: TWO YEARS AFTER FUROR 
INVOLVING TEAM OWNER, HE BECOMES THE FIRST CENTER SINCE 1983 TO BE VOTED THE 
LEAGUE'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the Houston Rockets accused Hakeem Olajuwon of faking an 
injury and he called the owner of the team "a coward," and the owner almost 
traded him, this day seemed a long way away. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the NBA chose Olajuwon as its most valuable player, making him the 
latest in the line of Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry 
Bird. Olajuwon has a friendly new boss, owner Leslie Alexander, and contract 
extension that will put his annual salary in the $6-million range. He has a 
team in the Western Conference finals. He can barely remember two years back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can predict the future," he said. "Wherever you are, you just try to 
do your best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, when I was planning to play for another team -- that summer I 
was working on my game, knowing that wherever I am, I really wanted to do my 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding himself, instead, still in Houston, Olajuwon made peace with owner 
Charlie Thomas and embarked upon a monster 1992-93 season, showing a serenity, 
not to mention a willingness to pass the ball, that had been missing. He became 
a devout Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley beat him for the '93 MVP award, 59 first-place votes to 22, but 
Olajuwon passed Jordan, who had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 If Barkley had been 1993's sentimental favorite, Olajuwon became this season's 
heir apparent, based on a largely ignored career in which he had averaged 23 
points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson's surge made him a candidate -- Sports Illustrated put Robinson 
on its cover with the headline: "Mr. MVP" -- but Olajuwon's season and the 
Rockets' first-place finish won out. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon averaged 27 points, third in the league; 12 rebounds, fourth; 3.7 
blocks, second, and had a career-high 3.6 assists per game. He was voted the 
league's best defensive player for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the MVP balloting, Olajuwon had 66 first-place votes to Robinson's 24. 
Scottie Pippen had seven, Shaquille O'Neal three and Patrick Ewing one. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon becomes the first center to win the award since Moses Malone when he 
was with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't really surprise me," Utah forward Karl Malone said. "I think he 
definitely deserved it. MVP to me is when someone puts the whole team on their 
shoulders and carries them to another level, and that's what he's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olajuwon: "I'm just grateful and happy, just to be mentioned. . . . I was 
just happy having fun, to play the game the way I know how, doing my best, in 
the off-season working on my game, enjoying playing basketball. To me, I would 
not consider it hard work because I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 If he wins a championship, the long-bypassed Olajuwon has a chance to join 
Jordan, Barkley and O'Neal in merchandising heaven. Olajuwon has little more 
than a sneaker deal now, but is willing to surrender some of his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is guaranteed," he said. "But if you show it to me on paper, I will 
sign it."

LONGSHOT U.S. TEAM TO SEEK SOLUTIONS AGAINST EVEN LONGER SHOT SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For players on the U.S. soccer team, today offers a rare opportunity to play 
against a team that figures to have less chance to succeed in the World Cup 
than they do. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of its final exhibitions before opening World Cup play on June 18 
against Switzerland, the United States meets perhaps the longest of the 
longshots, Saudi Arabia, at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on the World Cup, U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic said the result of the 
game is of secondary importance to the ongoing search for the right players to 
fit into the right system. He has returned at least temporarily to a four-man 
defense after an experiment with a five-man defense resulted in a 3-2 loss 
Saturday to Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find out what's better," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Striker Frank Klopas, who has scored six goals in six games, will try to 
become only the second American to score in three consecutive full 
international games. Forward Roy Wegerle, recovering from the third 
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee since January, might be used in a 
reserve role. RANDY HARVEY

SADDLEBACK COLLEGE IS TARGETED IN $6.25-MILLION DAMAGE CLAIM; JURISPRUDENCE: 
TEEN RUNNER HURT AFTER BEING HIT WITH A GOLF BALL ON THE SCHOOL'S TRACK SEEKS 
AN AWARD FOR LOST EYE, FUTURE ENDORSEMENT INCOME.

 Attorneys for Lake Forest track prodigy Ashley Bethel have filed a 
$6.25-million claim against Saddleback College for damages relating to a Feb. 
23 accident in which the 14-year-old lost her right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, a two-time national youth pentathlon champion and aspiring Olympian, 
was running on the Saddleback track when she was struck on the eye by a golf 
ball hit from the adjacent driving range. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, an eighth-grader at Los Alisos Intermediate School, had the eye 
removed, and she is in the process of being fitted for a glass prosthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Crandall, a partner in the Irvine firm of Hill, Genson, Even, Crandall & 
Wade, alleges the school "recklessly and/or negligently designed, built, 
managed and maintained a golf range adjacent to the athletic field, and knew or 
should have known that golf balls from the range fell onto the athletic field, 
posing risk of serious injury to athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Also listed as claimants are Skip Bethel, Ashley's father, Jason Bethel, 
Ashley's brother, and Dana and Morgan Bethel, Ashley's sisters. Crandall said 
the family members, who witnessed the accident, should be compensated for shock 
and emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall and attorney Linda Cummings filed the claim with the State Board of 
Control in Sacramento. The board has 60 days to act on the claim, after which 
Crandall said he will file a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical loss of an eye is worth a couple million dollars alone," 
Crandall said. "Secondly, the biggest part of the case is the loss of future 
endorsement income if she doesn't become the Olympic-caliber athlete she was 
expected to become." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kelly, vice chancellor of student services at Saddleback, said he 
expected the legal action but couldn't discuss specifics of the case. Following 
the accident, the school shut down the right third of the range, from where the 
ball that hit Bethel was likely struck, until 6 p.m. and closed the track after 
6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is really a tragedy, but our attorneys will handle it from 
here," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ric Ottaiano of the Santa Ana-based law firm of Lynberg & Watkins, which is 
representing the Saddleback College District, said he hasn't completed his 
investigation into the facts and circumstances around the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be premature for me to stake out a position at this point," Ottaiano 
said. "Until we pin down the facts, it's difficult to determine who's 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, whose top long jump mark of 19 feet 7 1/4 inches as a 13-year-old last 
summer would have placed her second in the 1993 California State high school 
girls' meet, returned to competition in April and has participated in four 
meets in the last five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Skip Bethel, who is also Ashley's coach, said Ashley's times and marks 
have been well off her usual results, and she has had trouble adapting to her 
loss of depth perception. Bethel has moved his track club, the Silver Wings, 
from Saddleback College to Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I'm proud of is she's strong enough that she's really 
determined to do this," Skip Bethel said. "She has the willpower to keep going 
as hard as we've been pushing her." 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Bethel, Ashley's mother, said the family has been more focused on 
Ashley's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been rough," she said. "We've paid for two surgeries, but we want to 
make sure she's getting the best possible care without sparing the cost. We'll 
let the attorneys handle the rest of it."

BIG A RULING HAS BENEFITS FOR ANGELS, RAMS; COURTS: DECISION OKS A STADIUM 
HIGH-RISE FAVORED BY FOOTBALL TEAM AND GUARANTEES GROUND-LEVEL BASEBALL 
PARKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ruling in a decade-old battle among the California Angels, Los Angeles Rams 
and their host city, a state appellate court on Tuesday allowed a portion of a 
hotly disputed office project in Anaheim Stadium's parking lot to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment, issued by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, is 
Solomon-like: Everyone gets something. It allows a partnership involving the 
Rams football team to build a high-rise office complex in the stadium parking 
lot near Orangewood Avenue. But it also guarantees the Angels its 12,000 
ground-level parking spaces and eliminated another Rams project near State 
College Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision drew a mixed response from the various parties. Rams 
officials called the ruling "a clear victory" and "total defeat" for the 
Angels, while a top Angels executive said the club is "pleased" that the court 
affirmed the ballclub's right to have its parking spaces but disappointed that 
it granted permission for any parking lot project. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials took a conciliatory position on the court's ruling, issuing a 
carefully worded statement in an obvious effort not to offend either of its 
Anaheim Stadium tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Said City Manager James D. Ruth: "We are hopeful that the clarifications set 
forth (in the court's decision) today will provide the basis for the involved 
parties to end their longstanding dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what impact the ruling might have on the Rams, who have 
exercised an escape clause in their stadium lease and are looking for a more 
lucrative stadium deal with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are negotiating an extension of their stadium lease with the city. 
Team officials indicated that the development, if it goes ahead, would play a 
role in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, meanwhile, maintained that "the unanimous decision is a compromise 
between the position of the Angels and the positions of the city" and the Rams, 
according to a prepared statement from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is the latest development in a lawsuit that has cost more than $20 
million in legal fees -- one of the most expensive civil lawsuits involving a 
city in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for the Big A's parking lot began in 1984 when the city offered the 
Rams parking lot development rights as part of the deal to lure them to Anaheim 
and away from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Angels owner Gene Autry sued in Orange County Superior Court, 
challenging the city's right to enter into the high-rise office development 
deal with a partnership involving the owners of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $100-million suit, Autry contended that the city had "sold the same 
horse twice" because the Angels were leasing the stadium and its accompanying 
parking lots. The suit said Angel fans have a right to park in ground-level 
spaces, not in the parking garages that were to accompany the high rises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision issued in 1988, Superior Court Judge Frank Domenichini issued a 
permanent injunction barring development on the lot without the Angels' advance 
approval. The judge also ruled that the Angels have an absolute right to the 
12,000 ground-level parking spaces into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ruling affirmed Domenichini's decision with a few modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin, the court stated that the 
city could develop the Orangewood Avenue portion of the plan without infringing 
on the Angels' rights to its minimum 12,000 ground-level parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred E. Augustini, the attorney for the Rams development group, said the 
court's ruling is "a total and utter defeat" for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients are walking several feet above the ground right now," Augustini 
said. "It's been a long hard slog, but now we're ready to enjoy the fruits of 
our agreement with the city and develop Orangewood." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Rams development group -- called Anaheim Stadium Associates -- had 
always been willing to eliminate the State College development proposal if the 
Angels agreed to permit the construction near Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been offered in our settlement negotiations since the very beginning 
of this lawsuit," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium Associates is owned by Rams owner Georgia Frontiere, children 
of her late husband Carroll Rosenbloom, and developer Trammell Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients are glad it's over and the court of appeals put the final nail 
through this lawsuit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, he said, Anaheim Stadium Associates plans to proceed with the 
project, but the partnership was negotiating with city officials, who have 
offered to buy the group's development rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard M. Brown, the Angels president, said the Orangewood development "may 
not be a problem" in the team's lease negotiations if development of the lot 
"is compatible with a new, long-term arrangement, which the Angels and city are 
now discussing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels would not like to leave their home in Anaheim," Brown said, "but 
since the lease was entered into 30 years ago in 1964, many changes have 
occurred which require a new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of an Angels departure is troubling to city officials who are 
reeling from the actions taken by the Rams organization to possibly relocate to 
another city. 
</P>
<P>
 Angels' attorneys said Tuesday that no decision has been made on whether or 
not to appeal the court's ruling to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth, the city manager, said the city wants to "to put this litigation behind 
us and continue to negotiate a long-term agreement that will keep the Angels in 
Anaheim well beyond the year 2001, when their existing contract 
ends."CALIFORNIA ANGELS (BASEBALL TEAM)

A LIFETIME SENTENCE; POST OFFICE RAMPAGE SURVIVOR FEARS SHE'LL NEVER BE FREE OF 
ANGUISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For more than a year, Mark Richard Hilbun has remained behind bars, but for 
Kimberly Renee Springer, he is never far away, nor is the memory of May 6, 
1993. It was on that day that Springer's world, as she knew it, came crashing 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing just took me and knocked me right off the face of the earth," 
Springer said Tuesday in her first extensive interview since Hilbun's 38-hour 
rampage in which his own attorney admits he killed his mother and his best 
friend and tried in vain to kidnap Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 He had stalked her for more than a year and showed up at the Dana Point post 
office where both of them worked fully intending to take her away. Foiled in 
his attempt that Thursday morning, he continued his robbery and shooting spree 
before being arrested the following Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 40, faces two counts of murder, seven counts of attempted murder and 
one count of attempted kidnaping, and has pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, 30, faces what she sees as a lifetime of restoration and recovery, 
waking up from the nightmare that has given her what she and her therapist call 
an existence on permanent hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "My anxiety level is still way out there," she said, crying often, pacing and 
twisting her long fingers together as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 She feels anger, not only for Hilbun -- whose name she won't say, referring to 
him only as "that person" -- but also for her employer of five years, the U.S. 
Postal Service, and her union, the National Assn. of Letter Carriers. Springer 
recently filed a lawsuit against the union seeking $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 She also feels a deep-rooted survivor's guilt, she said, for the people who 
died or who suffered injury, such as Patricia Salot of Newport Beach, who took 
six shots, all because of a twisted passion felt for Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have asked her not to talk to other survivors, such as Salot, for 
fear of tainting potential testimony. But Springer said that only makes it 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken me a long time to get to the point where I can say, 'You're not 
really to blame.' The lives affected, the co-workers, even his close friends, 
his family, all the other people whose lives are affected . . . I can't stop 
thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting along better than I was, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice trailed off, as it often does, but it's better than it was, she 
said, noting that she could barely speak and then only mutter "Martian talk" in 
the hours and days after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, I can't do more than one thing at a time. I can't concentrate. And 
I'm always looking over my shoulder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Men with "salty, gray" hair, in particular -- the same color as Hilbun's -- 
send her into spasms of paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be outgoing, never fearful of things," she said. "I was easy about 
being alone, but now, I'll never live by myself. Never again. I can't be on my 
own. I just can't." 
</P>
<P>
 She lives with her grandparents, moving from Laguna Beach to their home in the 
country, and spends most of her time with a tight circle of friends, as well as 
her two sisters, a nephew and her parents, who still live in her hometown of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Dating -- even trusting men as friends -- is a thing of the past, she said, as 
are dreams of marriage and children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't trust them," she said of men. "I don't trust anybody really. 
It's hard. I'm just not ready for any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 With men, she said, there's always suspicion, the inescapable sense that "they 
want something more. I don't even think about that any more. It's no longer one 
of my interests." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time of the shootings, Springer had been dating a man, with whom 
she lived for a while and who, to no avail, she said, confronted Hilbun over 
the stalking. She and the man parted ways, and no one has replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Mead-Messinger, her therapist, whom Springer recently began seeing 
twice a week instead of five, said her client has moved "from a stage of shock 
to one of denial. She's only now beginning to accept what actually happened in 
Dana Point. So when you try to project her into the future . . . she just isn't 
there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mead-Messinger and Jack M. Earley, Springer's attorney, sat with her 
during Tuesday's interview at Earley's office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said the hardest times have been notable anniversaries -- such as 
Thanksgiving, 1993, because Hilbun was released from a mental hospital one year 
before, after being fired from the post office and then arrested for the first 
time for having violated a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hardest was May 6, 1994. She found herself thinking continuously of 
Charles T. Barbagallo, 42, Hilbun's best friend and one of her favorite 
co-workers, who died in the post office from a single shot between the eyes 
from a .22-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 In tearful desperation, she found herself calling radio station KLOS to 
request a song. She asked them to play John Lennon's "Imagine," which had been 
Barbagallo's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me what my name was," she said. "I told them, 'Renee,' and left it 
at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Small and thin with straw-blond hair and deep-set blue eyes, Springer said she 
has lost so much weight that she's down to a Size 4. Stress has complicated 
almost every facet of her life, she said, from the movie scenes she finds 
herself freaking out over to the fact that she can't fall asleep until 4 in the 
morning.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She tried working during January and February, even delivering letters on a 
route but got so sick to her stomach that she had to go home. She's at her 
grandparents' place now, collecting workers' compensation and hoping the civil 
and criminal courts give her a measure of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 She can't believe Hilbun won't be tried until early 1995 and complains that 
she and all of his other victims will have to delay peace of mind through one 
more grueling year. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her greatest fear is "him getting out . . . being sent to a mental 
hospital where he might escape." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she feels for women who have been stalked, who live "with this 
incredible feeling that someone out there is thinking about you constantly, and 
you're the reason they're doing everything they do. It just makes you crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer hopes her lawsuit results in "changes, rather than Band-Aids." She 
blames the Postal Service but particularly her union for "not protecting me 
when they promised they would." She also blames them for tending to blame her 
-- in Earley's words, for wanting to know what she did "to egg the guy on." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Postal Service officials and union representatives declined to discuss 
Springer's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of how the suit or Hilbun's trial turns out, Springer will 
never again be the person she was before. She might be a better person, her 
therapist says, but never the same. She dreams of leaving her native Orange 
County and moving far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to a low-key place where I'm not such a wreck any more. I'm 
hyper anyway, but this really kind of did it for me," she said, and for the 
first time all day, she managed a small laugh.

MAN TELLS OF FINDING HIS MISTRESS SLAIN; COURTS: TAIWANESE BUSINESSMAN 
TESTIFIES AT HEARING FOR WIFE, ACCUSED OF FATALLY STABBING THE WOMAN AND 
KILLING HER BABY. 
</P>

<P>
 When Taiwanese businessman Tseng (Jim) Peng arrived in Orange County to visit 
his mistress and their child, he found them slain in her apartment, Peng 
testified Tuesday at a preliminary hearing for his wife, who is charged with 
double murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Li-Yun (Lisa) Peng, 44, a Taiwanese national with a home in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, is accused of fatally stabbing Ranbing Jennifer Ji and of killing 
Ji's 5-month-old son on Aug. 18, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng, 50, said he went to Ji's Mission Viejo apartment after returning from 
Taiwan. Peng, who didn't have a key, waited all day in an apartment manager's 
office after repeated phone calls to Ji went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he testified, he tried the door and found it unlocked. When he turned 
on the lights, he saw Ji, 25, bloody and lying on the couch. Touching her 
shoulder, "I discovered that her body was already cold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their baby, Kevin, was later found by sheriff's deputies suffocated under a 
blanket in his crib. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng is charged with murder and with additional counts that could carry 
the death penalty. Prosecutors claim to have a crucial piece of evidence, a DNA 
sample from a bite mark on Ji's left arm, that links Lisa Peng to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife's arraignment, Jim Peng told reporters that he believed his 
wife of 21 years was innocent, and that she never knew he and Ji had conceived 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the witness stand in Municipal Court here, Jim Peng was a reluctant 
witness. But he did reveal that he met Ji in 1990 while on a business trip to 
China. They developed a romantic relationship and he hired her to help him 
start a new business in China, paying her $4,000 to $5,000 from his personal 
bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated questioning by the prosecutor, Peng admitted he had fathered 
Ji's son. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of paternity and Jim Peng's actions have come under fire by Ji's 
family, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court in February. Ji's 
parents, Zhuo Chuan Ji and Xiang Lan Liu of Qindao, China, are seeking $2 
million in punitive damages from Jim Peng, claiming he should have known their 
relationship would lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that Jim Peng knew his wife had learned of the affair 
and that she had threatened Ji. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko told the court that Lisa Peng discovered Ji's 
home telephone number in China and called her after Ji bought Jim Peng a 
special T-shirt as a gift. Lisa Peng also later traveled to China to find Ji, 
Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was in 1992 that Lisa Peng took action against Ji, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng suspected that her husband and Ji were living at the Pengs' second 
home in Rancho Santa Margarita, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She caught Jennifer Ji in her home and discovered Ji's clothing in a closet 
in her home," Molko said. "She cut all (Ji's) clothing with a pair of 
scissors." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peng testified that he saw the clothing afterward, but did not see who 
destroyed it. While he spoke, Lisa Peng began sobbing uncontrollably, prompting 
the judge to call a recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing will determine whether sufficient evidence exists to 
bind Peng over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the hearing will be continued after Thursday's court session 
until Aug. 16 to give attorneys time to prepare arguments on the admissibility 
of DNA evidence. 30

SHORT-TERM SOLUTION TO AIRPORT PARKING; TRAFFIC: EXPECTING MORE PASSENGERS WITH 
SOUTHWEST'S ARRIVAL, JOHN WAYNE OFFICIALS CARVE OUT 440 SPACES FROM LONG-TERM 
LOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Circling John Wayne Airport for available parking is becoming more common for 
traffic on the ground than for airborne commercial pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual passenger counts up to 6.2 million per year and more expected with 
the arrival of Southwest Airlines this week, airport officials are carving out 
440 short-term spaces from existing long-term lots to provide more room for 
those racing to meet arriving flights. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rate of $1 per hour, the additional "super short-term" slots are 
expected to bring much-needed convenience to what recently has become an 
exercise in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, however, is expected to reduce annual airport parking revenues by 
$594,757, a small percentage of the $14 million in fees collected each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport continues to be popular with business travelers, but now we're 
seeing more and more leisure travelers coming through," airport spokeswoman Pat 
Ware said. "As more people come in, we're also seeing more people who are 
choosing to seek the convenience of parking here." 
</P>
<P>
 The additional spaces will be provided in the east parking structure, directly 
across from the main terminal. Currently a long-term lot where motorists are 
charged a flat fee of $7 per day, the east lot will convert 440 of the 1,122 
spaces for short-term users at the $1-per-hour rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, the airport had provided slightly more than 3,000 short-term 
spaces for users known in airport vernacular as "meeter-greeters." Those spaces 
are located on the north and south sides of the terminal, within easy walking 
distance of ticket counters and gates. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have noticed in recent months that more travelers have been 
occupying short-term lots for days at a time, regardless of the hourly costs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the airport has been experiencing a steady rise in the 
number of passengers using the airport, Ware said. Since 1990 when John Wayne 
opened for business, passenger numbers have increased from 4.5 million to about 
6.2 million people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those totals are expected to swell again this year as popular Southwest 
Airlines begins service in Orange County on Thursday, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just not enough of the spaces to go around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report presented Tuesday to the Board of Supervisors, airport officials 
said that parking shortages have left some "meeter-greeters" to circle the 
terminal in their cars, increasing traffic congestion on the airport roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things tend to get very busy first thing in the morning with business 
travelers," Ware said. "It tends to even out during the middle of the day and 
then picks up again later."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CONSULTANT SAYS PIER STRUCTURALLY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preliminary reports from a city-hired consultant indicated Tuesday that the 
Seal Beach Pier is structurally secure and that Saturday's fire caused limited 
damage to the landmark's massive vertical wood pilings, which hold the 
boardwalk over the water. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fire did burn some of the pier's crossbeams and supports, many of 
which must be replaced at an estimated cost of $350,000. The pier, built in 
1906, has been closed since the fire, which trapped people standing at the 
pier's end. Nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope further engineering tests will confirm that the pilings 
were not seriously damaged. Replacing severely burned pilings could add 
$100,000 to the overall repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is set to decide on a pier rehabilitation plan within the next week, 
City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 One option is to make temporary repairs so the boardwalk can reopen during the 
busy summer tourist season. In the fall, the pier would be closed while 
permanent repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario calls for workers to repair damage from both Saturday's fire 
and a 1992 pier blaze in one combined job. Bankston said the city wants to 
avoid opening the pier after one set of repairs is completed just to close it 
again a few weeks later for the second round of fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's fire was covered by insurance. But the city will have to pay a 
$100,000 insurance deductible -- just as it did after the 1992 fire, which 
caused about $180,000 in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was the latest in a series of financial setbacks to hit the city in 
recent years. The city has lost more than $1 million in tax revenue from the 
state and must come up with as much as $500,000 to pay for a sand replenishment 
project for its eroded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston estimated that the city has less than $100,000 in reserves to pay for 
unexpected expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach's insurer will probably pay out a portion of the fire claim as 
repairs proceed rather than reimbursing the city when the job is completed. 
This will allow the city's reserves to earn interest and will probably help the 
city avoid a cash shortage this summer, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have also asked various state agencies and local legislators 
about possible grants or loans that Seal Beach could receive for the historic 
boardwalk, which is one of few wood piers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fire investigators, a city-hired consulting firm and Southern 
California Edison continued Tuesday to study the pier's electrical system in an 
effort to determine what caused the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are focusing on a high-voltage conduit that runs beneath the 
pier from its base to a restaurant at the end of the boardwalk. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; POLICE CLOSE FIRM, ALLEGE SALES SCAM 
</P>

<P>
 Police shut down an alleged "boiler room" operation Tuesday at the United 
Supply Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities claim the firm called businesses throughout the country and, 
through misrepresentation, got them to pay for overpriced copier ink cartridges 
they never ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting a six-month undercover investigation, police armed with a 
search warrant confiscated telephones, phone directories and business records, 
and detained 18 employees for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 The search helped "gather evidence for the case against United Supply Center 
so we can shut them down permanently because they're fraudulently ripping 
people off with their scam," Lt. Jim Weuve said.  
</P>
<P>
 No one was arrested, but manager Cale M. Munson, 23, of Anaheim was cited for 
alleged possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, the business operated 40 phone lines out of a garage 
on Bishop Street. Employees said they were surprised when police arrived, and 
claimed their work was legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of expected something like this would happen some day because we do 
telemarketing and people get (upset) when we call, but I didn't think what we 
were doing was illegal and it's not," said Brian Lewis, 29, who has worked for 
the business for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees expressed anger because they are now jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took this job because I was desperate," said Jesus Tarango, 27, who lives 
in a hotel in Anaheim. "I was told and was under the impression that this job 
was legal as long as we followed the (sales) pitch, word for word." 
</P>
<P>
 That pitch, police said, is what got the business in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Several corporations complained of being shipped a single cartridge of copy 
machine toner, which sells in stores for about $70, at a cost of $500, Weuve 
said. He said the corporations claimed they had never ordered the item. 
</P>
<P>
 Former employees also lodged complaints about the business's practices, Weuve 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the telemarketers would call all kinds of large businesses to get the 
make and model of their copy machines and tell them that they were going to 
send a free manual. 
</P>
<P>
 A week or two later, however, the callers would again contact the businesses, 
informing them that the toner -- which was never ordered -- was on its way, 
Weuve said. The bill would then be sent along with the ink cartridge. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CRITIC OF CITY WILL SEEK COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William M. Vega, considered by many observers as the city's most critical and 
outspoken watchdog, announced Tuesday that he will run in November for a City 
Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, 37, has been battling city government for the past five years.His fight 
began when the Brea Redevelopment Agency tried to acquire his mother's property 
for a widening of Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has questioned local officials' actions and asked for federal 
and state investigations into city affairs. He has voiced support for residents 
and business owners whose properties were taken through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 He has sued the city and won a judgment that prevented it from taking his 
mother's Brea Boulevard property. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega ran two years ago for one of two open council seats and lost, but 
garnered 18% of the votes -- the third-highest number. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, officials have been considering limiting public 
testimony to 30 minutes per council meeting and reducing the number of meetings 
from two a month to one, which Vega vehemently opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very concerned and morally compelled to (run for office) to help 
reshape public policy based on the recent abuses to discourage public input and 
freedom of speech by . . . trying to drastically cut off public testimony," 
Vega said.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AT SCHOOL GET RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After working for two years without a contract, the Buena Park School 
District's non-teaching employees have reached agreement with the Board of 
Trustees on a new pact that includes a pay raise and bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Monday agreed to give the employees a 1.5% salary increase and a 
1% bonus for the 1993-94 school year, which is drawing to a close. Union 
members ratified the pact last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the classified 
employees and that we were able to provide them with a small salary increase," 
said Supt. Jack Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Michel, president of the California School Employees Assn.'s Buena 
Park chapter, which has 125 members, said the non-teaching employees are also 
happy about the pay increase, which is retroactive to the start of the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said the 1.5% pay hike translates into 11 cents an hour more for the 
majority of the classified employees, who serve as office clerks, bus drivers, 
custodians and maintenance and cafeteria workers. The total package will give 
each employee about $212 more annually, Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," she said. "It was the employees' choice 
(to accept the contract offer), and I think they're happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's 200 classified employees have not had a pay raise since 1991, 
Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said the two-year negotiations were the longest in the history of the 
104-year-old school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract ends in October. Negotiations are expected to begin in late 
summer for the 1994-95 contract, Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said that the school district has not been able to give employees 
raises because of financial problems caused by the poor state economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult to give raises when there are no new dollars coming 
in," he said. "We feel that we were in a position to do what we did in terms of 
salary and still maintain a reserve. . . . We did the best we could for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's teachers have also worked the past two school years without a 
contract. Townsend said district officials are expected to present teachers a 
proposal for a final agreement for the 1993-94 contract June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said one issue the classified employees and the district failed to 
agree on is a provision that would require all classified employees to become 
union members and pay union dues. The union dropped that demand in return for 
the pay raise, but will bring the issue in its next round of negotiations, 
Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said that by law, the union is required to represent all classified 
employees, even if they are not union members. She said it is only fair that 
they contribute to the local union chapter to offset legal fees and other 
costs, which include negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Townsend said the issue is a philosophical one with trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governing board feels employees should not be forced to join a union to 
work in a school district," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DRUG-TRAFFICKING PROBE TO CONTINUE

<P>
 Despite seizing $20 million worth of cocaine and arresting 18 people, a drug 
task force will continue its investigation into a cocaine-trafficking 
operation, Sheriff Brad Gates said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said others connected with the drug ring are believed scattered across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "More arrests are expected to follow," Gates said. "We are waiting . . . for 
local law enforcement to finish the paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates wouldn't specify where the suspects are or the extent of their 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 It took investigators eight months to arrest Samuel Moreno, a 46-year-old 
Santa Fe Springs resident, whom police identified as the kingpin of the 
organization. The drug ring, code-named "Telemundo" throughout the 
investigation because the suspects allegedly used a communications company with 
the same name as a front, was concentrated in Southern California, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they were able to link Moreno to drug trafficking and money 
laundering through a tap placed on his cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 249 pounds of cocaine and $2.3 million in cash were seized during the 
course of seven drug raids, which began last September and ended in January. 
The arrests were announced Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had larger seizures, sure, but the significance here is that we were 
able to take out a whole organization," sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators discovered that the communications company, based in Huntington 
Park, issued pagers and cellular phones under fictitious names and used them to 
arrange air transportation for suspected drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 All 18 suspects are being held in Los Angeles County Jail. Their bond averages 
$2 million each. None are from Southern California, nor did they own any 
businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested were 11 Colombians, two of them naturalized U.S. 
citizens, six Mexican nationals and one American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug task force includes the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression 
Program, the Los Angeles district attorney's office, the Inland Regional 
Narcotics Enforcement Team, Los Angeles Impact, Southeast Cities Against 
Narcotics and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. JAIME ABDO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ORANGE-THROWING SUSPECT FLEES POLICE

 A person suspected of throwing oranges at motorists managed to elude police 
Monday night by driving a stolen pickup truck on the wrong side of the San 
Diego Freeway, then over an embankment, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going over the embankment, the truck collided with a northbound car 
occupied by an Irvine couple, who suffered minor injuries, said police Lt. Al 
Muir.The truck was later found abandoned.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a bizarre incident," Muir said. "Unfortunately, whoever was 
in the truck got away." 
</P>
<P>
 The strange chain of events began about 10 p.m., when police received a report 
that someone was throwing oranges at vehicles on the east side of Jeffrey Road, 
where there is an orange grove, Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An officer arrives, looks into his rearview mirror, and sees a red Toyota 
pickup truck leaving the area," Muir said. "He gets behind the truck and 
activates his lights and siren. The truck then gets on the northbound freeway 
traveling southbound." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sand Canyon Avenue police lost sight of the truck, which was traveling on 
the shoulder of the freeway. There, it was involved in the hit-and-run 
accident, according to the California Highway Patrol.  
</P>
<P>
 "We located the vehicle down the embankment and it had been deserted," Muir 
said. "We conducted a search of the area with a helicopter and canine units, 
but whoever was in the vehicle got away." The couple suffered cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir said the truck had been reported stolen in Tustin earlier that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are "fairly certain" that the driver of the stolen truck was 
responsible for throwing the oranges. No one was injured in that incident. GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TB PATIENT HAS PART OF LUNG REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debi French, the 18-year-old who suffered a relapse of the tuberculosis she 
acquired in an outbreak of the disease at La Quinta High School in Westminster, 
successfully underwent surgery Tuesday to remove a third of her right lung.  
</P>
<P>
 "She is sleeping, comfortable and doing very well. I am relieved," Debi's 
mother, Patti, said after the 2 1/2-hour surgery at University Hospital of 
Colorado to remove the diseased upper lobe of her daughter's right lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said the surgery would greatly increase the chance of a complete cure 
for Debi French, who was infected with a strain of TB that resists the first 
line of TB-fighting antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's TB was originally diagnosed by her family physician in May, 
1993, when she was a junior at La Quinta. She was one of 17 La Quinta students 
to have contracted the disease since 1991. Orange County health officials 
determined that 12 of the students, Debi among them, acquired a strain of TB 
that is resistant to one of the major TB medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Debi French, like the other students, seemed to be responding to 
another combination of medications until February, when she suddenly developed 
a kind of TB bacteria that resisted still more drugs and began to quickly 
multiply. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Debi, at the suggestion of county health officials, was flown by 
private jet to the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory 
Medicine, which specializes in treating people with drug-resistant TB. The 
center referred her to nearby University Hospital of Colorado for the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jim Cook, head of the division of infectious diseases at the National 
Jewish Center, said all of the disease in Debi's left lung has been removed and 
she will receive antibiotics for about two more years to heal a small abnormal 
area remaining in her left lung. She should be going home in about three weeks, 
he said. LESLIE BERKMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY CLAIMS HUNTINGTON PROPERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding to its land stores for the planned Bolsa Chica Regional Park, county 
officials have taken control of a 3.6-acre gas processing plant in Huntington 
Beach and plan to convert some of its structures to house exhibits highlighting 
the area's oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to claim the Huntington 
Beach Co. property near Seapoint Street and Garfield Avenue, now operated as an 
industrial plant by Shell Onshore Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement, the county will lease the property back to Shell 
until the plant closes in December. Also, the company must remove contaminates 
from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease was needed to allow the company more time for the construction of a 
replacement gas site. In return, Shell will pay the county $100,000 in rent and 
$400,000 toward future park development. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, county and Shell officials acknowledged there was "significant" 
contamination on the property from nearly four decades of industrial use. The 
contaminates were characterized as "low-level" and not containing 
cancer-causing agents, a Shell chemist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup is expected to take several months and costs are to be paid by Shell 
Offshore Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas plant site will be part of the 106-acre regional park on the southeast 
edge of the Bolsa Chica wetlands reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting closer to seeing this park become a reality," said Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, whose district includes Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the preservation of some plant structures will ensure that an 
important link to the area's industrial history is maintained, Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said she was satisfied that soil contaminates could be removed and not 
present future hazards for the area. KEVIN JOHNSON

 Officially sealing the deal, the City Council voted Tuesday to sell an entire 
city block for $1.1 million to a partnership that hopes to turn the historic 
property into a flagship development for the heart of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, across the street from Mission San Juan Capistrano, includes 
three decades-old buildings that make up El Peon Plaza. The buyer is San Juan 
Partners, which comprises Richard J. O'Neill, a local rancher and one of the 
county's wealthiest men, and Steve Nordeck, who owns the Swallows Inn in 
downtown San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and Nordeck plan to renovate the buildings and bring in upscale retail 
shops to lure tourists. About 500,000 people visited the mission last year, 
making it the county's third-most-popular attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting as the redevelopment agency board, the council voted 5 to 0 to enter 
into a development agreement with the partnership. Escrow is expected to close 
in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not one of us (council members) here that isn't excited to see you 
come into town," Mayor Collene Campbell told Nordeck after the council took its 
vote during a special meeting Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the developers to pay cash for the 17,500-square-foot 
parcel and spend about $687,000 to bring the buildings up to earthquake 
standards and to rehabilitate the entire complex within a year after escrow 
closes. The partnership will still need city approval for much of the 
renovation work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to maintain the charm of the buildings but make them look spiffier, 
if you will," Nordeck told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said architects are already working on ways to renovate the buildings 
while preserving the character of the facades. The back of the buildings will 
be made into second entryways to many of the shops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is selling the property for almost $200,000 less than what it bought 
it for in 1987. But officials say once renovated, the plaza should generate 
more property and sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers have told the city they plan to attract a variety of upscale 
boutiques and bistros to the complex, which is part of the redevelopment 
agency's Historic Town Center project. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza now includes a variety of retail shops and eateries, including Cafe 
Capistrano, a Western art gallery and jewelers and some office space. All but 
one of the shop owners lease from the city on a month-to-month basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said the partnership has not decided which leases will be renewed. 
None of the El Peon Plaza merchants spoke at Tuesday's public hearing on the 
development agreement. ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; STUDENTS APPLY MATH SKILLS TO SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, you have a $95 budget and you need to buy four bath towels, a dress, a 
pair of pants, a shirt and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy enough? 
</P>
<P>
 Now figure that you have only an hour to shop and must come as close as you 
can to your budget without going over, of course taking into consideration 
discount percentages and sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 sixth-graders from Los Naranjos Elementary School in Irvine, the task 
was an exercise in mathematics made easy as they cavorted through a closed 
Mervyn's Department Store in Irvine on Tuesday morning searching for those 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real-life situation," math teacher Judy Hawley said. "They've been 
practicing a month for this, so they were really motivated to do well. This 
exercise involves every aspect of addition and subtraction, as well as 
multiplication, division and fractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Real-life situations, indeed, as most students -- rather than picking out 
items that merely fit the bill -- opted for chic attire even though they 
weren't actually buying anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion equals popularity," said Ricky Kovach, 12, scanning through a rack of 
colorful baggy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, assigned to groups of four, were given calculators and an 
"expense sheet" that listed group and individual items they needed to "buy." On 
the back of the sheet were discount percentages for the items. The three groups 
that came closest to their overall budget were given prizes such as hats and 
T-shirts from Mervyn's. 
</P>
<P>
 For John Udink, who finished fourth overall (coming in 36 cents under budget), 
studying decimals and fractions for a month has already helped in practical 
situations at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went shopping with my mom at Ralph's a while ago and she didn't know that I 
brought a calculator. When she was finished shopping, I added up the discounts 
and tax and it came to exactly what the checkout person had. My mom was so 
surprised, she asked them to check the figure again," said 12-year-old John. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never takes a calculator along, so now she wants me to go shopping with 
her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley said that after looking over the students' computations, most were 
right, while a few others were just pennies off. The top male finisher was 
Daniel Lawson, who came in 12 cents under budget. The top female finisher was 
Cailin Long, who came in 27 cents under budget.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have $40 left to buy a pair of shoes," said Cailin during the exercise. She 
had just snatched up a pair of pants and was briskly on her way to the shoe 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 Student-teacher Jennifer Paulson said that a month ago, the students would 
have difficulty performing all the calculations needed to get an accurate 
figure, but now it has become easy for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with them over the month in classroom exercises similar to what 
we're doing today. They pick up on these types of lesson real quick," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five sales clerks at Mervyn's spent the early morning helping the students 
with final tabulations and directions around the dimly lit store, opened early 
and exclusively for the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the regular customers that come in here to buy things ask us all the 
time how much something is going to cost if it is discounted. These students 
already seem to have a good understanding of how it works," said Alma Santoyo, 
a sales clerk who organized the field trip. BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PLANNING BOARD OKS AAA EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved the Automobile Club of Southern 
California's plans to more than double the size of its 467,000-square-foot 
complex. The City Council is scheduled to consider the AAA application June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents complained at Monday's commission meeting that the development 
at 3333 Fairview Road will clog streets, overwhelm city services and open the 
door for developers to increase densities throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the application, AAA has asked for an amendment to the General Plan 
-- the city's planning guide -- to expand the buildings more than is now 
permitted at the 30-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent analysis for the city said the AAA expansion will bring an 
increase of more than $150,000 in direct fees to the city, mostly in property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indirectly, the 1,135-employee business is now estimated to generate about 
$2.3 million in business activity for the city. If the payroll swells to 2,509 
employees as planned, the city would see about $4.5 million in sales of retail 
goods, services and hotel business, the analysis states. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Walter Davenport, John Palme and Libby Cowan voted for the 
development, saying they believe it will help the city. Commissioner Mark 
Korando voted against the project, saying he agrees with residents that it will 
open the way for other large, high-density developments. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; EFFORT IS SHOT IN ARM FOR 
IMMUNIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Palafox, 4, stared with big brown eyes as the nurse dabbed antiseptic 
on his finger. A moment later he was in tears as the needle pricked his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny may not have been pleased, but Betty Bumpers, who watched the procedure 
in South County Community Clinic, would like to see more children in his spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers, wife of Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers, visited the San Juan Capistrano 
clinic as part of her nationwide campaign, "Every Child by Two," which she 
co-founded with former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. The women are lobbying for 
every child younger than 2 to be immunized. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is "fueled by anger," she said. "Anger that we can't figure out a 
way to care for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers and Carter had campaigned in the '70s to get all 50 states to require 
children entering kindergarten to have proof of immunization. They began the 
current campaign in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers visited South County Community Clinic this week because it is one of 
the only major health care facilities in the region to offer immunizations for 
free or for a discount, said executive director Margot Hughes-Lopez.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has "disastrously low rates" for immunization of children, 
Hughes-Lopez said. Only 53% of those 2 and younger have had the recommended 
series of shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem (got) worse through the '80s," she said, citing a measles 
epidemic in 1990. "The barriers are primarily educational and motivational." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is hoping to become one of the first Orange County facilities to 
use a computer tracking system in conjunction with the county health department 
and other Orange County clinics to keep a record of each child's immunization 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, a child would receive immunization shots for measles, mumps and 
rubella, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus, hepatitis, polio and 
tuberculosis, about 20 shots through several visits, by age 2, clinic employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny's mother, Clemencia, said in Spanish through an interpreter that she 
knew of no other facility nearby where her children could have been immunized.  
</P>
<P>
 She smiled as the nurse wrapped up Johnny's pin-pricked finger. So did 
Bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a brave boy you are," she said. AILEEN CHO

IN HER OWN WORDS, CARRIE FISHER PROVES QUITE A CHARACTER; WRITING: THE ACTRESS 
TURNED NOVELIST, KNOWN FOR TAPPING HER PERSONAL LIFE FOR HER BOOKS, ENLIVENS 
AUTHORS LUNCHEON WITH HUMOROUS BUT FICTIONAL SCENARIOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She's been described as Hollywood's modern-day Dorothy Parker, and 
actress-author Carrie Fisher didn't disappoint during a brief talk at an 
authors luncheon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced as the owner of a Spanish-style ranch house in Beverly Hills that 
cost $2.5 million, Fisher cringed and put her head in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for that introduction," she said, then sighed heavily: "I'm always 
pleased to hear my house cost $2.5 million and (realize) that I cannot afford 
it. I basically belong to the bank now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, the actress daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, is best 
known to moviegoers as Princess Leia in "Star Wars." But over the past seven 
years she has carved out a successful career as a writer of bitingly witty 
novels, including her latest, "Delusions of Grandma."  
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was one of three authors on the bill at The Times Orange County 
Edition's seventh annual Book and Author Luncheon at the Red Lion Hotel. 
Speaking before a sold-out crowd of 750, she was joined by John Berendt 
("Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and Ursula Hegi ("Stones from the 
River"). 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that she hadn't prepared much in the way of a talk, Fisher, 37, said 
that when she hears her life and accomplishments chronicled in an introduction, 
either she thinks, "I don't want to be that person," or she wonders, "Who is 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled a talk-show host once asking, "So, what are you doing now?" 
</P>
<P>
 To which Fisher, tongue in cheek, replied: "I'm starting a new magazine called 
Deserted Woman. . . . There's going to be a fashion segment on what to wear 
when you're just dumped, then two months later, then six. There's going to be a 
perfume with that slightly discarded air.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Basically, I'm going to make it it hip to be dumped. And there's 
going to be, of course, a special fold-out supplement for if you're dumped with 
kids.' So the woman says to me, 'So, you're starting a clothing line?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On a certain level, Fisher told the audience, "I could say that I was doing 
anything because it makes no linear sense that I've gone from being someone 
that shot laser pistols at Wookies in outer space and I write novels. So I 
could go on a TV show and say, 'Yes, I'm running for Congress' -- and they 
would believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher is known as much for tapping her personal life for her novels as she is 
for her humor. In "Postcards From the Edge," it was her recovery from drug 
abuse. In "Surrender the Pink," it was the breakup of her marriage to singer 
Paul Simon. And in "Delusions of Grandma," it's her breakup with agent Bryan 
Lourd and the birth of her first child, Billie. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something of a price to pay for mining one's own life for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers, Fisher said, "do seem very comfortable in believing that I take notes 
at night and it all falls out in a kind of organized entertainment (fashion). 
Like I just stayed at the rehab and made notes, and I knew it would make a good 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally what she writes is always true, she said, but that doesn't mean 
everything she writes should be taken at face value. Still, she said, "the 
power of the written word is extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 "In my first book I said somebody shot heroin. And my mother said, 'People are 
going to think that that's you.' And I thought, 'No, they're going to think 
that's your daughter. . . .' "

IRVINE WOMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO KILLING BABY DAUGHTER IN 1976 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An Irvine woman charged with killing her 1-year-old daughter 17 years ago in a 
rural Illinois town pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Central Orange County 
Municipal Court while extradition proceedings moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Neal, 44, who was arrested at her Irvine home Thursday, denied 
killing her adopted daughter, Danielle Christine Neal.The baby girl died in a 
hospital in Peoria, Ill., in September, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in Tazewell County, Ill., who filed the murder charges, allege 
that Neal violently shook her child to death. At the time of the baby's death, 
a coroner discovered no foul play. Neal had told doctors that the baby had been 
injured in a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois authorities said they learned of wrongdoing last year after Neal told 
an Orange County social worker that she was responsible for the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's body was later exhumed, revealing evidence supporting homicide, 
according to Tazewell County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal's attorney, Keith Ross of Santa Ana, has denied the allegations, saying 
Neal was "going through a very difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen years ago, a child died in a tragic accident. There was a full 
investigation and death was found to be accidental," Ross has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, authorities from Illinois will come to Orange County for an 
identity hearing, and will continue with extradition procedure.

HEADLANDS PROJECT TO GO ON BALLOT; DEVELOPMENT: DANA POINT COUNCIL ORDERS 
REFERENDUM AS PART OF NOVEMBER ELECTION ON PROPOSAL FOR A HOTEL, COMMERCIAL 
CENTERS AND UP TO 370 HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced by a petition drive, the City Council on Tuesday voted to place the 
Headlands project, one of the most controversial developments ever proposed in 
South County, before city voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the community will finally have a say in this plan," said City 
Councilman William L. Ossenmacher. "That's the best thing that could happen. 
Those of us who believe in representative government and democracy will be 
glad, whatever the results are." 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous council action means city voters on Nov. 8 will decide the fate 
of the Dana Point Headlands. The council's only option was to rescind its April 
5 vote approving the Headlands plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years the plan has been the focus of an increasingly bitter 
local debate that will play a major role in next month's council election and 
continue until the November vote. The plan allows the landowners to build a 
400-room hotel, two commercial centers and a maximum of 370 homes on the 
121-acre Headlands peninsula near Dana Point Harbor, one of the county's last 
undeveloped coastal properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the development have insisted that the Headlands is a local 
landmark and that most of it should be preserved as a natural resource. 
Proponents say the city needs the revenue that development could provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the council approved the plan in April by a 4-1 vote, a 
grass-roots group circulated petitions demanding a local referendum. In 15 
days, the group managed to get 2,346 verified signatures, well over the 1,912 
required to force the council to reconsider its vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful petition drive caused immediate suspension of the plan and a 
detailed development agreement, pending further council action. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had a choice of calling a special election or putting the 
Headlands referendum on the November ballot. The petition came too late to 
qualify for the council election on June 7, according to City Clerk Sharon L. 
Waits. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members chose November because the estimated $16,700 cost is about 
half that of a special election. They also said the expected 60% voter turnout 
in November would provide a better survey of local opinion on the Headlands 
plan than a special election, which generally draws fewer voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Eggers, one of the Headlands plan's most vocal supporters, 
said he thinks the voters ultimately will support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those 2,246 signatures in no way represent a mandate of the voters," Eggers 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under state election law, if the plan is rejected, the council could wait a 
year and approve it again, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s the Headlands has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. and 
Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial 
holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co. 
which publishes the Los Angeles Times.

BOARD NAMES STEINER TO BARGAIN WITH ORANGE OVER JAIL; SECURITY: SUPERVISORS 
HOPE TO AVERT LEGAL TROUBLES REGARDING THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT'S USE OF THE 
CITY'S THEO LACY FACILITY TO HOUSE MORE DANGEROUS INMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner was named Tuesday to begin negotiations 
with the city of Orange to head off a costly legal fight over the housing of 
maximum-security inmates at the Theo Lacy Branch Jail located in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors' appointment of Steiner, a former Orange councilman, 
comes only a week after the city filed a lawsuit against the county, seeking to 
block further transfer of dangerous inmates to the branch jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an indication of our willingness to compromise and not paint each 
other into corners," Steiner said after a closed session of the board in which 
supervisors discussed the pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange City Atty. Robert O. Franks called Steiner's appointment a "very good 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to listen to their proposals," Franks said. "All of us would 
like to avoid expensive litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's legal action was prompted by the Sheriff's Department's transfer 
last month of 48 maximum-security prisoners to the 1,326-bed Theo Lacy 
facility, which typically houses medium- and minimum-security county prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer was necessary, sheriff's officials have said, because of 
overcrowding at the other county jail facilities and to prevent the outright 
release of prisoners well before their sentences were scheduled to end. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have contended that the maximum-security inmates could endanger 
homeowners and businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he has already begun informal discussions with Orange officials 
to consider how the county could address some of the community's concerns. But 
he did not foresee Sheriff Brad Gates reversing his transfer order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe (Gates) intends to keep maximum-security prisoners there," Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the supervisor said the county could provide assurances to the 
city, such as ensuring that maximum-security prisoners whose terms of 
confinement end at Theo Lacy would not be released directly from the Orange 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, all county prisoners are released from the Santa Ana Intake/Release 
Center after their terms. The supervisor said he would make sure the policy is 
strictly followed, especially in cases of inmates classified for maximum 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the county could also help in the city's redevelopment of The 
City Shopping Center, located across the street from the Theo Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (city officials) see Theo Lacy and maximum-security inmates as 
obstacles in future business development there," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing assurances for the safety of residents and business 
owners, Steiner said the county could take a more active role in attracting 
tenants for the shopping center and could propose transportation improvements 
to provide greater access to the center.

MAGAZINE CALLS IRVINE SAFEST LARGE CITY IN U.S.; CRIME: MONEY AWARDS NO. 1 
RANKING IN OVER-100,000 POPULATION CATEGORY. THE FBI EARLIER THIS MONTH 
DESIGNATED IT AS SEVENTH-SAFEST, USING A DIFFERENT FORMULA.

 Local realtor Dale Cheema hasn't had too much trouble selling houses lately, 
and he's pretty sure he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he learned that the June issue of Money magazine had named Irvine 
the safest large city in the country in terms of violent crime. That 
designation came after FBI released statistics earlier this month which showed 
Irvine to be the seventh-safest in the United States with a population over 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to be in a safe neighborhood and enjoy a better standard of 
living," said Cheema, president of the Irvine Board of Realtors. "After news of 
(the FBI ranking) spread, I had a lot of people from the L.A. area coming in 
who want to raise their kids in a safer area." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine combined population data with the FBI's statistics on violent 
crimes -- including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- to come up 
with the rankings, which place Irvine first among 187 cities with populations 
over 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's rankings are based only on violent crimes while the FBI's 
rankings also included crimes such as robbery, burglary, larceny and auto 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an overall plus to the city," said Mayor Michael Ward. "Everyone is 
pretty happy about it. I think it says an awful lot about Irvine. Crime is the 
No. 1 concern among people nowadays, and we are dedicated to keeping it a safe 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward and other city officials attributed the city's nationwide reputation for 
safety to a variety of factors including a highly educated, well-trained police 
force; urban planning that separates residential enclaves from high-traffic 
streets; a strong school system and active participation from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combined effort," Ward said. "It's a great town and everyone has to 
take part to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck said part of the low crime rate in this city 
of 110,000 residents can be attributed to a strong Neighborhood Watch program 
that he said reflects a citywide intolerance of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a lot of apprehensions and arrests based on what people report to 
us," Brobeck said. "It helps a lot. I think the overall attitude among 
residents is that they're not going to tolerate that kind of thing. There is 
not a sense of apathy." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's rankings are based on 1993 statistics, a year in which Irvine 
had one homicide victim. That was Turtle Rock resident Patricia Lea Pratt, who 
apparently surprised a burglar in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's slaying, which has not been solved, was the fourth homicide in the 
city since 1990, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the magazine's top ranking will help attract new residents and also 
help attract more businesses to the 43.6-square-mile, pre-planned city 
incorporated in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses want to locate their office in a safe community," the mayor said. 
"I also think recognition in a national, respected business magazine will help 
us keep the businesses that are here." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cheema, who said he has sold eight houses in the past month, this latest 
accolade is a real estate agent's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have an open house, I plan to bring the magazine article with me," he 
said. "I think it will help immensely."

DEMOCRATS PLAN 'IN YOUR FACE' CAMPAIGN; ELECTION: STATEWIDE VOTER-TURNOUT 
EFFORT TO BEGIN WITH MAJOR FUND-RAISER IN O.C. LOCAL GOP CALLS TACTIC 
'PUFFERY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Adopting an "in your face" strategy against the Republican Party, the 
California Democratic Party announced Tuesday that it will kick off its 
statewide campaign for the November general election in Orange County -- the 
heartbeat of Republican conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 State Democratic Chairman Bill Press said during a news conference that the 
first post-June 7 primary fund-raiser featuring the statewide Democratic 
victors will take place at the South County ranch of former state party 
Chairman Richard O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the anticipated proceeds -- about $50,000 -- will stay in Orange 
County for intensive voter registration and voter turnout drives leading up to 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an 'in your face' kind of a deal that we are bringing in our statewide 
team right here -- with all due respect -- into the belly of the beast as a 
sign that we are giving no quarter and ceding no territory in the state of 
California, nor taking any area for granted," Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican voter registration outnumbers Democratic voters in Orange County by 
52% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with the $20,000 in state party funds now being spent to register 
Democrats in the 68th and 69th Assembly districts in central Orange County, 
former local Democratic Chairman Howard Adler said the local party's fund 
raising will be months ahead of where it usually is in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 18 fund-raiser -- expected to draw Vice President Al Gore and other 
Clinton Administration officials -- "gives us $40,000 to $50,000 in the bank 
within two weeks of the primary, and that's the best head start we have ever 
had," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas Fuentes later dismissed the effort as 
"typical thumb-sucking puffery" employed by Democrats every two years in an 
attempt to draw interest to their party. After all is said and done, Fuentes 
added, the Democrats fail to meet their fund-raising goals or spend it all on 
the 69th Assembly district, the only legislative seat in the hands of 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is highly unlikely that this kind of effort, which they announced, will 
have any real or concentrated results," Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Press said the coordinated statewide campaign is a different ballgame this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last gubernatorial campaign in 1990, Press said the party spent 
only $2 million, but this year, their budget is $6 million to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Republican-size money," O'Neill emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that they cannot become the dominant political party in Orange 
County in one election season, Democratic Party officials said they nonetheless 
expect to make significant gains in hopes of having an impact on the statewide 
races in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republicans are usually counted on to provide large-enough 
margins for their statewide candidates to push them over the top. If Democrats 
can cut into those margins, then they feel they can strengthen their ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' new focus on Orange County also reflects the importance the 
party is placing on the candidacy of state Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden 
Grove), who is vacating his seat to run for state attorney general in November 
against Republican incumbent Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 The early resources in the central county legislative districts "recognize the 
strength of Tom Umberg running statewide and how he can help us in this county. 
We are here not only to help the county, but because we are counting on the 
county to help us win statewide," Press said.

2 MAVERICKS QUALIFY AS WRITE-IN CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL RACES; ELECTION: A LAGUNA 
BEACH PHYSICIAN AND A COMPUTER ANALYST FROM ORANGE HOPE TO STIR UP POLITICAL 
WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 1992 contender pulled in only a single vote, and no local write-in candidate 
has won an election since 1986. But a Laguna Beach physician and a computer 
analyst from Orange are braving the odds that voters remember their names come 
June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene R. Atherton and Huu Chung Nguyen were the only two to qualify with the 
county Registrar of Voters as write-in candidates for local races by the 5:30 
p.m. Tuesday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 They may not come anywhere close to winning, but the maverick candidates hope 
to stir up some political waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton, who has unsuccessfully run for office before, will challenge state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) in her previously uncontested bid to 
succeed retiring county supervisor Thomas F. Riley in the 5th District.  
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 38, is up against six other Democrats vying for a chance at the 46th 
District congressional seat held by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 But Nguyen's goals are decidedly modest, and he says he already has 
accomplished many of them. Nguyen, who says he is the first Vietnamese American 
locally to run for a congressional seat, simply wants to mobilize his community 
to get more involved in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get people involved in the American process, to get out and to 
vote," he said. "One way to do that is to get somebody to run for office." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who came to the United States in 1978 and now works as a computer 
analyst for the Los Angeles County Superior Court while pursuing a master's 
degree in business, said he has spent weeks registering people to vote at 
supermarkets in Little Saigon. He also has been working a phone list of about 
7,500 Vietnamese American voters in the district -- 5,000 of them Republicans 
-- with the hopes of swaying their party affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen had hoped to get his name on the ballot but switched his party 
affiliation from American Independent to Democrat in January, too late to 
qualify under the March filing deadline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's six opponents are Madelene E. Arakelian, a businesswoman from Laguna 
Hills; John M. Ivler, a systems analyst from Los Alamitos; Don Payne, an 
engineer from Anaheim; Robert John Banuelos, a senior citizens counselor from 
Santa Ana; Mike Farber, a Santa Ana businessman; and Norman Z. Eckenrode, a 
Placentia councilman.

FIRED EXECUTIVE WINS RACE-BIAS AWARD AGAINST COMPANY; DISCRIMINATION: THE MAN, 
WHO IS WHITE, WILL COLLECT $320,000 FROM JAPANESE-OWNED AIS OF MISSION VIEJO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County jury has awarded $320,000 to a Lake Forest man who sued a 
Japanese-owned company alleging that he was fired because he is white. 
</P>
<P>
 George A. Dalinger, a Canadian citizen, claimed in a lawsuit that Adaptive 
Information Systems of Mission Viejo fired him seven months after his hiring in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Though jurors awarded $320,000 in compensatory damages, they found that the 
company, which is partly owned by the Hitachi Corp., had not acted maliciously. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalinger's attorney, James L. Crandall of Irvine, said his client was pleased 
with the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The verdict says that Japanese companies, when they come to America, have to 
follow American rules regarding racial discrimination," Crandall said. "If 
you're going to do business in California, you're going to obey the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Gelb, an attorney for the company, which assembles and sells imaging 
systems, said his clients do not believe that they did anything wrong in 
dismissing Dalinger. Company officials maintain that they terminated Dalinger 
because the company was experiencing "financial difficulties," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we are disappointed with the jury's decision," Gelb said, "but our 
disappointment is tempered by the satisfaction that jurors rejected Dalinger's 
exaggerated claims that AIS acted with malice." 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1991, Dalinger was hired to a $93,000-a-year job as the company's 
director of product planning. He earned a favorable performance evaluation, but 
he was fired shortly thereafter when he decided to use American-made components 
in the company's Japanese-manufactured imaging systems, Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Dalinger said that company officials fired him "based on 
corporate policy that only because Japanese employees had a superior intellect, 
only Japanese employees could implement new projects." 
</P>
<P>
 He said company officials were "hostile to any research and development 
conducted by a Caucasian as opposed to a Japanese" employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial before Superior Court Judge Mason L. Fenton lasted 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelb said his clients were considering an appeal.

SANTA ANA DISTRICT TO WITHHOLD CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: SCHOOL TRUSTEES VOTE TO 
KEEP CONTROVERSIAL EXAMS FROM THE STATE DESPITE WARNINGS FROM THEIR ATTORNEY 
THAT SUCH AN ACTION MIGHT BE ILLEGAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Trustees of the Santa Ana Unified School District on Tuesday voted to withhold 
from the state the controversial standardized tests that students took earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, Keith Breon, an attorney for the district, warned that the 
Department of Education could sue the district for this. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not your tests; they belong to the state, and it would be a 
violation of current law" to keep them, he said. The district would have to pay 
the costs of defending its action in court, he pointed out.  
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Tom Chaffee, who made the proposal, called the California Learning 
Assessment System "a challenge to adult authority." The test "intrudes into 
family life. I don't care what a court says in L.A.," Chaffee said, referring 
to a recent court decision that the tests do not invade students' privacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 3 to 2 to withhold the CLAS tests except in cases where 
parents specifically request that their child's test be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee, Rose Marie Avila and Sal Mendoza voted in favor. Trustees Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji and Robert W. Balen rejected the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the state Department of Education require all school districts 
to administer the tests. But what, if anything, happens if they do not remains 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legal office cannot comment on a hypothetical" case, said Jan Agee, 
spokeswoman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS is a performance-based assessment program that tests fourth-, fifth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders in reading, writing, math, social studies and science.

GIRLS NAME EX-TEACHER, DISTRICT IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT

 Four teen-age girls and their parents filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a former 
teacher who was sentenced in February after admitting to fondling and making 
suggestive remarks to female students at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also names the Fullerton Joint Union High School District, the 
district administrator, the acting assistant superintendent and the principal 
and vice principal of the high school, saying they did not properly handle the 
complaints against George Melvin Fairchild, 53. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court, Fairchild 
exposed himself to one girl, repeatedly fondled the girls' breasts, humiliated 
them in front of classmates and called one of them at home asking her for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the girls said the harassment took place while they were asked to 
assist Fairchild as his instructional aides, according to the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild -- who taught science and math and worked as an athletic coach at 
the high school for 28 years -- was sentenced to three years' probation and 
lost his teaching credentials in February after pleading guilty to fondling 
three teen-age girls and making suggestive comments to two girls.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the school administrators failed to file a report with 
Child Protective Services about the allegations against Fairchild; the suit 
says they also failed to do so when a similar complaint was made about the 
teacher in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Fairchild, the suit names several school district officials. By 
allowing Fairchild to continue working, the administrators led parents to 
believe that he was fit as a teacher, the suit says. It also states that the 
administrators should have warned parents of earlier complaints against 
Fairchild.

MORE TESTS WILL ASSESS DANGER POSED BY LEGIONELLA BACTERIA

 Irvine Ranch Water District officials Tuesday called for more testing to 
determine whether the legionella bacteria recently detected in irrigation waste 
water presented any danger to county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria linked to the cause of Legionnaire's disease was found in water 
samples taken from the Orange County Water District and the Irvine Ranch Water 
District as part of research performed by the Orange County Sanitation 
Districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Those findings were to be presented this week to a convention of the American 
Society of Microbiologists in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Thompson, the Irvine district's water quality manager, said the district 
has been using reclaimed water for irrigation purposes since 1967 and has 
"never had an illness caused by the highly treated water." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to note that legionella bacteria is a background bacteria 
found throughout the environment," Thompson said. "In this instance, we don't 
know if the bacteria is alive or not and whether it's actually the individual 
species that can be harmful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hildy Meyers, the county's epidemiologist, has also called for additional 
testing of the treated waste water, which has been used to irrigate Mile Square 
Regional Park in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers did not know whether the sanitation agency findings were cause for 
concern, since the research did not address whether people could be infected by 
the bacteria found in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one case of Legionnaire's disease has been reported in Orange County this 
year, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legionella is an organism that can be found anywhere, not just in reclaimed 
water," Thompson said. "The concentrations in Irvine water noted in the study 
are far below levels known to cause illness in previous case studies. (Irvine) 
samples actually showed the lowest levels of legionella bacteria of any noted 
in the study." 
</P>
<P>
 Legionnaire's disease was discovered nearly two decades when it struck an 
American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Legionella bacteria grow in water 
and can be spread through the air by large air-conditioning systems, decorative 
fountains or other water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria may cause a pneumonia-like illness that can be fatal in its most 
advanced stages. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation agency research, partially funded by National Water Research 
Institute, has been the subject of much controversy within the agency itself. 
Margaret H. Nellor, the agency's acting director of technical services, has 
said the report contained "numerous errors" and urged that it should be labeled 
only as "preliminary."

ATTORNEY ADVISED SCYPHERS NOT TO SPEAK TO POLICE

 Simi Valley police officials said Tuesday they requested an interview with 
Mike Scyphers as part of an investigation of the suspended baseball coach, but 
Scyphers declined to be interviewed on advice from his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers was suspended as baseball coach May 3 pending police and Simi Valley 
school district investigations into possible disciplinary and financial 
improprieties.Police expect to conclude the investigation by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers also has filed a grievance against the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, asserting that he was suspended without five days' notice as mandated 
in a union contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The district says that Scyphers was not entitled to that notice because he was 
suspended only as baseball coach, and not as a teacher. The grievance has been 
rejected by Simi Valley Principal Kathryn Scroggin and advanced to the district 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Norman, grievance chairman of the Simi Educators Assn., said she is trying 
to schedule a meeting as soon as possible with either Supt. Mary Beth Wolford 
or her designee, probably Leon Mattingley, assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district rejects the grievance, Scyphers can seek arbitration, Norman 
said.

 The wide-eyed giddiness of last year's Cal State Northridge softball team is 
long gone. Earning a berth in the NCAA Division I College World Series was 
expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 This is virtually the same team that ventured to Oklahoma City last year for 
Northridge's first Division I World Series appearance. The team was ranked No. 
2 in the country and had set an NCAA record for home runs. But the Matadors 
came home early, embarrassed by losing two of three games. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Matadors, ranked No. 3 and seeded second in the tournament with 
a 49-8 record, believe that history will not repeat itself. With eight 
returning starters and a strong track record against the World Series field, 
they expect a better showing. Northridge opens the tournament against Missouri 
on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the seven other teams in the World Series, Northridge has defeated six in 
its last meeting between the schools. The Matadors have never played 
Illinois-Chicago (56-17-1), seeded eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Against fourth-seeded UCLA, No. 5 Fresno State, No. 6 Utah and No. 7 Missouri, 
the Matadors are 8-2 this season. They swept doubleheaders against UCLA and 
Missouri, won three of four against Fresno State and split a doubleheader with 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge did not play top-seeded Arizona (60-3), the defending national 
champion, and No. 3 Oklahoma State (49-10). However, the Matadors faced Arizona 
and Oklahoma State last year in tournament play and Northridge won both games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of them," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson said. "We kind of 
owe Utah and you know how it is with Fresno. It's a war. I think we look real 
good going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Judi Garman, whose Titans lost to Northridge, 4-0, in the 
regional championship game Sunday, said the Matadors will benefit from last 
year's experience in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been said that you have to go to the College World Series at least once 
to get the flavor of it to be successful," she said. "I think last year that 
was evident. They didn't play nearly up to their potential. They have the 
experience now." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson takes much of the blame for the Matadors' poor performance last year. 
He faults himself for failing to prepare his team for the 5,000-plus crowds and 
the fanfare that accompanies the biggest event in college softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to keep them as level as I can and not get them stressed out, and 
play that last game. It's a one-game deal. Once you get there, it's anybody's 
ballgame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bracket format has been changed this year to accommodate live coverage of 
the championship game on ESPN2, set for Monday at noon PDT. The championship 
game will match an undefeated team and a team with one loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge made a rookie mistake last year when the Matadors looked beyond 
their first-round opponent, Southwestern Louisiana, losing, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson vows the Matadors will not overlook Missouri, a team they swept, 8-1, 
12-0, in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're gonna lose the first game," Torgeson said. "I think that 
will be in the back of their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson has not picked a starting pitcher for the opener, but he has three 
capable arms from which to choose. The team earned-run average is 0.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Amy Windmiller (24-2) leads the nation with an 0.28 ERA 
and has 185 strikeouts in 178 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior right-hander Kathy Blake (0.52 ERA) is 16-6, and sophomore right-hander 
Jennifer Richardson (9-0, 0.21) has a 16-0 career record. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were up to Garman, the winningest coach in the country, Windmiller would 
get the nod. 
</P>
<P>
 "Windmiller is the key," Garman said. "When you get to that level, pitching is 
the key. If she stifles everybody else the way she did us, they've got a real 
good shot."

MOVIE REVIEWS; 911 FOR 90210 'COP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was a memorable moment in "Beverly Hills Cop" when Eddie Murphy's Axel 
Foley jammed a banana in a parked police car's tailpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking out of "Beverly Hills Cop III," you may be moved to ask, "Anybody have 
a banana for this movie?" 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of this film is a testament to star power -- or, to be more 
precise, recycling power. We're supposed to be so grateful to once again see 
Eddie Murphy as Axel that we can overlook how crude and shopworn this picture 
really is. It's one of the most cynically engineered sequels ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The kicky appeal of the "Cop" series -- at least potentially -- has always 
been the idea of a street-smart black cop from Detroit who outmaneuvers the 
(mostly) white Beverly Hills honchos who underestimate him. It's a neat racial 
joke that provided a few chuckles in "Beverly Hills Cop" and virtually none in 
its hyperpowered, Stallone-ish sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone, in fact, was originally supposed to star in "Beverly Hills Cop," and 
the series has never gotten very far from his overmuscled shadow. For most of 
the way in "Beverly Hills Cop III" we might as well be watching any old 
standard-issue action hunk dodging bullets and lobbing grenades (and, in a 
masterstroke, saving children in peril). But Murphy gives us less than those 
action hunks do; he's playing out his own fantasy image of a righteous avenger, 
and the fantasy is essentially humorless. There's little trace of his gift for 
con-man mimicry. It's as if he set out to trash his own franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 Once again Axel, wearing his Detroit Lions jacket, is brought back to Beverly 
Hills from Detroit to track down the killers of a close associate. And once 
again he gets propelled into shootouts and car chases with a clan of murderous 
nasties, headed by John Saxon and Timothy Carhart. Their base of operations is 
a theme park called WonderWorld, which -- how'd you guess? -- features a 
dinosaur ride. "Jurassic Cop," anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills police force retains series' regular Judge Reinhold, who now 
has his own office and his own SWAT team. Bronson Pinchot also turns up again 
as the oddly accented Serge. He has graduated from an art gallery to a boutique 
selling personalized luxury weapons, which is a fair way of gauging how far the 
inspiration in this series has dropped. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At a time when police detective shows on television are better than they ever 
have been, what excuse is there for the slovenliness of "Beverly Hills Cop 
III"? Director John Landis and screenwriter Steven E. De Souza (who worked on 
"48 HRS." and the "Die Hard" films) are strictly smash-and-grab guys. Like the 
other films in the series, this one has no muscle tone; it wobbles 
opportunistically between wan slapstick and routine bang bang, with lots of 
gratuitous cheesecake for scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy to make audiences laugh at a comedy where characters are 
actually shot on camera. And, in the post-Rodney G. King era, a racially tinged 
film involving cops and violence in L.A. carries a lot of unwanted baggage.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken simply as pure action, the mayhem in this movie may be routine but, in 
the context of a knockabout comedy it's deeply offensive. The film begins with 
a bunch of workmen in a Detroit auto shop shimmying to a record by the 
Supremes. The scene is played for broad, dumb laughs; then, in a scene that's 
not played for laughs, they get bloodily ventilated.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's near the end, when the assorted good guys wobble and collapse into 
frame with their wounds, that the corruption of this enterprise sinks in. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fundamental lack of human feeling in "Beverly Hills Cop III" that 
makes you want to avert your eyes from the people around you when the lights 
come up. Attending this movie makes you feel like an accomplice to the 
corruption. 
</P>
