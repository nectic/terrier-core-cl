 GHOST STORES: Los Angeles may declare quake-ravaged areas redevelopment zones 
to speed recovery. But Simi Valley has yet to decide what to do with two of its 
largest victims -- the crumpled Pic 'N' Save and Sears Outlet stores on Tapo 
Street. Neighbors say the stores have become dumping grounds and havens for 
transients. "It's as if time froze on them Jan. 17. Nothing has been done," 
homeowner Ellie Kieffer said. . . . Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell says the 
city is frustrated too. "We're walking a tightrope concerning private property 
rights and the need for an aesthetic community." 
</P>
<P>
 GUT ISSUE: Likely California voters favor more than 2 to 1 the November ballot 
initiative that denies government services to illegal immigrants. (A1) . . . 
That margin might be 3 to 1 in conservative Ventura County, said the measure's 
local coordinator. "People are saying: 'Enough is enough. We pay the taxes and 
illegal lawbreakers get the benefits,' " Steve Frank says. . . . Moorpark 
Councilman Bernardo Perez dissents: "People have a gut reaction, but the fact 
is that Prop. 187 is not based on facts." 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN SCHOOL: Hold the paper. Hold the plastic. Under Oak Hills Elementary's 
new zero-tolerance trash policy, students cannot bring non-recyclable paper or 
plastic in their lunch boxes (B6). . . . "It is our planet and we cannot keep 
trashing it," Principal Anthony Knight says. "Our (contribution) is to cut back 
in our trash." . . . But some parents have complained the school has gone too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW STATION: The firefighters of Camarillo's old Station 54 will welcome their 
move next year to a larger $1.5-million station. It will hold both of their 
firetrucks. "And we'll be able to flush the toilets," says Capt. John Moland, a 
seven-year veteran of the old station's plumbing problems (B1). But Moland and 
his crew have mixed emotions. "We like this station. It has big open-beam 
ceilings. It feels more like home." It also has history. And when the World War 
II-era building is torn down, Moland will be there. "There is a time capsule in 
some wall, we want to take it with us."

O.C. DANCE; 'MANON' TOUCHES THE SORE SPOTS; KENNETH MACMILLAN'S UNCONVENTIONAL 
BALLET LOOKS AT THE SEAMY SIDE OF LIFE. THERE'S ROOM FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE, SAYS 
ABT'S GEORGINA PARKINSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Kenneth MacMillan cut the role he created for Georgina Parkinson 
from his full-length ballet "Manon," but she bears him no grudge. In fact, she 
calls MacMillan "a genius" and a man "ahead of his time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an absolutely fabulous pas de deux, which opened Act III in the 
original 'Manon,' " for the Royal Ballet of Great Britain, Parkinson said 
recently by phone from her home in New York City. "I was the courtesan of the 
Jailer. When we later revived it a few years later, Kenneth said the ballet was 
too long and that to introduce a new character in Act III was more than the 
audience could deal with, so it would have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that was that. Nothing personal or anything, he said. He cut the whole 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 That cut notwithstanding, Parkinson said Orange County will be seeing "Manon" 
as MacMillan envisioned it during the American Ballet Theatre's six-day 
engagement beginning Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. This 
is the first time ABT is dancing the full-length ballet in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson danced with the Royal Ballet for about two decades and has been 
ballet mistress at ABT since 1978. In that position, she coaches Cynthia 
Harvey, Julie Kent and Susan Jaffe, who will be dancing "Manon" next week in 
Costa Mesa. MacMillan died in 1992 at the age of 62. He had been director of 
the Royal since 1970, but he also served as Artistic Associate of ABT from 
1984-89. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manon" was his third full-length ballet, choreographed in 1974, nine years 
after his "Romeo and Juliet." For the plot, MacMillan went back to the source 
-- Abbe Prevost's 18th-Century novel, rather than to Massenet's' famous opera. 
To distinguish it further from the opera -- although the plot is by and large 
the same -- the Massenet music that MacMillan used didn't include anything from 
the opera. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1974 interview in the New Yorker, MacMillan said: "The characters 
fascinate me. You have a 16-year-old heroine who is beautiful and absolutely 
amoral, and a hero who is corrupted by her and becomes a cheat, a liar and a 
murderer. Not exactly our conventional ballet plot, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Parkinson said, "When Kenneth did it in 1974, everybody hated 
it. It got dreadful reviews. Kenneth has always been ahead of his time. He 
challenged his audience to look at the way life was, not the way (they) would 
like it to be. Some people find it very stimulating to be confronted with life 
with a capital L, as it really is. But that doesn't incorporate (the audience) 
being carried off on a cloud at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "With ballets by (Frederick) Ashton, everyone left the theater feeling 
fabulous," she added. "But people leave the theater uncomfortable with Kenneth. 
Maybe they've seen things they didn't want to acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it touches many sore places, that's great. That's what I like in the 
theater. But not everybody does. Maybe it's even harder for a ballet audience 
to accept that seamy side of life. But maybe there's room for both attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography for "Manon" is "intensely physical," Parkinson said. "The 
choreography carries the emotion. A lot of what he's saying is written in the 
choreography. But a dancer needs a deep understanding of the character to make 
her come alive for the audience. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to believe in true love. You have to try to prevent (the 
audience) from doing that. This is a woman who is completely in touch with 
herself and only herself, and things that please her and satisfy her. They have 
to have that understanding. They have to read the book, get a grasp of the 
issues. It's about survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manon was a material girl, and she only knew what she wanted at that moment 
and went out just to get that. I don't think she was looking to the 
repercussions of what might happen. And at that time, you were rich or in the 
gutter, a courtesan. She loved all that money gave her as much as she loved 
(her young lover) Des Grieux. It was hard for her to differentiate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the ballet, Parkinson said, is like "watching a novel unfold. And at 
the end, when Manon is dying, there is a great pas de deux, which shows his 
intensity and her intensity in death. It leaves the audience in tears. You 
wanted her to be different and love him all along -- romantic, poetic, soppy. 
The audience wants her to treat him better and she does and when it ends, it's 
too late. She's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the compiled score, Parkinson said, "it works for the ballet. It's a 
little thin in places, but the main melodies are there when he needs them. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "In all three-act ballets, there's padding and filling in. But physically it's 
so beautiful and so of that period. It's very rich in content. It has to be 
given time. I don't think it should be scrutinized on a first viewing. It takes 
a lot of viewings. (Then) more and more stuff comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "MacMillan's very observant about life and love and physical needs and 
romance. I think he was a genius and those pas de deux appeal to one and all. 
He's given the girls such great vehicles -- and the boys, too -- to explore 
themselves and reveal a lot about themselves -- maybe even when they don't want 
to admit what is there." 
</P>
<P>
 * American Ballet Theatre will dance Kenneth MacMillan's "Manon" on Tuesday 
and Sept. 23-25 at 8 p.m., and on Sept. 24 and 25 at 2 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The company 
will dance works by Makarova (after Petipa), Twyla Tharp and James Kudelka on 
Sept. 21 and 22 at 8 p.m. $18 to $55. (714) 740-2000 (Ticketmaster) or (714)

THEATER REVIEWS; IT'S TRUE, SAN CLEMENTE'S 'RUMORS' IS A JOKEFEST 
</P>

 When Neil Simon rolls up his sleeves and decides to get funny, as in "Rumors," 
watch out. Certainly the audience at San Clemente's Cabrillo Playhouse on 
Friday proved helpless before its rapid-fire jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 comedy is a meringue about four wealthy couples at a dinner party. 
The first couple arrives to find their hostess missing and their host with a 
bullet hole in his ear. They feverishly work to hide the truth from the other 
guests while frantically trying to find out what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no serious undercurrent, no baring of the soul as in "Broadway Bound," 
none of the Angst of "Jake's Women." 
</P>
<P>
 But the comedy machine charges with such velocity that the biggest problem the 
San Clemente Community Theatre actors have is failing to wait for the laughs 
before they spring the next jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Simon's humor works like an assault weapon: You can waste a few 
bullets knowing there's still plenty to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 The other remarkable thing about "Rumors," is that the farcical element plays 
funnier in smaller venues. The only problem is that small companies have 
trouble projecting the requisite wealth in the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, despite a barely adequate set, K. Robert Eaton's deft direction kneads 
the audience like a comic massage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Bonnitz starts the play off right as Chris, the nervous, 
so-desperate-for-a-cigarette-she'll-smoke-a-Q-Tip half of the first couple to 
show up. Walter DuRant's high energy as Chris' husband, Ken, pushes the story 
along nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 As the second couple, Diane Aaron offers intelligent elegance as Claire and 
Dee FitzGerald captures husband Lenny's wry slant on life. Barbara Kerek 
Anzlovar at first seems too young as the ache-ridden Cookie, but her disarming 
performance charms anyway. Bill Carden amuses as Cookie's husband Ernie, the 
analyst who hasn't a clue as to what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger B. Manning and Laura Williams as the politician Glenn and his wife, 
Cassie, actually succeed in finding the humor in their constant bickering -- 
not an easy thing with these thinly drawn characters. 
</P>
<P>
 It all adds up to a play that may not be deep but is good for a laugh. Hey, 
it's good for about 100 of them. 
</P>

 Depp Trouble: Film star Johnny Depp ("Edward Scissorhands," "What's Eating 
Gilbert Grape?") was arraigned Tuesday afternoon on charges of fourth-degree 
criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, after allegedly smashing glass lamps and 
tables and causing $9,767 in damages to his room at New York's posh Mark Hotel. 
Depp, 31, was arrested at 5:30 a.m. on charges of second-degree criminal 
mischief, a felony. The charges were lowered after Depp agreed to pay for the 
damage and will be dropped altogether in six months if no further trouble 
ensues. His girlfriend, celebrity model Kate Moss, was with him in the hotel 
room but not charged. A police report said that Depp was "possibly intoxicated" 
during the incident, but officer Eileen Perez told reporters that she did not 
smell liquor on the actor's breath. After the arrest, Depp reportedly told 
police: "I was angry." Depp has had previous brushes with the law: He was 
arrested in 1989 after a noisy party in Vancouver; and in 1991, Phoenix police 
clocked a car he was driving at 93 m.p.h. Earlier this year, fellow actor River 
Phoenix collapsed and died of a drug overdose outside of Depp's L.A. nightclub, 
The Viper Room.

 Suit Threatened: Phoolan Devi, India's famed "Bandit Queen," has threatened to 
sue the Toronto International Film Festival for showing a "humiliating" movie 
that depicts her as a victim of rape and her life story as an abused woman 
turned outlaw. "As soon as I can find the money to hire a lawyer abroad, I will 
sue you and your festival and everyone else that is party to this shameful 
exploitation," Devi, 38, wrote festival director Piers Handling. Devi, who was 
released this year after 11 years in an Indian jail, has filed a court action 
in India against "Bandit Queen," and a judge there has temporarily blocked the 
film from being shown. MOVIES

 Seagal's Ultimatum: Turmoil continues on "Under Siege II," the sequel to 
Steven Seagal's 1992 blockbuster, with the star giving Warner Bros. this 
ultimatum: Either co-star Gary Busey goes or he goes. Busey, who played the 
lead villain in the prequel, was brought aboard the sequel by Jon Peters -- a 
producer who himself bailed from the project this summer. Busey could not be 
reached for comment. Seagal made the ultimatum five days before shooting was to 
begin, so the scramble is now on to find a replacement.

 Wildmon's Violence Study: The four major networks combined had an average of 
47 incidents of sex, violence and profanity in each hour of prime-time 
television, according to a study released this week by the Mississippi-based 
media watchdog group American Family Assn., led by the conservative Rev. Donald 
Wildmon. In a study of all network prime-time programs airing from May 1 to 28, 
the group -- which has targeted several programs including ABC's "NYPD Blue" to 
protest racy or violent content -- found nearly twice as many incidents -- 18.8 
per hour -- on Fox as on the other networks. CBS ranked second with 10 
incidents per hour, NBC had 9.8 and ABC had 8.7. POP/ROCK

 Back in L.A.: The 37th annual Grammy Awards ceremony will return to Los 
Angeles next spring. Michael Greene, national president and CEO of the 
sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, and Mayor Richard 
Riordan will make the announcement at a press conference today at City Hall. 
The Grammys were held regularly at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium for several 
years, until New York City began aggressive campaigns to lure the awards in the 
mid-'80s. The Big Apple has ended up hosting the program at Radio City Music 
Hall three of the last four years, including last March 1. SHAUNA SNOW

TV REVIEW; 'MOMENT OF TRUTH' LACKS NEEDED GRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Franz is much more credible on "NYPD Blue" than he is as a naive 
Louisiana newspaper reporter snookered by the FBI in the methodical TV movie 
"Moment of Truth: Caught in the Crossfire." 
</P>
<P>
 The only element this production has going for it -- aside from a visually 
enticing New Orleans as scenic backdrop -- is the edgy, Emmy Award-winning 
Franz.But without any particular grit or bite in this story of FBI chicanery 
and public corruption, he is mainly reduced to looking duped and anxious after 
he's arrested for unwitting extortion as an inept informer. 
</P>
<P>
 What's difficult to accept (even if the story is reportedly true) is that 
Franz's reporter Gus Payne enthusiastically agrees to inform on the Louisiana 
Mob for the FBI despite his obvious conflict of interest. Even his editor tells 
him it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne's motive, however, has a crust of human truth. Rounding middle age, he's 
tired of interviewing prom queens and covering City Council meetings, he wants 
to be a good citizen and squash crime and, yes, he likes the idea of padding 
his income. Even his wife (the boringly loyal Alley Mills) reluctantly goes 
along with his foolhardy double life. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers D. Victor Hawkins, Tom Nelson and Dan Levine mercifully avoid car 
chases and, except for a quick, opening murder on a bayou county road, they 
negotiate a sex-free, violence-free script. But neither the scenarists nor 
director Chuck Bowman compensate much in the way of an arresting plot or 
character twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Moment of Truth: Caught in the Crossfire" airs at 8 tonight on NBC 
(Channels 4, 36 and 39).

THEATER REVIEW; CORNERSTONE MAKES 'EVERYMAN' A BALL AT THE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How surprised shoppers at Santa Monica Place must be when Death chases 
Everyman in the shadows of Victoria's Secret. It's certainly not your typical 
day at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet what more fitting place to stage "Everyman," the anonymous 
15th-Century morality play and bane of English literature students everywhere, 
than in a temple to materialism? The text reminds us, after all, that "all 
earthly things are but vanity" -- and that includes frilly lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based Cornerstone Theater Company has revived this creaky 
chestnut with a bold leap into environmental theater. In "Everyman in the 
Mall," the troupe leads the audience past vending carts and through service 
corridors as the hapless Everyman journeys toward his spiritual reckoning. The 
result is some of the most engaging and visually exciting theater in town. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, "Everyman" is no great shakes as a play. We read (and, on very rare 
occasions, perform) it less on account of its crude dramaturgy than its 
historic role as a bridge between medieval church performance and the secular 
theater of Shakespeare, Marlowe and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet directors Shishir Kurup and Bill Rauch have creatively employed the mall's 
shops and public spaces to mine the essential drama out of the title 
character's quest for redemption. While often adopting a tongue-in-cheek tone 
-- and playfully updating and revising numerous passages -- the production 
remains as true to the humanistic spirit of the text as its nameless author 
could have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance begins in a small second-level auditorium, where audience 
members and the multiethnic cast mingle in a make-believe "convention of gods 
and goddesses." A door prize is awarded -- a plastic canteen, on review night 
-- just as Death (Page Leong) suddenly appears amid swirling fog in front of a 
toy store. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the imaginations of Kurup, Rauch and company seldom flag. The six 
principal cast members rotate through the role of Everyman, who rushes to 
prepare for Death by consulting such trusted mall personages as Fellowship 
(here played by Ashby Semple as a rich mall shopper), and Goods (Leong, as a 
blond-wigged mannequin in a window display). 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer technical demands, including the use of follow-spots and wireless 
mikes in the cavernous spaces, are daunting. But the show saves its most 
impressive strokes for the mall's familiar conveyances. 
</P>
<P>
 Death, astride a staircase landing, issues her initial warning to Everyman as 
he obliviously rushes into a glass elevator, clutching a shopping bag. Later, 
Everyman (Christopher Liam Moore) confronts Kindred and Cousin (Armando Molina 
and C.J. Jones, as cigar-puffing glad-handers) walking down the up escalator. 
</P>
<P>
 As Everyman ponders his fall from grace amid the trappings of consumerism, you 
begin to perceive a whole new dimension to the slogan "shop till you drop." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Everyman in the Mall," Santa Monica Place, Fourth Street and Broadway, 
Santa Monica. Thursdays-Saturdays, 9 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Oct. 9. $12.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LIVELY NIGHT FROM THE LADIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Slimmed down and grown up a bit since their last appearance in the area about 
a year ago, the Toronto-based Barenaked Ladies proved at the Coach House on 
Monday that more mature isn't necessarily less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet's debut album, "Gordon," was a largely whimsical, congenial effort 
full of witty lyrics and hip jabs at American pop culture.The band's new second 
album, "Maybe You Should Drive," is a bit more serious, so it follows that 
their shows would also be less frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 True. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly two-hour Coach House show steered away from the new work's darker 
selections to emphasize songs with a more palatable pop beat. Still, "The Great 
Provider" came off as a folksy ballad with something genuine to say about 
father-son relationships. More characteristic of the show, though, were such 
numbers as "Alternative Girlfriend," "Life, in a Nutshell" and the new single, 
"Jane" -- all quirky, lively songs about ordinary people's peculiarities. 
</P>
<P>
 The most playful side of Barenaked Ladies emerges in between-songs patter and 
improvisational riffs. And, even though the Ladies have grown up a bit, they 
haven't abandoned forays into rap, which again provided some of the set's most 
delightful moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barenaked Ladies play tonight at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., 7:30 
p.m. $15. (213) 650-1451.

 This irk-a-day world: We can't explain why traffic slowed to a crawl on the 
Ventura Freeway at midday, unless it was because the makers of a "Brady Bunch" 
movie were displaying prop trucks that flashed the messages, "Gang War Riot 
Ahead" and "Killer Bee Gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs, at the Van Nuys Boulevard on-ramp, were supposed to be out of the 
sight of drivers but . . . well, that's show biz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievably weird," said KNX traffic reporter Dona Dower. "Why the Ventura 
Freeway? Why not the Simi Valley, where there's never any traffic?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least none of the motorists decided to join in the "riot."

 Some pork that should have been in Clinton's crime bill: Billie Hart, who has 
an information booth at the World of Pigmania exhibit at the L.A. County Fair, 
contends that pigs are better than those celebrated K-9 units at sniffing out 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pig's smelling capabilities far exceed that of dogs," says Hart. "A pig 
doesn't have to sniff around the drugs -- he gives one snort and goes straight 
to 'em."  
</P>
<P>
 We could see the LAPD forming an Oink-9 unit. The only problem we could 
envision is if the charging porker couldn't fit through the doorway.

 The post office is on strike, too?After reading the cautionary statement on 
the envelope he received from Unocal, Gerald Bronson wasn't sure whether it was 
worth affixing a stamp to it. No wonder the post office is always having money 
problems.

 Who needs the Dodgers anyway?After all, Long Beach will field a minor league 
team in 1995. It has a home stadium -- at Cal State Long Beach. What it doesn't 
have is a nickname. The team, owned by 643 Sports Inc., has requested 
suggestions through today. 
</P>
<P>
 With the deadline upon us, General Manager Paula Pyers says she has received 
more than 2,000 offerings, including such expected ones as Waves, Breakers, 
Surf, Breeze and Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more offbeat suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beach Bums  
</P>
<P>
 * Beach Hogs 
</P>
<P>

 * Tamales

 And one contributor, perhaps anticipating that the new team would emulate the 
major leaguers, suggested:  
</P>
<P>
 * Strikers. miscelLAny Pioneer Robert Widney explained that he started a 
horse-car line in the dusty little pueblo of L.A. in 1873 because "we lived way 
out of town" and he wanted to make sure his wife "could get in and out of town 
without so much trouble." Where was "out of town?" The Widneys lived a few 
blocks south of present-day City Hall on 6th Street.

GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly three years of fruitless verbal sparring, Israel and Syria may at 
last be ready to get serious about trying to reach a tenable peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans another trip to the Middle East 
soon, and he's prepared to shuttle between Jerusalem and Damascus if it appears 
the two countries are prepared to discuss a framework for peace. The word from 
Washington is that Christopher is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has proposed a partial Israeli 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. 
For nearly two decades before that, the Golan was an occasional gun platform 
for Syrian attacks on Israel. The area's strategic importance is a key reason 
why more than 13,000 Israelis have been encouraged to settle there. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's plan for an early Israeli pullback on the Golan in exchange for 
Syria's moving to normalize relations evoked immediate opposition in Israel 
from those who see continued occupation of the plateau as essential to Israel's 
security. The noise level is sure to swell if a basis for negotiations in fact 
is found. That's because Israeli Cabinet officials have rushed to describe the 
Rabin plan as no more than an opening negotiating gambit, the clear implication 
being that at the first sign of give in Syria's position Israel would quickly 
produce a more flexible offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Any negotiations promise to be hard and complex, yet at least on the 
territorial question the outcome of successful talks can be largely foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria insists on control of the Golan because it refuses to accept the 
permanent presence of Israeli forces within artillery range of Damascus, and 
because no Syrian leader could survive if he gave up sovereignty over even a 
tiny part of Syrian territory. Control of the Golan is vital to Israel because 
it is determined that never again will its communities be shelled from Syrian 
territory. Syria won't settle for anything less than virtually total Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan over a relatively few years, which is what Egypt got 
in the Sinai Peninsula. Israel justifiably can accept nothing less than the 
territory's full demilitarization, with international monitors helping to 
assure that Syrian guns never again threaten Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Can a framework and timetable be hammered out that would meet the basic 
interests of the two sides? Recent words from Damascus have been conciliatory. 
Does this mean that agreement is indeed in sight? That's the central assessment 
Christopher will be making during his coming journey, perhaps one of the most 
important of his tenure.

A BIZARRE EVENT'S POTENTIAL VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The astonishing crash of a light plane on the White House lawn Monday morning 
has prompted several top-level investigations, and rightly so. A thorough and 
serious review of presidential security procedures is clearly warranted. But is 
it possible to conduct such a study without the sophomoric finger-pointing or 
ritualistic scapegoating that is so common in Washington? 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will want to know what can be done to prevent airborne threats 
to the White House in the future. An apparently despondent amateur pilot -- 
possibly drunk and bent on suicide -- who steals a plane and aims it at the 
White House, as Frank Eugene Corder did early Monday, is one thing; a terrorist 
bent on penetrating the highly restricted airspace around the White House in an 
attempt to assassinate a President is obviously quite another. The latter might 
well have lethal resources and information that could prove to be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 All that can be said now about White House security in this case is that there 
are too many questions. When did the Federal Aviation Administration know 
something was amiss? If the plane was observed by air traffic controllers, 
either at National Airport or elsewhere in the Washington area, did they know 
they were supposed to notify the Secret Service? If the Secret Service had been 
warned, should the President have been moved out of the danger area? 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service sharpshooters, stationed on the roof of the White House and the 
old Executive Office Building, are reportedly armed with shoulder-fired Stinger 
antiaircraft missiles. But if a fired missile were to miss its target, might it 
hit something in the congested neighborhoods around the White House? Could it 
endanger other aircraft flying nearby? 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the President from many kinds of assault in the middle of a city is 
an onerous responsibility that demands the utmost organization and planning. 
That an airplane could be flown to within feet of the White House is 
disturbing. This bizarre incident will have value only if investigators look 
beyond its specifics to conduct a probing examination of what is being done to 
shield the nation's leader.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; DEBATE, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every politician prefers a campaign he or she can control to one that's 
freewheeling, but campaigns aren't supposed to be conducted for the convenience 
of office seekers. They are run instead to give voters the chance to size up 
and compare the people who seek the public's trust.Part of that process 
requires that a candidate's ideas on the issues of the day be aired and held up 
to public scrutiny. Here, of course, the interests of the public and of 
politicians diverge. Politicians stay out of electoral trouble by avoiding 
controversy. Voters, though, if they are to make informed decisions, must have 
just the kind of forthrightness that politicians instinctively run from. How 
can voters' interests best be served? 
</P>
<P>
 Face-to-face confrontations between candidates -- debates, in a very loose 
sense of the word -- fall well short of the ideal, but they are vastly 
preferable to the manipulative TV spots and mailers that politicians now rely 
on to make their case. The latest Los Angeles Times poll finds a dispiriting 
63% of voters worrying that the state is headed in the wrong direction. 
California's interests, we believe, demand that Gov. Pete Wilson and his 
Democratic challenger, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, meet in a series of 
face-to-face debates. There's been enough posturing about formats and the rest. 
Let a respected neutral outside group, like the League of Women Voters, propose 
a venue that the candidates would agree in advance to accept. Then let them do 
what the democratic process requires. Let them have the courage to stand up and 
defend their records and ideas.

ECONOMY AND CLINTON'S POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Economy Keeps Improving, Why Aren't Clinton's Polls?" by Walter Russell 
Mead, Opinion, Sept. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we are near the end of a long period during which people looked to 
government to solve their problems. In the process, government has come to 
consume over 40% of the economy. It employs 33% of the work force, which 
produces very little; mostly it redistributes our tax money. These people live 
off the money the government takes and returns -- after keeping most of it to 
pay for employees and the redistribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-government workers find themselves strapped because they not only support 
their own families, but also carry the unproductive government sector. Each 
productive private sector worker is paying for almost two families. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous signs that productive workers are disgusted. They will look 
more and more to themselves for solutions in the coming years. The first part 
of this period will likely have a strong tone of morality, individual 
responsibility and high productivity. But first, some crisis will arise that 
will galvanize the productive sector into taking control of government and 
their lives. 
</P>

stupid! 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN SCOTT 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * "Clinton Gets Little Credit for Economic Turnaround" (Sept. 5) reminds me of 
the Rodney Dangerfield line, "I can't get no respect." The reasons presented 
are varied and even hackneyed. Labor Secretary Robert Reich says it's the fault 
of the media. Ho-hum. Others (such as Mead) suggest it's the economy, stupid. 
Most folks have to work harder just to keep up. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman 
of the Council of Economic Advisers, says much the same thing: Blame the media. 
 
</P>
<P>
 They all may be right to one degree or another. May I suggest that a major 
component of respect is trust and confidence in a person's word. Lose that and 
wham! -- get shunned by congressional candidates of your own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember George Bush's "read my lips -- no new taxes" pledge? Bill Clinton 
could do a lot for his credibility, the economy and the slide in incomes with a 
"no baloney, no smoke and mirrors" middle-class tax cut as promised. With about 
40% of middle-class incomes going to every level of government, it's about time 
the pundits, journalists, economists and labor secretaries wake up and smell a 
tax cut long overdue and end transfers of income to those who never deserved 
it.

<P>
 * The President gets no credit because he deserves no credit. He has not done 
anything specific to help the economy. The jobs created are low-paying without 
benefits or a future. The jobs lost have not been replaced in quantity or 
quality. He failed to do what he could to help, such as create new programs to 
repair and expand the infrastructure and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is he talks of percentages and statistics, not people. He should 
talk about the people who have lost jobs and what will be done to make jobs for 
those educated and skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Re "President Who? Democrats Shun Campaign Help," which you considered 
front-page material (Sept. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 It is a President who has to deal with a Congress whose members are Democrats 
or Republicans first and Americans second, and so many of whom are primarily 
interested in being reelected. A President who has to deal with an American 
public that fails as citizens of a democracy to fulfill their responsibility 
with a shocking low voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 A President who, together with his wife Hillary, has had the courage to tackle 
the controversial topics of universal health care and reducing now-excessive 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A President whose Administration had many important accomplishments such as 
deficit reduction legislation, the crime bill, the peace agreement between 
Israel and Jordan and Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestinians, the agreement 
with North Korea that defuses the threat of nuclear proliferation, the creation 
of over 4 million additional American jobs and the passage of the NAFTA 
agreement, so important to the economies of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A President who is concerned about the very complex and troublesome situations 
in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Cuba and former Yugoslavia and whether American 
interests warrant putting the lives of U.S. soldiers at risk, since most past 
international interventions have failed to produce either democracy or economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Let Democrats and Republicans be Americans first and support our President, 
whose main interest is the welfare of all Americans.

DEBATE OVER SLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The state Legislature passed a bill (signed by the governor, Sept. 12) that 
makes it illegal for most employers to prohibit female employees from wearing 
slacks to work.  
</P>
<P>
 Under this law, employers will fear enforcing any type of dress code 
whatsoever on female employees.This law should be thrown out by the courts as 
unconstitutional. It is a sexist law in that it limits enforcement of a dress 
code for female employees only. 
</P>
<P>
 One might expect women to wear slacks or pants in a factory or when working 
out in the fields; however, in the professional world, both in the U.S. and 
abroad, it is expected in many settings that the appropriate attire is a coat 
and tie for male employees and a conservative dress or skirt for female 
employees. The success or failure of many companies may largely depend on the 
image employees project in their work apparel.

 * It is comforting to know that while our California Legislature is trying to 
solve the problems associated with crime, welfare, illegal immigration and job 
erosion, it still has time to debate the merits of whether women should or 
should not be allowed to wear slacks in the workplace (Sept. 1).

DRUG OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is good to see The Times supporting drug courts as an alternative to 
incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders at taxpayers' expense (editorial, Aug. 
31). Will you now review your longstanding and indefensible opposition to 
marijuana legalization? 
</P>
<P>
 Reasonable analysis shows that smoking marijuana, the flowering tops of the 
hemp plant, is far safer for most individuals than using alcohol or tobacco, 
driving a car, or having sex. The social costs would be less, too, if, as a 
society, we reserved our jails for violent criminals and stopped locking up 
otherwise law-abiding people for smoking or growing God's green herb. 
</P>

<P>
 * The Aug. 30 story about the sentencing of Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders' 
son to 10 years in prison for selling one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine to an 
undercover police officer is extremely depressing. Even if nothing else was 
involved, the idea of putting away a young man for 10 years when he hurt no 
one, while rapists and muggers are given much lighter sentences, is a terrible 
indictment of our "justice" system. But given that the young man was arrested 
five months after the sale, on a warrant issued a week after his mother dared 
to suggest that the government study legalization of drugs, it is clear that it 
was a setup to get at the surgeon general. Her son is truly a political 
prisoner, and I hope The Times pursues the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The same edition of your paper told of "three more former Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies" being convicted for seizing drug peddlers' money for 
themselves -- yet another example of the widespread corrupting effect and 
suffering brought upon our society by the criminalization of drugs and by the 
misnamed War on Drugs. It's actually a war on the American people and a war on 
civil liberties.

 Once again the Legislature failed its responsibility by adjourning without 
passage of a school bond measure for the November ballot (Sept. 1).With the 
failure of Proposition 1B on the June ballot, this means that funding of 
desperately needed new schools and modernization of old ones will not be 
available for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently a small contingent in the Assembly held school bonds hostage for a 
new prison bond measure. This is Draconian politics to hold the state's 
schoolchildren hostage. I will remember this when I vote in November. It might 
behoove Gov. Pete Wilson to call a special session to readdress school bonds, 
as it surely will affect him.

U.S. GOVERNMENT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Two articles appeared on consecutive days that I found very ironic. One 
dealt with our relationship with Jordan (Aug. 24) and the other with earthquake 
repair funds (Aug. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 While federal funds to assist earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles (and in 
particular the San Fernando Valley) will fall short by $200 million, the 
President, in a magnanimous gesture, will ask Congress to "write off" Jordan's 
$700 million debt to the United States. As I recall, several years ago, 
President Bush also "forgave" Egypt's $7 billion debt to America. To add insult 
to injury, on the following day (Aug. 26), a national TV news report said the 
U.S. will pull out of Somalia but will continue to provide $50 million per year 
in aid money. 
</P>
<P>
 For a nation with such a huge deficit, the government is very generous with 
our people's hard-earned money. While we "write off" or "forgive" other 
nations' debts to us, the Small Business Administration here in L.A. is turning 
down hundreds of loan requests by our own people, who have suffered tremendous 
earthquake damage, because they may not have the financial ability to repay the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we should all declare ourselves citizens of a foreign country and in 
that way we can be assured of obtaining free aid money from the U.S. 
government.

LOOPHOLE-FREE REFORMS NEEDED; INSURANCE: COMMUNITY RATING -- WHERE EVERYONE 
PAYS THE SAME REGARDLESS OF HEALTH OR OCCUPATION -- IS KEY TO FAIRNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GARAMENDI and LAURA ROSENTHAL, John Garamendi is California Insurance 
Commissioner; Laura Rosenthal is a senior legislative counsel with the 
California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the death of universal health coverage in Congress for this year, 
Washington has turned its attention to incremental insurance reforms. These 
reforms can restore some fairness to the health insurance market, and set the 
stage for more fundamental changes that address access and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But Congress must avoid proposals which would be counterproductive to the 
larger effort for real reform, for example, exempting selected low-risk 
businesses who self-insure or join trade associations from the general risk 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Community rating -- the requirement that everyone pays the same premium 
regardless of health or occupation -- is central to all serious market reform 
proposals. This equitable principle was embodied in the original nonprofit Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield plans. But it was seriously undermined when commercial 
insurers entered the market with special rates for favored occupational groups 
and aggressive medical underwriting to weed out people with potentially 
expensive medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, insurance companies and agents aggressively sold coverage to 
trade associations -- conglomerations of preferred customers -- to the 
disadvantage of other small businesses. Frequently, they established these 
associations themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As carriers excluded uninsurable individuals and businesses, and as costs 
escalated for everyone, other forms of health coverage evolved. One was the 
so-called "multiple employer welfare arrangement" -- a self-insured health plan 
subscribed to by numerous small businesses. MEWAs include both phony insurers 
and health plans operated by non-fraudulent, but frequently undercapitalized, 
small business associations.  
</P>
<P>
 The American health insurance market has become highly fragmented and often 
does not provide insurance at all. Except in states such as California that 
have enacted limited reforms, insurance companies can reject customers at will, 
or charge business owners low introductory rates then raise premiums or cancel 
coverage if employees become really sick. 
</P>
<P>
 We have not one insurance market, but many: one for the entrepreneur who must 
pay thousands of dollars more for health insurance than he did in his corporate 
job; another for the kidney patient who could obtain an insurance policy only 
from a scam insurer that left her owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
medical bills; another for the white collar businessman whose membership in a 
professional association gives him comprehensive health insurance at 
below-market rates, and another for the convenience store owners whose 
insurance premiums are becoming unaffordable because their insurer gives great 
deals to big associations. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this travesty nationally, Congress must adopt market reforms that 
include community rating with no special deals. As a matter of simple 
arithmetic, special deals for selected groups necessarily drive up rates for 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proposals before Congress would reinforce market fragmentation and could 
undermine reforms already implemented in California. For example, the Senate 
"mainstream coalition" bill would permit many small businesses to escape 
community rating by self-insuring, insurers to give special deals to trade 
associations and self-insured MEWAs to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a special committee on health reform of the National Assn. of 
Insurance Commissioners recommends that all businesses with up to 500 employees 
be community-rated, that smaller businesses not be permitted to self-insure and 
that no special status be permitted for trade-association plans. 
</P>
<P>
 These positions reflect strong concerns both about solvency in MEWAs and 
self-insured plans and about the detrimental effect on the general market if 
low-risk groups can opt out. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the California Department of Insurance has opposed amending 
California's existing reforms to create loopholes for associations (about 20% 
to 30% of the small-group market). The California Legislature rejected such 
proposals two years in a row despite massive lobbying by influential trade 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 While incremental insurance market reforms are not the cure for what ails us, 
these reforms have potential to move us in the right direction. Market reforms 
can correct real abuses and create rules that will be necessary in any system 
to provide and fairly finance universal coverage. Having apparently abandoned 
the big fight for this year, Congress must be careful not to re-establish 
privileges and loopholes that will stand in the way of the important work that 
lies ahead.

EVEN UNINTENTIONAL SINS PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH SHAPIRO, American-born writer Sarah Shapiro has lived in Israel since 
1976.Each hour, each day of every person's life can become a memoryand an 
occasion for atonement. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I'm on vacation, not only does my physical self go off-duty, but my mind 
also takes off. This means that while visiting relatives in America a few 
summers back, it was hard to carry my children's dishes to the sink, and hard 
to put their dirty clothes into my mother's washing machine. Thinking, also, 
was not my style -- a disappointment because my opinions as an Israeli citizen 
were occasionally solicited on Israel's "unwillingness to join the peace 
process." When neighbors would ask, "What do you think of James Baker?" I'd say 
something like, "Dresses well but a little bit bald." 
</P>
<P>
 So on our day with Aunt Sophie at her Long Island apartment, perhaps she 
should have known better than to remark that someone should help the lifeguard 
keep an eye on my children in the swimming pool. Sophie had always been one of 
the great dynamic anchors of our family, the revered matriarch on whose 
tireless energy we all depended. Around her, anyone's sense of responsibility 
could wilt. With hindsight, I realize why she thought that I, their mother, 
should assume the poolside duty. But at the time, a photograph album on 
Sophie's coffee table caught my attention just as I was about to get up off the 
couch. What an amazingly interesting album! Sophie and Sam's engagement, my 
cousin Michael as a little boy in summer camp, my father as a 2-year-old. I was 
just about to go out to check on the kids, but Sophie was already returning 
from the pool. Good, I thought, everything's OK. I and the album stayed on the 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was that incident with the key. All of us were getting ready to 
visit Michael and his family, and everyone had gone out to the car except me. I 
had my purse, I had the children's sweaters. I looked around, shut the door and 
proceeded to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophie, who'd been loading the car, turned toward me. Her face fell. "You shut 
the door?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take out my stuff yet! My purse is inside!" 
</P>
<P>
 For the next hour, the children and I sat on the curb and melted in the sun as 
Sophie walked around searching for the manager. I remember how she looked: in 
her late 70s, walking with strain, hands on hips, lips pressed together, 
squinting in the glare (her post-cataract-operation sunglasses were in the 
house.) "I'm sorry," I told her on one of her trips around the building. She 
waved a hand. "Can I help?" I offered the next time she came around. She shook 
her head distractedly. She really should try to make me feel better, I thought. 
How was I to know the door locks by itself? 
</P>
<P>
 At Michael's house that evening, I decided for the sake of our relationship to 
come clean. "You know, Sophie, when I apologized for locking us out, I wish 
you'd been more forthcoming about accepting my apology. I did feel terrible." 
She took her hands out of the dishwater and rested them on the edge of the 
sink. "Sarah," she said, her brown eyes locking gently with mine. "It wasn't 
the key so much. It was the way you just assumed someone else could watch the 
children when they were in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," I replied. "I see. I am sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 She smiled. Then she died. Not on the spot, of course, and I wouldn't suggest 
it had anything to do with the strain of that afternoon. But that was the last 
time I saw Aunt Sophie. My mother called a few days after our return to 
Jerusalem with the news that Sophie had died of a heart attack that Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sin we committed in thy sight unintentionally, reads the Yom Kippur 
prayer.  
</P>
<P>
 For the sin we committed in thy sight willfully or by mistake.  
</P>
<P>
 For the sin we committed in thy sight by casting off responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't do anything that terrible. I was so tired, and it was my vacation, 
after all. How was I to know about the door? It was an innocent mistake, it 
could happen to anyone. And she did accept my apology. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's me who's been getting pinched ever since with this belated 
understanding: In a world in which all things except memories are secretly 
fragile and shockingly temporary, there is no such thing as being on vacation. 
I'm the one who replays that mental movie of Sophie in her pink shirt on the 
green lawn, eyes downcast, eternally walking toward me from the pool. It's I 
who must live with the image -- more precise than in any photo album -- of Aunt 
Sophie circling that condominium again and again, perplexed, squinting into the 
heat of a July afternoon.

MORNING BRIEFING: PATERNO, LIKE HOLTZ, CAN MOAN AND GROAN WITH BEST OF THEM

<P>
 Before Penn State played USC last Saturday, Nittany Lion Coach Joe Paterno 
sounded like Lou Holtz in an interview with Gene Collier of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be interested to see the shock, after what our kids experienced last 
week (a 56-3 rout of Minnesota), of when somebody takes the football with that 
big, strong offensive line and they start going after our kids. It will be 
interesting to see how long it will take our kids to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 The "kids" had adjusted by the coin toss. They led at halftime, 35-0, on their 
way to a 38-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Add USC: It's possible that Penn State's 35-0 halftime lead over USC was the 
largest halftime deficit in Trojan history.  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame beat USC, 51-0, in 1966 and led at halftime, 31-0. California beat 
the Trojans, 52-30, in 1990 and led at halftime, 35-7. Research continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was UCLA's opponent in its first football game in 1919? 
</P>
<P>
 Jingle bells: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that after 
Kansas City's 24-17 victory over the 49ers, Joe Montana's teammates talked 
about him as if he were Santa Claus.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in him," Kansas City offensive lineman Joe Valerio said. "I've 
believed in him since I was 10 years old. He's magical." 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal: Casey Candaele, the former Houston Astro infielder now with the 
triple-A Indianapolis Indians, doesn't believe there has been a wave of minor 
league fever since the major league players went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like the 24-hour flu," he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Optimist: After Livingston, a Division II university in western Alabama, lost 
its first two games by an average of 63 points, Coach Todd Stroud said:  
</P>
<P>
 "When I see eight freshmen starting for us last week on defense, I see the 
future," he said. "I see this team getting better real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 For his sake, it had better. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to move: Richard Rothschild of the Chicago Tribune, writing on future 
realignment of NFL divisions, with Dallas most likely remaining in the NFC 
East: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Dallas is about as Eastern as oil wells and cattle, and every other pro 
team from Texas plays in either a Central or Western Conference or division.  
</P>
<P>
 "A realigned NFC West with Dallas, New Orleans, Arizona, San Francisco and the 
L.A. Rams makes good geographic and competitive sense."  
</P>
<P>
 Just wondering: Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe: "Was there any morning-after 
water-cooler talk in your office after England dumped the U.S. soccer team in 
Wembley Stadium last week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Better banter: Raymond Floyd in Senior Golfer magazine on storytelling on the 
regular and senior tours:  
</P>
<P>
 "There are stories in the locker room on the senior tour. The other guys 
aren't old enough to have stories yet. They're still talking about high school 
football games and things like that. You've got a lot of good stories over 
here."  
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Manual Arts High. UCLA lost, 74-0.

<P>
 Jennifer Capriati, who left the women's tour last year and was later arrested 
on drug charges, wants to return to tennis in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The player's agent, International Management Group, said the 18-year-old star 
has requested wild-card entries for the Barilla indoor tournament in Zurich, 
Switzerland, and the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zurich tournament will be held Oct. 3-9, the Filderstadt tournament Oct. 
10-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati left the tour last year after losing in the first round of the U.S. 
Open. She started playing pro tennis shortly before her 14th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati was arrested May 16 at a Coral Gables motel and charged with 
marijuana possession after she had allegedly spent the weekend partying with 
friends. Acquaintances said she had used heroin and crack cocaine during that 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati spent 23 days in the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami before being 
released from the substance-abuse clinic June 10. Jurisprudence

KARIYA HAS GOAL AND ASSIST IN DEBUT FOR DUCKS

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks lost to the Dallas Stars, 4-3, in an exhibition game Tuesday 
at Reunion Arena that marked the debut of rookie Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, had a goal and an assist, both in the third period, and rookie 
linemate Valeri Karpov, 23, also had a goal and an assist.The two young wingers 
are playing on a line with veteran center Anatoli Semenov, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a learning experience," Kariya said. "I have to learn what I can and 
can't do at this level. Nothing comes just like that. It takes years, not just 
one game." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's goal, at 15:20 of the third, came on what he called "a bad pass" 
meant for Semenov. Instead, the puck went in off defenseman Craig Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
 The game also marked the debut of veteran defenseman Tom Kurvers, a power-play 
specialist the Ducks traded for during the off-season. Kurvers scored the 
Ducks' first goal -- on a power play -- at 12:46 of the second. ROBYN NORWOOD

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
 What does the well-dressed football player wear? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If he is a Ram, it is a replica of the uniform worn by the 1951 team that 
remains the only one in Los Angeles franchise history to have won an NFL title. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The gold jerseys, blue numerals, and white pants will make a return appearance 
Sunday for the game against the San Francisco 49ers at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now, if the Rams can only flash some of that 1951 form. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The offense was one of the most exciting ever, averaging 32 points and 
featuring the passing of Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield, the receiving of 
Elroy (Crazylegs) Hirsch and Tom Fears, and the rushing of the Bull Elephant 
backfield of Deacon Dan Towler, Tank Younger and Dick Hoerner. . . . Van 
Brocklin completed 100 of 194 passes for 1,725 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
Waterfield completed 88 of 176 for 1,566 yards and 13 touchdowns. The league 
passing championship in those days was determined by yards per attempt. 
Champion Waterfield edged runner-up Van Brocklin, 8.90 to 8.89. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder there was a quarterback controversy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joe Stydahar's team went 8-4 to win the National Conference title and 
then defeated the American Conference champion Cleveland Browns, 24-17, in the 
NFL title game before 57,522 at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That's right, postseason play consisted of exactly one game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most distinctive about the uniform, which will be worn again as part of the 
league's 75th anniversary celebration, were the Rams' horns on the helmet. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 One night during the 1948 season, running back Fred Gehrke, who had been an 
art major in college, went home and painted horns on what he thought was an 
uninteresting piece of headgear. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 His teammates approved of the new look and the design has remained to this 
day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gehrke will be one of Georgia Frontiere's guests Sunday along with former Rams 
Hirsch, Fears, Towler, Younger, Hoerner, Don Paul, Howard (Red) Hickey, Henry 
Thompson, Woodley Lewis, Bob Boyd, Stan West and Jim Benton and former general 
manager Tex Schramm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Benton set an NFL one-game record for receiving yardage -- 303 against the 
Detroit Lions in 1945 -- that wasn't broken until 40 years later by Stephone 
Paige of the Kansas City Chiefs. . . . The current record holder is the Rams' 
Flipper Anderson, who caught passes for 336 yards against New Orleans on Nov. 
26, 1989, and would settle for a fraction of that Sunday against the 49ers. . . 
.

 It should come as absolutely no surprise that UCLA will be playing in 
September against a Nebraska team that is ranked first in one poll and second 
in the other. . . .

</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Nebraska on Sept. 24 at Lincoln, 42-10. . . .

<P>
 No. 2 Nebraska on Sept. 12 at Lincoln, 42-33. . . .

 It's terrible how television can dictate the starting times of football games. 
Prime Ticket has decided to televise the USC-Baylor game Sept. 24 at the 
Coliseum, meaning a change was made Monday on the kickoff time from 12:30 p.m. 
to 7 p.m. What about the fan who had shelled out good money for tickets and 
made plans for that evening? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You could have watched live college football on the tube nonstop from 9 a.m. 
Saturday to 1 a.m. Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Elway was 15-18 as a starting quarterback at Stanford. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those two touchdown catches against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday might 
start turning it around for former Trojan Curtis Conway, who has been a 
disappointment with the Chicago Bears. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe putting William Perry in the backfield would solve the Eagles' short 
yardage-for-a-touchdown rushing problems. The Fridge has experience, you know. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Julio Cesar Chavez beats Meldrick Taylor and Frankie Randall defeats Juan 
Coggi as expected Saturday night, Chavez and Randall will be rematched Dec. 10. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The two best of the six title fights on the MGM Grand card should be World 
Boxing Council super featherweight champion James Leija vs. Gabriel Ruelas and 
International Boxing Federation welterweight champion Felix Trinidad vs. Yory 
Boy Campas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those four fighters have a combined record of 145-2-2. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The new heavyweight sensation is Michael Nunn, who weighed 195 pounds the 
other night. . . . I wonder what the Dodgers' magic number is.

SAILING; DORESTE MAKES A STRONG MOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Luis Doreste of Spain, who helped to win two Star class world 
championships as crew for Antonio Gorostegui in 1982 and '83, made his best 
move toward winning one as skipper by finishing first in Tuesday's third race 
of the 73rd Star worlds at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Doreste was still far off the lead halfway through the event, having placed 
29th and 30th in the first two races because, he said, "I was not 
inspired.(Those were) the most difficult races I have ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Ross MacDonald, who won the second race, remained the overall leader 
after finishing seventh Tuesday. San Francisco's John Kostecki was third with 
placings of 1-9-4.  
</P>
<P>
 The Etchells world championship at Newport Beach had a lay day Tuesday. Both 
competitions are scheduled to conclude Friday. RICH ROBERTS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL FIGHTING MAD OVER BRAWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle Seahawks Coach Tom Flores was furious over the Raiders' behavior 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And Raider Coach Art Shell was equally angry after reviewing game films.Shell 
wasn't about to defend the action of his players in a fight that resulted in 
the ejection of defensive linemen Chester McGlockton and Aundray Bruce with the 
Raiders trailing, 7-3, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With their already thin defensive line decimated, the Raiders were outscored, 
31-6, the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when Raider linebacker Winston Moss appeared to punch 
Seattle quarterback Rick Mirer while Mirer was on the ground. Seahawk lineman 
Ray Roberts rushed to Mirer's defense, which led to the involvement of 
McGlockton and Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Moss give Mirer a cheap shot? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a cheap shot unless you get caught," said Moss, who was not 
penalized on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell was upset with every Raider involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be stupid," he said. "Those things are uncalled for. You (might) 
want to go in and help your buddy, but the whistle has blown, the flags are up. 
You cease. You stop. You just don't do that because, invariably, it hurts your 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders led the league last season in penalties (148) and penalty yardage 
(1,181), falling one penalty short of the league record. 
</P>
<P>
 They are off to another infamous start this season with 19 penalties for 125 
yards in two games. What can Shell do to stop the whistles? 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about it," he said. "Preach about it. Behind closed doors, you discuss 
it." STEVE SPRINGER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; COLBERT TAKES OVER FOR GREENWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Colbert was on the field for all 79 of UCLA's defensive plays Saturday 
against Southern Methodist, but that was a special case. The Mustangs play a 
four-receiver, run-and-shoot type of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska is another story. Colbert, the fifth defensive back in a five-back 
set, figured to play little on Saturday against the No. 2 Cornhuskers, who are 
basically a team that runs the ball and dares you to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Carl Greenwood broke his ankle in the third quarter of the SMU game, and 
suddenly Colbert had the status of a starter. He is a cornerback, and as a 
sophomore replacing a senior, figures to be one for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure it's a gift," Colbert said. "I'm grateful for it." 
</P>

 The winner of the Tommie Frazier look-alike contest this week is Eric Scott, 
who is emulating Frazier, Nebraska's Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback, with 
the scout team. It's mostly because of Scott's quickness. Frazier has run for 
214 yards and passed for 188 in two games. . . . The starting time for the 
UCLA-Washington State game at the Rose Bowl Sept. 24 has been fixed at 3:30 
p.m. by Prime Ticket. . . . Skip Hicks, considered out for the season because 
of a knee injury, lined up for a few walk-through plays with the offense 
Tuesday. JIM HODGES

 Four-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman Bill Fralic is making his retirement 
official.Fralic, 31, sent retirement documents to the NFL office this month. 
Fralic, who spent eight of his nine pro years with the Atlanta Falcons, left 
for Detroit as an unrestricted free agent before the 1993 season. He was waived 
by the Lions, at his request, after the team asked him to take a salary cut. He 
got offers from several teams, but said he was certain about his decision to 
retire.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RECEIVER ANDERSON OFF TO A FAST START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all but vanishing from the Rams' offense last year, wide receiver 
Flipper Anderson has more receiving yards in two games than Green Bay's 
Sterling Sharpe, Michael Haynes of New Orleans and Dallas' Michael Irvin and 
Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's 154 yards on five catches Sunday against Atlanta gives him 198 
yards for the season, third in the NFC behind Atlanta's Andre Rison (316) and 
San Francisco's Jerry Rice (247). Irvin has 174 yards, Haynes 158, Harper 146 
and Sharpe 101. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flipper is running really well right now," receivers coach Steve Moore said. 
"I remember working him out at the Senior Bowl, when he was coming out of UCLA, 
and he is quicker, faster and certainly more skilled than he ever was then." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson caught only one touchdown pass in his final 10 games last season, his 
lack of productivity coinciding with quarterback Jim Everett's decline. But the 
Rams signed quarterback Chris Miller, one of the best deep throwers in the 
game, and hoped Anderson would return to his 1989 form, when he caught 44 
passes for 1,146 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He is averaging 33 yards a catch this season, including a 54-yard bomb from 
Miller and a 41-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With San Francisco defensive end Richard Dent sidelined because of a torn knee 
ligament, the Rams might be lining up across from Charles Mann on Sunday. Mann, 
a former all-Pro with Washington, met with 49er coaches and officials Tuesday. 
The Rams worked out Mann during training camp, but didn't offer him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In seven seasons with Atlanta, Miller was 3-7 against San Francisco. In those 
10 games, he completed 58.6% of his passes with nine touchdowns, but was 
intercepted 14 times. . . . The Rams have a three-game home winning streak 
dating to last season, but they haven't beaten the 49ers in Anaheim Stadium 
since their 16-13 victory on Sept. 14, 1986. . . . First-round pick Bryant 
Young starts for the 49ers at defensive tackle and is among the team's leading 
tacklers with seven. The 49ers selected him with the eighth pick, acquired in a 
trade with the Rams. . . . Right tackle Jackie Slater, a 19-year veteran who 
will start his 249th game Sunday, moved to guard for two series in the fourth 
quarter after starter Leo Goeas suffered a knee injury. "That was something I 
haven't done in 15 years," Slater said. MIKE REILLEY

FISH REPORT: ANGLER DOESN'T GIVE UP, LANDS A LUNKER CATFISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Yee got mad, but then he got even. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing for catfish at Irvine Lake on a recent morning, he took his eye off 
his pole and it was promptly pulled overboard by what was believed to be a 
large catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Yee went home for another rod, went back to the same location at the lake, and 
pulled out a 24-pound channel catfish.  
</P>
<P>
 Catfish angling remains superb at the lake, with several fish tipping the 
scales at more than 10 pounds.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: THEY FOUND A SPOT WHERE TUNA ARE HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What started as a basic fishing trip to the islands turned into one of the 
better tuna trips of the year for the local fleet, and it appears a tuna season 
is finally under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Conklin of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's First String, carrying 30 passengers 
from an Eagle Claw fishing school prepared more for calico bass and rockfish, 
responded to reports of tuna at an offshore bank about 60 miles southwest of 
San Pedro and found the fish Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kovach, in charge of the school, said the passengers were fishing the high 
spot for rockfish for nearly three hours before the tuna showed, crashing the 
surface after bait fish. Everyone reeled in and four trolling rigs were put 
out. All four lures were hit almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were skipjacks to 15 pounds and then the yellowfin followed," Kovach 
said. "A lot of the guys weren't really prepared. We had a lot of guys get 
spooled on 12- and 15-pound test." 
</P>
<P>
 The First String went back to the area Monday and its 40 passengers boated 
another 51 yellowfin and 61 skipjack, most fish weighing 10-25 pounds. Conklin 
said the fishing was "as good as you'd want it," with fish hitting bait and 
iron lures.  
</P>
<P>
 The fishing slowed Tuesday, merely because the weather was so rough it made it 
hard for the boats to stay on the fish. Still, the Toronad out of Long Beach 
Sportfishing reported having caught nine fish by 11 a.m. Conklin couldn't be 
reached as of Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peterson, owner of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, said the landing will run 
daily trips to the area until the tuna disappear. Long Beach will run regular 
trips as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California's second "Free Fishing Day," offering people a chance to go fishing 
without buying a license, will be Sept. 24, and the Department of Fish and Game 
has come up with an angle to lure new faces into the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family Fishing Day" is scheduled at El Dorado East Regional Park in Long 
Beach from 8 a.m. to noon. The DFG and city of Long Beach will lend equipment 
to a limited number of participants and experts will be available for hands-on 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $5 a car, with the first 100 car-poolers getting in free. 
</P>
<P>
 Free fishing days are held twice annually in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Blue marlin are scattered outside Cabo San Lucas, with some 
closer than they have been all year. An angler from Connecticut caught and 
released three marlin in one day aboard the Tracy Ann. The fleets reported some 
fish to 500 pounds, but most ranged from 150-300 pounds. Dave McCoy of Long 
Beach caught a 456-pound black marlin aboard the Pisces' Karina. There is an 
abundance of dorado and tuna offshore as well. An Arizona angler aboard the 
charter yacht Rapfsody caught an 85 1/2-pound bull dorado. Wahoo fishing is 
fair at best. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Tuna and dorado are striking feathers with surprising consistency. 
The tuna are running 25-50 pounds and the dorado 20 pounds. Blue marlin and 
striped marlin are occasionally striking larger lures or being baited farther 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 La Paz: Yellowfin tuna 50-100-pounds are still bending rods south of Espiritu 
Santo Island, and the Mosquito fleet is targeting them daily. Bob Butler's 
panga fleet is running outside of Cerralvo Island and encountering more dorado 
than it knows what to do with. "It's the best I've seen it in 25 years," Butler 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range -- The overnight fleet is still waiting for an improved 
tuna bite, and the multi-day boats are still finding plenty of tuna to tackle. 
The American Angler returned Sunday from a six-day trip halfway down the Baja 
California peninsula and its passengers bagged their limits in two stops. "We 
got there (at the Uncle Sam Bank) at 4:30 and picked up 200 before dark, and 
the next day we got the rest," said Dan Sansome, owner of the vessel. "We 
released more than 100 tuna." They also picked up 200 dorado from under 
floating kelp paddies on the way down and 140 yellowtail at San Benito Island 
on the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 FRESHWATER -- The annual Mammoth Lakes Fall Trout Derby will take place 
Saturday from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. Trophy-sized trout will be stocked in all lakes 
before the event and this year Convict Lake and Crowley Lake, as well as the 
lakes within Mammoth Lakes proper, are eligible sites. There will be awards for 
the largest fish, but most prizes will be won in a drawing at the end of the 
tournament. There is no fee. Details: (800) 367-6572. . . . A float-tubers-only 
tournament will be held at Crowley Lake on Sept. 24-25. Cost is $20. Details: 
(714) 546-4370. . . . Full Moon Madness, held each full moon at Irvine and 
Corona lakes, will be repeated Saturday, offering fishermen a chance to take 
advantage of the night catfish bite. Both lakes will reopen at 6 p.m. and close 
at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- Deer seasons are coming to a close, but seasons for mountain quail, 
blue and ruffed grouse, ptarmigan and tree squirrels got under way Monday. The 
DFG is offering a free 10-hour course that will enable prospective hunters to 
obtain their mandatory hunter safety certificates. The course will be held 
Saturday at 6:30 a.m. at Raahauge's Pheasant Hunting Club in Norco. Details: 
(800) 773-4868. . . . Duck, whitewing and mourning dove hunting dates in the 
state of Sinaloa, Mexico, have been set. Whitewing dove opens Oct. 22, closing 
Feb. 25, 1995; mourning dove opens Nov. 5 and closes Feb. 5, and duck opens 
Nov. 5 and closes March 6. The area around Los Moches is renowned for its 
outstanding whitewing dove and duck hunting and experts say conditions are 
excellent. Details: (818) 707-7393. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign into law soon a measure 
that will make it legal -- beginning Jan. 1 -- for anglers in inland lakes to 
use two fishing poles. A special stamp will be required, however, at a cost of 
$7.50. The DFG says revenue generated might total as much as $2 million 
annually, but it remains to be seen whether anglers are willing to shell out 
the extra cash, considering what many feel is an already high price for a basic 
annual fishing license, $25.40.

 Kevin Feterik inherited one of the Southland's optimum duties this summer when 
he became starting quarterback at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins entered the season with a 35-game unbeaten streak, including 
three consecutive Southern Section titles. They've earned those victories 
primarily behind one of the area's most proficient passing attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the quarterback at Los Alamitos means getting to pass at least 30 times 
a game and finishing the season with 2,000 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, a 6-foot-2, 180-pound junior, was off to a promising start in the 
season opener last Friday against La Palma Kennedy when he fell on his left 
throwing hand and suffered a broken bone. The break is in the middle of his 
hand below the ring finger and is expected to heal in two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left the game in the second quarter, Feterik had completed 18 of 20 
passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns. After the injury, Feterik stayed in 
the game and finished the series with four more completions, including a 
20-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got ice in those veins," said Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes. "If he 
hadn't gotten hurt, he would've finished with over 500 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, 16, was replaced by sophomore Sean Stein, who helped the team extend 
its unbeaten streak to 36 games with a 24-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feterik family was busy Monday, conferring with doctors. Kevin will not 
have to wear a cast, and he hopes the healing process will be speeded by 
acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to mesh together the best of Western and Eastern medicine," said 
Terri Feterik, Kevin's mother. "We want this to heal as quickly as possible."

 The revolving door for football coaches at Playa del Rey St. Bernard continued 
in full swing last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Noonan, who coached the Vikings to a Southern Section playoff berth last 
year, walked off the job Tuesday--three days before the team's season opener 
against Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McClune, St. Bernard's athletic director, said he was not given a reason 
for the resignation and that Noonan also quit his teaching post at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps he was having some personal problems that no one knew about, but he 
seemed to be happy and doing a fine job," McClune said. "The timing was really 
lousy." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan was unavailable for comment. He replaced Tom Strickland in August of 
1993 after Strickland quit one week before the start of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime assistant James Swain will take over coaching duties in the interim. 
McClune, who has already received numerous inquiries, said a permanent 
replacement should be hired before Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City defeated St. Bernard, 26-12, Friday night. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 It was a tough coaching debut for Larry Mohr, who replaced Harry Welch at 
Canyon Country Canyon earlier this year. Welch won three Southern Section 
titles in 12 seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who compete in Division II, lost their opener to Righetti, a 
Division VII team, 37-22, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Host Righetti ended a 12-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ugly, a tough night," Mohr said. "This team has a lot to learn. For 
one thing, we're not going to show up and beat people just because we're the 
Cowboys." 
</P>

 The California Interscholastic Federation, the state's high school athletic 
governing body, is expected to return to financial stability this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization had to dip into its reserves last year because it was without 
any corporate sponsorship. The outlook brightened during the summer when Toyota 
Motorsales USA Inc. signed on as a title sponsor in July. Since then, other 
companies have joined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to meet and possibly exceed our goal of raising $1 million this 
year," said Bob Seagren of Marketing and Financial Management Enterprises of 
Woodland Hills, which is representing the CIF in marketing endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota replaces Reebok, which bowed out in July of 1993, as title sponsor. 
Details of the contract are still being worked out, but it is believed to be 
worth at least $1.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota joins Vons Inc., Tombstone Pizza and Herff Jones as corporate sponsors. 
Seagren said deals with Dial and ShasCo Inc. are pending but that each is 
expected to contribute a minimum of $100,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated $1 million will be split proportionately among the CIF's 10 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our intent and aim to get the money back into the schools as soon as 
possible," said Margaret Davis, CIF associate commissioner. Prep Notes

 The state's longest losing streaks continued in the opening week of the 
season. Huntington Beach Ocean View ran its winless streak to 30 games with a 
50-6 loss to Costa Mesa, while Los Angeles Jordan increased its streak to 27 
games with a 21-19 loss to Harbor City Narbonne. Jordan's loss spoiled the 
coaching debut of Willie Brown, a three-time Super Bowl winner as a player and 
coach with the Raiders. "It was the first game of the season and the kids 
played hard," Brown said. . . . Ryan Williams of Bellflower St. John Bosco 
turned in one of the weekend's top performances in a 48-10 victory over 
Huntington Beach. Williams rushed for 268 yards in 10 carries, including 
touchdown runs of 80, 76, and 44 yards. He also scored on a 99-yard kickoff 
return. Times' Top 20 Football Poll

LOS ALAMITOS; LONGSHOT DAILY TRIPLE PUTS FIGUEROA A GIANT STEP FARTHER IN 
COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jockey Roman Figueroa hadn't had a major victory this meeting before riding 
Daily Triple in the $85,000 Governor's Cup Derby last Friday. But in Figueroa's 
mind, he had already scored his biggest victory of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping my fingers was a pretty big win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa was alluding to an accident that nearly ended his riding career 
earlier this year. In mid-February, Figueroa was working in his garage when he 
accidentally cut his hand on a table saw. The accident nearly severed four of 
the fingers from his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2 1/2-hour operation, doctors were able to save Figueroa's fingers, 
including the index finger, which had bone and joint damage. In the process, 
they saved his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went into surgery the surgeon knew he was an athlete and needed his 
hand, so he did everything possible to save it," said Figueroa's wife, Brenda. 
</P>
<P>
 For about two months, Figueroa underwent physical therapy for his hand. In 
mid-April, about the same time the Los Alamitos meeting was opening, he decided 
to discontinue it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to therapy for a long time, but it wasn't helping," Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was late May, more than three months after the accident and six weeks into 
the meeting, before Figueroa rode in a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot to do with your hands," Figueroa said. "A lot of your riding is 
in your hands and feeling your horse." 
</P>
<P>
 And feeling was one thing the 39-year-old jockey was having trouble with. 
There was none in his index finger and he had limited sensation in the others. 
Although he was no longer attending therapy sessions, Figueroa exercised his 
hand, doing stretches and strengthening exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 He had ranked 10th in the nation in money earned last year but is far from 
that kind of success this year. He has chances, with mounts in many of the 
stakes races at Los Alamitos, among them the Kindergarten and Miss Kindergarten 
Futurities and the Los Alamitos Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had kind of a cold meet so far, so you get to thinking it's the hand," 
he said. "If I said it felt comfortable all the time since I've been back, I'd 
be lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Friday, Figueroa got the mount on a 25-1 shot named Daily Triple 
for the Grade I Governor's Cup Derby. Jockey Ralph Seville had qualified both 
Daily Triple and Movados for trainer Brian Koriner and chose to ride Movados in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Triple, who had not won a stake since last year's Kindergarten Futurity, 
was part of a strong field that included Southern California Derby winner 
Artesias Special Gal, multiple stakes winner Totally Illegal and Grade I stakes 
winner Rainbow Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa took Daily Triple to the front early, battling The Money Crunch for 
the lead. Drawing away near the wire, Daily Triple defeated The Money Crunch by 
a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the first major victory of the year for Legacy Ranch, which owns 
Daily Triple. But it wasn't the first Governor's Cup Derby victory for the 
ranch, which had won it in 1989 with Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold, an 8-year-old gelding, has since made a name for himself as the best 
distance quarter horse in the nation. The three-time champion, however, has had 
trouble this year. He started the year in the 400-yard All-Star Jockey 
Challenge, in which he finished fifth. Returning to 870-yard races, Griswold 
finished second in the Table Tennis and Pat Hyland Memorial Handicaps, each 
time under John Creager. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold, who is trained by Daryn Charlton, will get a chance to redeem 
himself Saturday night in the 870-yard Katella Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing everything we ask him," said Legacy co-owner Pete Parella of 
Griswold. "I think he's going to run a big race in the Katella Handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 Parella indicated that Henry Garcia might ride Griswold, as he did during the 
horse's 1991 and 1992 championship campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator, the defending world champion, is a probable starter in the Grade 
I Vessels Maturity on Friday night. The gelding will seek to avenge his loss to 
Down With Debt in the Go Man Go Handicap last month. . . . Arabians will also 
be featured this weekend, with four races scheduled Friday and Saturday: the 
$100,000 Gladys Brown Edwards Handicap, the $40,000 California Open and two 
divisions of the $30,000 Arabian Cup Juvenile.

DEL MAR; TIMBER COUNTRY HEADS FIELD FOR FUTURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big stakes races for 2-year-olds are all about wishes and dreams, and 
today's $250,000 Del Mar Futurity is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Futurity is the traditional curtain call of this 43-day meeting, a 
seven-furlong look at what is to come. The trainers and owners come into this 
one with a variety of sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally, for example, does not know if his glass is half empty or 
half full. He has On Target, winner of his only start, but he wishes Mr Purple, 
also unbeaten, had not fallen through the cracks in the nominating process. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hadn't even run yet when nominations were due," McAnally said. "But both 
Mr Purple and On Target have been training identically. One would go out and 
run seven-eighths in 25 and 2 (1:25 2/5th) and the other would go out and run 
seven-eighths in 25 and 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lukas barn has the probable favorite, Balboa Stakes winner Timber Country, 
but trainer Wayne Lukas would like to see this race run at a mile around two 
turns, as it was until 1993. He wishes his colt had a little farther to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won his last time out and he's trained well since," said Jeff Lukas, his 
father's assistant. "We feel he'll be better when the distance is stretched, 
but he has to be tested against these horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Lukas would like another furlong, the handlers of Desert Mirage and 
Supremo are looking for maybe another length. Both were defeated by Timber 
Country by less than that margin in the Balboa Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Canadian invader A.J. Jett, winner of five in a row over a 
five-furlong track in Vancouver. His owner, Jim Whyte, hopes he did not waste 
$20,000 supplementing and shipping his $2,800 colt to California. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Jett represents the mystery element in a nine-horse field, Timber Country 
having defeated Houston Sunrise and Desert Pirate as well as Desert Mirage and 
Supremo in the Balboa. The others, Glittering Event and Strong Ally, are not 
stakes-tested, giving them an element of mystery as well. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the early-career measurement of Timber Country vs. Mr Purple will 
have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr Purple is obviously very good," Jeff Lukas said. "I'm sure they will have 
other opportunities."

THEATER REVIEWS; WOMEN 'ON THE VERGE': GOOD AS THEIR WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the reasons for the continuing success of Eric Overmyer's "On the 
Verge," both for audiences and for clearness of its text, is its fascination 
with words and, more specifically, wordplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Its simplistic fantasy -- three 19th-Century female anthropologist explorers 
set out for an unknown land called "Terra Icognita" and find that it actually 
is the future -- is slight enough to allow Overmyer's verbal somersaults full 
rein. 
</P>
<P>
 At Orange Coast College's Drama Lab, director Heather deMichele knows about 
this, and her three explorers keep the language forging ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the pace lags is when she makes too much of nonverbal staging, 
with her protagonists whacking through the bush for much too long and spending 
much too much time arranging and lighting candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the effective crossing of jungle gorges pales in its leisurely execution. 
At these times Overmyer's imperative is forgotten, his poetry silenced. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times DeMichele manages to keep the words flying in fine fashion, 
allowing the action to underline the dialogue, particularly in the hectic 
second act. She and her actresses are well aware of the straight-faced sobriety 
with which such lines as "the jaundice of yellow journalism" must be tossed 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three intrepid voyagers have the right feel for their Victorian origin. 
Kristina Leach as the starchy Mary, Bronwen Bitetti as the giddy Alex, who 
admits her obsession with words even though she often uses the wrong one and, 
particularly, Anna Fitzwater as the prim and naively romantic Fanny, are of the 
period. They easily make effective transitions into women who discover their 
true terra incognita -- the 1955 future -- where everything is more possible 
than it was 70 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Messerschmitt is less effective his gallery of cartoon people the trio 
meets along the way, from a horny Yeti and a South African cannibal who ate a 
German balloonist. He's most effective as Fanny's gentle but colorless husband 
but usually overdoes his physical shtick to little purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stayner's lucid lighting design and Robert A. Williams Jr.'s excellent 
sound design nicely frame DeMichele's mostly effective production.

TV RATINGS; JERRY RICE CARRIES THE BALL ACROSS THE GOAL FOR ABC

 Jerry Rice was the biggest star on television last week. Figures released 
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed that the "Monday Night Football" 
game--in which Rice scored three touchdowns to set an NFL career record of 127, 
leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 44-14 win over the Raiders--was the 
top-rated program last week.It was seen in about 19 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's Emmy Awards telecast on ABC finished at No. 9 among the week's 85 
prime-time network programs, registering a 7% ratings increase over last year 
for its best showing since 1986, ABC reported. The program was seen in about 
14.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Minutes" began its 27th season with a seventh-place finish and helped give 
a big send-off to the new CBS comedy that followed on Sunday, "The Boys Are 
Back," which placed 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning for its fifth season, Fox's "Beverly Hills, 90210" placed 10th and 
tied its best-ever rating, which had come for the season finale last May. Among 
Fox newcomers, "New York Undercover" ranked 49th, "Wild Oats" was 68th, 
"M.A.N.T.I.S." was 75th and "Fortune Hunter" was 79th. Southland Ratings

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; CRASH PADS FOR 
POLICE RARELY A 'SUITE' DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "bridal suite" at the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire station 
is a room kept clean by volunteers. At the Van Nuys Division, no room is 
available, so a bunk bed crammed into a hallway has to suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bridal suite" is cop slang for station house crash pads for officers who live 
too far away, or work too late, to make morning court appearances or other 
appointments if they go home for the night. Much overtime and long days are a 
routine part of the police officer's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of accommodations runs from faux Bonaventure to a bad night at the 
Bates Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, every station has had one," said Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD 
spokesman. "I think there's one here in Parker Center, but I don't know where 
it is anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Most LAPD stations try to have separate rooms for male and female officers, a 
tough task at stations where space is already at a premium.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rampart and West Valley divisions have trailers behind their station. 
</P>
<P>
 If a jail cell is empty, male West Valley officers will sometimes sleep behind 
bars when female officers need to spend the night in the trailer, said Sgt. Dan 
Carnahan. But Carnahan says he, for one, just doesn't feel comfortable sleeping 
in a cell next door to the cell of a man he may have put there. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer stations, like Devonshire, usually have nicer rooms because cot rooms 
were part of the building's original design. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recent years, with all the natural and unnatural disasters that have 
descended on Los Angeles, cot rooms have gotten more and more use, officers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike Sonntag of the Devonshire station said that just about every night, 
at least one officer beds down in the four-bunk room there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rooms "get kinda grungy but you're in a situation where, say you get off 
at 3 a.m. and you have an 8 a.m. court date. What are you gonna do?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill Division station, currently undergoing major renovations, has a 
brand new cot room with carpeted floors, separate sleeping areas for male and 
female officers, air conditioning, a reading light and even a window. The only 
thing it doesn't have are beds just yet, but officers are using jail mattresses 
until they arrive, said Sgt. Tom Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no complaints, you can sleep there," said Smart, who did just that 
last week to make an early morning meeting. Sleeping rooms are also a safety 
measure to spare worn-out officers from long, sleepless drives home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys station's bridal suite isn't actually a room at all, but rather a 
corner of a basement hallway where a bunk bed has been crammed in, home for the 
night to any two of 350 officers who work there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Brett Papworth, a Van Nuys watch sergeant, says there are many times when 
officers need a place to lay their head, but the Van Nuys bridal suite is 
rarely vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans to expand the cot rooms for both men and women at some 
stations, newly important because the department is now studying a proposal to 
change police workweeks to three 12-hour shifts or four 10-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 That study is now moving through the department's chain of command, said the 
department's press relations office. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no cot room at the North Hollywood station, one of the older Valley 
stations, said Sgt. Robert Balderrama. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have a cot room, because there is no place for anyone to 
go and get any sleep around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderrama said North Hollywood officers sometimes sit in their cars all night 
or go to a 24-hour restaurant and drink coffee to stay awake until a morning 
court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 77th Street station, the bridal suite is sort of a challenge to the 
officers' bravery, to hear them describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 They have to share a musty-smelling basement room in a 69-year-old building 
with a small army of cockroaches, said Sgt. Paul Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would bet that if you gave the guys a choice of sleeping in a rice paddy or 
the cot room, they'd sleep in the water," Hernandez said. "I don't think anyone 
goes down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez describes it as more a "conversation piece" than a practical 
alternative to a long drive, and Dunkin calls it "about as close to a hovel as 
you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 But help is on the way: by March, 1994, construction will begin on a new 
station on the site of the present one.

 The Verdugo Mental Health Center's  
</P>
<P>
 Arden House, a Glendale day-rehabilitation program for those suffering from 
schizophrenia, anxiety disorders or severe depression, will hold two 
fund-raisers this week to supplement a limited government-subsidized budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The first event, a dinner benefit at a local Sizzler Steak Restaurant, is 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The second will be a square dance at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Eagle 
Rock on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arden House exists through state funds provided by the Los Angeles County 
Department of Mental Health.  
</P>
<P>
 The program helps people with mental illnesses by offering them safety lessons 
on how to avoid being victimized, field trips, arts and crafts classes and 
general group and individual therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "clubhouse" setting, Arden House members attend sessions three times a 
week, choosing activities that best suit their needs.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's dinner will be from 5 to 8 p.m. at the restaurant at 1544 Canada 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8.50 admission includes an entree and salad bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The square dance Sunday will be from 1 to 5 p.m. in the church at 2109 
Chicksaw Ave.  
</P>

FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As our children returned to school last week, many of them entered aging 
facilities needing repair, upgrade and improvement. Most of them sat in classes 
with over 30, often close to 40, peers.In many places around the state, class 
was held in "temporary" trailers disguised as classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 With the slim defeat of the June bond proposition and the state Legislature's 
failure to place a new, smaller request before the voters in November, the 
facilities are guaranteed to get older, class sizes larger, and the "temporary" 
trailers won't be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fastest growing districts in Orange County, the short-term impact is 
that 13 building projects worth about $60 million are indefinitely on hold. In 
the longer term, Santa Ana Unified School District alone needs 15 new schools 
plus expansions and maintenance of existing schools. It is estimated that $6 
billion worth of new classrooms are needed statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire issue of school funding needs to be reviewed and replaced with a 
rational system. The question is how long are we going to wait before we insist 
that all of our children have proper school facilities without regard to a 
Beverly Hills, 90210, or a Santa Ana, 92701, address?

KARIYA SCORES IN DUCK DEBUT; HOCKEY: AFTER TENTATIVE START, ROOKIE ADJUSTS AND 
GETS GOAL IN LATE GOING OF 4-3 LOSS TO STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Call him Paul Kariyaov. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kariya had a goal and an assist in his NHL exhibition debut Tuesday night 
in the Mighty Ducks' 4-3 loss to Dallas, playing on a line with center Anatoli 
Semenov and fellow rookie Valeri Karpov, who also had a goal and an assist in 
his debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul plays like a Russian," Semenov said. "He plays like Pavel Bure. He has 
speed and he's smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do love borscht," he said. "I was telling (Semenov) he should make some for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov, a veteran who had his best NHL season while playing on a line with 
Bure in Vancouver, knows Kariya isn't as strong or quite as rocket-fast as 
Bure, but, he says, "Same thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, seemed tentative early in Tuesday's game, unable to pull off the 
moves he had in mind -- even tripping over referee Don Koharski's skate at one 
point. But shift after shift, he made adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning I expected that. He got more confident as the game went on," 
Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kariya: "It was a learning experience I have to learn what I can and 
can't do at this level. . . . Nothing comes just like that. It takes years, not 
just one game." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a physical one, and Dallas players took aim at the Ducks' hotshot 
rookie more than once. Craig Ludwig welcomed him to the NHL with a hit that 
knocked his helmet off -- one of a few runs that led Wilson to say he "made a 
mistake" by leaving tough guys Stu Grimson and Todd Ewen at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they had a chance to give me a shot, they gave me a shot. That's the 
game of hockey," Kariya said. "(But) I put myself in positions where they could 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He found fault with his play, regretting that he didn't establish his speed 
early to force the defense to back off, disappointed that he didn't see more 
quickly that Dallas was playing him to make his cutback moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his goal, at 15:20 of the third, came off what he called "a bad pass" 
after he set up behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Semenov) was wide open in the slot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson thinks the Kariya-Semenov -- Karpov line could mean to the Ducks what 
the Johan Garpenlov-Igor Larionov-Sergei Makarov line meant to San Jose last 
season. One of the few flaws he sees is occasional overpassing by Kariya and 
Semenov, two playmakers who would as soon have an assist as a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov, 23, who the Ducks drafted in the third round in 1993 but were unable 
to sign until this summer after he played in the Olympics, is in position to 
capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's very talented too," Semenov said. "Good speed, nice hands, smart 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov's goal came off a pretty pass across the slot from Semenov at 2:13 of 
the third, with Kariya picking up the second assist. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Ducks a 2-1 lead before goalie John Tanner took a penalty for 
delay of game after shooting the puck out of the rink. Dallas's Mike McPhee 
quickly scored on the power play, and Mike Modano and Richard Matvichuk added 
goals to give Dallas a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's OK, first game," Semenov said. "I can't say, 'I'm happy we 
played great.' No, is not true. Only when the season is over. Tonight is one 
game, it's nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The game at Reunion Arena also marked the Duck debut of veteran defenseman Tom 
Kurvers, a power-play specialist the Ducks traded for during the off-season in 
hopes he will help turn around a power play that was the worst in the NHL last 
season. Kurvers scored the Ducks' first goal -- on a power play -- at 12:46 of 
the second. . . . Rookies Paul Kariya, Valeri Karpov and Nikolai Tsulygin are 
scheduled to play again against San Jose at 6:35 p.m. tonight in Denver. 
Forwards Bob Corkum, Terry Yake, Todd Ewen and Stu Grimson are among the 
players meeting the team in Denver for the game, while a number of those who 
played in Dallas will return home. . . . Dallas' Jarkko Varvio suffered a 
sprained neck and mild concussion after a hit by David Williams and was 
spending the night at a hospital for observation. . . . Dallas' Alan May is out 
at least two weeks after surgery to repair a lacerated tendon in his left 
knuckle after a fight with Myles O'Connor.

WATER POLO '94; BENNETT PLAYS A BIG ROLE FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY, 12-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what if Joey Bennett is only 5-foot-9. Everyone's about the same height in 
water polo: just a head, shoulders and arms sticking out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, grappling with larger players as the hole-man, scored four goals to 
lead Crescenta Valley High to a 12-9 victory over Agoura in a nonleague game on 
Tuesday at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because I'm smaller and I can move around (taller opponents)," said 
Bennett, who scored six goals in the Falcons' season opener against La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett scored two goals 41 seconds apart late in the third quarter to give 
the Falcons (2-0) an 11-5 lead, their largest of the game. Agoura scored the 
next three goals to pull to within 11-8 with three minutes to play in the game, 
but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a pretty good team," Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal said. "They are 
well-balanced. We just played flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley Coach Pete Loporchio said the Falcons, ranked third in the 
Southern Section in Division III, could also have played better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to reduce the number of errors," he said. "We are turning the ball 
over too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett scored the first goal 90 seconds into the game. The Falcons dominated 
the first quarter and led, 6-2. Agoura (1-1) missed chances when David Arons' 
penalty shot hit the post in the second quarter, and when the Chargers failed 
to score on a 6-on-5 advantage early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura, favored by some coaches to end Royal's 13-year streak of Marmonte 
League championships, took advantage of the sun, which shines in opposing 
goalies' eyes during the fourth quarter at Agoura's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura goalie Chris Miko scored for the second consecutive day, on a 40-foot 
shot. Ninety seconds later, another Miko shot sailed over goalie Andy Cushman's 
head, but hit the crossbar before Joey Vona flipped it into the net, pulling 
Agoura to within 11-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's Chris Driscoll, who led the Marmonte League with 62 goals last 
season, scored four times.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; WIDE RECEIVER ANDERSON GETS OFF TO A FAST 
START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all but vanishing from the Ram offense last year, wide receiver Flipper 
Anderson has more receiving yards through two games this season than Green 
Bay's Sterling Sharpe, New Orleans' Michael Haynes and Dallas' Michael Irvin 
and Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's 154 yards (in five catches) Sunday against Atlanta gives him 198 
yards for the season, third in the NFC behind Atlanta's Andre Rison (316) and 
San Francisco's Jerry Rice (247). Irvin has 174 yards, Haynes 158, Harper 146 
and Sharpe 101. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flipper is running really well right now," receivers coach Steve Moore said. 
"I remember working him out at the Senior Bowl, when he was coming out of UCLA, 
and he is quicker, faster and certainly more skilled than he ever was then." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson caught only one touchdown pass in his final 10 games last season, his 
lack of productivity coincided with quarterback Jim Everett's decline. But when 
the Rams signed quarterback Chris Miller, one of the best deep throwers in the 
game, they hoped that Anderson would return to his form in 1989, when he caught 
44 passes for 1,146 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He's averaging 33 yards a catch this season, including a 54-yarder from Miller 
and a 41-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "They connected well deep," Moore said of Miller and Anderson, "and he 
(Anderson) ran a couple of out routes that I would like to put in a can and 
pull out during training camp to teach how it's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's 154 yards ranked second only to his 336 yards against New Orleans 
in 1989, when he set the NFL single-game reception record with 15 catches. He 
had not had more than 100 yards receiving in a game since Dec. 15, 1991, when 
he had 103 yards against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With San Francisco defensive end Richard Dent out with a torn knee ligament, 
the Rams might be lining up across from Charles Mann on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, a former All-Pro with Washington, met with 49er coaches and officials 
Tuesday. The Rams worked out Mann during training camp, but didn't offer him a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, who has had knee surgery twice in the past year, also worked out for the 
49ers during training camp, but turned down a minimum $162,000 contract, 
calling it "an insult." MIKE REILLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Lance Stewart (third year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 31-3 overall, 12-2 in the Sea View League. Won second consecutive 
Division I State and Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Kelly Campbell, 6-1, setter, Jr.; Ali Havriluk, 5-9, outside 
hitter, Sr.; Wrenna Johnson, 5-10, middle blocker, Sr.; Kathryn Rice, 5-10, 
outside hitter, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Julie Coombe, 5-10, outside hitter, Jr.; Melissa Ford, 5-10, 
setter, Jr.; Doris Hawley, 6-1, middle blocker, Jr.; Jenny Hover, 5-8, outside 
hitter, Sr.; Tia Lambert, 5-10, setter, Sr.; Melissa Street, 6-0, middle 
blocker, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Sea Kings lost four of the top players in the county -- Kristen 
Campbell, Kim Coleman, Caitlin Pickart, Jennifer Stroffe -- to graduation, but 
Stewart isn't overly concerned. "We're not as set at the beginning as in the 
last two years, but those were special seasons," he said. "We're not real good 
right now, but we can become a really good team at the end of the season." 
Kelly Campbell will take over at setter and Hawley, a transfer from San Diego, 
should make an impact.

 Coach: Pete West (first year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 10-4 overall, 7-3 in the South Coast League. Lost to Corona del Mar in 
the first round of the Division I section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Abigail Daniels, 5-11, middle blocker, Sr.; Anna Geber, 5-8, 
outside hitter, Jr.; Roberta Gehlke, 5-10, outside hitter, Jr.; Laurie Layton, 
5-7, setter, Jr.; Nicole Noya, 6-2, middle blocker, Jr.; Heather Wride, 5-9, 
outside hitter, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Amy Orr, 5-8, outside hitter, Jr.; Keri Porter, 5-11, outside 
hitter, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: West was the former men's volleyball coach at Concordia and has a 
one-year contract. He takes over for Laura Kennedy, who is on maternity leave. 
West inherits a team that is "evenly balanced," he said. "But we still have to 
mature. We start only two seniors, so we're probably a year away from the best 
we can be." Still, the Monarchs should battle with Capistrano Valley and Dana 
Hills for league supremacy. Daniels and Wride are the lone seniors who will 
play key roles. Gehlke is the team's most dynamic player and Noya, at 6 feet 2, 
teams with Daniels for a solid middle.

</P>
<P>
 1993: 19-2 overall, 12-0 in the Olympic League. Won Southern Section Division 
IV championship, lost to San Jose Archbishop Mitty in the State Division IV 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Lynn Lovingier, 5-10, outside hitter, Sr.; Courtney Owens, 5-9, 
outside hitters, Sr.; Beth Prigmore, 5-10, middle blocker, Jr.; Jenny Roberts,

</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Maryjane Dinnie, 5-7, outside hitter, Sr.; Whitney Hoover, 5-6, 
setter, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Expectations are high at Calvary Chapel. Owens, the Division V player 
of the year last season, is being recruited by Colorado and UC Santa Barbara 
among others, and Lovingier is also receiving attention from Division I 
universities. They would be the first Calvary Chapel girls to receive Division 
I athletic scholarships. Downey will give the Eagles stern tests by playing a 
tough nonleague schedule, including Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar. The 
Eagles also will play in Division I of the Orange County Championships.

 Key newcomer: Laura Wilson, 5-10, middle blocker, Jr.

 Outlook: The Sailors are the overwhelming favorite to win the section and

win league, then hopefully we can do well in the Southern Section playoffs," he 
said. "This is one of the most talented teams we've had." May, the county 
player of the year last season who has committed to Long Beach State, returns 
along with Schutz, who is being recruited by UCLA and Duke among others. 
Fairborn, Bowman and Osborne are also Division I recruits.

 1993: 16-6 overall, 12-2 in the Sunset League. Lost to Los Alamitos in the 
Southern Section Division II semifinals and lost to Torrance in the State 
quarterfinals.

 Key newcomers: Allison Ciarelli, 5-6, setter, So.; Nicole Gale, 5-5, back row,

<P>
 Outlook: The Sunset League will be stronger with the addition of Division II 
powers Esperanza and Los Alamitos. "It's going to be tough," Ciarelli said. 
"This season, the Oilers won't have to depend solely on Wendt, a first-team 
All-Division II selection. Teams won't be able to key on just Melissa, so when 
we get to fourth and fifth games, she won't be as tired. We have good overall 
balance and our blocking could be good." Two of Ciarelli's nieces, Allison 
Ciarelli and Ziegler, could also contribute.

GIRLS' TENNIS ROUNDUP; ACCUSATIONS OF CHEATING MAR MATER DEI VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preseason is supposed to be a time for athletes to prepare for league play and 
for coaches to adjust their rosters. But in Tuesday's girls' tennis match 
between Edison and Mater Dei at Costa Mesa Racquet Club, things got nasty in 
the Monarchs' 13-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension began with accusations of cheating by Edison players and Coach Amy 
Beard. In No. 2 singles, the Chargers' Brooke Lacey accused Sarah Jarrett of 
making bad calls during Jarrett's 6-4 victory. Things seemed to settle down 
after two linesmen from separate schools were called in to watch the lines and 
the first round ended with the teams tied, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Round 2, Mater Dei took control of the match, winning five of six sets to 
lead, 8-4. Jarrett again won her set, 6-3, against the Chargers' No. 1 player 
Kelly Foster. And again there were complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to call a close one, but not an obvious one," Beard said. "I'm 
really mad about those two sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei Coach Sue Harrison didn't want to get into the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is preseason. We don't need this going on," Harrison said. "This is 
supposed to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final round, with the victory locked up for Mater Dei, Harrison went on 
the court during a tie-break situation to encourage her No. 3 doubles team of 
Lisa Panique and Melissa Walker. Beard than warned Harrison that it was a 
violation to coach players during a tie-break situation. Harrison said she was 
just getting them up, not coaching. Panique and Walker won the set, 7-6 (6-1).

 Although the Newport Harbor Sailors started slowly, their balanced attack 
eventually pounded out a 15-11, 15-4, 15-13 victory over Huntington Beach in a 
nonleague girls' volleyball match Tuesday at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Fairborn had 14 kills, Misty May had 13 and Melissa Schutz had 11 for the 
Sailors (1-0), ranked No. 1 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a great opening match for us," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. 
"We were able to spread it around and that's what we want to do more of this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-1), ranked seventh in the county, took a 6-0 lead in Game 1 
before Newport Harbor got untracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down early, but we didn't panic so that was good," Glenn said. "We 
weren't playing poorly, but Huntington was playing well. They are just going to 
get better and better and I'm sure we'll play them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach also led in Game 3, 10-5, before the Sailors tied it, 12-12 
and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have won one game," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. "I 
could have done without Game 2. That's a good, senior dominated team we played 
and we're young. We did some good things tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Melissa Wendt had 13 kills for Huntington Beach, and sophomore setter 
Allison Ciarelli, who had 17 assists, came off the bench to spark the Oilers in 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Jenny Hecker had 44 assists for Newport Harbor. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PREP WATER POLO ROUNDUP; SAN CLEMENTE WINS IN OVERTIME DESPITE PRE-GAME BUS 
ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Clemente water polo team got off to a bumpy start even before its 7-5 
overtime victory over Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 En route to the game, a backhoe fell from a tractor-trailer and into the path 
of the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was injured in the accident, which involved five other vehicles and 
left the Tritons stranded on the freeway for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real worried about the bus accident when we got here, the guys were 
just kind of walking around like zombies," Coach Steve Yancey said after the 
match. "In 14 years (of coaching), I've never had that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Tritons (1-0) didn't show any frayed nerves early, jumping 
to a 2-0 lead in the first minute on two goals by junior Jim Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Foothill's Brian Brown skipped a shot under goalkeeper Gabe Gardner's 
arm and Jeff Pflueger scored on a pass from Scott Hay to even the match after 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Knights took their only lead in the second quarter when 
Plueger stole a ball in the San Clemente end that eventually turned into an 
Adam Metzger goal, giving Foothill a 3-2 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Tritons scored three consecutive goals in the third quarter, 
including the third and fourth for Farley, giving them a 5-3 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's goal pulled the Knights to within one to open the fourth and Hay sent 
the game into overtime when he beat Gardner up high with 2:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The overtime belonged to San Clemente as Andy Bailey scored in the opening 
minute on a lob from deep and freshman Jordan Hewko added his second goal with 
1:11 remaining. DAN ARRITT

 BJ Services Reveals Bid: The Houston oil services company offered $450 Million 
in cash and stock for Western Co. of North America, but Western's board 
rebuffed the offer. BJ Services Co. said it decided to disclose its attempt to 
buy Western, an oil field service company also based in Houston, a month after 
it was spurned because it believes Western's shareholders will support the bid 
once they are aware of it.On July 29, BJ Services proposed a price of $18.50 a 
share -- 50% cash and 50% BJ Services common stock -- for each of Western's 
18.2 million outstanding shares. The offer was rejected Aug. 15. Western, which 
offers pressure pumping services, production chemicals and offshore drilling 
services, could not immediately be reached for comment. BJ Services provides 
pressure pumping and related services.

 Ford to Recall Models: The auto maker said it is recalling 220,000 1994 
Lincoln Town Cars, Mercury Grand Marquises and Ford Crown Victorias to fix a 
problem with the brakes. Ford Motor Co. said certain nuts and bolts that attach 
the brake backing plates to the rear axle housings may loosen and separate, 
damaging the parking brake assembly or the anti-lock braking systems on some 
vehicles. Should all the nuts on one of the backing plates separate from the 
bolts, the parking brake cable or one of the brake hydraulic lines could be 
damaged, resulting in a partial loss of braking capability.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; SWIMMING IN THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF THE KILLER WHALE; 
GONE WHALING: A SEARCH FOR ORCAS IN NORTHWEST WATERS BY DOUGLAS HAND ; SIMON & 
SCHUSTER$20, 256 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 Back in the early '60s, when the so-called killer whale was still regarded as 
a bloodthirsty creature of near-mythic power and mystery, the director of the 
Vancouver Aquarium decided not to try to capture one for display. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as we learn in Douglas Hand's "Gone Whaling," he contented himself 
with commissioning an artist to sculpt a life-sized statue for the edification 
and amazement of visitors to the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptor, however, was a bold and enterprising fellow who promptly 
harpooned a killer whale to use as a model. Ironically enough, the whale 
survived the attack and it ended up on display at the aquarium as the very 
first of its species in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Moby Doll, as the killer whale was dubbed, lasted only 90 days -- but the 
docile nature of the unfortunate whale changed the fate of its species. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Moby Doll had behaved so gently, resigned or perhaps just in shock, 
his capture touched off a thirst for more," Hand explains. "Between 1965 and 
1973, 48 killer whales were captured in British Columbia and sold to aquariums 
and oceanaria." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone Whaling" is something of a mystery quest, a highly intimate narrative of 
how the author "went looking for whales" in the Pacific Northwest. At the same 
time, it's an account of how the killer whale itself -- also known as an orca, 
the shortened version of its scientific name Orcinus orca -- moved from Native 
American folk tradition to amusement park superstardom and then into the 
ambiguous realm of scientific inquiry and heightened environmental 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most interesting stuff in "Gone Whaling" is what Hand tells us 
about the nature and habits of killer whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcas, he explains, are classified as "the largest oceanic dolphins." They are 
"voluntary breathers," which means that an orca will drown if it falls asleep, 
and they have virtually no bladders, which means that they urinate almost 
constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 And they live in tightly knit, multi-generational family groups called "pods" 
in which the dominant role is played by the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcas are expert hunters, Hand concedes, and they will devour everything from 
salmon to blue whales, the largest mammals in the world. But they are not 
wanton "killers." 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been found true of the wolf is also true of the orca, which is that 
they eat because they are hungry and rarely eat more than they need to 
survive," Hand writes. "However, despite their skilled hunting, there are no 
accounts of an orca actually attacking and killing a human and never any reason 
to fear them as a man-eater." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather less appealing, however, are the humans whom we encounter as we follow 
Hand from museum to aquarium, from scientific laboratory to artist's studio, 
and from island to island around the Northwest. He introduces us to Native 
American artists, aquarium directors, museum curators, marine biologists, 
eco-activists and assorted other whale-watchers and whale-worshipers, none of 
whom is quite as endearing as the whales themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Douglas Hand himself. He strikes the familiar stance of the 
hard-bitten and hard-driving investigative reporter -- jaded, skeptical, always 
probing for unpleasant truths and bad motives, and yet suffused with a 
heart-of-gold sincerity that allows him to see beyond the crass and the corrupt 
and behold the inner beauty of whaledom. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hand muses aloud on why the orca engages in the characteristic 
leap that is so familiar to Sea World audiences. Biologists, he reports, have 
rejected the notion that the killer whales are merely jumping for joy out of 
sheer playfulness. But Hand insists that the scientists are wrongheaded and 
maybe just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I watched the orca, it was impossible to keep myself from imagining the 
pure pleasure of leaping into the air and soaring with them," he writes. "When 
they were free of the water and poised at the peak of their jump, I believed 
they felt as I did as a child when I threw myself off the high dive." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hand has a habit of injecting himself into his narrative in rather 
curious ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone Whaling" is one man's journey through history, art, science and 
politics, all in search of the secrets of what Hand persists in calling 
"mystery whales." At the end of his quest, Hand is back where he started -- he 
now knows a great deal more about the orca, but it is the sense of mystery 
rather than the scientific truth that Hand embraces and celebrates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran it over my tongue a few times and I said it aloud: Mystery whales," 
Hand concludes. "I liked the sound of it. I sniffed the air and stuck out my 
tongue. It tasted delicious."

DANA PARSONS: CALL TO MISSION WORK BROUGHT HER TO WOMEN'S PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people do good deeds hoping to get noticed. Others do good deeds in ways 
that almost guarantee that no one else will notice; their satisfaction comes 
from the act itself. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know which kind we like the most. And when the good deeds are of the 
spiritual kind, we really know which kind we like the most. 
</P>
<P>
 By any measure, you'd have to put Lee Krueger in the latter category, and God 
bless her for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever you stand on religion, you'd have to agree that going into a women's 
prison to talk to inmates is not a path to fame and fortune. There are no TV 
cameras, no rich collection plates to tap into, no influential constituency to 
impress. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a more forgotten or less powerful target group in America than 
women in prison, I'm not sure who it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the arena, however, that attracted Krueger, a 63-year-old 
great-grandmother who heads up the Women Aglow Prison Ministries from the Buena 
Park home she shares with her husband of 45 years and that often is the site of 
rollicking Monday night prayer meetings. Her chapter is an offshoot of the 
national organization. The statewide group has a handful of coordinators who go 
into the four women's prisons and try to answer what, Krueger says, imprisoned 
women ask most often: 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any life for me; is there any hope?" 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger decided as a teen-ager to be a missionary. Africa or China seemed like 
logical choices. She became a practicing Christian at 15, knowing only that she 
wanted to make some kind of difference in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't expect to do it behind prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the most unlikely prospect for this," she says, and she's right. She's 
prim in appearance, proper in speech and manner. "I've never really been drunk, 
I never used drugs, I quit smoking when I was 10 (after a summer's 
experimentation), and I've never been arrested. I'm squeaky clean, but my heart 
for hurting women seemed to enlarge because I was raised by a single mom and we 
were very poor." 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry is evangelical in nature, but Krueger insists that she and the 
other women who conduct the meetings are "not a bunch of Sunday school 
teachers." If the prisoners want to walk out of the weekly Sunday meetings, 
they are free to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelical Christians are not the group that comes to mind when I think of 
prison reform, much less women's causes, but Krueger doesn't hide her contempt 
for some aspects of the penal system that affect women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of women who shouldn't be in prison," she says. "They have not 
committed violent crimes, and they've been removed from their families for a 
very long time for crimes that have been in defense of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The female population in California prisons stands at 6,745, according to the 
state Department of Corrections. Of that number, spokeswoman Gloria Isaac said, 
right around 5,000 are imprisoned for nonviolent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's had a lifelong empathy for the underdog, Krueger's feelings 
about inmates changed soon after her first prison visit 11 years ago. "I had 
the attitude that if a person was in prison, they were there because they 
deserved it and they should just serve their time and shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 But from the start, she felt humbled in the presence of these often-forlorn 
women, who, Krueger says, are often "hurt and trampled on by society and family 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 She says most of them turned to crime after being abused as children. The 
resultant damage to their outlook on life led them to drug use, prostitution or 
more serious crimes, Krueger believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dehumanized. Most of the time, they're disowned by their families 
(after imprisonment), their children are taken from them unless a family member 
takes them, most of their husbands divorce them and their boyfriends leave 
them. It's horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Women Aglow not only offers spiritual guidance for prisoners but follows it up 
with post-imprisonment contact, Krueger says. "We help them feel like a person. 
They begin to feel like they have some worth, because we go in time after 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Krueger didn't call me for a story. I just happened to notice 
the Women Aglow listing in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymous people doing anonymous work. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Krueger about the thankless nature of her work; about the anonymity of 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
 She begged to disagree. "The missionary call I felt when I was in my teens, 
this is my missionary work," she says. "It seems so natural. I feel like these 
are just girls who made wrong choices. From the first time I went, I felt like 
I belonged, like I had found my niche."

OXNARD APPROVES PROFIT-SHARING PLAN; FINANCES: BASED ON PERFORMANCE, THE NEW 
APPROACH IN CERTAIN CITY DEPARTMENTS IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE OPERATING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another move to mimic the private sector, the Oxnard City Council on 
Tuesday unanimously approved a performance-based profit-sharing plan for 
selected city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is intended to save cash-strapped Oxnard money by encouraging city 
workers to be innovative and reduce the operating costs of their departments 
while maintaining a high level of services, City Manager Tom Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every employee should be rewarded for his creativity and dedication," said 
Frutchey of the concept. "People get the mistaken impression that it's everyone 
looking out for themselves, but this is about people working together." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, set to begin next month, will be tried out on Oxnard's equipment 
maintenance, parks and facilities, engineering, and planning departments, and 
possibly one or two other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Each department will be given a list of goals to complete every three months, 
and a detailed budget. Employees can meet the prescribed objectives however 
they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 If at the end of a quarter a department has met its goals and come in under 
budget, half the surplus money will be distributed among its workers. The other 
half will go back into Oxnard's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a department exceeds its quarterly budget, the money will be taken out 
of its budget for the next quarter, putting more pressure on workers to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee theft, accidents, unmet goals and shoddy work would also result in 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are objective standards that are laid out," Frutchey said. "Any 
department that isn't doing its job right can be fined."  
</P>
<P>
 The program was developed by the city of Pittsburg, Calif., and has been 
working successfully there for eight years, Frutchey said. Pittsburg employees 
each have made up to $6,000 annually by cutting department budgets, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Henderson, Oxnard's parks and facilities superintendent, said he looks 
forward to beginning the program in his 61-person department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it gives our full-time employees the opportunity to put their 
ingenuity to work," he said. "If they take this idea and put it to use, they 
won't have to worry about the city contracting out for services they provide, 
and laying people off. They will be as competitive as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has to be approved by the two unions that represent Oxnard city 
workers, the Service Employees International Union, and the International Union 
of Operating Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Service Employees International Union, which represents white-collar 
workers, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Archie Soliz, chief steward for the International Union of Operating 
Engineers, said the 280 blue-collar workers he represents support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the (Service Employees Union) is concerned, this isn't about saving 
money," said Soliz. "It's about saving jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Frutchey also said the program would help prevent layoffs and the erosion of 
public services. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council privatized Oxnard's Economic Development Department in 
November in an effort to cut costs. The city is undergoing a sweeping 
reorganization to downsize city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Andres Herrera said the plan approved Tuesday empowers employees by 
giving them more control over their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the issue is that they have ownership of their own services," Herrera 
said. "They are the masters of the environment in which they work, and they can 
do their work however they want." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Michael Plisky said that although he supported the plan on a 
trial basis, he believes it is unnecessary for those who believe in basic work 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm skeptical of the approach," Plisky said. "If these people can't do the 
job right without incentives, I'm sure we can find someone who will do it well. 
There are a lot of unemployed people in this state."

BOARD OKS MONEY FOR CAMARILLO FIRE STATION; EXPANSION: SUPERVISORS RELEASE 
FUNDING, BUT CRITICIZE THE DEPARTMENT'S FAILURE TO COMPLETE A STRATEGIC PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite concerns about the county Fire Department's lax spending practices, 
Ventura County supervisors on Tuesday agreed to release $1.5 million to replace 
an aging fire station in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 to approve the construction money after 
board members emphasized their growing impatience for completion of a new 
management plan to reduce department overtime and sick pay and to remedy other 
problems criticized by a citizens task force earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn made the point most strongly, casting a "protest 
vote" against the new fire station in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire district is out of control," Flynn said in an interview after the 
vote. "It's got to be brought back into control. Hopefully, the strategic plan 
will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fire officials said they were delighted to get the money to replace 
the cramped, aging Station No. 54 south of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that we'll be able to build this needed station," said Ventura 
County Fire Chief James E. Sewell. "This has been our No. 1 priority for 
capital improvements. It's something we've been planning for for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials want to relocate the station to the north side of the freeway 
so firefighters would not be trapped south of it if overpasses collapsed during 
a catastrophic earthquake. Most of Camarillo's 56,000 residents live north of 
the freeway in developments that went up long after the concrete firehouse was 
built in the early 1940s by the federal Works Progress Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Fire Department has grown weary of the electrical and plumbing 
problems that have bedeviled the station's crew. And the small station does not 
have room to store both its large fire engines inside. One rig is parked next 
to the old station on Ventura Boulevard, subjecting the equipment to the 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new station will provide us the room to put all of our equipment inside," 
said Capt. John Moland, head of the station's six-member crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the crew has mixed emotions about leaving the historic 
building and its open-beamed ceilings. "It doesn't feel like a business place 
when you come to work. It feels more like home." 
</P>
<P>
 The new station planned for Pickwick Drive in central Camarillo will have 
ample room for the two fire engines. At 8,000-square-feet, the planned station 
will also provide sleeping quarters and administrative offices for fire crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The new station will be financed with interest from delinquent property taxes 
that were earmarked for Fire Department construction projects. The department 
bought the land for the fire station in 1992 and has listed a new Camarillo 
station as a construction priority since 1989, Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the supervisors asked Fire Department leaders to develop A long-range 
management plan after an audit criticized the department's fiscal policies and 
a citizens committee recommended a number of cost-saving steps. Among the 
suggestions were to reduce sick pay for firefighters, cut their overtime pay, 
use civilians for some non-emergency work and reinstitute a volunteer force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell, who recently joined the department, said he is reviewing a draft of 
the plan prepared by his predecessor and expects to deliver final draft to the 
board soon.

CONTRACT TALKS WITH FIREFIGHTERS STALL ON 2 ISSUES; LABOR: UNION OFFICIAL CITES 
MERIT PAY AND PROMOTIONS AS TROUBLE SPOTS. COUNTY SAYS ONLY THAT NEGOTIATIONS 
ARE CONTINUING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Contract negotiations between Ventura County firefighters and county personnel 
officials have bogged down over issues of merit pay and promotions, a 
firefighters' union official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 378-member Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn. has been working 
without a contract since July 2, but it is nowhere near reaching an agreement 
with the county, said union President Kenneth Maffei. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county doesn't seem to be willing to make any type of concessions on 
their original proposal," Maffei said. "We've offered to structure some type of 
a compromise on many of the issues, and they don't seem to want to compromise 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward L. McLean, the county's assistant personnel director, said negotiations 
are continuing. But he declined to discuss details of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our policy as long as bargaining's going on not to comment on what's 
going on in it," McLean said. "We are in negotiations with Fire. There have 
been meetings, and there is at least another meeting scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said the union will not budge on the county's demand that firefighters 
give up periodic 5% merit raises -- even though the raises were deferred last 
year for more than half of all county employees in a budget-trimming move by 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters were the only county employees who refused to accept the 
raise deferment at that time, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises are usually given to new employees who successfully complete their 
first six months on the job, and every year to certain newer employees until 
they reach the top of their salary range, McLean explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them we'll take a 5% cut if all the county managers take a 5% cut," 
Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two parties also disagree on a grievance policy: The union is clinging to 
a procedure the county wants to abolish, whereby the union can file a grievance 
on behalf of a group of employees, Maffei said. The firefighters' union and the 
county also disagree about policies governing promotions and transfers of 
firefighters within the department, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transfers and promotions now are carried out based on proficiency exams, but 
the county wants the ability to transfer and promote firefighters at will, 
Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the union has offered to give the county the freedom to make such 
transfers, the firefighters also want the county to drop its demand that 
candidates for such moves continue to take the exams, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the ability to promote who they want to promote regardless of test 
scores," Maffei said. "We made them the offer to promote whoever they want to, 
and said, 'Let's not go through the charade of giving an exam.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The union and the county are "at loggerheads" on this issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've presented us with a proposal that is just totally out of the question 
. . . the unfettered right to transfer personnel station to station," Maffei 
said. "We call it 'freeway therapy' -- you anger the chief and they'll transfer 
you to the farthest station from your home." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei conceded that the county wants the freedom to make such transfers so it 
can put more skilled firefighters where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We don't have a problem if one person's better than another. But 
let's establish a criteria to determine who's better." 
</P>
<P>
 The county also wants the ability to temporarily replace sick or vacationing 
captains with less experienced firefighters, and to let some stations operate 
with crews of only three people per fire engine instead of two if someone calls 
in sick, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say we weren't willing to compromise on that issue," he said. 
"We've asked them to explain why." 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, negotiations have not touched on that issue, nor on the 
potentially thorny question of overtime, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A county audit last year and a citizens review panel this year harshly 
criticized the department for letting firefighters collect overtime and sick 
pay in the same pay period. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief James E. Sewell said he and other department managers are 
working on a strategic plan to steer the department's personnel, equipment and 
facilities issues for the next 10 to 20 years. He expects to hand the completed 
plan to the Board of Supervisors by Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sewell declined to comment on the contract talks, saying only, "I don't 
want to talk about specific issues, because I don't want that to interfere with 
negotiations. I want to get the contract settled."  
</P>
<P>
 County and union negotiators are to meet again Sept. 21, Maffei said.

DISTRICT TO CONSIDER INTERPRETERS AT EVENTS; OXNARD: SCHOOL BOARD WILL DECIDE 
TONIGHT ON FORMALIZING A POLICY TO PROVIDE TRANSLATIONS FOR SPANISH-SPEAKING 
PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After years of debate, the Oxnard School District will decide tonight whether 
to have a Spanish-language interpreter present at all of the district's major 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of trustees also will consider buying as many as 50 
electronic headsets that would allow audience members to listen to simultaneous 
translations at graduations, large social events and other special ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major step for the district," said Supt. Bernard Korenstein. "We 
will formalize what we have practiced for years." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said simultaneous translations would prevent events from 
lasting too long -- a complaint from some parents who attended the recent 
opening ceremony at Frank Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that was said in English was repeated in Spanish," said Trustee 
Jack T. Fowler, who said he favors the proposal. "That was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 As in some other Ventura County school districts with predominantly Latino 
populations, Oxnard already has a Spanish-speaking interpreter available for 
board meetings if the district is notified of the need. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the elementary and intermediate school district's 13,000 students 
are Latino, and 47% of those students speak English as their second language, 
district figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein said a formal policy would allow the district to set more specific 
guidelines on how and when the district would provide translators. 
</P>
<P>
 The translation equipment and headsets would cost about $5,000, officials 
said. In addition, the district pays translators about $13 an hour for their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board votes to purchase the equipment, it would be made available to 
all of the district's schools and parent-teacher associations. Those groups, 
however, must find their own translators. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Mary Barreto and bilingual teachers have argued for years that the 
district is limiting parents' participation in their children's education by 
not providing translators at meetings and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto said she would like the district to broaden the proposed policy so 
that a translator's presence would be required at all district board meetings 
and at expulsion hearings where the parents are Spanish-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only when they are at the hearing (do) parents realize the seriousness of the 
event," Barreto said. "They get very confused because they are unable to 
express themselves. It's heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
 But Korenstein said it would be too costly to have a translator at each of the 
district's twice-monthly school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of people who attend board meetings and who need translation has 
historically been few," Korenstein said. "Also, we always have district staff 
in our meetings who can translate." 
</P>
<P>
 If the board adopts a policy, non-English-speaking parents would still be 
required to give the district advance notice that they plan to attend a board 
meeting so officials can arrange for a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 That requirement is difficult for some parents to meet, said Ray Alvarez, a 
bilingual fourth-grade teacher at Emilie Ritchen School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much of a hassle for parents to try to arrange for a translator when 
they don't know enough English to make the request," Alvarez said. "I know many 
parents who would attend meetings if they knew someone there spoke Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto, one of two Spanish-speakers on the five-member board, said she has 
often been called on to translate for parents and for board members. She said 
performing that task has caused some non-Spanish-speaking trustees to question 
her objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't work. They felt uncomfortable, I felt uncomfortable," Barreto 
said. "A professional should translate."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY OFFERS TO BUY LAND TO END LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to end a lawsuit over underground fuel contamination, Ventura County 
supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed to spend $2.15 million to purchase 
five acres of land at Oxnard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the lawsuit, agreed to 
buy the property from Oxnard Aero Center as part of a settlement agreement 
worked out after a year of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Aero Center contended that fuel tanks at a nearby county-owned parcel 
leaked pollutants onto their land. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials were interested in buying the land before the settlement and 
expect a grant from the Federal Aviation Administration to cover 90% of the 
cost of the purchase. The remaining portion should be picked up by the firms 
allegedly responsible for the leaking fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard Airport, said the 
land purchase should resolve the long controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got property," Flynn said. "That's the end of it, period." KENNETH R.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HOUSING PROJECT CLEARS 1ST HURDLE 
</P>

 The Oxnard City Council allowed a developer Tuesday to move forward with a 
controversial plan to build 716 homes -- 159 of which would be designated for 
low-income families -- in an agricultural area designated to be exempt from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the proposed 132-acre Channel Islands Estates development is 
currently outside the city's boundaries and in an area that Oxnard, Camarillo 
and Ventura County set aside as a greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 For the project to take place, the land would have to be placed in Oxnard's 
sphere of influence by the Local AgencyFormation Commission, a state agency 
that deals in jurisdictional matters. Camarillo and the county would also have 
to approve the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 An environmental report must be completed before the council gives the 
proposal final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is redeeming about this project that would propel this current council 
to go through all these machinations?" Councilman Andres Herrera asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Affordable Homebuilders Inc., has pushed for the project by 
arguing that it is providing what Oxnard needs most: low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to allow the plan to move forward. Councilman Michael 
Plisky cast the dissenting vote, arguing that Oxnard should not promote 
affordable housing at the sake of a greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm very pleased that the council decided to support affordable housing for 
the people of Oxnard," said Lynn Jacobs, president of Affordable Homebuilders. 
"We feel that all the necessary steps can be completed." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HUGE POT SHIPMENT SEIZED; 7 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and local authorities have seized more than $51 million worth of 
Colombian marijuana and arrested seven suspects, including two Ventura County 
men, after they transferred 3 1/2 tons of the drug from a sailboat to a Santa 
Barbara County beach, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the largest amount of marijuana seized from a ship in Southern 
California in more than a decade, said Special Agent Ralph Lochridge of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce H. Throckmorton, 41, whom federal agents believe to be the ringleader, 
was arrested after he used a short-wave radio early Sunday morning to direct 
the unloading from a hill overlooking the 52-foot sailboat north of Refugio 
State Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The marijuana seizure, at 7,242 pounds the largest in Santa Barbara County 
history, came after the smugglers had loaded 129 bales into inflatable boats 
and hauled them ashore with a rope to be transferred to rented trucks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after launching flares to light the beach, about 50 officers emerged and 
took the men into custody, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects included Throckmorton, a Ventura-area resident, and Ronald V. 
Solakian, 46, of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick McLaughlin said both were being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the DEA and the Coast Guard, the operation involved Santa 
Barbara sheriff's deputies and U.S. Customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said the seven were charged with possession with intent to 
distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. He said this carries a 
minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged, McLaughlin said, were Michael W. Budma, 48, of Leucadia; Javier 
R. Ortiz-Casierra, 26, of Colombia; Kirt D. Lucio, 32, of Santa Barbara; Mark 
A. Calicchio, 37, of Costa Mesa, and Adam J. Winchester, 28, of Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 All were arraigned Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Lucio was 
being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, McLaughlin said. The others were being 
held without bail. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY HELPS FUND TASK FORCE TO SAVE BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council agreed to contribute $32,450 to a group that hopes to 
persuade the Pentagon not to close the Point Mugu and Port Hueneme naval bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The money goes to the Base Realignment and Closure 1995 Task Force, which 
hopes to raise $350,000 to hire Washington lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Group leaders say that the county would lose up to 60,000 jobs and $1.5 
billion a year if the bases are shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closure of those bases would be the most severe economic impact this 
county has ever seen," said Bob Conroy, co-chairman of the task force.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine Port Hueneme without that base? They would be decimated."  
</P>
<P>
 The task force is hoping to get $150,000 from county and city governments, 
$50,000 from companies with government contracts, $50,000 from federal 
employees and $100,000 from county businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is giving the task force $10,000 and 
free office space. The Port Hueneme City Council postponed a decision last week 
on a task force request for $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But task force members persuaded the Ventura City Council to pledge $19,930 
Monday night. And they will ask the Camarillo City Council for $19,530 today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard council also agreed to contribute $2,500 to a $15,000 county study 
of a Channel Islands Harbor aquarium. The study, by aquarium expert Richard 
Lyon, has already been paid for by the county and is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez urged council members to pitch in for the study to 
show their enthusiasm for the project. But Councilman Michael Plisky complained 
that he was not invited to the news conference where county officials announced 
the project and that the county "only involves Oxnard when it wants money."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BOARD OKS PLAN FOR NEW PLAYGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura school board Tuesday approved a plan that will provide Blanche 
Reynolds School with an elaborate new playground that the community will build 
by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Ventura Unified School District's support, organizers for the 
playground said all they have to do is raise $60,000 before the scheduled start 
of construction Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by the same architects who planned the playground at Alameda Park in 
Santa Barbara, the play-lot project at Blanche Reynolds is being financed 
entirely by the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and parents at the elementary school on Valmore Avenue launched a 
fund-raising drive in the spring after realizing that the financially strapped 
school district would be unable to help replace their school's rusty metal 
slides and jungle gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the group has raised about $20,000 in cash and $20,000 in construction 
materials, Blanche Reynolds teacher Lisa Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an additional $60,000 in cash is needed to be able to build the 
10,000-square-foot play lot on the targeted construction dates of Nov. 2 to 6, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, teachers and other community residents have all committed to help 
build the project. They will use plans drawn up by the Ithaca, N.Y.-based 
architectural firm of Robert S. Leathers and Associates, which has designed 
hundreds of community-built play areas around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as a barn-raising, as a community-building effort," teacher Roni 
Adams told the school board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Rainbow Bridge project, the playground will have as its theme a 
Chumash legend that says the Chumash used a rainbow as a bridge when they 
crossed from the Channel Islands to settle in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of wood and a wood-like recycled plastic material, the play lot will 
feature life-sized sculptured dolphins for children to play on, rubber bridges, 
a tire swing and seven slides. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 The Ventura County Grand Jury has indicted a 23-year-old gang member accused 
of fatally shooting another gang member over a romantic triangle, prosecutors 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Al Corral, 23, is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Superior 
Court today on a charge of murder.He also faces a kidnaping charge from an 
unrelated 1991 case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Corral burst through the door of his ex-girlfriend's Ventura 
home July 21 and shot Roger Rowland, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 By obtaining the indictment through the grand jury, prosecutors avoid having 
to prove that there is sufficient evidence to hold Corral on the charges at a 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral and a co-defendant, Ruben Viveros, were arrested in Las Vegas a week 
after Rowland's death.  
</P>
<P>
 Viveros, who is charged with accessory to murder, is being held at the Ventura 
County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an outstanding arrest warrant from a 1991 case, Corral is being 
held without bail, authorities said. DWAYNE BRAY

PORT HUENEME CITIZENS GROUP BACKS 5 COUNCIL CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Port Hueneme community group that campaigned to save the local Police 
Department has re-formed as a political action committee and endorsed five of 
14 candidates running for three open seats on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Save Our Port Hueneme Police Department Committee, renamed Friends of Our 
Port Hueneme Police Department, pledged last week to provide financial and 
staff support for the campaigns of Valorie Morrison, Frank A. McElfish Jr., 
Tony Volante, David W. Goodman and Robert Turner."We want to elect a City 
Council that will wholeheartedly support and maintain our Police Department," 
said Penny Bohannon, the committee's co-chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has pledged $10,000 -- money leftover from the campaign to save 
the Police Department -- to help finance the candidates' campaigns. The 
committee has also offered the help of 50 volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea to form a political action committee emerged after members of the 
community group consulted the Fair Political Practices Commission in Sacramento 
and learned that among their options, they could finance political campaigns 
for candidates who support their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forming a PAC and supporting candidates who are advocators of our local 
Police Department is the best thing we could do," Bohannon said.  
</P>
<P>
 About a month ago, the committee sent applications to all 14 candidates asking 
them about their views on the local Police Department, Bohannon said. Only the 
five candidates who were eventually endorsed answered the application, and each 
of them "showed strong support for our local Police Department," Bohannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the citizens committee campaigned last spring to support a parcel 
tax to raise $500,000 needed to maintain the Police Department. But the 
proposed tax measure was defeated in the June election, and the City Council 
eventually approved a utility tax to raise the additional money. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Schultze is moving to Paso Robles with her husband, who has taken a job 
there.Her resignation will take effect Oct. 2, said park spokesman Rick 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Schultze has been instrumental in promoting new activities for 
teen-agers and physically and mentally challenged residents of the park 
district, which includes Simi Valley and Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Park board member Bonnie Carpenter said Schultze will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really has added a sparkle to our meetings," Carpenter said. "She has a 
wonderful sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said Schultze was expert at reviewing budgets and figuring out 
financial solutions as the parks' resources dwindled in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze's term expires in 1996, and Carpenter said the board will probably 
appoint a successor from the community to fill her seat until the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a great deal of interest in serving on the park board," 
Carpenter said. "But Debi is going to be hard to replace." MARY F. POLS

LOW RIDERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to respond to the article ("Low Ridership Plagues New Transit Service," 
Sept. 7). When I first heard about VISTA, I was excited because I thought that 
I could finally do my part by using alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at the schedule in the newspaper and began to chart the route I would 
take to get to work. My current commute is 34 miles round-trip and takes a 
total of 45 minutes per day. Under the VISTA system, my total commute time 
would be more than four hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming home is worse: It would be 7 p.m. by the time I would get home, and the 
commute would take 2 1/2 hours. Why would I want to do this? 
</P>
<P>
 This is one example of why the ridership may be low. I support public 
transportation, and I car pool as much as possible. But it is unreasonable to 
give up that many hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 JAN R. GILMORE 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 It should be pretty obvious why VISTA ridership is so low: It takes far longer 
to get from point A to point B than it would in a car.  
</P>
<P>
 After I studied the routes and the time to get me from my home in Moorpark to 
my office in Ventura, I determined that it would take -- one way -- 1 hour and 
45 minutes. I could spend three to four hours a day commuting, and bureaucrats 
wonder why ridership is low? It's not fast, stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 If VISTA's purpose is to get people somewhere quickly, why not treat it truly 
as an express service? Get the people from major point A to B in the same time 
it would take if they were driving their own cars. For example, one could board 
the bus at the Moorpark train station and go directly to the Buenaventura Mall 
in Ventura for connecting intercity service to one's work. If VISTA delivered 
you to work in an hour or less, ridership may improve. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestions are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of spending lots of money on a media blitz, find out who your 
potential customers could be. Do some marketing, poll the community and find 
out what the community needs and if a ridership really exists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct service between major cities at peak hours. Why not have a truly 
direct express service between cities at 6, 7, 8 and 9 a.m. and 3, 4, 5, 6 
p.m.? It has to be convenient and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 * How about smaller buses like the airport shuttles that run on propane? Maybe 
if the rider was to get between point A and B faster, one would not need a 
toilet on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improve on Metrolink. I discovered, to my disappointment, Metrolink is 
designed only to get riders to and from L.A. during peak hours. Try to 
incorporate an intra-county rail system within the Metrolink system to serve 
intra-county commuters needing to go the other way (i.e. Moorpark, Camarillo, 
Oxnard, Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA's fare of $1 is a lot of bang for the buck. Make it faster and the 
riders will come.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: DOCENTS SOUGHT FOR HISTORICAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Historical Society is looking for residents with a strong 
interest in history, a healthy dose of patience and plenty of free time to 
volunteer as docents at the Strathearn Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, situated off Madera Road, is a popular city landmark that showcases 
the artifacts and old homes of the city's founding families and the Native 
Americans who lived here before them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are given year-round, but extra volunteer guides are needed during the 
school year when large groups of children visit the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents will undergo 12 hours of training over three days and will begin 
leading students on hourlong tours in early October, docent Seree Schnepf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 positions available, two have been filled. For more information, 
call Schnepf at 583-1956. MATTHEW MOSK

REWARDING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On behalf of the Environmental Coalition, and as the project manager for the 
Arroyo Simi Restoration Grant in Moorpark over the last 15 months or so, I want 
to thank the hundreds of people and organizations who gave unselfishly of 
themselves to make this unique combination of volunteer and paid community 
effort a success.  
</P>
<P>
 The total effort of all combined was more than 7,518 hours.Of that, about 65% 
was donated (4,845 hours) and about 35% will be paid (2,673). 
</P>
<P>
 As I prepare my final report to the state Department of Water Resources, the 
agency which funded this grant, I am proud to announce that in addition to the 
$64,000 that will be paid to people from the grant funds, there has been a 
combined in-kind donation (in labor and materials) from all those who worked on 
the project of at least $152,861. As manager of what has therefore turned out 
to be a $216,816 project, I think that is outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a difficult, time-consuming and rewarding project. We hope that 
everyone in the community is as proud as we are of the accomplishments.

TREATMENT NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Aug. 16 article on the arrest of a 29-year-old male from 
Fillmore: It took 50 law enforcement officers. Have we taxpayers no say in this 
craziness? 
</P>
<P>
 This young man has repeatedly gone to jail for alcohol-related crimes. Did it 
ever occur to the district attorney and judge that this man should be treated 
at a recovery center with follow up for at least one year? We must recognize 
alcoholism as an illness. It is serious and endangering to others. 
</P>
<P>
 By providing more treatment centers, focusing on employment after release and 
living conditions, maybe we could help. By jailing these individuals we do not 
improve them; we further provide no hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't we utilize our tax dollars to better advantage? Shame on our system. 
Our fellow human beings deserve better.

CAMPAIGN COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our Constitution confers the right to stand for public office basically to 
every citizen of legal age, never having been convicted of a felony. Yet there 
is a terrible inequity in the system by which a candidate for a local office 
who is short of funds is put at a great disadvantage against a candidate who is 
able to more freely spend his or her money. 
</P>
<P>
 The inequity centers around the candidate's statement, which appears in the 
official voters pamphlet, but only if paid for by the candidate. The Election 
Code gives the right to the local agency to charge for the candidate's 
statement to recoup for printing costs, handling, etc. Thousand Oaks charges 
$600, due on filing. The candidate may also be billed additionally should the 
$600 prove insufficient as a pro rata share of costs. The only exception to the 
charge is where a candidate may prove to be indigent. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that a change is in order that would be much more fair and equitable 
for all serious candidates. If the city was to consider a nominal fee for 
filing, that would eliminate some who do not intend to conduct a serious 
campaign. It would also partially reimburse the City Clerk's office for the 
time and paperwork involved in processing each candidate. At the same time, the 
very undemocratic charge for the candidate's statement should either be 
eliminated or made nominal enough -- with a maximum cap -- so that all 
candidates could take advantage of this important advertising medium.

RODEO CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thankfully, there was a drop in attendance for this year's Ventura County Fair 
Rodeo. Perhaps, after years of protest by animal activists, the fundamental 
ethical premise that animals are not on this planet for our entertainment is 
reaching mainstream awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the day is near when we will view rodeo in much the same way that we 
regard dogfighting or cockfighting. Perhaps repugnant photographs such as the 
one depicting a dog with a small monkey on its back will be deemed unacceptable 
for family viewing. (After all, how do you coerce a wild animal to ride atop 
the back of a domestic animal?) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the rodeo grandstand will soon be permanently empty.

ELECTION WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Bernardo Perez and Councilman John Wozniak have given two 
reasons for canceling the City Council election. I'd like to respond to both. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we were told that "no viable candidates" had come forward. The truth is 
that the council had already received a letter from Roy Talley informing them 
of his interest in running as a write-in candidate. If that doesn't constitute 
a "viable candidate," I don't know what does. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 23 letter urging his colleagues to cancel the election, Perez 
writes, "Could it be, just possibly, that the lack of candidates, the lack of 
any real controversy surrounding the option of no election, are statements of 
approval by the community for the three official candidates?" Such arrogance 
suggests that Perez confuses voter apathy and cynicism as being a voter 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really appropriate for incumbent councilmen to judge who is and who 
isn't a "viable candidate" to run against them? 
</P>
<P>
 The second reason we've heard for canceling the election is that it will save 
taxpayers money. By that logic, why not cancel all elections? Of course, that 
will mean having Bubba in the White House for all of eternity, but what the 
heck? At least we won't have to waste money on those pesky elections any more.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; DISABLED OFFERED VAN SERVICE ON 
SATURDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Transit has extended its curb-to-curb van service for disabled 
riders to include Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 As with weekday service, vans on Saturdays will be provided from 8 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. for trips within the city limits. Bus fares are $1 and transportation 
requests must be made at least one day in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday service is required under the federal Americans with Disabilities 
Act, and is provided in conjunction with Simi Valley Transit's Dial-A-Ride 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who cannot ride the regular buses are entitled to a more compatible 
service," management analyst Hibbie Hayslett explained. "It is to take the 
place of a fixed-route bus."  
</P>
<P>
 Transportation requests may be made by calling 583-6464. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: AIDS CARE RECEIVES $5,000 AMGEN GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nonprofit support group AIDS Care Inc. has received a $5,000 grant from 
the Amgen Foundation to help indigent Ventura County residents affected by HIV 
or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our clients are indigent, and they need help to buy medication, pay 
rent or keep their phones turned on," said Doug Green, executive director of 
AIDS Care."This grant will help us provide emergency financial assistance to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amgen Foundation donation will also boost AIDS Care's $200,000 annual 
budget, which suffered a blow earlier this year when the group failed to win a 
grant from the county's HIV consortium. "This will make up some of the 
difference, and we're really grateful," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Amgen Foundation also awarded AIDS Care $5,000, and stipulated 
that the grant be used to help clients buy prescription drugs. Amgen Inc., a 
global biotechnology company, markets Epogen, a drug used by some patients 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amgen Foundation, the biotechnology company's charitable arm, distributed 
about $615,000 in grants last year to support the arts, education, environment 
and social services. STEPHANIE SIMON

FUNDS APPROVED FOR CHUMASH MUSEUM ARTIFACT ACQUISITIONS; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
$100,000 ALLOCATED BY COUNTY SUPERVISORS WILL ALSO PAY FOR DISPLAY CASES AT THE 
NEW FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a Chumash museum set to open in Thousand Oaks in mid-December, Ventura 
County supervisors Tuesday approved $100,000 to acquire artifacts and build 
display cases inside the recently completed museum in Oakbrook Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited, the money will help us finish the project," said Paul 
Varela, executive director of the Oakbrook Park Chumash Interpretive Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.7-million center, which will include artifacts, a replica of a Chumash 
village and a pictorial history of local Native American culture, is in the 
438-acre county park along the eastern edge of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which has never been opened to the public without a special permit, 
has numerous rock caves with rare Chumash pictographs and once was the site of 
a Chumash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although local governments have other museums with Chumash artifacts, this 
will be the first Chumash museum and interpretive center run by descendants of 
Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakbrook Park Chumash Indian Corp. has leased the center from the county 
for eight years and plans to operate a center aimed at teaching schoolchildren 
and residents about the indigenous culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just doing it for Indian people," said Varela, who traces his 
ancestry to the Chumash. "This center's for everyone. We want people to know we 
were here and we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials Tuesday were set to give the nonprofit group another $106,100 
to launch the museum and interpretive center during its first 18 months of 
operation. But they postponed action because of legal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the money comes from a special developer fee for parks, 
which usually is restricted to building parks and other recreational projects 
and cannot be used for maintenance or operations, said Blake Boyle, the 
county's manager of parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The county council's office is reviewing the law, he said. And if the 
developers fees cannot be used, Boyle said the Parks and Recreation Department 
will look for another source of start-up money. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are committed to opening the park, which the county purchased 
in 1971 and set aside as an archeologically sensitive wilderness reserve. The 
park was off-limits to the public, except for the occasional permit given to 
Boy Scouts or other groups to enter the property, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big benefit is going to be for the children," said Boyle, who expects 
busloads of schoolchildren to visit the interpretive center beginning next 
year. "It'll be a reminder to everyone of our local cultural roots." 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretive center's semicircular building was completed in August, 
surrounding an old oak tree that stood alone in a clearing on the parkland. 
Situated on Lang Ranch Parkway off the northern extension of Westlake 
Boulevard, the 5,000-square-foot building is divided into sections for a 
library, gift shop, amphitheater and caretaker's house, as well as a gallery to 
display artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the artifacts will be on loan from the collections held by the 
Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History and UC Santa Barbara, Varela said. 
Artists are working on a five-panel pictorial history of the Chumash before the 
arrival of Spanish missionaries, and other workers expect to complete a trail 
for hikers before the December opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also will build a replica of a working Chumash village, complete with a 
sweat house and Chumash huts," said Varela, who left his job with a printed 
computer-circuit manufacturer in Ventura to oversee the center. He and his 
family now live in the caretaker's house on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Varela said his group stitched together a variety of grants to complete the 
center. And to preserve authenticity, it has sought advice from archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the plans and they look great," said John Johnson, curator of 
anthropology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. "This is the first 
culture center that has an almost entirely Native American board." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he has helped several board members trace their family genealogy, 
and the board has descendants of the Chumash, Tataviam and Gabrielino -- the 
three groups of Native Americans who once lived in Ventura County. Each group 
had its own language. 
</P>
<P>
 He also emphasized the importance of the location of the center. A cave in 
Oakbrook Park, he said, has one of only three known pictographs of a swordfish, 
a prominent entity in Chumash mythology. The Chumash believed that the 
swordfish was the chief of all creatures of the sea -- the maritime counterpart 
to human beings.

 The council's Monday night vote capped months of community Angst over the fate 
of the mushroom-looking trees, which have lined the city's main thoroughfare 
since the 1950s. The council split 6 to 1, with Councilman Jim Monahan opposing 
because he thinks the project is a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a painful but simple decision for me," said Councilman Gary Tuttle as he 
prepared to vote to chop down the ficuses. "It is an investment in economic 
vitality." 
</P>
<P>
 The tree question was the most controversial element of an improvement project 
for Main and California streets that the council approved Monday. The 
$2.5-million project includes installing old-fashioned street lamps, laying 
decorative brickwork and expanding the sidewalks to allow more pedestrian 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners say they hope to begin construction in January and finish by 
April. By the time the city is through, the tristania conferta "Brisbane Boxes" 
trees on Main Street will also be replaced by palms and locust trees, and there 
will be 30% more trees on Main and California, planners say. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also considered planting palm trees only, or just leaving the 
ficus trees in place. But some council members worried that rows of palm trees 
alone would deprive pedestrians of shade as they walked along the downtown 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the council also agreed to rip out the ficuses because, when the 
sidewalks are expanded, the trees would grow right in the middle and impede 
pedestrians. City planners explained that ficuses do not transplant well. Many, 
they said, would die if moved just a few feet. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ficuses are disliked by many local merchants because their bushy tops 
obscure store signs and window banners. Adopting dramatic tones, some residents 
told the council that a vote against the ficuses was a vote for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, the council holds in its hands the key to Ventura's future," said 
Tim O'Neil, who owns a consulting business on California Street. "Ventura, like 
all of us, cannot live in our past. Our future is calling." 
</P>
<P>
 Other city residents, however, vehemently defended the ficuses' right to 
continued existence on California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a shame to destroy beautiful, healthy, existing trees," said 
resident Donna Herbert. "I'd like somebody to point out a street in Ventura 
that is lined with palms that is attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ficus trees took root in Ventura in the early 1950s, when the city's 
Soroptomist Club donated the mushroom-like vegetation for planting along 
California Street, said Richard Senate, the city's unofficial historian. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, palm trees lined the length of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, at one time, Ventura was known as 'The Palm City,' " Senate said, 
adding that the priests at the San Buenaventura Mission planted date palms all 
over the city in the 19th Century.

NEW CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS OPEN; THOUSAND OAKS: LITTLE LEAGUERS ALSO HONORED AS 
CITY SHOWS OFF ITS ENERGY-EFFICIENT HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Inaugurating the new City Council chambers with a broad grin, Thousand Oaks 
Mayor Alex Fiore slashed a ceremonial red ribbon on Tuesday evening and 
welcomed a crowd of looky-loos and Little Leaguers into the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a magnificent moment in the history of this city," Fiore said, "a 
time when we can come together to reflect on this extraordinary facility, which 
will be uplifting spirits for years into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 To bursts of applause, Fiore introduced two Thousand Oaks Little League teams: 
the 9- and 10-year-olds, who won the state championship this year, and the 
older Junior Division all-stars, who took the world title. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball players, clad in their black-green-and-white uniforms, arrived at 
the 2-day-old City Hall shortly before the 5 p.m. ribbon-cutting ceremony after 
a triumphant motorcade through Thousand Oaks' downtown corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Proudly, the players joined a throng of well-wishers in packing the council 
chamber's 280 russet-colored seats to watch beaming politicians and bureaucrats 
ascend to the dais. The theatrical council chamber doubles as a community 
auditorium; the dais sinks into the basement on coiled springs to be replaced 
by a parquet stage. 
</P>
<P>
 After welcoming the crowd, Fiore rededicated 16 seats named for outstanding 
citizens of Thousand Oaks. Most of the seats were originally dedicated a decade 
ago, in the city's first government center at 401 Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting moment for all of us," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "This 
is your facility. Please enjoy it and please come down and use it all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen county and state officials attended the ceremony, including 
California's First Lady Gayle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hoopla died down, Fiore accepted a rebate check from Southern 
California Edison worth $95,301 in recognition of energy-saving features built 
into the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison hands rebate checks to all home or business owners 
who incorporate energy-efficient equipment during new construction. Each 
state-of-the-art lighting system or air-conditioner is worth a certain dollar 
amount, and Edison will tally up the total and cut a check after construction 
is complete, said Division Manager Tom Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison rebate check will be credited to the Civic Arts Plaza's 
construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' $64-million Civic Arts Plaza incorporates the latest 
energy-saving insulation, lighting and window glazing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most unusual feature is the air-conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During off-peak hours such as nights and weekends, when energy prices are 
lower, the system works full blast to cool water in an underground storage 
tank. This ice water then circulates through the air-conditioner fans during 
daytime hours, saving the city big money. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison estimates that the Civic Arts Plaza's various energy-saving devices 
will cut the annual bill by about one-fifth -- saving the city $61,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building was built in 1994, so from glass and door seals to the 
insulation in the walls, everything about it is energy-conservation minded," 
agreed Bill Huston, who is supervising construction of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the high-tech devices cost a little more, "I'm sure they'll make that 
up with their energy savings in five years or so," Huston said.

NEW LUNCH POLICY TAKES A BITE OUT OF LANDFILLS; SCHOOLS: TO CUT DOWN ON REFUSE, 
STUDENTS AT AN OAK PARK CAMPUS MUST BRING LUNCHES IN REUSABLE CONTAINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Watching the children at Oak Hills Elementary School in Oak Park nibble on 
their lunches, Principal Anthony Knight sees a green future. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, there is not a paper napkin or 
candy wrapper in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a pint-sized potato chip bag lurks in a lunch box somewhere, Knight is 
confident it won't land in his garbage cans -- thanks to the school's new 
zero-trash policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to cut down on waste going into landfills," Knight said. "It is 
our planet and we cannot keep trashing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Oak Hills' new policy, children must bring school lunches in reusable 
containers. If plastic bags are used, they must be taken home and used again. 
Commercially prepackaged food is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to get away from all these individually wrapped items," Knight 
explained. "Instead of a bag of chips, they have to have a container of chips." 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of the policy is simple: "If they bring trash, they take it home 
with them," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the program, which started this school year, is already 
reducing campus trash. 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents complain that the policy goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in some respects it is great," parent Amy Menashe said. "But I feel 
it really puts a big burden on the kids and the adults." 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the policy's strict guidelines, Menashe had to buy new lunch 
containers for her two daughters and must spend more time in the morning fixing 
their lunches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last school year, in her own attempt to use plastic containers, Menashe said 
her children lost more than $100 worth of Tupperware. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we send Tupperware to school, nobody is there to monitor that it will ever 
make it home," she said. "I understand why they did it, but there has to be a 
happy medium." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Susan Kaye agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a bit restrictive," she said. "But I think the policy is trying to 
teach us to change to be more ecologically minded for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some complaints, the program appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, lunchtime trash filled eight 55-gallon trash barrels each day, 
Knight said. But so far this year, lunch trash has filled only about a 
half-barrel a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been extremely positive results," Knight said. "That is 1,260 
barrels of trash (a year) that is not going into a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 510 students who attend Oak Hills have embraced the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep our environment clean," 5 1/2-year-old Garrett Spiegel said, 
taking a bologna sandwich out of a plastic container in his Batman lunch box. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Sarah Weinstein's lunch box is an environmentalist's dream come 
true. Inside the first-grader's purple-and-green Little Mermaid pouch are three 
neatly arranged plastic containers -- and not a hint of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a Tupperware drink, I have a banana, but I didn't eat it because I 
don't like bananas," Sarah said. "I have this big Tupperware that I keep my 
sandwich and some chips in. And, I have a cloth napkin." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hurdles the school faces in implementing its program is steering 
parents away from the allure of kid-sized commercial packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Nicole Rader's single-portion bag of Doritos and paper juice 
boxes make Knight cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in violation of the policy," he said. "That's three counts right 
there." For children whose lunch boxes violate the rules, officials send home a 
"green note" asking for parental compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging parents to resist the attraction of petite packaged items is an 
objective of school and government officials trying to reduce waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big distributing companies want (consumers) to believe this is what kids 
want," said Virginia Hand, the county's recycling manager. "But you have to 
start with the consumer. Somewhere along that loop we have to apply some 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Hand said Oak Hills' policy goes beyond waste reduction projects launched by 
other Ventura County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is right in line with what we have tried to do on a county if not a 
statewide basis," she said. "I have not heard of any school (in the county) 
trying to do a zero-garbage policy. It is a pretty bold project, but it is 
feasible."

110 CALABASAS AREA HOUSES GET OK; DEVELOPMENT: PROJECT ALONG LAS VIRGENES ROAD 
WILL INCLUDE 4.5-ACRE COMMERCIAL PROJECT AND 400 ACRES OF OPEN SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping eight years of debate, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday approved a controversial housing project near Calabasas at a fraction 
of its original size and gave up on extending an unpopular four-lane highway 
through the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The board granted the developer of the Malibu Terrace project permission to 
build a 4.5-acre commercial project and 110 houses in the sensitive ecological 
area along Las Virgenes Road north of the Ventura Freeway -- less than 
one-tenth of the 1,816 houses originally proposed in 1986. The supervisors also 
designated 400 acres of the 500-acre property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The board dropped plans to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard about a mile east 
through the property over the objections of the county's road department, which 
recommended building the road as the first step toward creating a vital 
alternative to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents the area, successfully argued that the 
remaining four miles of the extension would never be completed because of 
opposition from nearby residents, the city of Calabasas and the National Park 
Service, which owns the contiguous Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our road people, God love them, see roads and just can't live without them," 
Edelman said. "But the problem is this road won't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of the road, the supervisors ordered Las Virgenes Properties to pay 
the county $600,000 for regional transportation improvements, such as bridge 
widening and traffic signal installation. John Vidovich, a partner in the 
development firm, objected to the fee, saying the company had already agreed to 
pay almost $500,000 in other traffic fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Vidovich said he was relieved the project had finally been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to celebrate by being nice to my wife," Vidovich said. "We've only 
been married 10 years and I've been working on this project the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution of the long-debated issue also pleased Calabasas officials, who 
argued that extending Thousand Oaks Boulevard would generate traffic and induce 
growth in their 3-year-old city. Calabasas incorporated in 1991, largely out of 
displeasure with the county's planning policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Weisbrock, director of the environmental group Save Open Space, said 
the project will destroy the Palo Comado Significant Ecological Area -- one of 
61 areas designated for protection by the county in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisbrock also said the board should have required the developer to donate the 
open space to a public agency, as Edelman initially proposed. Instead, the 
board simply designated it as open space, effectively allowing the developer to 
try to sell or lease it to a parks agency or other public entity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board said if the developer decides to donate land, it must be 
given to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the National Parks Service or 
the county.

EPA FINES 5 FIRMS $750,000 IN TOXICS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday announced fines of 
$750,000 against five firms accused of failing to treat industrial waste before 
discharging it to municipal sewage treatment plants in Burbank and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. was socked with the largest penalty -- $460,000 -- for 
violating the federal pre-treatment requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said Stainless Steel Products Inc. and Zero Corp. of Burbank 
agreed to pay $90,000 and $75,000, respectively, while Teledyne Industries Inc. 
of Los Angeles and Chevron U.S.A. Inc of El Segundo were fined $85,000 and 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties are included in settlement agreements filed in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles that end a 3-year-old lawsuit against the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed on behalf of the EPA and the Los Angeles Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, a state agency, accused the firms of violating the 
federal Clean Water Act by failing to remove toxic metals and other industrial 
contaminants before discharging waste water to city sewer plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants were designed to handle domestic waste, and could be damaged by 
industrial waste or pass it, untreated, into the Los Angeles River or Santa 
Monica Bay, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Settlements such as these send a strong message to the regulated community 
that it doesn't pay to pollute our precious water resources," said Robert P. 
Ghirelli, executive officer for the regional water board, in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very old case involving alleged violations in the late 1980s at 
facilities no longer in operation," said Lockheed spokesman Paul Haney, 
referring to the company's Burbank manufacturing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed agreed to this out-of-court settlement with the government more than 
two years ago, without admitting liability, to avoid the cost of litigation," 
Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
 An EPA official also said the companies agreed to the fines about two years 
ago, but that delays in filing the consent agreements resulted, among other 
things, from efforts to settle claims against a sixth firm -- Crown Cork & Seal 
Co. of Van Nuys. Crown officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Arthur, an environmental engineer at the EPA's San Francisco regional 
office, said the lawsuit will continue against Crown and the cities of Burbank 
and Los Angeles, which were accused of failing to adequately enforce federal 
pre-treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur said Lockheed, Zero and Stainless Steel Products were found to have 
violated pre-treatment standards for metals. He said Teledyne exceeded 
standards for metals and cyanide, and Chevron for oil, grease and ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
 City sewage plants "are designed to handle human waste . . . so they don't 
treat for metals and they don't treat for cyanide, as examples," Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pollutants "can contaminate the sludge that those treatment plants make, 
they can cause those treatment plants themselves to fail to work, or they can 
just pass right through the treatment plant and end up in Santa Monica Bay or 
the Los Angeles River," Arthur said.

SUPERVISORS WARNED ON '3 STRIKES'; JAILS: BLOCK, GARCETTI AND JUDGES SAY A 
RECENT BUILDUP OF FELONY CASES INDICATES THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM COULD SOON BE 
OVERWHELMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County jails and courts could soon be overwhelmed by a flood of 
accused criminals fighting prosecution under the state's tough new "three 
strikes" law, officials warned the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid buildup of felony cases since the controversial sentencing law was 
enacted six months ago is evidence that the costs of prosecution, 
administration and incarceration under that law could be extraordinary, said 
Sheriff Sherman Block, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and a panel of Superior and 
Municipal Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying the law and paying for it could require severe cutbacks in other 
public services or lead to new or higher taxes, the officials warned. And 
although the law was meant to clear the streets of career criminals, the 
gridlock it is causing could force officials to let thousands of petty 
criminals go free as the wheels of justice grind to a halt, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step, Garcetti asked the Board of Supervisors to immediately give 
him the authority to hire 40 additional prosecutors and support staff and to 
begin building a financial reserve to prepare for the inevitable onslaught of 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for criminals 
convicted of a third felony after two other serious felony convictions. The 
prospect of a lengthy term eliminates much of the incentive for defendants to 
plea bargain, leading to the upsurge in jury trials, the officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Block said there could soon be no room left for sentenced criminals in the 
county's jails as defendants awaiting trial under the "three strikes" law fill 
every cell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The law added 1,700 inmates to county jails during its first six months, Block 
said. And because county jails are under a court order to limit crowding, that 
means an equal number of convicted or accused criminals had to be let go to 
make room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sending a message that petty crimes won't get jail time," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who opposed the "three strikes" law as ill-conceived 
election year politicking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a supporter of the law, said "it sends the 
message that if you commit a (serious) crime, you will be going away for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 About the new law, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said: "'We're all for 
fighting crime, but shouldn't we know how much it is going to cost?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to the experts, it's about to cost more at every juncture of the 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the cost of guarding "three strikes" inmates, considered 
high-security prisoners, is much higher than that of incarcerating the general 
jail population, Block said, and could eventually require millions of dollars 
annually for additional jailhouse personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six months of the law's implementation the proportion of 
high-security inmates has jumped from 36% to 44% of the jail population, Block 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the cost of booking prisoners will go up by several hundred thousand 
dollars annually because the law requires sheriff's deputies to do more 
exhaustive and time-consuming searches of arrestees' criminal histories, Block 
said.

 Although the Legislature is legally bound to fund any law that leads to new or 
higher costs for local governments, county Chief Administrative Officer Sally 
Reed said the cash-strapped state government is unlikely to come through with 
additional funds for the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said the number of felony prosecutions handled by his office could 
climb by nearly 150% within the year, leaving his staff of 900 attorneys buried 
under paperwork. The number of felony jury trials has held relatively steady 
over the past several years at about 2,400 annually. But in 1995, Garcetti is 
forecasting more than 5,875 such trials.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not here to be an alarmist," he said. "We need to be prudent but 
prepared for the 'three strikes' crisis that could be coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will I have to double the number of attorneys on my staff? We just don't 
know," he said. "The dam will burst, and there will be a flood of cases. It's 
an awesome number of cases . . . and we are not prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he believes that defendants, who largely control the timing of 
their trials, are waiting to see if the law is softened after the November 
elections. He called that a false hope, but said it shows that the number of 
potential cases is building and could overwhelm his office. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of Superior and Municipal Court judges warned that there may be no 
court space or judges available for misdemeanor prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misdemeanor prosecutions will be history," said Superior Court Judge Carol 
Fieldhouse. Fieldhouse predicted that many, and possibly all, Municipal Court 
judges will be called on to handle the overflow of felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Even civil court judges could be drafted because of the overflow of felony 
cases, Fieldhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your seat belt on and get ready," he said.

OFFICIALS BACK MOST OF LAPD SHAKE-UP; POLICE: SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT NEW 
ASSISTANT CHIEF POSITION, AND SAY WILLIAMS WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite significant misgivings at City Hall over Los Angeles Police Chief 
Willie L. Williams' proposed reorganization of his department, council members 
and police commissioners said Tuesday that they expect to back the chief on 
most of his ideas and then hold him accountable if the shake-up fails to 
produce results. 
</P>
<P>
 But even among Williams' supporters, some expressed doubts about a plan to 
create a new position of "first assistant chief" and accused Williams of 
demoting his top assistant, Bernard C. Parks, to deflect criticism of his own 
management. Several key council members, including Council President John 
Ferraro, said they were troubled by the proposal to create the new post. And 
two retired LAPD chiefs, Daryl F. Gates and Ed Davis, both condemned the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous possibility for corruption" when one assistant has so 
much power, said Davis, who still is an influential figure in Los Angeles 
politics, particularly in issues involving the Police Department. "It would be 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates agreed and blasted Williams for the moves, which the chief announced 
Monday evening after word began leaking out that changes were in the works. 
"The problem is not Parks," said the former chief, who in recent months has 
been highly critical of the man who took over the LAPD when Gates retired under 
pressure in 1992. "The problem is Willie Williams. He is an absolute, total 
blob. He's incompetent." 
</P>
<P>
 When he unveiled the shake-up Monday, Williams presented the management 
reorganization as effective immediately. But police commissioners and members 
of the City Council, some of whom were irritated to learn of the changes from 
reporters rather than from Williams himself, say they will play a role in it 
before it is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure that the chief has proposed will be a discussion point with the 
commission," said Enrique Hernandez Jr., president of the civilian body that 
oversees Police Department policy. "I think he knows the commission wants to 
support him." 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Mayor Richard Riordan said the mayor also backed the chief's 
proposed reorganization, which sources say was prompted largely by Riordan's 
dissatisfaction with the Police Department's performance under Williams. 
Williams acknowledged that the mayor's office was consulted about the 
reorganization, but denied that the moves were made in response to pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent meeting with the mayor, Williams complained that his efforts to 
move the department forward were being hampered by his lack of faith in his 
command staff. Sources said that Riordan did not make any specific suggestions 
about personnel changes, but that he and his staff urged Williams to take 
greater control of the department in order to ensure that the LAPD stayed on 
track toward achieving reforms and implementing a highly touted police 
expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Williams described the personnel shifts as necessary to push the LAPD 
forward and announced that he was promoting Deputy Chief Ronald Banks to the 
position of first assistant chief. Banks, according to Williams, "will be 
accountable, along with the chief of police, as a driver of change within the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 No such post currently exists, and several observers raised doubts about it 
Tuesday. In particular, they questioned why Williams needed an assistant to 
take charge of all LAPD operations and administrative services when, under the 
current organization, that is Williams' job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job he described is what he's supposed to be," said Ferraro. "I don't 
know why we need that." 
</P>
<P>
 Another councilman, Richard Alatorre, promised to have pointed questions for 
Williams when he comes to the council for approval of the new assistant post. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't need that position before, " Alatorre said, referring to 
the chief's first reorganization of the department. "Now he is saying he does 
need it. Why? What changed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was out of the country on vacation, but his chief 
deputy, Alisa Katz, said Williams will be questioned closely about the value of 
creating another top post in the Police Department's management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It flies in the face of manage ment audits previously done on the Police 
Department, which called for reducing the number of top management staff," Katz 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Commissioner Gary Greenebaum said, however, that he and other 
commissioners were committed to giving Williams room to manage the department 
as he sees it. Greenebaum said he hoped council members would agree and not 
obstruct Williams' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the City Council going to want to micro-manage the chief in that way?" 
Greenebaum asked. "We feel as a commission that it's not our job to do that. I 
think the City Council should not do that either." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, in comments that were echoed by many officials, said 
that while he and other council members are impatient for progress in deploying 
more officers, he wants to give Williams ample latitude to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the chief's call, and then ultimately he will be judged on the wisdom of 
his decisions and the results he gets," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although creation of the new assistant chief job is the most significant 
structural change in the organization, it was Williams' decision to demote 
Parks that prompted the most emotional response. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Parks and Williams has never been cozy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sought to become the department's first black police chief. After 
Williams won the job, he made Parks his top aide, but the two have frequently 
clashed over internal police matters. Both, however, are popular figures -- 
Williams enjoying wide support among the public and Parks with the city's power 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 As the split between two top law enforcement leaders spilled into the public 
arena this week, its fallout was felt profoundly throughout the Police 
Department and City Hall, where the shake-up was a hot topic of conversation. . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is causing a great deal of consternation among some rank-and-file 
officers and some ranking members of the department, as well as in the city's 
elected leadership," said one council member who asked not to be named. Parks 
"is held in very high esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, who have openly feuded 
with Parks in recent months, called a news conference to praise the chief's 
actions, hailing the shake-up as a way to address low officer morale and 
uncertain public confidence in the Police Department. In a statement read by 
league Vice President Ron Aguilar, the union leaders said they had "encountered 
some very serious managerial and attitude problems with Chief Parks," and added 
that his demotion would be a blessing for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks was not surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not at work Tuesday but consulted with his attorneys, one of whom said 
he was contemplating seeking an injunction, filing a lawsuit or filing a 
grievance to block the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "From all appearances, what Chief Williams has done is unlawful and improper 
and against all LAPD practices and procedures," said Barry Levin, counsel to 
the Command Officers Assn., a labor organization that represents high-ranking 
LAPD officers. Levin said Williams had failed to give Parks notice that he was 
planning to demote him and thus never gave Parks the opportunity to respond to 
any complaints about his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said Williams had spoken to Parks just before Parks left for Europe, 
where he was representing Los Angeles at a sister city conference in Berlin 
last week. During that meeting, according to Levin, Williams told Parks that he 
was pleased with his work.

MARCH OF THE MONKS ; BUDDHISM: MEMBERS OF WAT THAI TEMPLE MAKE WEEKLY 
PROCESSION IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD. ANCIENT RITUAL IS MEANT TO HELP RID THEM OF 
EARTHLY DESIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking single file, the line of Thai monks slips unnoticed through a 
residential section of North Hollywood each Saturday at sunup. 
</P>
<P>
 They move deliberately, their sandals flapping softly against the sidewalk. 
Sooner or later, their billowing orange robes betray their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 A dog barks. Sleepy-eyed motorists stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where they go," said Richard Holmquist, who paused in his 
driveway while tying a bag of garbage to watch the procession. "They come by 
every week. I call them the Orange Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is an oddity to neighbors, the march of the monks is an ancient 
ritual meant to help rid them of earthly desire, a first step on the path to 
Buddhist enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The route takes them from the Wat Thai temple to the front yards of about a 
dozen Thai American families. There, the monks are offered fruit, rice, bags of 
curried meat and bottles of water from small tables or the hoods of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, where most of the population is Buddhist, providing food for 
monks has been practiced every morning for centuries, and is not considered 
charity. By feeding monks, adherents help their mentors become free of material 
needs, which in turn enhances their own spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Phra Setthakic," Nith Duangkam, 77, said in Thai, bowing nearly double 
as she scooped rice into his bowl. "I'm sorry, I cannot come to the temple 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's too bad," Setthakic said. "I hope you can come soon." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, which has the largest Thai community outside Thailand, the 
alms walk is largely symbolic. The monks say it helps them and their followers 
remember who they are in the concrete sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside another home, Phra Anon poked his wooden bowl through his robe to 
accept a neatly wrapped bundle of skewered meat and a box of chocolate milk 
from a woman bent respectfully low. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Anon confided, "I like chocolate milk." But, perhaps sensing a 
transgression, he quickly added: "I like all food the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Thai monks try to rid themselves of desire, and the achievement is their 
source of holiness. They succeed to varying degrees, depending partly on how 
long they have been monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Anon, 57, quit his computer data entry job three months ago to spend five 
months as a monk at Wat Thai before he begins another job in Hawaii. For Thai 
men, joining a temple for at least a few months of their lives is considered 
crucial to the understanding of Buddha's teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been about getting things," Anon said. "I am learning that money 
is not so important. Maybe when I go back I won't be so attached to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the temple, the rice, curries, bananas, grapes and other foods are 
prepared by volunteers for the 20 monks who live at Wat Thai -- the largest 
Thai temple in the United States. But the supplies will last only a day. The 
rest of the week, a cook hired by temple supporters prepares food for the 
monks, who, according to the teachings of Buddha, are forbidden to handle 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 17,000 Thais live in Los Angeles County, according to 1990 census 
figures, with six temples to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Phra Sumana, head monk at Wat Thai, said thousands visit the temple each month 
to ask advice from the monks, pray or study the Thai language, flower arranging 
and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks usually stay within the two-acre temple, where they chant in groups 
in the morning and evening, meditate alone during the day and perform chores 
such as sweeping and decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict interpretation of the Buddha's teachings allows them only eight 
possessions: two robes and an undergarment (all saffron colored), a bowl for 
accepting food, a razor for keeping the head and face shaved, a sewing needle, 
orange thread and a cloth water filter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need anything more," said Phra Setthakic, a 30-year monk, 
demonstrating how one robe is used for a pillow while the other serves as a 
blanket. "We can sleep on the ground if we need to." 
</P>
<P>
 A few other trappings, such as eyeglasses, sandals and socks, have made their 
way onto the unofficial possessions list. Living in Los Angeles, too, has 
forced the monks to abandon a few taboos. Sumana admits to having been forced 
several times to drive himself to a grocery store because no help was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "A monk in a store does not look right," Sumana said. "But we have to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 As have the neighbors of the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the sight of the robed monks jaywalking across Coldwater Canyon 
Avenue is as bizarre as that of their ornate temple flanked by a Mobil station 
and a tract of stucco homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A block west of Wat Thai is Grace Community Church of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look like they're out for Halloween," Rod Smith, security guard and 
member of the church, said as he watched them pass. "I pity them. I believe 
they are lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are part of the community," said Vytautas Barkus, who walks his dogs 
near the temple. "They are very peaceful. They cheer me up."

TRIAL OPENS IN TOW TRUCK DRIVER DEATH; COURTS: PROSECUTOR CALLS SHOOTING BY 
LAPD OFFICER OUTRAGEOUS. DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS IT WAS JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer was on an obsessive personal crusade against 
"bandit" tow-truck drivers when he shot an unarmed one to death two years ago 
during a dispute over the man's truck registration, a prosecutor told a jury 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader portrayed the July 1, 1992, shooting of 
John Daniels by motorcycle Officer Douglas Iversen as "outrageous," "out of 
line" and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks were made at the start of Iversen's trial on a second-degree 
murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Iversen's lawyer, John D. Barnett, told the jury that his client had acted 
properly in the shooting because, Barnett contended, Daniels had challenged 
Iversen and his partner in a threatening way and attempted to drive away, 
putting them and nearby pedestrians in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, Barnett said, "was be hind the wheel of a multi-ton truck that could 
mow down people" and was "seeking to arm himself by turning the truck on." 
Barnett told the jury that Iversen had reason to think Daniels was dangerous 
because the tow truck driver was among "a plague" of unlicensed tow operators 
who often recklessly rushed to accident scenes to get business. 
</P>
<P>
 Iversen is only the second law enforcement officer in Los Angeles County in 
more than a decade to be charged with killing someone while on duty. His trial 
is expected to last two or three weeks and focus heavily on his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Iversen has insisted that pedestrians were in the path of Daniels' moving tow 
truck and that it was only to ensure their safety that he fired at Daniels. 
Several witnesses, however, have said that the truck was traveling less than 5 
m.p.h. and that no one was in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 A police official testified at Iversen's preliminary hearing that it is 
against LAPD policy for an officer to fire at a moving vehicle. The official 
also testified that Iversen and his partner violated policy by stopping to 
check Daniels' tow truck registration when they should have been answering a 
call with a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Mader has indicated in court papers that she hopes to attack Iversen's 
truthfulness by introducing records of a 22-year-old felony conviction against 
him for receiving stolen property. The crime, which occurred in Minnesota, was 
pardoned, but Iversen failed to disclose it on his LAPD application as 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels' shooting took place a month after the Los Angeles riots, at a gas 
station at Florence Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard, not far from the riots' most 
infamous flash point. Officials feared the shooting might spark more civil 
unrest because immediately after it occurred, a large anti-police crowd 
gathered. No serious violence resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's theory of why Iversen shot Daniels starts with an incident 
two weeks before in which Iversen and his partner chased a truck that was owned 
by Daniels' family and that had been reportedly involved in a street robbery. 
Daniels was not involved in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck had no registration and was impounded, but was later mistakenly 
released. When Iversen spotted it at the Chevron station, he was determined to 
re-impound it because he had a "fetish" against tow trucks that were operating 
illegally, Mader told the jury Tuesday.

GRAB AT FREEDOM; CUBAN COUPLE REPRESENT NEW, DESPERATE GENERATION OF REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY and ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 On the coast of Cuba, on a black June night, two swimmers stroke slowly 
through the shallow, murky water, then dive beneath a fence surrounding a boat 
owned by a senior Communist official. 
</P>
<P>
 Working swiftly, the pair cut the fence, ducking to avoid spotlights sweeping 
the water near the dock, swim to the boat and cut its mooring lines. Gently, 
the swimmers tug the 21-foot boat through the gap in the fence and down the 
coast 150 feet to a landing, where Pedro and Ania Torres, a young Cuban couple, 
wait silently with 12 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cuba, the slogan of the revolution is: 'Socialism or Death,' " said Ania 
Torres on Tuesday. "Well, we chose neither." 
</P>
<P>
 Ania, 24, a teacher, and her husband, Pedro, 34, an engineering student, 
reached her aunt's home in North Hollywood a month ago and have been living 
there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 They represent a new, desperate generation of Cuban refugees, willing to risk 
drowning, shark attack, or dehydration for a chance at freedom in the United 
States. This generation of Cuban immigrants, captured on innumerable television 
shots floating in black rubber inner tubes tied together with rope, with U.S. 
helicopters or Coast Guard vessels hovering nearby, is different in many ways 
from the older generation of Cubans who emigrated to the Valley 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tragic situation," said Aurelio De la Vega, a music professor 
retired from Cal State Northridge who left Cuba by the less rigorous method of 
simply buying an airplane ticket in 1959, a few months after Fidel Castro came 
to power. 
</P>
<P>
 To De la Vega, a noted composer who started a university music program in Cuba 
before he fled, this latest generation differs greatly from his because they do 
not remember Cuba without Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuba was a great country to live in," remembers Christian Bru, a 73-year-old 
retired accountant now living in Chatsworth. He left Cuba in 1961 with only a 
nickel in his pocket. "No pollution. The ocean was beautiful. The country was 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bru, who in Cuba was an accountant for Standard Oil of New Jersey before 
Castro came to power, said he left because "I did not want my children to live 
in a communist system. I knew that country would get worse and worse through 
the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, De la Vega can still identify with the new refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you lose your country, you don't belong anywhere anymore," De la Vega 
said. "You just have people who are congenial to you. You leave behind all your 
history and all your memories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The generation of Cubans who arrived here in the years just after Castro's 
1959 revolution were often educated, bilingual professionals, such as lawyers, 
bankers, accountants, businessmen and women, and educators. Together they have 
constructed a strong, informal network of families, friends and Cuban 
professionals able to assist new, young arrivals such as the Torres couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro and Ania took nothing with them but powdered milk, water and the clothes 
on their backs when they left. Still wearing those clothes, and speaking in 
Spanish through an interpreter, Pedro Torres recounted their seaborne escape 
that would lead them to Los Angeles, home to what Cuban American groups 
estimate are 45,000 Cuban immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vital mechanical parts of the boat they stole had been removed in an attempt 
to keep it from being used to escape from Cuba, he said. But one of the 16 
immigrants aboard was a mechanic who was able to start the motor, but it was 
stuck in reverse. They motored along backward for a short while until the 
engine broke down and the group hid on a small island while the mechanic 
repaired it. They reached the Florida Keys three days after leaving Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to escape, Ania Torres said, "because of the impossibility of 
continuing to live there." They had to endure severe food shortages in Cuba and 
lived in the kitchen of a house with Pedro's mother, brother and sister. They 
could not get better jobs because they were not Communist Party members. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, their happiness here is troubled by guilt. They made it to America 
before the Clinton Administration's recent reversal of a 28-year U.S. policy of 
granting asylum to Cubans who reach U.S. soil. The United States has said it 
will grant 20,000 visas this year to Cuban immigrants who qualify. All others 
must get in line, no matter how desperate their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday morning, a total of 31,400 Cubans had been rescued at sea by the 
U.S. Coast Guard, according to a Justice Department spokesman. They are being 
detained at camps in Panama, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and at sea on ships. Most 
will be returned to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left most of my family behind. I left my grandfather," Pedro Torres said. 
"They are suffering, and here we are enjoying freedom and liberty."  
</P>
<P>
 De la Vega, who was a law student at the University of Havana from 1944 to 
1947, remembers an energetic fellow student a year behind him named Fidel 
Castro. "A young man full of ideals," De la Vega said. "We didn't see what he 
was going to become." 
</P>
<P>
 California has the fourth-largest population of Cuban immigrants in the United 
States, with 71,000, according to 1990 U.S. Census data. New Jersey and New 
York rank second and third, respectively, and Florida has the most, with 
674,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bru sympathizes with the Cubans now being held on American military bases, but 
he believes the United States cannot absorb so many new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem right now is that the economy is not too good," said Bru, adding, 
"I wish all the 10 million people over there can come over here, but it's 
absolutely impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Bonilla of Northridge, a controller at NBC who left Cuba in 1962, said he 
understands the Clinton Administration's position regarding Cuban refugees, but 
added, "I think the people that risked their lives should have preference. The 
ones who rafted over, these people are risking their lives. Most of them have

EPA FINES 5 FIRMS $750,000 IN TOXICS CASE; ENVIRONMENT: COMPANIES ARE ACCUSED 
OF FAILING TO REMOVE METALS AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS BEFORE DISCHARGING WASTE 
WATER TO BURBANK, L.A. SEWER PLANTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday announced fines of 
$750,000 against five firms accused of failing to treat industrial waste before 
discharging it to municipal sewage treatment plants in Burbank and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. was socked with the largest penalty -- $460,000 -- for 
violating the federal pre-treatment requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said Stainless Steel Products Inc. and Zero Corp. of Burbank 
agreed to pay $90,000 and $75,000, respectively, while Teledyne Industries Inc. 
of Los Angeles and Chevron U.S.A. Inc of El Segundo were fined $85,000 and 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties are included in settlement agreements filed in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles that end a 3-year-old lawsuit against the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed on behalf of the EPA and the Los Angeles Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, a state agency, accused the firms of violating the 
federal Clean Water Act by failing to remove toxic metals and other industrial 
contaminants before discharging waste water to city sewer plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants were designed to handle domestic waste, and could be damaged by 
industrial waste or pass it, untreated, into the Los Angeles River or Santa 
Monica Bay, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Settlements such as these send a strong message to the regulated community 
that it doesn't pay to pollute our precious water resources," said Robert P. 
Ghirelli, executive officer for the regional water board, in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very old case involving alleged violations in the late 1980s at 
facilities no longer in operation," said Lockheed spokesman Paul Haney, 
referring to the company's Burbank manufacturing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed agreed to this out-of-court settlement with the government more than 
two years ago, without admitting liability, to avoid the cost of litigation," 
Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
 An EPA official also said the companies agreed to the fines about two years 
ago, but that delays in filing the consent agreements resulted, among other 
things, from efforts to settle claims against a sixth firm -- Crown Cork & Seal 
Co. of Van Nuys. Crown officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Arthur, an environmental engineer at the EPA's San Francisco regional 
office, said the lawsuit will continue against Crown and the cities of Burbank 
and Los Angeles, which were accused of failing to adequately enforce federal 
pre-treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur said Lockheed, Zero and Stainless Steel Products were found to have 
violated pre-treatment standards for metals. He said Teledyne exceeded 
standards for metals and cyanide, and Chevron for oil, grease and ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
 City sewage plants "are designed to handle human waste . . . so they don't 
treat for metals and they don't treat for cyanide, as examples," Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pollutants "can contaminate the sludge that those treatment plants make, 
they can cause those treatment plants themselves to fail to work, or they can 
just pass right through the treatment plant and end up in Santa Monica Bay or 
the Los Angeles River," Arthur said.

FILMING FOR 'BRADY BUNCH' CREATES TRAFFIC CRUNCH; MOVIE: SIGNS ON VENTURA 
FREEWAY WARNING OF 'GANG WAR' AND 'KILLER BEES' WERE MOVIE PROPS AND WEREN'T 
SUPPOSE TO BE VISIBLE TO TRAFFIC, CALTRANS SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's the story of a jam named Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the westbound Ventura Freeway was tied up Tuesday afternoon after 
motorists were startled by glimpses of electronic signs, mounted on trucks in 
Caltrans fashion, that flashed warnings of "Killer Bee Gridlock" and a "Gang 
War Riot Ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 But they were safe from both bugs and thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were props for an upcoming movie based on the "Brady Bunch" 
television series. Shooting wrapped up last week, but some extra footage of 
freeway traffic was needed for the movie's opening scene, co-producer Jenno 
Topping said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were to be placed on the Van Nuys Boulevard on-ramp, out of sight of 
drivers above on the freeway, according to California Department of 
Transportation spokesman Russell Snyder. But somehow they were placed alongside 
the actual freeway in full view of motorists, who slowed down and gawked, 
creating a midday jam that snaked back for at least a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signs were not supposed to be visible to mainline traffic," Snyder said. 
"For whatever reason, that did not happen, so it was a mistake somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But Topping said everything went "as planned" with Caltrans, except that the 
signs sparked a greater slowdown than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to disturb anybody's day," Topping said. "We didn't want to 
back traffic up. It was just regular traffic that we wanted to catch (on 
film)." 
</P>
<P>
 The footage is for the opening scene of the film, in which the 
hyper-functional Brady clan is transplanted to the present but mentally is 
still living in the '70s (clothes included). In the opening scene, the movie's 
villain drives along the freeway, indifferent to electronic warnings of 
supposedly commonplace catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are absurd but still possible," Topping said of killer bee 
crossings and announced gang battles -- ideas that came from a "joint effort" 
among those working on the Paramount Studios film, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is due out in February. The original series premiered in 1969, 
exactly 25 years ago this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said the film crew had a Caltrans permit to film between 10 a.m. and 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After traffic began to snarl because of the signs' visibility, "we took 
immediate steps" to rectify the error, he said. The California Highway Patrol 
was on hand to help direct traffic.

OFFERED TO HELP SOLVE MURDER AT GAS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Shell Oil Corp. officials Tuesday announced a $45,000 reward 
for information about the murder of the assistant manager of a South-Central 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph Miguel, 34, was counting receipts when he was stabbed to death in the 
back office of a Shell station in the 8600 block of Western Avenue two weeks 
ago.The station, destroyed in the 1992 riots, was reopened 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Marta Moran of the South Bureau homicide unit said there are no 
suspects in the early-morning murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a $25,000 reward for any tipster who helps 
authorities find and prosecute the killer. Earlier this month, Shell officials 
offered $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference announcing the reward money, Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas said, "Let's be realistic -- people are fearful and we have to 
motivate people to come forward."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MARCH 
PLANNED AGAINST IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of labor unions and community organizations Tuesday announced an 
upcoming march in Los Angeles against Proposition 187, calling it a "vicious, 
mean-spirited measure" that would cost the state millions of dollars to 
implement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 16 march, sponsored by the National Coordinating Committee for 
Citizenship & Civic Participation, will start in East Los Angeles and end at 
City Hall.Californians will vote on the measure in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that Proposition 187 would save the state tens of millions of 
dollars by denying illegal immigrants public schooling, non-emergency health 
care, social services and other government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of 
Labor AFL-CIO, said Tuesday that the measure "will solve no problems. It is 
simply a cowardly attack against the sick, children and the elderly."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; CITY SUES 
FORMER OPERATOR OF LANDMARK ALEX THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Glendale filed suit Tuesday against the former operators of the 
city-owned Alex Theatre, accusing them of breach of contract, absconding with 
donations and the fraudulent selling of 11,000 subscription tickets for a 
season of musicals "knowing they would be unable to deliver the musicals." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is the Pasadena-based Theatre Corp. of America, which had 
promised Glendale it would produce splashy musicals and other major 
entertainment events at the Alex, a 1925 Art Deco theater that reopened this 
year after a $6.5-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. of America, which manages the Pasadena Playhouse, had told 
Glendale officials the Alex could be operated at no cost to the city. But city 
officials say that in July, after tickets were sold for a three-musical series, 
the company informed them that most of the money had gone to pay debts and that 
remaining funds would not be enough to produce even one show. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the city and the company was formally severed in August. 
In the suit, filed in Glendale Superior Court, the city asks for a full 
accounting of money collected and spent in order to determine how much the city 
might be owed. The city believes it "exceeds the sum of $1 million," according 
to the suit. Theatre Corp. of America officials could not be reached for 
comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GEORGE BURNS 'STABLE' 
AFTER SURGERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian George Burns was conscious and in stable condition at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center on Tuesday following a two-hour operation to remove fluid from 
his brain, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, 98, entered the hospital Monday afternoon and had surgery about 6 p.m. 
that evening, spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no sense of impending disaster," Wise said, adding that Burns 
"tolerated the surgery well. . . . With any kind of luck he'll be out of here 
in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns had been flown to Cedars-Sinai for observation on July 13 immediately 
after a fall in a bathtub in his Las Vegas home, which had required two 
stitches for a cut. He was released from the hospital then, but his speech was 
slurred as a result of the accident and the slurring worsened recently, 
according to Burns' manager, Irving Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 The fluid had gathered above Burns' brain as a esult of the fall, Wise said, 
and the surgery was designed to relieve pressure on the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fein said Burns has canceled engagements in Connecticut from Sept. 30 to Oct. 
2, and a luncheon at the Plaza Hotel in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Burns commemorated his 98th birthday with sellout shows Jan. 20-23 at Caesar's 
Palace in Las Vegas, receiving standing ovations as he traced his 91-year 
career. NICHOLAS RICCARDI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; SOME RESIDENTS AREN'T SOLD ON SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A new swap meet near the corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards has 
antiques and vintage jewelry galore. But some neighbors say they wish the 
outdoor market itself would become a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 While these residents consider the market a blot on the otherwise upscale face 
of Studio City, others call it a boon to downtown business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday swap meet, located in the parking lot behind shops in the 12100 
block of Ventura Boulevard, opened Aug. 21 and was held again Sept. 4 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who live nearby have complained that the market is a nuisance. 
"The residents are concerned about the type of business -- that we have a swap 
meet in Studio City," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents 
Assn. "They view it not as a positive development for the neighborhood, but as 
a detractor." 
</P>
<P>
 The market, which is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sundays, typically features as 
many as 45 vendors selling antiques, jewelry, collectibles, furniture and 
vintage clothing. Food and drinks are also sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Brahms, who lives two blocks from the bazaar, said that it has worsened 
traffic and that the market's portable toilets have attracted transients. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are cutting through side streets and not obeying stop signs," Brahms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the swap meet has the blessing of Sondra Frohlich, 
executive director of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has tremendous potential for bringing additional shoppers (to the area) 
and we certainly can use all the additional shoppers we can find," said 
Frohlich.  
</P>
<P>
 But the legal status of the Studio City Sunday Antique Swap Meet has been 
questioned. City officials said that market owner Jim Gurdine, a Santa Clarita 
businessman, has not received the necessary approvals and permits from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Marc Woersching said Gurdine must apply for a zoning variance 
because he is operating a commercial enterprise on land that is zoned for 
parking. Gurdine must also get a land-use permit and a certificate of occupancy 
from the building and safety department, according to Chief Building Inspector 
Russell Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market owner said he thought he had obtained all the required 
approvals from the city -- including a business license, tax registration 
number and police permit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gurdine said he had contacted both the planning, and building 
and safety departments, and no one had told him to apply for the other 
approvals and permits.  
</P>
<P>
 Frohlich said nearby shop owners welcome the market because of the additional 
business it brings them. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous Rucker, weekend manager at Kinko's Copy, said weekend business has 
doubled in the past two weeks, thanks in large part to the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for it -- it gives Ventura Boulevard exposure," he said. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $1.2 MILLION AWARDED FOR PARKLAND PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday allocated about $1.2 million in 
voter-approved funds for parkland acquisition and improvement to projects in 
the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The money came from Proposition A, the 2-year-old property assessment measure 
that will generate $540 million countywide.Most of the money was earmarked 
under the measure, but the supervisors have discretion over how $37 million of 
it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 community organizations and cities competed for about $10 
million of the discretionary funds this year, leaving about $27 million to be 
awarded during the next three years. The supervisors awarded about 12% of the 
funds to cities and groups in the Valley region after reviewing recommendations 
from panels that included community members. In most cases, the awards will be 
matched or augmented by non-county contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The allocations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * $40,000 for a public art mural and the installation of graffiti-resistant 
tile in the restroom at Las Palmas Park in the city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * $46,895 for graffiti prevention and removal at Apollo Park, Jackie Robinson 
Park and Everett Martin Park in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * $200,000 for the restoration and enhancement of Bull Creek in the Sepulveda 
Basin Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 * $500,000 for the acquisition of five acres and construction of a bike trail 
along the Santa Clara River in the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 * $415,152 for the acquisition of land and construction of a 1.5-mile 
multipurpose trail off Barrell Springs Road in Palmdale. TRACEY KAPLAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
RECORD NUMBER SEEK SPOT ON NEXT YEAR'S GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With recent events placing a spotlight on the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, a 
record number of people have asked to serve on the panel next year, Superior 
Court officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 663 people have asked for applications for the 1995-96 grand jury, 
according to Gloria Gomez, the court's juror services manager."It's 
unprecedented," Gomez said. "In the past, no one has requested a grand jury 
application this early in the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court officials had sought applications before a Nov. 4 deadline in 
part to increase the diversity of the 23-member panel, which will serve from 
July 1, 1995, to June 30, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury has gained unusual attention because of publicity about its 
role in high-profile cases such as those of O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be citizens and at least 18 years old and have been county 
residents for at least a year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL CLEARS WAY FOR NEEDLE SWAP PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council cleared the way Tuesday for a needle exchange program aimed 
at preventing the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 9-1 vote, the council passed a resolution endorsing Mayor Richard 
Riordan's declaration of a local emergency that allows for "responsible needle 
exchange programs" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes leadership requires things that are not popular . . . things that 
are not on our personal agendas," Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said in support 
of the controversial program. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan last week declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles to get around 
California laws barring the distribution of most types of drug paraphernalia, 
including syringes. The needle exchanges seek to reduce the transmission of HIV 
through contaminated needles, which are often shared by drug users.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; HELP SOUGHT TO CLEAN ABANDONED MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Van Nuys residents who once complained about prostitutes and drug dealing at 
the Chateau Motel will join together this weekend to spruce up the abandoned 
inn and turn it into a positive force in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The old motel is being transformed into a new one that will be used to train 
the disabled for careers in the hospitality industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 15 trainees will serve as maids, desk clerks and maintenance workers at 
the inn, located in the 6700 block of Sepulveda Boulevard. Counselors who 
provide the free training will also work at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup follows years of heated controversy over the 46-unit motel, which 
was branded a magnet for petty crime by the city earlier this year. The former 
owners closed the motel in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The empty building has now been leased to Asian Pacific Community Services, a 
nonprofit group headquartered in Westminster. The agency has operated other 
businesses to train and place more than 3,000 disabled individuals in jobs 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Catron, board president of Asian Pacific Community Services, said his 
agency will follow the conditions placed on the Chateau Motel by the city, 
including hiring a security guard, adding security cameras and improving 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also formed a Community Advisory Committee to address 
neighborhood needs and crime reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Catron said it will take at least two months and $50,000 to rehabilitate the 
property. The costs include replacing stolen televisions and air conditioners, 
converting a fire-damaged room into a storage shed and clearing the 
weed-covered entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to bring the community out," said Mary Lou Holte, founder of the 
community's local Townkeeper's Action Group. "Now that the worst is over, we 
can see a turn-around of the boulevard and this is a good example. When you 
join forces, you succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup and yard sale will be held Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Residents are asked to bring their own shovels and gloves to help clean up 
and pull weeds. For more information, contact the Townkeeper's Action Group, 
(818) 901-8342. ALICIA DOYLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; TOWN LEADERS DEBATE REDEVELOPMENT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to create a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks generated both 
support and concerns at a meeting of the Sherman Oaks Town Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they liked the fact that the redevelopment plan 
currently being drafted by the Community Redevelopment Agency appears to limit 
that agency's powers, including its ability to seize property by exercising its 
power of eminent domain. Others worried aloud about the speed at which the plan 
is being put together. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has proposed creating a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks as a way to 
raise money to rebuild the quake-damaged portions of the hard-hit community. 
The money would come from the additional property taxes in the project area the 
city would collect after the improvements were made to the area. "I think (the 
plan) will work, and I think it will be a benefit," said Barry Wegman, 
executive vice president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we keep from creating a monster that 30 years from now goes out of 
control?" asked the Rev. Allen McCallum, pastor at the First Presbyterian 
Church.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Monday night meeting, which was dominated by the discussion on 
redevelopment, council co-chairman Fred Gaines observed that both the chamber 
and the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. have formed committees on the issue and 
have been intensively studying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners committee has already met with officials from the CRA and City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's office to discuss concerns about the draft plan, 
and the two committees have met recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief of staff, said that because the area would be 
an emergency recovery area rather than a traditional redevelopment area, the 
city would appoint a Community Advisory Committee rather than hold elections 
for a Project Area Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference between the two is that members of an advisory committee do not 
have to live in the project area, as project committee members must. And while 
a project committee's decision to reject a redevelopment plan can only be 
overridden by a two-thirds majority of the City Council, an advisory committee 
does not have that power, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held at the Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center, the site 
of the council's next meeting on Oct. 10. KAY HWANGBO

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; IS THE SIMPSON CASE RELEVANT TO THE 
REST OF L.A.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though it occupies much of my time, I often wonder if the O.J. Simpson 
trial has anything to do with the rest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just a sensational celebrity murder case? Is it a tale of the lives of 
the rich and privileged who have no real connection with L.A. except as a place 
to touch down briefly for a change of clothes during their jet-setting? On the 
other hand, does the upcoming trial have anything to say about our society? 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, I discussed this point with John Mack, the longtime president 
of the Los Angeles Urban League and one of the African American community's 
most respected leaders. It turned out he, too, often questioned the Simpson 
case's importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It simply boils down to two people brutally murdered and a fellow who happens 
to have been a big celebrity," he told me. "But when you look at the 
bread-and-butter issues that need to be addressed in Crenshaw, South-Central 
and throughout Los Angeles, it's a footnote in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I replied, it was important enough for you and other African American 
community leaders to discuss it with Gil Garcetti on July 19 in one of your 
periodic meetings with the district attorney. Mack smiled, indicating that I 
had a point. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting turned out to be a noteworthy development in the Simpson story. 
Garcetti's critics cited it as evidence that the D.A. bowed to these community 
leaders, who happened to be foes of the death penalty. Instead, the district 
attorney's office is seeking life imprisonment without parole for Simpson, who 
has pleaded innocent. Mack played down the capital punishment aspect of the 
session. He said the death penalty discussion occupied just a few minutes of a 
long session. "I don't think Gil Garcetti made a decision not to go to the 
death penalty in order to appease the African American community and its 
leadership," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What I found more interesting than Mack's impressions of the meeting were his 
views on the relationship between the Simpson case and the black community. As 
we talked in his comfortable Crenshaw-area office, I could see that the subject 
was complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I have been very careful about, as have a number of my 
colleagues in leadership roles, was to avoid jumping out there and screaming 
race. . . . The feeling of most of us was that it is really a complicated 
issue," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a privileged brother . . . who had been carefully packaged and 
marketed and he was not part of the African American community. . . . It was a 
contrast to the Rodney King incident where you had a young, poverty-stricken 
African American male who had no clout of any kind, who had been jacked around 
by the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we all first heard about it, the first reaction most of us had, since 
most of us didn't know O.J., was . . . there was no way this guy could have 
done it, this great guy. But . . . we discovered he was not the wonderful, 
caring, compassionate, loving husband that his handlers had portrayed. The 
spousal abuse business is bad. Clearly what happened in 1989 when he clearly 
had badly beaten Nicole Simpson and was allowed to get away with no jail time, 
to pick his own psychiatrist . . . was clearly a case of class and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there is the nagging reality we have to deal with. Yes, there are all 
those things, but it's an undeniable reality that in Los Angeles and in 
America, whenever you have an incident where an African American man . . . is 
accused of killing two white people, especially when one of them was his 
ex-wife . . . you have all of the racial bigotry and baggage that people carry 
about interracial marriages." 
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, Mack said, "I recognize Garcetti has a job to do. I 
recognize that some of my constituents are convinced that O.J. Simpson did not 
do it, and do not want to be bothered with the evidence or the facts. I don't 
take that position. I take the position that if the evidence . . . would 
convict O.J. Simpson, then O.J. Simpson should be held accountable. " 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "I think he should receive a fair trial. It's very important 
that he not be treated above the law, but he should not be a victim of his 
celebrity status, either." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I puzzled over what Mack had said. Obviously, he did not see 
Simpson as a symbol, or his arrest as symbolic of the treatment of African 
Americans by the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he seemed to be giving a message to Garcetti, his deputies and the 
investigators: This man may not be part of our community. He abused his wife. 
He's not a role model. But the criminal justice system has treated African 
Americans badly. Blacks, rich and poor, have been abused. So we'll be watching 
to make sure he gets a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, that may be the importance of the Simpson case. It is not about 
race so much as notoriety and the media and the public's obsession with all the 
details. The real question is whether L.A.'s strained criminal justice system 
can operate fairly under such extraordinary circumstances.

SCHOOL REQUIRES PUBLIC SERVICE FOR GRADUATION; EDUCATION: CHATSWORTH HIGH IS 
THE FIRST IN THE COUNTY TO SET UP SUCH A PROGRAM. BACKERS SAY STUDENTS WILL BE 
HELPING PEOPLE WHILE EXPLORING CAREER POSSIBILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Beginning this semester, Chatsworth High School students will be required to 
do community service work to earn their diplomas, making the school the first 
in Los Angeles County to adopt such a graduation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student in grades 9, 10 and 11 must complete 20 hours of community 
service before finishing finish high school or face the possibility of not 
graduating. This year's senior class will have to perform 10 hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school tested the program on its senior class, with 90% of the 
students participating in projects ranging from volunteer work with local 
politicians to planting trees at the new Metrolink station in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the requirement came from the School Based Management Team -- 
committees of parents, teachers and school officials that guide policy -- at 
Chatsworth High. Members decided to phase in the community service requirement 
to bolster students' awareness and pride in their neighborhood, said Chatsworth 
Principal Donna Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth High is the only school in the county to impose such a requirement, 
said county education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets kids to appreciate their community and how they can give back to 
the community," said Smith, who added that the volunteer program allows 
students to explore career possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the logistics of implementing and enforcing the new policy have yet to 
be fully fleshed out, students will be asked to present signed letters to 
school officials proving that they did their community service work. 
</P>
<P>
 All volunteer service must be done after school hours or on weekends, and no 
academic credit will be given, said Ed Burke, a government teacher and a 
coordinator of last year's senior volun teer program. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can participate in programs already approved by the school or come up 
with their own plans. Some students have already expressed interest in upcoming 
community events, Burke said, such as an AIDS march at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud (Chatsworth High School's) efforts. All high school students should 
have this type of experience," said Los Angeles Board of Education member Julie 
Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the community service requirement were sown eight years ago when 
Korenstein set up a voluntary exploratory development program at Chatsworth 
High in which students could do 90 hours of volunteer work to earn school 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bridge between being a young, inexperienced teen-ager and the 
transition into the work force," Korenstein said. Although the students are not 
paid for their work, they can list their efforts as work experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the first day of school, 17-year-old Willy Leon, a Chatsworth High 
junior, said he did not know about the new policy. But he said it is "a pretty 
good idea." Willy said he would be most interested in doing volunteer work at 
the school itself. 
</P>
<P>
 While a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District school board, Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg proposed a districtwide community 
service requirement. Her proposal was not approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were afraid that the record-keeping would be so enormous that it would 
not be possible," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I would love to see all the schools individually do this. . . . The 
value of it is hard to deny. Everybody runs about saying how alienated youth 
are. Of course they are. They're not connected. By serving lunches and helping 
out at a child care center, those kids will feel very different about 
themselves."

 Some Culver City residents have demanded that the city's Police Department 
rescind its hiring of Timothy Wind, the former Los Angeles police officer who 
was acquitted of state and federal charges stemming from the Rodney G. King 
beating but was dismissed from the LAPD because of his role in it. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad-hoc group told the City Council that the hiring last month of Wind -- 
who is performing mainly clerical duties as an unsworn community service 
officer -- made it appear that the city was insensitive to the issues raised by 
the King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a videotape of the incident at the council's Monday meeting, group 
members pointed out Wind's participation and said they were concerned that the 
same thing might happen in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has suggested that the city create a civilian review board to 
oversee decisions made by Police Chief Ted Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind and Cooke have declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Edward Wolkowitz said the fact that Wind was brought to trial was 
not a reason to deny him a job. Wind's dismissal from the LAPD had more to do 
with politics than with his performance, Wolkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Tim Wind was found innocent twice doesn't seem to matter," 
Wolkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads, including the police chief, do not have to consult with the 
council before hiring personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The council signs off on civilian appointments about once a month, and Wind is 
scheduled to be considered in October. The council generally treats the vote as 
a formality, but it could halt an appointment, City Clerk Thomas Crunk said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PARKING KEY TO FASHION CENTER REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A dying Glendale outdoor mall may be brought back to life with a multiscreen 
theater, a gourmet supermarket, a major electronics retailer and even a modern 
video and music store. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mall's rejuvenation may depend on how soon the city can rebuild a 
municipal parking structure next door, which crumbled in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners of the Glendale Fashion Center want to proceed with a 
redevelopment plan conceived by the mall's previous owners, who lost the 
property in bankruptcy court earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is concern that several businesses that were interested in the 
new Centrium shopping center before the Jan. 17 quake will begin looking 
elsewhere if the project doesn't get off the ground soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very anxious to expedite this project and get the Fashion Center up 
and running as fast as we can, and we realize the importance of that parking 
structure in terms of keeping potential tenants," Glendale Assistant City 
Manager Bob McFall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the mid-1960s, the center once was a thriving retail spot, with a 
two-level Robinson's department store and about two dozen specialty stores. 
Today, there is a Sportmart store flanked by a candy shop, a coffee shop, 
Clothestime and a few others, but many stores are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-scale rebuilding of the mall -- estimated to cost about $20 million -- 
was scheduled to begin this year. It included a Pavilions market, eight-screen 
cinema, a reconfiguration of the parking lot and the addition of new stores. 
The Glendale City Council approved the project in 1992 and extended the mall's 
lease on the city-owned garage next door for another 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the mall was owned by a Minneapolis-based investment group. 
But when the parking structure pancaked, the group was forced to forfeit the 
property to Balcor Financial, an Illinois subsidiary of American Express Corp. 
that held the second trust deed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay has been a boon of sorts for one mall tenant. A popular 
Western-style nightclub called In Cahoots was scheduled to be one of the first 
buildings razed when reconstruction of the mall began. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Kahwajian, a consultant to Balcor, said the new owners now hope to have 
the mall finished and open by Christmas, 1995. He said interest in the center 
is strong, and among the retailers that have inquired about the mall are the 
Good Guys, Tower Records, Barnes & Noble books and Blockbuster Music.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the construction delay has actually "opened up new possibilities" for 
different stores to lease space in the new mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "This center right now probably generates less than $100,000 in sales tax 
revenue per year," Kahwajian said. "Under this renovation, we're going to boost 
that up to about $700,000 per year. You can buy a few police officers and 
firetrucks with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kahwajian said the design of the shopping center might change slightly from 
what the previous owners envisioned. A final design won't be selected until the 
city decides on the size of the rebuilt parking structure at the corner of 
Isabel Street and Wilson Avenue. City officials said they are not sure when 
construction on the garage will begin, although they are confident the garage 
will be ready for the mall's scheduled opening. A firm has been hired to create 
designs for the structure that would provide more spaces and make it more 
compatible with the mall, yet occupy the same amount of space as the old 
structure. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; NEW DRAFT PLAN MAY CLARIFY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas officials hope that a revised draft of the city's first-ever general 
plan will end months of controversy over how much development should be allowed 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting there," said Planning Commissioner Dave Brown. "I think 
we improved it a great deal, and it still reflects what the community would 
like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas General Plan/Agenda for the 21st Century is expected to be 
available for public review this week, said Community Development Director 
Steve Harris. Copies of that, as well as copies of a revised environmental 
impact review, will be available at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a public workshop on the plan on Sept. 26 at 7:30 p.m. in the 
council chambers at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Housing and Community Development Department must approve the 
housing component of the plan, Harris said. The City Council could take action 
on the plan as early as January. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which incorporated in 1991, began work on the plan in the fall of 
1992, Harris said. A citizens advisory committee worked on the project until 
January of this year, attempting to iron out issues such as what limits should 
be placed on the number of homes built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The new draft allows for 900 more homes than was originally allowed, for a 
total of 2,400 new homes in the next 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The revisions were made, according to city officials, after several landowners 
argued that the original draft was unfair. "I would say we are going to try to 
do what's fair," Brown said. "A lot of these people have owned this land for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also takes into account the danger of developing near hilltops and in 
other areas where landslides could endanger lives and property. It requires 
additional grading and construction reinforcements in areas prone to 
landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would provide a significant obstacle to Ahmanson Land Co., which 
wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square feet of 
commercial space in the hills southeast of Simi Valley on the border of Los 
Angeles County. It would prohibit widening of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and the 
extension of Las Virgenes Road to the county line, two key components in 
Ahmanson's traffic plan for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is not so cut and dried, however, when it comes to the controversial 
proposed Calabasas Park Centre. While suggesting the site, at the corner of 
Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas, is ideal for a mixed-use project, it 
makes no mention of an acceptable scale. 
</P>
<P>
 It says only that the overall purpose of the plan for downtown is to 
"re-create the character of the traditional small downtown within this area, 
emphasizing the area's function as a community gathering place." 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Rosenquist, who was on the committee that formed the original draft, 
said Monday that he opposes the removal of language that would have limited 
traffic congestion and the size of the Park Centre project. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; HIGHER WATER RATES RECEIVE TENTATIVE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District has given its tentative approval to 
a proposal to increase customers' rates by an average of 7% to make up for the 
district's declining revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a second reading and final vote on the increase Sept. 26 at 7 
p.m. at district headquarters, said Bobbe Wymer, spokeswoman for the district. 
The board is expected to give final approval then. 
</P>
<P>
 No one spoke in opposition to the proposal on Monday during a public hearing 
before the vote, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average customer would pay about $51.48 a year extra if the proposal is 
approved, Wymer said. Customers would see the change on their Nov. 1 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people realize that we have been so financially responsible," Wymer 
said. "This very small increase, I think, people are willing to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would help fund the district's $34.3-million operating budget for 
fiscal 1994-95, which has already been approved, she said. Some customers would 
be charged "slightly" higher percentage increases than others, depending on 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would be the third in as many years. During the 1993-94 fiscal 
year, the district increased rates for residential customers $2.75 a month for 
water and $3 a month for sanitation. In fiscal 1992-93, the agency increased 
rates by $3.36 per month for water. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's revenues have dropped over the past few years due to the 
decline in construction, Wymer said. Over the past three years, the district 
has lost $1 million annually in new connection fees. Previously the connections 
brought in $9 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the district still has to fund repairs, maintenance and 
other costs, she said. It has also undertaken several ambitious projects, 
including the $50-million Rancho Las Virgenes Composting Facility, which 
officially opens this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Eaton, a candidate this year for the Board of Directors, Division 2, 
said just because no one spoke against the increase at this week's meeting does 
not mean there is no opposition to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just very busy, and they don't have time to go to these meetings," 
said Eaton, who attended the session but did not speak. "But they are going to 
be surprised when their rates increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton also wondered aloud whether the district wants to increase customers' 
rates because it needs a way to repay $60 million it borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Dynda of Agoura Hills, president of United Organizations of Taxpayers, a 
Los Angeles-based taxpayers watchdog group, said homeowners in many communities 
will be hard-pressed to afford any increases in utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, for example, a 4% tax on utilities was levied for the first 
time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start adding all these things up compared to what the base was and you're 
getting a substantial tax increase," Dynda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynda has argued in the past that existing customers should not have to pay 
any increases because they have already paid their connection fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wymer said the district made budget cuts, instituted a hiring freeze and has 
put off some capital improvement projects.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, each department trimmed its budget by 20 percent and the district 
skipped pay raises for many non-union employees that were due in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency serves about 60,000 people -- or about 18,000 households -- in 
Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village and several 
unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County. FRANK MANNING

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN DRAWS HEAVY CRITICISM; MEETING: AGENCY IS ACCUSED OF USING 
FUNDS ON LARGE COMMERCIAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE LITTLE BENEFIT FOR AVERAGE 
RESIDENTS.

 A proposed five-year redevelopment plan for North Hollywood drew heavy 
criticism from residents at a public meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood Redevelopment Project, proposed by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency, would include $6.9 million for economic development 
projects and another $3.1 million for rehabilitating housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the approximately 100 people who attended the hearing of CRA board 
commissioners at St. David's Episcopal Church on Magnolia Boulevard showered 
criticism on the redevelopment agency, accusing it of channeling taxpayer 
dollars to large commercial projects that would provide little benefit to the 
average resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, replace the five-year plan with a five-day plan," said John Walsh, a 
North Hollywood resident. "Get out of here by Sunday! This plan is about the 
transference of wealth from small property owners to large property owners." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Fiedler, one of seven CRA commissioners, said during the meeting that 
the agency, which began work in 1979 in North Hollywood, "has not made a level 
of improvement that is reasonable after these years. Overwhelmingly, in terms 
of the number of people here, there seems to be opposition to this plan." 
</P>
<P>
 As speaker after speaker took the podium to oppose spending more money for 
redevelopment, resident Ann Hoyt stood at one side of the room, encouraging 
them to help her prepare a map that would show the extent of opposition to the 
redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want your property taken out of the special district?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After making their statements, many residents marched to a map of the 
redevelopment district leaning against the wall and told Hoyt to mark their 
property in red ink, to show that they do not want to be included in the 
redevelopment district's program. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood CRA has spent $77 million so far, not including debt 
service, and the agency is now seeking alternative sources of funding. Agency 
officials have said that four years into the next five-year plan, they will 
very likely have no money for new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But funds to pay off the plan's debts would come from projects already under 
way, according to agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the goals of the five-year plan include widening streets and helping 
homeowners remodel or renovate earthquake-damaged houses. The plan also 
envisions building 78 new residences in a 750-acre redevelopment project.

COUNTY APPROVES 110 HOUSES IN CALABASAS AREA; DEVELOPMENT: PROJECT ON 500 ACRES 
ALONG LAS VIRGENES ROAD WILL INCLUDE 4.5-ACRE COMMERCIAL PROJECT, 400 ACRES OF 
OPEN SPACE AND NO FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Capping eight years of debate, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday approved a controversial housing project near Calabasas at a fraction 
of its original size and gave up on extending an unpopular four-lane highway 
through the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The board granted the developer of the Malibu Terrace project permission to 
build a 4.5-acre commercial project and 110 houses in the sensitive ecological 
area along Las Virgenes Road north of the Ventura Freeway -- less than 
one-tenth of the 1,816 houses originally proposed in 1986. The supervisors also 
designated 400 acres of the 500-acre property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The board dropped plans to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard about a mile east 
through the property over the objections of the county's road department, which 
recommended building the road as the first step toward creating a vital 
alternative to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents the area, successfully argued that the 
remaining four miles of the extension would never be completed because of 
opposition from nearby residents, the city of Calabasas and the National Park 
Service, which owns the contiguous Cheeseboro Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our road people, God love them, see roads and just can't live without them," 
Edelman said. "But the problem is this road won't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of the road, the supervisors ordered Las Virgenes Properties to pay 
the county $600,000 for regional transportation improvements, such as bridge 
widening and traffic signal installation. John Vidovich, a partner in the 
development firm, objected to the fee, saying the company had already agreed to 
pay almost $500,000 in other traffic fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Vidovich said he was relieved the project had finally been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to celebrate by being nice to my wife," Vidovich said. "We've only 
been married 10 years and I've been working on this project the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution of the long-debated issue also pleased Calabasas officials, who 
argued that extending Thousand Oaks Boulevard would generate traffic and induce 
growth in their 3-year-old city. Calabasas incorporated in 1991, largely out of 
displeasure with the county's planning policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Weisbrock, director of the environmental group Save Open Space, said 
the project will destroy the Palo Comado Significant Ecological Area -- one of 
61 areas designated for protection by the county in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisbrock also said the board should have required the developer to donate the 
open space to a public agency, as Edelman initially proposed. Instead, the 
board simply designated it as open space, effectively allowing the developer to 
try to sell or lease it to a parks agency or other public entity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board said that if the developer does decide to donate the land, 
it must be given to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the National Parks 
Service or the county.

VALLEY BRIEFING: CONTROLLED BURNS; THE PRESCRIPTION FOR FIGHTING FIRE DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controlled burning of wildland brush is often misunderstood by present-day 
Southern Californians, who can't see past the smoke it creates and the land it 
blackens. Native Americans burned land to improve hunting, create travel routes 
and rejuvenate succulent vegetation.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters today closely-monitored prescribed burns to renew plant growth, 
enhance wildlife and prevent huge fires. Prescribed burns also are used to 
train firefighters and study fire behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department currently has 13 sites that are under 
study for controlled burns. But because of weather restrictions, only eight 
burns have been conducted this year-all on a site in the Santa Clarita 
Valley-totaling a mere 100 acres. More than a dozen controlled burn days have 
been cancelled because of high temperatures and / or low humidity, a dangerous 
combination for keeping a fire under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlled burn specialist Don Pierpont, a county fire battalion chief, calls 
the burns complex, "choreographed" events. They require months of detailed 
planning. Each controlled burn project ha its own "prescription" listing ideal 
conditions for burning and a burn plan detailing how the burn will be 
conducted. From Proposal to Action Recommendations for a controlled burning 
site come from area fire stations, as well as residents. Then the site must get 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Area homeowners are sent a map drawn by fire department vegetation management 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental impact studies are done to ensure the safety of endangered or 
threatened species, and archaeological research determines the existence of any 
important areas such as ancient burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials then write a "burn plan" detailing how the burn will be done -- 
including the number of acres to be burned and personnel needed. Final approval 
comes from the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn contract is good for three years -- a controlled burn can occur there 
within that time, dependent on the right conditions. Preparing A Burn Site 
</P>
<P>
 Containment lines are cut by hand crews or bulldozed  
</P>
<P>
 Samples of vegetation are taken and analyzed for moisture content  
</P>
<P>
 IDEAL CONDITIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Once a burn plan is OK'd, fire officials must wait for a window of opportunity 
when weather and vegetation conditions are optimal for burning. High 
temperature and wind, coupled with low humidity can cause a fire to get out of 
control. The best times for controlled burns are in the spring and immediately 
after winter rains.  
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature: 70-75 degrees 
</P>
<P>
 * Wind: 7-10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 * Humidity: 35% 
</P>
<P>
 * Fuel moisture: 90% The Day of A Burn 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-planning: The fire department obtains the following day's weather and air 
quality forecasts. If acceptable, all divisions involved are notified, as well 
as area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 7 a.m.: Supervisors meet to review plan, go over topographical maps. Spot 
forecast is obtained from weather service. Weather balloon is launched and 
tracked to determine wind speed. Small corner of area is ignited to test how it 
will burn. 
</P>
<P>
 9 a.m.-noon: Various sections of burn area are lighted in sequence.  
</P>
<P>
 Noon-5 p.m.: Fire is allowed to burn within limits -- usually 30-foot flame 
lengths. Smolders are doused by engines or helicopters to prevent spot fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight: Several firefighters keep watch to make sure embers don't start 
spot fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Next day: Two crews put out any remaining smolders. 
</P>
<P>
 Before and during burn, weather balloons are released and tracked to determine 
wind speed and direction of smoke. * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting Headfires Once backfire has burned about 150 feet, smaller headfires 
are set, which are pushed by wind to meet main backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling the Direction Firefighters armed with hand tools are stationed at 
fire's perimeter to keep fire from jumping prescribed line. Engines are nearby 
in case fire jumps containment line. * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting A Backfire A backfire is set downwind from a firebreak such as a road 
or creek. It is intended to burn slowly and creates a "blackline" at which 
headfires will stop.

 Fires are started using drip torches-the principal method-a canister from 
which gasoline is squirted; terra torches, which shoot flaming gel up to 100 
feet; helitorches, aerialtanks attached to helicopters that pump jelled gas 
from the air; or small plastic balls filled with a flammable substance dropped 
from helicopters.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WELCOME MAT IS PULLED BACK FOR MOBILE HOME; 
DISPUTE: RESIDENTS CALL A TRAILER MOVED ONTO A VACANT LOT AN EYESORE. BUT CAROL 
WISE HOPES TO STICK IT OUT AND RENOVATE THE QUAKE-DAMAGED RESIDENCE.

 To Carol Wise, the triple-wide mobile home she moved to an empty lot in Saugus 
is her dream house, but to neighbors in more expensive housing, it is an 
eyesore they want hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise moved the mobile home, damaged by the Northridge earthquake, from the 
Greenbriar Mobilhome Park in Canyon Country into a quiet neighborhood last 
week. She said she plans extensive renovations so it will blend in with 
surrounding custom-built residences, including a two-car garage, a covered 
porch, landscaping and new windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home is unoccupied while the work is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly don't feel it will be identifiable as anything but a house," the 
high school teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But petitions bearing more than 100 signatures were presented to the Santa 
Clarita City Council Tuesday night, asking that the council order the 
15-year-old mobile home removed from the lot on Barbacoa Drive. A group of four 
residents told council members the mobile home is "extremely decrepit."  
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of our homes in the area are quite lovely," said Connie Clift, a 
26-year resident of the area. "This mobile home certainly does not fit into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wise put the mobile home on a lot she owns, one of four that have been vacant 
since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake leveled houses on the lots. Residents said 
they worry other mobile home owners might also try to move onto the lots, 
lowering the area's property values. 
</P>
<P>
 They protested that city officials have stated that no cosmetic changes are 
required for it to meet building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Rich Henderson said the mobile home will meet city building and 
planning codes once additions such as a proper foundation and the enclosed 
garage are built, and all required construction permits have already been 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits the city from discriminating against modular homes if they 
meet zoning requirements, Henderson added. 
</P>
<P>
 A violation of the law would have to be found for the city to be able to stop 
the work in progress, City Atty. Carl Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members were cheered and applauded by about two dozen homeowners 
in the audience when the officials indicated a willingness to challenge Wise's 
relocation plans. The council unanimously ordered city planning staff members 
to study regulations for the area, and determine if the soil on the lot is 
sufficiently stable to support the mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will be discussed at the council's Sept. 27 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jan Heidt said the city has spent years providing mobile home 
owners with enclosed areas to live, and allowing them to place mobile homes 
among more conventional houses is "an invasion of property rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "That a mobile home could be placed in a residential neighborhood . . . I 
can't believe it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise appeared surprised at the opposition, saying, "I didn't think they'd be 
thrilled, but I didn't expect this kind of community action." But she said she 
has no plans to abandon the site.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TAKERS OF $45,000 TRAILER YIELD TO SWEET 
TEMPTATION 
</P>

<P>
 The culprits who stole a $45,000 tractor-trailer that had been detached from 
the cab of a big rig proved that they are not above smaller temptations as well 
by grabbing a handful of snack food worth about $5 from another trailer parked 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves broke into a locked trailer containing about 20,000 pounds of 
fruit roll-ups, but apparently didn't think the entire cargo was valuable 
enough to steal, authorities said.Instead, the suspects grabbed a few snacks 
and made off with the other trailer, apparently without looking inside. 
</P>
<P>
 But they may have been better off stealing the fruit roll-ups. At least, 
that's what Robert Schmache, the driver of the missing trailer, believes. He 
said his cargo, 44,000 pounds of steel wire, has no practical street value. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they open the trailer, the joke's going to be on them because they won't 
be able to do anything with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmache said he left his trailer at the intersection of The Old Road and 
Sedonia Lane, a location he has used without incident for the last five years, 
at about 4 p.m. Friday before going to his Val Verde home. His father, also 
named Robert, left the other trailer nearby about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the thefts were discovered at about 11:30 a.m. Sunday. The 53-foot 
trailer was worth $45,000, and the rolls of steel wire inside about $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer containing the wire is still missing, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TRY TO STOP ARBOR PARK 
CONDOS; DEVELOPMENT: COUNTY PANEL APPROVED THE VALENCIA PROJECT ON 20 ACRES OF 
FLOOD CONTROL PLAIN LAST MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two environmental groups have appealed the preliminary county approval of a 
195-unit condominium project along a tributary of the Santa Clara River because 
they claim that the residences could be subject to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission gave unanimous approval 
last month to the first phase of the Arbor Park project, which would place the 
condominiums on 20 acres of flood control plain next to Bouquet Creek in 
Valencia.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the project Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But the condos will be subject to flooding because of the development's 
proximity to the river, said Lynn Plambeck, vice president for the Santa 
Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment (SCOPE).  
</P>
<P>
 Flood control measures that narrow the river will speed it up, causing 
flooding, reducing ground water supplies and eroding downstream property, 
Plambeck said. In addition, she said, the project appears to be above an 
earthquake fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Plambeck said the housing project is relatively small, but she noted that 
commercial development and other projects also are planned for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to address the cumulative impact of various projects," she said. "If 
we allow one project to go in, they will continue to do projects in the flood 
plain." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal, filed last week by SCOPE and Friends of the Santa Clara River, is 
necessary so that the Board of Supervisors will review the project in detail, 
Plambeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Bouquet Creek has been lined with concrete during the past three years 
by the developer, Newhall Land and Farming Co., as part of a flood control 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said the process, called channelizing, 
has nothing to do with Arbor Park: it is for an already approved commercial 
project nearby and to protect a bridge near Newhall Ranch Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottoms of Bouquet Creek and the Santa Clara River are not paved, she 
added. In addition, Lauffer said, large boulders known as "rip rap" are being 
placed at the bottom of the river to slow down the velocity of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauffer said studies by the county and other government agencies have not 
revealed a fault line under the property. She said a fault line is nearby, but 
in that regard, the property "is not that much different than most of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the project could be completed by the fall of 1995, with an 
additional 55 units planned at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
 Plambeck said the appeal is focusing on the condominium project because "once 
they go in it's impossible to design any other way for flood control measures 
for the river." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies indicate the condominiums will be safe from flooding, Lauffer said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Plambeck said other supposedly "safe" flood channels have failed. "You 
really can't control a river," she said. "It's nice and we think we can control 
it, but rivers don't always do what we expect them to do."

PANEL URGES SAN DIEGO JUDGE'S OUSTER; COURTS: JURIST, ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING 
GIFTS FROM LAWYERS APPEARING BEFORE HIM, VOWS TO FIGHT WATCHDOG AGENCY'S 
RECOMMENDATION. HE SAYS ACTION IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge vowed Tuesday to fight a watchdog agency's recommendation to remove 
him from office for accepting gifts from attorneys and others appearing in his 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Commission on Judicial Performance, in a rare action, 
recommended to the state Supreme Court that Superior Court Judge G. Dennis 
Adams, 53, be removed from office for inappropriate conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams has 30 days to petition the Supreme Court to reject the recommendation. 
He said Tuesday that is exactly what he intends to do to save the seat he has 
held since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the judge acknowledged that he had "used poor judgment in 
(his) relationships with some lawyers and a litigant who had received a 
favorable decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said a special panel of the watchdog agency previously found that he 
did not act with "evil motive, and certainly not for financial gain," and that 
gifts had not influenced his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I truly regret some of my past actions, my conduct does not warrant my 
removal," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he suggested, the watchdog agency is motivated by political concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears I am being sacrificed by the commission so it can justify its 
existence to a very critical Legislature," Adams contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is the first judge recommended for removal by the commission since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That record, and the secrecy under which the commission operates, were cited 
by critics who have placed a measure on the November ballot. It would replace 
the current nine-member commission, which includes five judges, with an 
11-member commission that would include six representatives of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would require all proceedings to be open after formal 
accusations are filed against a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would give the commission power to adopt ethical standards for judges 
and to remove judges on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court will hold oral arguments in the Adams case after the 
judge files his appeal. He is suspended from his job with pay for now, forcing 
him to declare a mistrial in a civil case he had been hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial commission's chief attorney, Victoria B. Henley, had no further 
comment on the Adams case Tuesday except to say the commission had recommended 
his removal because of "willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to 
the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission charges that Adams: 
</P>
<P>
 * Accepted gifts from a car dealer and his attorney three years after awarding 
the dealer $5 million in a non-jury civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gave the attorney legal advice on cases being heard by other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Failed to disclose gifts he had accepted from other attorneys who had 
appeared in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gave misleading or inaccurate answers to questions from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in late 1991, when the commission began investigating six San 
Diego judges for allegedly failing to disclose gifts from attorneys who later 
appeared in their courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Adams' case, a three-judge special panel heard 17 days of testimony in 
closed-door hearings in San Diego in October and November. Its report to the 
entire commission found that Adams was not guilty of willful misconduct, but 
was guilty of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other five judges' cases, four were given minor disciplines. The fifth, 
Judge Michael Greer, resigned from office last year with misconduct charges 
pending against him.

MIKE PENNER: RAMS WILL ONLY LOOK THE PART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Rison was smart enough to know when to pick his spot, and so are the 
Rams, proving to be fast learners if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, you've probably heard the teaser: This Sunday, the Rams will look like 
champions when they play the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course they will. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow jerseys with royal blue block numbers and arm stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 White pants with gold and blue piping down each leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Solid blue stockings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what the Rams wore the year they brought the NFL championship back to 
Los Angeles, the now mythic 1951 season. These were the uniforms Bob 
Waterfield, Tank Younger and Elroy Hirsch made famous, once upon a time, and if 
you're too young to remember them -- everybody under 45 qualifies -- the Rams 
are bringing them back the next two weeks in the hope that dressing for success 
might be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are doing this in accordance with the NFL's "Throwbacks Weekend" 
promotion, a fine idea I'd assumed the No Fun League was no longer capable of 
making. This weekend, every team in the league wears a uniform from yesteryear, 
and some of them are true classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers will wear their 1933 "rugby shirts" -- black and gold 
vertical stripes with a castle-topped coat of arms on the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers dig out their Lance Alworth specials -- powder blue 
jerseys and white helmets with gold lightning bolts that debuted in 1961 and, 
if there's any justice, ought to replace the team's sad Ram-wanna-be outfits on 
a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers will oppose the Rams in their 1955 suits -- silver helmets, red 
shirts and nifty three-D effect numerals that immediately conjure images of 
giant-finned autos, ceramic diner counters and Hugh McElhenny alone in the open 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' throwbacks are golden oldies, too, reminders of a time when the Rams 
were the boldest team around, instead of the one that runs Jerome Bettis up the 
middle three times from the one and then botches the take-the-safe-route field 
goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Who else in the NFL had the audacity to wear yellow jerseys on Sunday? The 
Rams of 1951 may have looked like banana splits, but with Waterfield and Norm 
Van Brocklin cranking up 54-14 and 48-21 victories, no one seemed to laugh 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love 'em," says Mickey Dukich, the Rams' director of video operation for 
the past 39 years. "It was sad to give them up. They were unique, distinctive. 
Very clean-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave them up in 1957 because television, in an ominous sign of things 
to come, ordered them to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The games were broadcast in black and white then," Dukich says, "and the gold 
came out as gray on TV sets. It conflicted with white jerseys and light blue 
jerseys, like the ones the Detroit Lions wore. Television wanted more of a 
contrast." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams switched to blue and white, but "not without a struggle," according 
to Dukich. "Dan Reeves, who owned the Rams then, told our equipment manager, 
Bill Granholm, to try to find a gold or a yellow that come across as white, or 
near it, when it was photographed in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill went through a lot of different shades, but none of them worked until he 
found a light-colored yellow with blue on it. We went to the Coliseum one 
afternoon, he'd model it on the field and I'd shoot it from the top of the 
stadium. Sure enough, it came out white on the film. We were told we'd be able 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then Dan Reeves asked Bill the name of the color. 'Buttercup yellow,' 
Bill told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That did it. Mr. Reeves said, 'No way, I'm not going to let the reporters 
know my team plays in buttercup yellow.' It was back to blue and white after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams remained in blue and white throughout the '60s and into the '70s, 
until Carroll Rosenbloom bought the team in 1973 and introduced the basic 
design the Rams wear today. The Rams had some outstanding moments in those 
"ambulance whites" -- Roman Gabriel, Dick Bass and Deacon Jones made their 
names in them -- and the 1967 version was one of the two finalists the Rams 
considered as their "Throwbacks" uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Mrs. Frontiere's decision," says Todd Hewitt, Ram equipment manager. 
"The '67 uniform would've been fun, with the white horns on the helmet. But 
Mrs. Frontiere wanted to go with the '51s, because it was the year we won the 
championship and it brings to mind so many great players. And, she liked the 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams intend to wear the yellow '51s twice, this Sunday and next, and it is 
Hewitt's responsibility to have them ready. He was a little nervous last week 
when the jerseys arrived with white cuffs and sleeves -- the '51s were all 
yellow -- and some of the linemen's jerseys had the wrong shoulder material. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt had to send them back and hope a rush order for the correct models 
would arrive by Monday. They did, and were in the shop Tuesday being stitched 
with names and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not authentic '51s, Hewitt confesses. First of all, no long sleeves. 
"With all the grabbing that goes on now," Hewitt says, "a Sean Gilbert or a 
Jackie Slater is not going to play in long sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
 And no nylon dureen, the heavy material that made the '51 jersey feel "like an 
old blanket when it got wet," according to Hewitt. The new yellows are 
lightweight nylon mesh, cooler and more comfortable. Nostalgia has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 And what say those who will be seen in public wearing them Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "When the players first saw the jerseys, they said, 'Aw, we gotta wear those 
?" Hewitt says, laughing. "But then they saw the white pants and they said, 
'Oh, those are pretty cool.' I think they thought they were going to have to 
wear gold pants, too. That would have been a little too much." 
</P>
<P>
 If they were good enough for Deacon Dan Towler, they ought to be good enough 
for Tim Lester. If it sets back fashion 43 years but brings the football with 
it, it's a trade the Rams should make and stick with.

NO REST IN SIGHT FOR RAMS' ISRAEL; FOOTBALL: ONE WEEK AFTER PLAYING AGAINST 
ANDRE RISON, CORNERBACK MUST FACE JERRY RICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Steve Israel emerged from the Ram locker room Monday afternoon, 
raised his arms in frustration and shot questions back at reporters in defense 
of his pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else do you guys want to know?" he said. "Yes, we lost to Atlanta. Yes, 
Andre Rison caught some balls against me. Yes, my technique was bad. What else 
is there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, this week, it's San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice, the NFL's career 
touchdown leader who has tortured the Rams with highlight reel catches over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Israel for real? Rison toyed with him Sunday, beating him on short 
sideline routes, then taking him downfield on his way to 12 catches for 123 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison used that performance in his argument that he's one of the NFL's best 
receivers. But Israel has the task this week of covering perhaps the best in 
Rice, who caught eight passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns at Anaheim 
Stadium last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say I pout and just keep thinking about Sunday," Israel said. "Sure, 
I'm upset about it, I'm a professional, just like Andre is. I'm hired on by the 
Rams to cover guys, no matter who it is -- Rison or some rookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration has clearly set in with Israel, a 1992 second-round draft pick 
from Pittsburgh who will start only his 16th NFL game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A pulled thigh muscle forced him to miss a couple weeks of training camp, and 
he and cornerback Todd Lyght were beaten regularly during an 0-4 Ram exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed in my progress," he said. "This was by far my best 
off-season of conditioning and preparation I've had since I've been in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in here like, 'This is my year.' It's only the second week of the 
season and things haven't started like I've wanted them to, but there's no 
reason to take down the tent and pack up now." 
</P>
<P>
 His season so far: 
</P>
<P>
 Week 1 -- In the fourth quarter, Arizona wide receiver Ricky Proehl beats 
Israel by two steps down the left sideline, but Proehl drops a sure 58-yard 
touchdown pass. Rams win, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 2 -- Rison guarantees victory over the Rams, then lines up against 
Israel, who was in man-to-man coverage at least 60% of the time. Rison makes 
Israel look like Robert Bailey, catching two touchdown passes against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams lose, 31-13, and afterward Rison says: "I guess my performance against 
No. 31 (Israel) shows what I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre Rison is one of the best," Israel said. "I said it before the game, I 
said it after the game. I'm happy I get a chance to go against him again (Oct. 
2) to prove that I'm better than what I showed on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox announcers Joe Buck and Tim Green, who worked the Rams-Falcons game, 
regularly defended Israel's coverage, saying it was as good a job as anyone 
could do against a receiver as physical as Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 Former All-Pro wide receiver James Lofton, a former Ram who watched the game 
from the press box, wondered if there was a cornerback in the league who could 
stop Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox wasn't pointing a finger at Israel after the game, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things that go into pass defense," Knox said. "The formula 
is rush plus coverage. You have to have both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rison caught 14 passes against Detroit the week before, and it wasn't because 
Detroit didn't know who he was. You try to defense him, but he gets his 
catches. It's tough for any corner out there. But you just keep battling and 
battling. There's nothing else you can do. You just go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defensive line sacked Arizona quarterback Steve Beuerlein four times 
for 30 yards in the season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 But Falcon quarterback Jeff George's three-step drop and quick release 
prevented the Rams from getting a sack or even a heavy pass rush. That left 
Israel and Lyght as easy pickings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it wasn't just Andre Rison vs. Steve Israel out there," Israel said. 
"You're right, you do need a pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I'm on coverage, and taking care of my job like I'm supposed to be, 
then there's no need to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used as many as six defensive backs on certain downs against Atlanta, 
but Israel was often left one-on-one with Rison, with little or no help.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had an excellent game plan," Israel said. "The coaches had all the correct 
calls. A lot of the calls I was in place, and you didn't see the times when I 
was in coverage and they didn't throw the ball. You just see the ones where he 
(Rison) made plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult positions in the 
league. You're not rewarded if you're on coverage and they don't throw. You're 
only rewarded if it's a big-time play and you knock the ball down or make an 
interception. That's it. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 With the rewards few and far between, has Israel's confidence been shaken? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing I told myself I would never do," he said. "You can't lose 
confidence in yourself at this level, and certainly not at my position. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do, you're shot."

AT 18, HE FIGHTS FOR A JOB; KINGS' ROOKIE JOHNSON MAKES EARLY IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enforcer Stu Grimson of the Mighty Ducks was flat on his back on the training 
table, one ice pack on his knee and another on his eye after an exhibition game 
against the Kings on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone would have thought he had run up against the Kings' Marty McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wounds weren't the work of McSorley -- or any other established NHL 
heavyweight. A reporter gave Grimson some information about his newest foe, 
saying: "He's 18." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is?" Grimson said in a hushed tone. 
</P>
<P>
 He is King rookie forward Matt Johnson, who is defined by his coaches and 
teammates by one word -- huge. But the 6-foot-5, 230-pounder isn't particularly 
awed by his own size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 6-5 when I was 15," Johnson said, shrugging. "I grew fast." 
</P>
<P>
 So he is used to causing partial eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
 King Coach Barry Melrose knew next to nothing about Johnson when the team was 
preparing to select him in the NHL's entry draft in June at Hartford, Conn. But 
General Manager Sam McMaster knew that Melrose would have no quarrel with the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam said, 'This is your second-round pick. You'll love him,' " Melrose said 
Tuesday. "I looked up and couldn't see any light behind him. That's when I knew 
he was our guy." 
</P>
<P>
 One table away, Glen Sather, Edmonton president and general manager, looked up 
at his scouts and asked, "Who the . . . is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 An Oiler scout answered, "That's the guy we wanted you to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson showed he is no long-term project, either. In the opening period of 
his first NHL exhibition Sunday at San Diego, he fought Grimson, came out 
ahead, then later earned a draw in the second-period rematch.  
</P>
<P>
 One exhibition game does not make an NHL career, but it helped Johnson take a 
significant step toward making the Kings' roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a force in this league in a few years -- if not now," Duck 
Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Manhattan Beach home, McSorley, who didn't make the trip, watched the 
fights on TV, then sat back and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say how proud I was of him," McSorley said. "He didn't have me or 
Troy Crowder behind him. He was like, 'Look, here I am.' Stu's got a good 
reputation. And not only did he fight him once, he fought him again. 'OK, let's 
bring it. I'm not going anywhere.' And he got hit too. You can't make a guy a 
tough guy.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to hide him anywhere. He's out there front and center. He got 
punched. Everybody is going to get hit. You've got to stand there and take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, like McSorley, grew up on a farm near a small town in Ontario, 
Canada, and spent his childhood fighting his younger brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still go at it all the time," Johnson said. "We chase each other around. 
You don't stop until something gets broken." 
</P>
<P>
 From all accounts, he wasn't the one suffering the broken bones at home or in 
the Ontario Hockey League the last couple of seasons. Generally regarded as the 
undisputed heavyweight champion of the OHL, Johnson scored 13 goals, 37 points 
and recorded 233 penalty minutes in 50 games last season with the Peterborough 
Petes.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson can't remember the last time he lost a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't admit to it if I did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does say that his most memorable encounter was two years ago against 
Alexander Stojanov, who was then with the Guelph Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of my best junior fights," he said. "It felt like it would never 
end. It was a stand-up fight. But that was my first year of junior. He would 
have been about 20. I was 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before joining Peterborough, Johnson knew his route to the NHL would be 
as an enforcer. He has diligently worked on improving his skating as well as 
his touch around the net. McSorley, for his part, has been impressed by 
Johnson's work ethic at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to come off the ice," McSorley said. "I'll say, 'What do you 
want to work on?' And he'll want to do skill things around the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for him to do other things -- like taking half a team with him 
as he goes to the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he didn't think about fighting before the Anaheim game, but 
McSorley suggested otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him at length before the game," McSorley said. "I said, 'If it's 
not right, don't do it.' But he wanted it."  
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings sent defensemen Rob Cowie, Michael Gaul, Justin Hocking and Michael 
Burman; left wings Jeff Shevalier, Randy Pearce and Dan Bylsma, and goaltender 
Pauli Jaks to the Phoenix Roadrunners. Right wing Shayne Toporowski was 
returned to his junior team, the Prince Albert Raiders, and center Ken Hodge 
Jr. was released.

GAME MAY BE OVER TODAY; BASEBALL: SELIG LIKELY TO MAKE ANNOUNCEMENT CANCELING 
SEASON, INCLUDING PLAYOFFS AND WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting baseball commissioner Bud Selig, barring another spasm of indecision, 
is expected to announce today that he is canceling the rest of the 1994 season, 
including the playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, it was learned, faxed a resolution to the 27 other owners on Tuesday, 
asking them to sign off on the decision to call off the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, says it is with 
"enormous regret" that the rest of the season must be canceled "in order to 
protect the integrity" of the regular season and playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Washington, according to the Associated Press, a Senate bill 
that would have ended the strike fell through. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) 
failed to obtain an immediate vote on the measure, which would modify the 
sport's antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzenbaum said he had spoken with Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, 
and was told that Fehr would recommend ending the strike if the bill passed 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator needed unanimous consent under Senate rules to get a vote, but 
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.), objected, saying it would be a bad precedent for 
Congress to intervene in the strike now. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig's resolution cited the lack of negotiating progress and said it would be 
impossible for the players to resume play at a championship level without a 
substantial training period. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the resolution, Selig said there has been an increased level of 
communication between the clubs in various forms over the last few days but he 
would not be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Selig has a conference call scheduled with the owners for 
mid-afternoon, after which a tentative news conference has been scheduled in 
Milwaukee. Does he intend to cancel? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what happens overnight, if anything," Selig said. "I'm still 
hoping, but each day the ground becomes more tenuous." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one National League owner: "There's a strong possibility (Selig will make 
the announcement today), but he's so careful and cautious that he's liable to 
find a glimmer of hope in anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig's anticipated announcement on Day 34 of the strike by major league 
players would mean that the World Series, which has survived two World Wars, a 
depression and the 1989 Bay Area earthquake, will not be played for the first 
time since 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would mean that the last 52 days and 669 games of the regular season 
will have been erased by a strike that began on Aug. 12. The mid-season strike 
of 1981, the previous longest, wiped out 50 days and 712 games. 
</P>
<P>
 A union lawyer estimated that the owners will have lost $600-$800 million in 
gross revenue and $400-$500 million after the saving on salaries is deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said Selig called him and "asked me to sanction pulling down the season 
and I told him that if he wanted to pull down the World Series it was his 
responsibility, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that he cares one iota about what we think or do is nonsense. They 
have been looking forward to and planning for this day for a long time, he and 
Dick and Jerry." 
</P>
<P>
 The reference was to owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch and Chicago White Sox 
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and to Fehr's contention that the owners' goal has been 
to break the union and unilaterally implement their salary cap proposal without 
meaningful negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no negotiations again Tuesday, but it was learned that Fehr and 
owner Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies were in phone contact again 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A management official said it seemed doubtful that their "back channel" talks 
would lead anywhere, and McMorris, who has tried to keep the process alive, 
would not discuss the specifics of his latest effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "As great as this game has been to all of us, it's a disgrace that this group 
of people can't save the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disgrace, Ravitch said, is that the players have not addressed the primary 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has all the elements of a Greek tragedy, but the fans have to remember 
that the owners didn't go out on strike and didn't force the players to go 
out," Ravitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't make some kind of radical or off-the-wall proposal. We asked them 
to consider the same system that is working in football and basketball, and we 
guaranteed the same billion dollars in compensation they are receiving now, 
with a chance to receive considerably more if revenue continues to grow as it 
has in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said he remains dumbfounded by the players' unwillingness to discuss 
cost certainty and cost containment, or to acknowledge the industry's economic 
problems. He accused the union of buying into expectations that the owners 
would back down as they have in previous negotiations and refusing to discuss 
anything that would impede free agency and salary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union's contention that the owners forced the strike so that they could 
implement their proposal is nonsense," Ravitch said. "Implementation doesn't 
solve anything. Collective bargaining does. We can implement from now to 
kingdom come, but we can't force the players to sign and we can't force them to 
play. We do have a Constitution in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected, however, that at some point in October the owners will declare 
an impasse and unilaterally implement their proposal, touching off a winter of 
legal chaos leading to resumption of the strike next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have a $200-million strike fund, with the first checks due to be 
mailed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead to next spring and the possibility of continued hostility, 
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, a member of the union's negotiating committee, 
said the players are united in their opposition to a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all uncharted waters, but history shows the players have stayed 
together better than almost any other union," he said. "There's such a kinship 
and unity among players because of career length, of what it took to get here. 
. . . and all the different things that bring baseball players together. I 
don't think people would cross the line."

USC GLAD TO BE IN STATE OF GRACE; HE SWITCHED FROM BASKETBALL, THEN CAUGHT ON 
IN BIG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Football looked like fun. Well, a little bit of fun, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But at De Anza High in Richmond, Calif., Ken Grace was a star on the 
basketball team -- he scored 49 points in one game -- and didn't want to get 
off that court. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when friends implored him to go out for football, he almost gave in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the point where I agreed to go out, if all I'd have to do was return 
kicks," said Grace, who is now a starting senior wide receiver for USC.  
</P>
<P>
 "The coach didn't think much of that idea, so I stuck with basketball. All the 
kids in my neighborhood in Richmond, we all played basketball. I wanted to get 
a basketball scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 After his senior year, in 1989, Grace the basketball player was recruited by 
UC Santa Barbara, San Jose State and Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned them all down, and got a job. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked for a year on the staff of the FRAGO Treatment Center in Oakland, 
counseling disturbed, displaced children. There, he learned that life's rewards 
aren't confined to sports. 
</P>
<P>
 And in his year out of school, Grace reassessed his sports future. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he measured himself again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rats! 
</P>
<P>
 He was still 5 feet 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe football wasn't such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented himself to Thomas Coleman, football coach at Contra Costa Junior 
College, in San Pablo.  
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Coach Coleman took a chance on me, and I owe him a lot," Grace 
said. "I had no experience and he told me he'd give me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 For Coleman, the payback was immediate. The first time Grace touched a 
football in a game -- in the 1991 season opener -- he ran 90 yards on a reverse 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, the fleet, 170-pound Grace was on a fast track to major 
college football. In 1992, he averaged 157 all-purpose yards per game, catching 
passes, running and returning kicks.  
</P>
<P>
 Enter everyone, most prominently USC, UCLA, Florida, Tennessee, Washington and 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennessee showed a lot of interest in me, but USC came on late and I was a 
little leery of going out of state," Grace said.  
</P>
<P>
 He quickly nailed down starting roles as a wide receiver and kick returner 
with the Trojans. He started 10 games last season and was third in receptions 
(36 for 458 yards) on a team whose headliner was All-American wide receiver 
Johnnie Morton.  
</P>
<P>
 As the 1993 season wound down, Grace had his most productive games, since 
opponents were double-teaming Morton.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently -- in a bye week before USC plays Baylor Sept. 24 -- Grace is almost 
the only sound wide receiver Robinson can suit up. With starters Keyshawn 
Johnson and Ed Hervey injured, USC's pass offense has been at half-speed in its 
first two games.  
</P>
<P>
 Grace has caught seven passes and is tied for the reception lead with tight 
ends Johnny McWilliams and John Allred. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get healthy, we'll show that we have one of the best offenses in the 
nation," Grace said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of high expectations placed on us, and maybe we're trying too 
hard to meet other people's expectations instead of pleasing ourselves. Our 
pass attack will get going, but right now it's missing a big chunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace sees himself as some sort of ticking bomb, skulking about unsuspecting 
defenses.  
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to show up in patterns where defenses don't expect me, to make 
things happen," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, when defenses looked for Morton deep, I was all alone over the 
middle a lot. When we get it going, the same thing will happen this year. We've 
got lots of good tight ends, plus Hervey and Keyshawn -- all that helps me. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what's going on in a pass pattern, I'm sort of hangin' around. I 
might be deep, short or in the middle, but I'm hangin' around, somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace was "hangin' around" in last year's UCLA game, when he made a play that 
put the Trojans within three yards of the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had a 27-21 lead when Rob Johnson passed 33 yards to Morton and then 43 
yards to Grace to set up USC at UCLA's three-yard line with 1:16 left.  
</P>
<P>
 Unhappily for USC, opportunity was lost when a third-down interception ended 
the threat.  
</P>
<P>
 Grace hasn't had a kickoff return this year. He led the team and was fourth in 
the Pac-10 in kickoff returns with a 22.5 average in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an athlete who understands there is life beyond pro sports.  
</P>
<P>
 That understanding was reinforced in his year at the FRAGO center. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the children here are severely disturbed and some of them are very angry 
and had suffered trauma in their lives," said Jimmie Franks, founder of the 
center.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ken is an excellent child-care worker. He shows great patience with these 
children, and they loved him because he listens to them. All of the staff here 
felt Ken had a lot of assets in this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace is hopeful he might earn a living one day returning kicks in the NFL, 
but has other goals too.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a history major, and some day I'd like to be a junior college history 
teacher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in the Oakland area, I saw a lot of athletes grow up assuming 
they'd be pro athletes, and when it never happened, they had nothing to fall 
back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to put all my marbles in one basket. I'll compete as hard as I 
can in football, and we'll see what happens. I definitely think I can play in 
the NFL, but you never know."

MIKE DOWNEY: DODGERS GONE, BUT NOT THEIR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I caught Fred Claire by telephone in Albuquerque shortly before he was about 
to leave for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm down here to watch a baseball game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A baseball game," I said. "Sounds wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't it?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball withdrawal. Some of us suffer from it. Others don't care if they ever 
see a baseball game again. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, there might be no more major league baseball for 1994. Claire, 
the general manager of the Dodgers, was down New Mexico way to enjoy Game 1 of 
the best-of-five Pacific Coast League championship series Tuesday night between 
the Albuquerque Dukes, a Dodger farm club, and their rivals from Vancouver, the 
Angels' minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
 Real, live, meaningful, professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky Fred, I thought. He gets to see Billy Ashley, the minor leagues' player 
of the year with 37 homers plus three in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, alas, when it rains it pours. The Albuquerque game was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire has also been to Wichita and to Great Falls and to Helena and to 
Colorado Springs. He has been on the road more than Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
 Because not all baseball business has been suspended. There's the San Antonio 
farm team of the Dodgers, for example. There's Darren Dreifort and there's Chan 
Ho Park, young pitchers who got to keep working all summer because they had the 
good fortune -- or misfortune -- not to be in the big leagues when this 
damnable strike began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger GM keeps an eye on his up-and-comers. How come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because in a way it's symbolic of what this entire episode is about," Claire 
said. "Because we will be playing baseball again in Los Angeles. I don't know 
when and I don't know how, but we will be playing again, so you have to proceed 
with that in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 25 years with the Dodgers, I have never seen anything like this. This 
thing has thrown everybody off stride. None of it makes any sense to me. 
Clearly there are no winners in this situation and I'm not sure there ever will 
be. There's no reason to go into specifics, because there's more than enough 
blame to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say for certain is, there's a lot of ground to make up, a lot of 
damage to recover from. Both players and management have a bigger job to do 
than just end this strike eventually. There's the rebuilding of the game itself 
to think about. A great deal of damage has been done to the game of baseball 
and somehow people's faith has to be restored." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire gets progress -- or lack of progress -- updates at regular intervals. 
He would like nothing better than to find a red light blinking on his hotel 
phone somewhere in Montana or Kansas, with a message to get back to Chavez 
Ravine on the first machine leaving town, be it plane, bus or hitchhiking on an 
18-wheeler. A message that the Dodgers were back in business. "I checked in 
before I left for Albuquerque," Claire said. "There wasn't much encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him that I couldn't help but reflect on what we all were missing. The 
possibilities. What might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone with a kind heart recently gave me a souvenir program from the 1965 
World Series. The "Out of This World Series," as the cover of this (50-cent) 
program called it, depicting space capsules representing the Dodgers and 
Minnesota Twins colliding in orbit above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It carried me away on a wave of nostalgia. The inside cover bore the memorably 
ungrammatical ad: "Winston Tastes Good Like a Cigarette Should." Remember, this 
was back when tobacco was something that a baseball player didn't spit. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pages ran ads for Banana Stix frozen ice milk. . . . "The Ipcress File," 
starring Michael Caine (exclusive engagement, Grauman's Chinese Theatre). . . . 
The Statler Hilton ("Take Our Helicab from the Airport and Arrive in Just 8 
Minutes!"). . . . The brand new 1966 Dodge Coronet 500 two-door hardtop. . . . 
"Man! Now You're Really Living, Watchin' the Champion Dodgers and Munchin' 
Morrell All-Meat Franks!" . . . Congratulations, Dodgers, from the All-American 
Nut Co., Inc., of Downey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 And: 
</P>
<P>
 "Debbie Reynolds, starring in 'The Singing Nun,' now in production, says: 
'Artesia Doors are the swinginest!' " . . . Lindy ballpoint pens, with the new 
Tankful of Ink traction-point refill. . . . Jerseymaid Milk ("Couldn't Be 
Fresher If You Kept a Cow"). . . . The Sands Hotel, Las Vegas (with a scorecard 
featuring "all-stars" F. Sinatra, D. Martin, R. Skelton, S. Davis, J. Bishop, 
C. Burnett, L. Horne and J. Lewis). . . . Nate's Friendly Liquor Store, 4400 S. 
Huntington, Los Angeles 32, California. . . . And the new Honda 50 motorbike, 
"a paragon of economy," capable of cruising at a comfortable 40 m.p.h., yours 
for "about $215." 
</P>
<P>
 It made me think about what the 1994 World Series program might have been. 
About keeping a scorecard for the Dodgers vs. the New York Yankees. Or about a 
night in Chavez Ravine with the Cleveland Indians in town. Or about a 35th 
anniversary series with the Chicago White Sox, only this time not at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to go all the way to Albuquerque to be able to watch the Dodgers 
of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, I might not have much choice.LOS ANGELES DODGERS

MCGEE'S MIND BACK ON GAME; AFTER SHOOTING, TRANSFERS, HE'S READY TO PLAY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jon McGee was in Norman, Okla., half a continent removed from where gunfire 
had inexplicably found him in a place where he had least expected it, when it 
dawned on him. 
</P>
<P>
 He hated football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like watching it on TV, I didn't like playing it, I didn't like 
playing football video games," he said. "Just about anything that had to do 
with football, I didn't like. I got to that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, of course, such feelings would not be cause for alarm. But they 
concerned McGee because he excelled at football and had always enjoyed it. At 
the time, in fact, he was attending the University of Oklahoma on a football 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months earlier, in the fall of 1992, he had been playing for USC, 
waiting for practice to start at Howard Jones Field, when he was struck by 
gang-related gunfire about a quarter-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 A stray bullet passed completely through his left arm above the elbow, an 
injury that surely must rank among the least common -- and most traumatic -- 
ever suffered on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have hit Rob Johnson or Willie McGinest or Tony Boselli, any of the 
Trojans' stars. Instead, it struck McGee, a promising freshman linebacker who 
had been a prep All-American a year earlier at Sahuaro High in Tucson but had 
yet to make his mark at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, McGee, 20, suffers no physical ill effects from the injury 
but is still trying to find his way in college football. He has transferred 
twice, most recently to Arizona in hometown Tucson, where he is a walk-on 
trying to earn a scholarship as he sits out this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists, he said, have told him that he has suffered from post-traumatic 
stress syndrome, a mental disorder sparked by exposure to violent incidents 
that return as recurrent images, disrupting normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms include nightmares, insomnia and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 In McGee's case, they also included an aversion to football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think part of it is that it happened on the football field, and he had to 
go back and look at the football field every day," said his father, Mike, no 
relation to former USC Athletic Director Mike McGee. "I guess your mind does 
funny things to you. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like this girl (Monica Seles) who got stabbed on the tennis court. 
She's making umpteen millions of dollars a year and she can't go back. It's a 
psychological thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some won't understand it, Jon McGee acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who haven't gone through it will probably think I'm nuts and it 
shouldn't have bothered me as much as it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hard to figure out. I had just a terrible attitude about 
football. I got to the point where I didn't want to go lift weights, I didn't 
want to work out. I just had a bad outlook on everything. Everything was 
negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said at a news conference two days after the shooting that he 
planned to remain at USC, McGee later asked Coach Larry Smith to release him 
from his scholarship so that he could transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought a change of scenery might help my attitude toward football," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He transferred to Oklahoma early in 1993 but realized during spring practice a 
few months later that he still wasn't enjoying football. His coaches persuaded 
him to stay, however, and he played in four games last fall before quitting the 
team and leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Arizona last spring, determined never to play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to play football or even think about playing football," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, however, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like all the clouds parted and I decided I wanted to play again," he 
said. "It was like a light switched on or something." 
</P>
<P>
 He made an appointment with Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, who invited him to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been going really good," McGee said. "I've been having a lot of fun with 
football now. I'm just excited to get back into it and get going. I've got the 
desire back. I've made about a 180-degree turn and I'm positive about 
everything now." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing so sparingly during the last three years -- he sat out four 
games of his senior year in high school because of an ankle injury and never 
got into a game at USC -- McGee is a little rusty. But he is determined to make 
an impact next season on a defensive unit that has recently ranked among the 
best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see signs of Jon McGee having the potential to be a good college football 
player, but he's got quite a ways to go as far as his overall development," 
said Larry Mac Duff, Arizona's defensive coordinator and linebacker coach. "He 
needs to improve his quickness and some of those things. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's working extremely hard. At one time, he was a guy who was very highly 
recruited and very highly publicized on a national basis as far as an 
outstanding prospect, and I think now what he wants to do is get away from all 
that. He just wants to work hard and improve and make his own way in our 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's taking steps toward doing that, but he's got a ways to go and 
he's going to be in competition with some really good players here. So, time 
will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 For McGee and his family, it has already been a long wait. But, apparently, 
their ordeal is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how upset he was, and I know how he's doing now, and he's his old 
self," Mike McGee said of his son. "In talking with the psychiatrists and 
psychologists, they say it's just a process your mind has to go through to 
readjust and it usually takes a year and a half to two years. And they were 
right. He really is over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's missed a lot and he's got a lot of catching up to do. But he's doing 
well. And he's happy. That's what I care about, and that's what he cares 
about."

NBA MOVES TO ELIMINATE 'UGLYBALL'; PRO BASKETBALL: THREE-POINT LINE TO BE 
SHORTENED AND PHYSICAL PLAY TARGETED IN PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having watched a star coach, Pat Riley, complete a personal journey from 
Showtime to Uglyball, NBA officials have at last been persuaded to address the 
threat to free-wheeling offensive basketball before the fast break becomes 
extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Chicago, the league's competition committee Tuesday recommended 
shortening the three-point line to bring defenses from under the basket, plus 
several rules changes designed to deal with physical play and fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scoring in this league has gone down for something like 10 straight years," 
said Rod Thorn, NBA vice president for operations. "Teams are not taking as 
many shots. They're holding the ball more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a sport, you like to have some action. You don't want it to 
become a grappling match." 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring has actually been dropping for 25 years, since the high-water 1968-69 
season when teams averaged 122 points. Scoring held steady around the 109 mark 
in the '70s but slipped almost every season in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend was little remarked on during the star-studded '80s but with Magic 
Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan retired, it showed its face with a 
vengeance. Last season, scoring plummeted four points, from 105 to 101. The NBA 
finals drew the league's lowest TV rating in four years, or before Jordan made 
his first appearance. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks set several 
finals scoring lows and their play was nicknamed "Uglyball." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Stern fended off critics last spring but gave up his 
spirited defense when the final TV numbers came in. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition committee recommendations, expected to be adopted by the board 
of governors, would shorten the three-point line from its present 23 feet 9 
inches at the top of the circle to 22 feet all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Players fouled while shooting a three-pointer would get three free throws. 
Defenders would not be able to hand-check until the offensive player gets below 
the foul line. Fines for technical fouls would be increased and taunting would 
be monitored more closely. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Eager to get on with their lives on a court rather than in one, Orlando Magic 
officials say they will offer free agent Horace Grant a new contract, rather 
than try to persuade a judge that the one he has now is acceptable under NBA 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The judge) has already said that the league has a good case here," said John 
Gabriel, Orlando's vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise, who approved the league-rejected 
contracts of A.C. Green, Toni Kukoc and Chris Dudley, had asked for more 
information on Grant's case. 
</P>
<P>
 With the start of camp three weeks off, the Magic will instead change Grant's 
one-year-and-out contract to a two-year deal for about $2.125 million per 
season. The league has approved such contracts and Grant's agent, Jimmy Sexton, 
says Grant will sign it.

ANGELS REPORTING $8 MILLION LOSS; WAGE FREEZE USED TO AVOID LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel owner Jackie Autry said Tuesday that with the anticipated end of the 
baseball season today, the club will lose $8 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ranks as one of the largest in the franchise's 33-year history, Autry 
said, and is more than a third of the team's $23.3-million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she added, there will be no front-office salary cuts and possibly no 
further layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many layoffs already in Southern California," Jackie Autry said, 
"and Gene Autry doesn't want to add to that misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we don't want to penalize our employees because of the 
actions of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of wage cuts, the Angel employees have been notified there will be no 
raises until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is in contrast with most baseball clubs, including the Dodgers, who 
recently announced a 15% pay cut for management personnel, and 10% cut for 
non-management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about doing this as painless as possible," Angel President Richard 
Brown said. "We decided programs will be cut in lieu of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels pulled their scouts off the road early and saved another $120,000 
when they canceled their instructional league program.  
</P>
<P>
 They laid off three full-time employees in August, and now have 47 
front-office employees -- the fourth-smallest total in the major leagues. The 
Dodgers have 100 front-office employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Angel pitcher Mark Langston will begin training for the Salsa soccer team 
today, the Salsa announced Tuesday. Langston is scheduled to take the field for 
a practice at 7:30 p.m. at Titan Stadium.

 A temporary agreement clearing the way for the NCAA to restore the eligibility 
of five Florida State football players, including All-American linebacker 
Derrick Brooks, was approved by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, tailback Tiger McMillon and reserve offensive lineman Marcus Long were 
scheduled to come off a two-game suspension Saturday, but the school was at 
risk of further penalties if they played without the NCAA restoring their 
eligibility.

 The University of Colorado violated an NCAA regulation by allowing recruited 
freshman running back Lendon Henry to participate in football practices before 
his transcript and high school course work had been approved by the NCAA's

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; GARY JAILED FOR DRIVING VIOLATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ram running back Cleveland Gary was jailed briefly in Stuart, Fla., 
after being charged with driving with a revoked driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, 28, was booked into the Martin County Jail on Monday and released after 
paying $250 bail for the June 29 incident.He was taken to jail after appearing 
in court to answer a separate charge of driving with a revoked license on June 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 The former University of Miami star was declared a habitual traffic violator 
when his license was revoked in August of 1990. He was cited for speeding twice 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he was allowed to drive for work purposes only, but that privilege 
was withdrawn in 1993 after Martin County deputies stopped him twice for 
speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys were considering signing Gary after he was cut by the Rams 
two weeks ago, but decided against it after learning Gary had undergone an 
emergency appendectomy in Miami. 
</P>

<P>
 Running back Eric Metcalf and safety Eric Turner of the Cleveland Browns were 
arrested on reckless driving charges, two radio stations reported. WWWE in 
Cleveland and WTVN in Columbus reported the two were in separate cars on 
Interstate 480 in suburban Independence when they were arrested Tuesday 
afternoon. The radio station said each player was charged with reckless driving 
and weaving in and out of traffic. Police said the players were released on 
$420 bond each, according to the radio station.

HYBRID ACTION A BREED APART; THE 'WIPER,' A CROSS BETWEEN STRIPED BASS AND 
WHITE BASS, ADDS SPECIAL EDGE TO THE NIGHT FISHING ON REOPENED CORONA LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the sun disappeared over the hill, leaving a crescent moon to light the 
sky, the temperature finally dropped and little Corona Lake came alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools of tiny shad were jumping out of the water, as if there were a chance 
for survival on the outside. Larger fish were crashing the surface and taking 
them in gulps. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, under a blazing desert sun, lake manager Brad Grieder had 
said it would be like this, but it was hard to believe. Corona Lake was covered 
by a thin skin of algae and seemed to be little more than a stagnant pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens every day at this time -- they run the bluegill and shad around 
the lake just like a striper would a trout," Grieder said, casting a small 
white jig and hooking up almost instantly after each cast, rocking and reeling 
as the fish he calls "wipers" went absolutely wild after his lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the funny thing is, nobody knows about it. They're all fishing for 
catfish." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it had become apparent on this warm desert evening that this 85-acre 
irrigation reservoir, located alongside Interstate 15 south of the 91 Freeway 
in Riverside County, is no ordinary fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, who ever heard of going out to catch a wiper? 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, there is no such fish. A wiper is merely a cross between a striped 
bass and white bass, and is more accurately referred to as a hybrid striped 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what they are called, the fish have the qualities of each 
parent. They look like a striped bass, but have a much smaller mouth. They are 
strong, like stripers, and quick, like white bass. They are unable to 
reproduce, though, and fishermen, therefore, are allowed to keep only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona Lake, which opened June 18 for the first time since 1988 -- it was 
closed primarily because of water-level problems associated with drought -- is 
believed to be the only Southland reservoir stocked with hybrid stripers to 
create a specific fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana River Lakes and Anaheim Lake used to have hybrid stripers, but both 
reservoirs have been drained. Hybrid stripers were put into Corona Lake as sort 
of an experiment, according to Steve Miller, vice president and general manager 
of Outdoor Safaris International, which operates concessions at several 
Southland reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are so voracious, chasing down anything they can fit into their 
little mouths, hybrid stripers are considered a potential threat to other 
species of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Corona Lake, the experiment seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called wipers tend to stay in the north end, where there is more open 
water. The south end is a maze of submerged trees and brush, which provide 
cover for smaller bait fish and several species of game fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Largemouth bass thrive in the structure and, although they aren't particularly 
large -- the biggest to date is an eight-pounder -- they are abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Motsinger, 41, a representative of tackle manufacturer Daiwa's 
bass-fishing team, pre-fished Corona Lake several days before the June opener 
and said 25- to 30-fish days were common, with most fish running two to six 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about Corona is, you have all this deep structure and you can flip 
(lures) all day, or you can cast a plastic worm on the structure, or you can 
reel spinner baits through the trees," Motsinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he also had field days with four- to six-pound wipers, which 
"pound for pound beat a largemouth" as far as the fight is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluegills and crappies also thrive in Corona Lake, and light-tackle anglers 
are fairly assured of catching their fill on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the summer, the most popular of all the species in Corona Lake 
-- wipers included -- wears a thick gray skin and sports what look like 
whiskers. Catfish are stocked by the hundreds twice weekly, providing Southland 
fishermen with almost unparalleled catfish action. 
</P>
<P>
 And given that they become most active in the evenings, and that the desert 
sun has made fishing during the day unbearable if not unproductive, catfish 
provide an ideal means of recreation for the dozens of fishermen who come to 
Corona after a hard day at work. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, when the wipers were beginning their frenzy at the north 
end of the lake, most of the boats were at the south end, the fishermen having 
maneuvered through the maze of trees to find their favorite catfish holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bradshaw, 40, of Riverside, had spent the afternoon fishing from a tiny 
skiff, filling his stringer with six or seven catfish, the largest going about 
six pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His largest this summer was nearly 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from Bradshaw were Eden Garcia, 65, and Bob Bunch, 63, both of 
Riverside. They had arrived for the night bite, as they do two or three times 
each week -- they eat catfish for dinner on the other nights -- staying on the 
lake until it closes at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had caught a 12-pounder the night before and said he has caught several 
similar fish in previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost some big ones too," he said. "You lose more fish than you catch here 
because of all these trees. . . . That's why I use 30-pound test (line)." 
</P>
<P>
 Grieder said that although most of the catfish stocked are two- to 
three-pounders, an occasional giant is thrown in, including a 40-pounder 
planted earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest caught since the reopening of the lake, however, was a 20-pounder 
that, surprisingly, was caught in the middle of the day in the middle of the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's bigger ones," Grieder said. "You just can't get them out (because of 
so much hidden structure)." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller calls Corona Lake his new crown jewel, high praise considering that 
Outdoor Safaris also has Irvine Lake, which is known for its superb catfish and 
trout fishing. But then, Miller has plans for Corona, which has limited shore 
access but is ideal for small boats. Only rowboats and boats with 
battery-powered trolling motors are allowed, which keeps the lake quiet and 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
 The company bought 550 acres of land surrounding the lake and in January will 
begin landscaping and the installation of picnic tables and barbecues, Miller 
said. RV hookups and a campground are planned for the more distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has Miller and Grieder really excited are the fishing prospects for 
this fall. Brown trout in the three- to five-pound class and larger rainbow 
trout will be heavily stocked before the trout opener Nov. 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "The people at the hatchery came out here and told us this would be a 
tremendous fishery," Grieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lake is only 21 feet deep, so there's only so many places the fish can go 
(to hide)." 
</P>
<P>
 If they are as easy to catch as the wipers, it should be quite a fall. CORONA 
LAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Hours are 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., then 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday; 
6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday. Lake is closed Monday and Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $11 per person, $9 for seniors and children 12 and under. No fishing 
license is required.  
</P>
<P>
 Rental boats are available, $20 for a full day, $12 for half a day.

WATER POLO '94; PREVIEW; CROWLEY IS A HIT IN SECOND-FAVORITE SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Crowley doesn't remember when he first scored 11 goals in a water polo 
game, tying the Notre Dame High record. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't remember the second time he did it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley is a baseball player who spends his free time in a pool, firing yellow 
balls into nets. In two-plus varsity seasons, he's done it 288 times, another 
school record. But water polo still is his second love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is my favorite sport," said Crowley, a senior. "I think I'd rather 
play baseball in college. That's where you can go somewhere. In water polo, you 
can't go anyplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has played baseball his whole life, he didn't discover water polo 
until eighth grade, and it seemed to come naturally to him. Crowley was 
introduced to the sport by Blazs Pongracz, a former member of the Hungarian 
national team who was dating Crowley's older sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was coaching a team and he wanted me to come down and watch," Crowley 
said. "I really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pongracz worked with Crowley for two years -- until he stopped seeing 
Crowley's sister -- but apparently, that was enough. Crowley split his freshman 
season between the varsity and junior varsity at Notre Dame. He has played 
varsity full-time since 1992, and last year scored 137 goals, a school record. 
He already has 12 goals just two matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very natural athlete, so he's very easy to coach," Notre Dame Coach 
John Hirn said. "You tell him what you need him to do and he figures it out 
pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches in the Mission League also keep Crowley in mind when preparing 
for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good player," Harvard-Westlake assistant Eric Mandel said. "I think 
highly of him." 
</P>
<P>
 So do baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley, an outfielder and first baseman, hit .319 last spring for Notre Dame, 
which advanced to the Southern Section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, he played American Legion baseball and batted .500 in 48 
at-bats. In August, he was chosen by professional scouts to play in the Area 
Code Games, a showcase for many of the West's top high school players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Area Code games are often the ticket to a college scholarship, which 
Crowley will pursue this spring. Another goal is a Mission League water polo 
championship, a possibility because four starters return from last year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 As for personal accomplishments in water polo, Crowley said he is missing only 
one: 
</P>
<P>
 "I never could get that 12th goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake -- The Wolverines, who have won two Southern Section titles, 
remain the region's most dominant team. Of course, what would you expect with 
U.S. Olympic water polo Coach Rich Corso doubling as Harvard's coach? This 
year's team will be led by senior Jimmy Duff and junior Albert Won, both 
selected 17-and-under All-Americans this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the younger players to watch is junior J.J. Arden, who was a 
15-and-under All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard finished 25-3 last year, losing, 7-5, to San Clemente in the Division 
I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley -- Despite the loss of two All-Southern Section players from 
last year's 20-5 team, the Falcons return four all-league players and appear to 
be contenders for a section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley, ranked third in the preseason Division III poll, is led by 
junior Joey Bennett, who will start for the third year. Junior Jon Conrad, an 
excellent defender, and seniors Eddie Kim and Brian Haley will help run the 
Falcons' high-speed attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal -- Highlander Coach Steve Snyder says Agoura is the favorite to end 
Royal's streak of 13 consecutive Marmonte League titles. "This is going to be a 
real tentative group for us because we only have a few kids back," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Randy Owens, junior Bill Bruininga and junior Kris Kunkel are the top 
players for Royal, which was ranked third in the preseason Division IV poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- The Chargers' optimism stems from the return of four starters, led 
by Chris Driscoll, whose 62 goals led the Marmonte League last year. Harvey 
Wilford is one of the fastest swimmers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena -- Although the Bulldogs were ranked fourth in the Division IV preseason 
poll, that made them only the third-best team in the Channel League -- behind 
No. 1 Santa Barbara and No. 2 San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena's top players are senior Jeff Malas, junior Matt Swartout and junior 
goalie Curtis Tolmie. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame -- The Knights return all significant players from a team that 
finished fourth last season in the Mission League. Besides Crowley, Notre Dame 
will rely on 6-foot-4 defensive specialist Theo SmitsvanOyen. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi -- Seniors Mike Scarcelli, Bennan Bakke and David Brea are returning 
starters from a team that was 17-7 last year. The Celts usually give their best 
efforts of the season against Harvard, and this year they might have the talent 
to come away with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale -- The Dynamiters were 9-13 last year, but leading scorer Gilbert 
Abramyan and sophomore goalie Edvin Saakyan, who was selected all-league last 
year, are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake -- Although the Warriors might not have enough depth to surpass 
Agoura or Royal in the Marmonte League, they do have one player the whole 
league fears -- David Block. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, a 6-foot-2 senior, played this summer on the 16-and-under Southern 
Pacific All-Star team that traveled to Hungary. He also competed with the 
17-and-under junior national team that played in Greece.

WATER POLO '94; PLAYOFF EXPANSION WELCOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look no further than Glendale High to find the significance of the Southern 
Section's decision to expand water polo playoff divisions from four to six this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale was ranked ninth in the Division III preseason poll, marking the 
first time the Dynamiters had ever been in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Glendale Coach Pat Lancaster said. "You don't have to be 
superhuman to be in the rankings anymore. There is no way Glendale would be 
ranked if we were under the old system." 
</P>
<P>
 Division I still consists of the five leagues with the highest caliber of 
play, including the Mission League. But the other five divisions are 
geographically based, with relatively similar levels of play, said Ed Zintel, 
section spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific League is in Division III, which includes teams from Glendale into 
the San Gabriel Valley. The Marmonte, Channel and Frontier leagues are in 
Division IV, which covers Ventura County and extends north to Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Zintel said the change was made to ease travel. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many area teams, the change means they no longer have to fight Orange 
County powers for section titles, much less fight traffic to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly better for us, after all the years that we had to drive down 
to Orange County," said Steve Snyder, coach of Marmonte League member Royal. 
"And then you might have to drive down again two days later." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission League members Alemany, Crespi, Harvard-Westlake, Notre Dame and St. 
Francis remain in Division I. JEFF FLETCHER

FISCAL WOES PLAGUE CSUN ATHLETICS; FUNDING: PROPOSED REFERENDUM SEEKS 
ADDITIONAL $49 PER STUDENT PER SEMESTER TO OFFSET SHRINKING BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The future of Cal State Northridge athletics may be tied to the most 
superfluous of sports-related events -- the election of the homecoming court. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletics department Tuesday sought to place a referendum on the 
homecoming-election ballot Oct. 18-19 that ultimately could decide whether the 
school continues to compete at the NCAA Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 If the funding referendum fails, cuts in the department could result in the 
elimination of several programs, including football. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert, who outlined the proposal to the 
Associated Students' Senate on Tuesday, says the department -- already funded 
at a level below many of its Division I counterparts -- is not understating the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're not funded, we're going backwards," Hiegert said. "We're certainly 
not crying wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is faced with losing as much as $700,000 from its 1995-96 athletics 
budget. This year's budget is $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is asking students to consider paying an additional $49 each 
semester in Associated Students' fees to generate funds that would underwrite 
sports programs. Since 1985, the athletics department has received $4 per 
semester from each student. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the enrollment level of 24,000, the fee hike would generate $2.25 
million annually for Matador sports. Hiegert expects to learn by next week 
whether the referendum will be included on the homecoming ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage could result in more athletic scholarships and the establishment of 
additional programs. Over the past three years, declining enrollment and 
decreases in funding from school sources have resulted in a departmental 
decrease of $335,000. Also, state funding has dropped $200,000 over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The University Corporation, which oversees many of the school's financial 
resources, is strapped because of costs associated with earthquake damage and 
reduced its athletic funding from $430,000 in 1993-94 to $225,000 this year. 
The foundation isn't expected to fund athletics at all next year, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic department could face a series of difficult decisions if the 
referendum fails -- and history isn't exactly on the athletes' side. A similar 
proposal presented to students last spring lost by 87 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the October referendum is again shot down, the school might eliminate 
programs to trim costs, including the Division I-AA football team. "I'd say 
that if there is a quick fix, that is probably the quickest to do," Hiegert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if the referendum fails and departmental projections are 
accurate, elimination of programs might force the school to return to the 
Division II level. The NCAA requires schools to field 14 teams in order to 
maintain Division I status. Currently, Northridge fields 16 sports recognized 
at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's decision to move to Division I seven years ago was in part tied 
to long-range enrollment projections that have fallen well short of the mark. 
Estimates made in the late 1980s indicated the school would have an enrollment 
of 40,000 by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the recession and earthquake have sent the student population 
spiraling downward. Enrollment has tumbled this semester to 24,000, down from 
the late '80s high-water mark of 31,000, and the department has felt the 
financial pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 More athletics costs loom: California State University gender-equity bylaws 
require member schools to field the same number of teams and supply an equal 
number of scholarships in men's and women's sports by 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to elicit support for the referendum, Northridge officials are 
accentuating the payoff for students as well as student-athletes if the 
proposal is approved: 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding football, scholarships for Northridge programs would be raised to 
the NCAA maximum, making teams more competitive across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least two women's sports would be added in accordance with gender-equity 
requirements. Women's soccer could be added as soon as next fall, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also, students would avoid paying admission fees for future athletic events. 
Students with a valid activities card currently are admitted free.

ESCOTO TO COACH SYLMAR BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nine seasons as an assistant coach for two successful programs, Bort 
Escoto was named to replace Jose Fernandez as the Sylmar High basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez left Sylmar to take a high school coaching position in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Escoto, 28, who at 18 began as an assistant at Cleveland High, is the fourth 
coach in five years at Sylmar and will inherit a team that finished 13-10 and 
won the Mid-Valley League championship. It was the school's first league title 
in basketball since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't heard much about Sylmar until last year when they did so well," 
Escoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an assistant to Bob Braswell at Cleveland for six seasons (1986-91), Escoto 
helped guide the Cavaliers to runner-up finishes in the City Section 4-A 
Division in 1986 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
 Escoto assisted former Chatsworth Coach Sandy Greentree the past three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He is eager to make Sylmar a contender in the Valley Pac-8 Conference, which 
is dominated by North Hollywood and Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Miller, the former girls' basketball coach at Sylmar and current 
softball coach, will assist Escoto.

VRANAU TO COACH NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Vranau has taken over the baseball program at North Hollywood High, 
succeeding Rick Pally, who opted to step down and be an assistant to Vranau 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Vranau, a former baseball coach at Burbank, Chaminade and Murphy highs with a 
102-98 career record, taught at North Hollywood as a long-term substitute the 
past year, but recently earned his teaching credential and master's degree and 
will teach full-time at the school this year. 
</P>
<P>
 His task outside the classroom, however, is not an easy one. He inherits a 
team that finished 7-18 overall and 1-16 in the East Valley League. The Huskies 
are 35-80 in the 1990s under three different coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Vranau insists it's time to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am enthusiastic and upbeat," Vranau said. "And I want the kids to see that 
so they can begin to feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Vranau added: "Is this something that I can sink my teeth into and get into it 
for more than one year?. . . . Not if Pepperdine came knocking on my door and 
wanted me as an assistant coach. I could make an exception for that."

ANGELS SAY THEY WILL LOSE $8 MILLION, BUT HALT LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel owner Jackie Autry said Tuesday that with the anticipated end of the 
baseball season today, the club will lose $8 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ranks as one of the largest in the franchise's 33-year history, Autry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she added, she and her husband Gene have decided there will be no 
front-office salary cuts and possibly no further layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we don't want to penalize our employees because of the 
actions of others," Jackie Autry said.  
</P>
<P>
 Angel employees have been notified that there will be no wage cuts but also no 
raises until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Most baseball clubs have cut back since the strike began. The Dodgers, for 
instance, recently announced 15% pay cuts for management personnel, and 10% 
cuts for non-management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about doing this as painless as possible," Angel President Richard 
Brown said. "We decided programs will be cut in lieu of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels pulled their scouts off the road early and saved another $120,000 
when they canceled their instructional league program. They also are able to 
forgo wage cuts because of their small front office, Brown and Jackie Autry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They laid off three full-time employees in August, and now have only 47 
front-office employees -- the fourth-smallest total in the major leagues. The 
Dodgers have a front-office staff of 100.

RELATIONSHIPS: WHEN E-MALE MEETS E-FEMALE; MEMBERS OF AMERICA ONLINE'S 'OVER 
FORTY' CHAT GROUP VENTURE OUTSIDE OF CYBERSPACE TO A DANA POINT PARTY TO FIND 
OUT WHAT THEIR COMPUTER PALS ARE REALLY LIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before Lorene Mies of Coto de Caza moved out, her husband asked why 
she spent so much time in front of her computer "chatting" with others on her 
computer service. 
</P>
<P>
 She replied acidly: "Because someone answers me back." 
</P>
<P>
 The night after she left, she spent four hours on the computer being comforted 
by soundless words on a computer screen. They were sent by old friends she'd 
met "on line," some of them thousands of miles away, many whose true names she 
did not know, none of whom she had ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 Mies dived into this electronic tide, and it carried her inevitably to the 
first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 She had encountered him by computer. She was attracted to him by telephone 
conversations. Now she agreed to meet him in the parking lot of the Newporter 
Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 They talked on their cellular telephones as they drove there. They arrived and 
parked. They walked toward one another, still talking on their telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 And though it was the first time one had actually seen the other, "we 
immediately hugged," Mies said. After all that computer pillow talk, "you feel 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the only such story floating around the bar at the Villa Mexican 
Restaurant in Dana Point on Friday night. About 25 other cyberpals had 
gathered, all members of the American Online computer service, all habitues of 
the same "Over Forty" chat group, all eager to see the faces and figures that 
go with the computer monikers. 
</P>
<P>
 The party had been arranged, of course, over the computer, and organizers 
expected 50 or so to show up at either the Friday "mixer," the Saturday beach 
party or the Sunday brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, I'm PamelaK601," said the woman who approached a group at a bar table. No 
one asked her real name. Few would have recognized it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Johnny Angel, but he doesn't sign on much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glad to meet you," said one of the group. "I'm Modem Junkie." 
</P>
<P>
 A man at the table said it's normal for outsiders to be confused by all this. 
"People who are not on AOL, they have no idea what's going on," said DenSoCal 
(Dennis Gallagher to his friends back in Temecula). 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties are all over the country," said Sarah Reuter (SMS 7831), an 
advertising copy writer in Redlands who helped organize the Dana Point 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big one in Philly last month and one in Chicago in May. We had a 
small one in Thousand Oaks in July. They're planning a national Vegas bash next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who come to these have not met before. We're all from the 
Over Forty room, and whether we're all going through a midlife crisis or 
whatever, most are divorced or single. Or they're married and not fanatic about 
it. It's like a computer dating service, if you want to call it that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than that, according to Lady Aruba (Diana Laduke of Monterey). It's 
a crisis support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left my husband in July, and I lost my access to AOL," she said. "One of 
the people on AOL sent out the news, and I got 300 printed pages of e-mail 
(electronically transmitted messages), people comforting me and supporting me. 
I'm currently living with a woman I met on AOL." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said he struck up a computer acquaintance with a woman whose 
teen-age daughter died during their weeks of correspondence. "She asked me to 
keep the death a secret. I told her you can tell people on AOL things like that 
and they'll support you, but she said, 'No, don't tell anyone. I need a place 
to go. This is my only escape.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on line about six months," Reuter said. "That makes me a vet. I see 
a lot of loneliness and a lot of pain. I know I'm on because of loneliness. I'm 
still in the process of a divorce, and I didn't go back to work outside the 
home until April. It was a case of being isolated and wanting some friends. 
It's very addictive. There are so many people to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 America Online claims a membership of more than 1 million nationwide, the 
fastest growing service in the country. Its most popular features are e-mail 
and "chat rooms," temporary mini-networks of people whose short, written 
messages flash almost instantly on the screens of everyone else in the "room." 
The rooms are labeled "Romance Connection," "Over Forty" or the like. The aim 
is to gather people of similar interests and simulate conversation at a party. 
And as in a party, you can draw someone aside and "talk" privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how addicted these people are to such cyberchat is reflected in their 
monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online charges $9.95 per month, for which you get five hours on line. 
Each additional hour is $3.50. Jack Martin's bill is "$500 every month. My 
first month was $711. You have to make money to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin (JackM1111 when he's on line) at least temporarily held the distance 
record for this party. He'd flown in from his horse ranch in Denton, Tex. 
Seated at the bar in cowboy hat a boots, he was attracting a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lady," he said, his arm around her, "I met her for the first time 
tonight, and I love her. She's the sexiest lady on line." 
</P>
<P>
 She left, then returned with another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Sensuous 9,' she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not," said the other. "I'm Sultry Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 "You do have sensuous eyes," said Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 " Sultry eyes!" she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin mollified her and she left. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this is a little strange, let's face it," he said. "But I got tired of 
the bar scene. I got on AOL because you could meet people. You meet a person's 
personality. You get to know someone's mind. There's a lot of B.S., but some 
people are honest. You can pretty well read them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you gain their confidence you get their phone numbers, then you call 
them. Then you meet. You can get yourself hooked up doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 You can also get yourself severely hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see people get hooked on a personality that's a lie. The person on the 
other end is just writing a book. They fall in love with someone that doesn't 
exist, and that's sick. I see this all the time. I see it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On line, you are what you say you are. America Online allows its subscribers 
five sign-on names, and "you can use them as your alter ego and be a completely 
different person," Reuter said. "I've heard of men masquerading as women, women 
as men, people saying they're single when they're not, people saying they're 
married when they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Protected by anonymity, able to withdraw at the click of a button, shy people 
become assertive, fat people become thin, plain people become beautiful, 
fearful people become sensuous, teen boys become love gods. 
</P>
<P>
 So the uninitiated can be in for some surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a man writing really beautiful letters," Mies said. "He said he was 
very tall and a cowboy. We met, and he wasn't either. He had a New England 
accent. This happens a lot, I guess, because people are always saying to me, 
'It's amazing. You are who you said you are."' 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes the surprises are not so slight, Reuter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the women get harassed by porno messages. I don't get as many because my 
screen name is so androgynous. But a woman with a name like Soft and Sexy is 
going to get tons." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men will want you to go off into an electronic corner for "hot 
chat" or "cybersex." 
</P>
<P>
 "You just avoid these people, although there are some women who like it, I 
guess," Mies said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who invite approaches can transmit photographs into an electronic image 
library for anyone to see. The listings not only show the person's screen name 
but how many times the photo has been viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers show plainly what most people are after. SoSexyLisa's photo was 
viewed 11,281 times in three days. Sexylegs4U was seen 3,107. JoniBook, 
however, attracted only 385 viewers, and Mr Donut, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've found that relationships on line tend to develop at warp speed, and I 
cannot figure out why," Reuter said. "I think you are more open because if 
someone says something you don't like, you just click them off forever. A lot 
of people spend a solitary existence, and this is, to borrow a phrase, reaching 
out and touching someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "At these parties, some relationships are created and some are broken. Most of 
the people have never actually met before. It's almost a joke on line: People 
tend to fall in and out of love like you change your socks."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: EYE-OPENING STEP AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I stumbled upon some wonderful news as I cut through the lobby of a fancy 
Downtown hotel last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A bunch of your basic professional conference types -- with name tags and 
notebooks -- were conferring in clumps. When I saw a couple of Family Violence 
Prevention Fund posters behind a long registration table, I stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out I'd walked into "Family Violence and the Courts," a three-day 
conference put on by the Judicial Council of California, the agency that 
oversees the state's courts. The council had not sought media coverage for fear 
that the event, in the works for more than a year, might become tangled in the 
upcoming Murder Trial of the Century. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 judges from all 58 California counties were joined by 
prosecutors, probation officers, police officers, public defenders and 
advocates for victims of domestic violence in what I can only describe as an 
extraordinary (and encouraging) session of consciousness-raising and 
goal-setting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ballrooms, victims of domestic violence recounted appalling court 
experiences, batterers spoke of breaking through denial, judges talked of 
social commitment, prosecutors and public defenders discussed the use of expert 
witnesses and protective orders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meeting rooms, county teams met to create plans to improve the ways 
courts respond to cases of family violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For L.A. Superior Court Presiding Judge Robert Mallano, the conference was an 
eye-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time," he said, "I could put myself in the shoes of a battered 
woman, how she feels petrified about dying, how she feels shamed, how she has 
no money, no friends and no place to go. And the shocking thing is, there is so 
little support. Someone at the conference said that we shelter more animals 
than human beings. That really brought it home for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not without its share of highly publicized problems, L.A. 
County is recognized as a leader in the movement to coordinate services for 
victims of domestic violence (and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, among others, was 
praised in several quarters for his advocacy on behalf of victims). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we are light-years ahead of other counties," said Alana Bowman, who 
supervises the domestic-violence unit of the Los Angeles city attorney's office 
and whose profile increased exponentially after Nicole Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some smaller counties are seriously constrained by staffing and budget issues 
-- and will, for instance, issue temporary restraining orders only one day a 
week. Thus, a woman who seeks court protection on a Monday may be told to 
return Thursday, by which time the courts could be dealing with homicide 
instead of spouse abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila James Kuehl, the women's rights attorney and Assembly candidate, 
offered a classic example of how the system can conspire against victims of 
family violence. She repeated a story told to her by the police chief of a 
small San Joaquin Valley town: "He said, 'We have no jail, so we have to take 
people to county jail, and we have to pay the county for each incarceration, so 
it is a disincentive for our police force to arrest batterers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Kuehl, who has trained judges on domestic-violence issues, the conference 
was about "raising the consciousness about the connection between court 
procedures and putting battered women in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Though judges are allergic to appearing one-sided on any issue, she said, how 
they respond to domestic violence can make a huge difference -- and not just in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their own example in taking this seriously sets a tone," said Kuehl, "not 
just for their courts, but for their entire communities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, like anyone else, are often unschooled in the dynamics of domestic 
violence. Judges, like anyone else, wonder why victims stay, why they refuse to 
press charges, why they don't want to testify against their partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, like anyone else, often have trouble understanding that lesbians and 
gay men suffer from domestic violence and that when a gay man batters his 
partner, it is not "mutual combat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges are often viewed by battered-women's advocates as being unaware and 
uneducated," Bowman said. "Sure, judges are expected to be neutral. But just 
because judges cannot be advocates doesn't mean they have to be ignorant. We 
are trying to educate them." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a bill asking the Judicial Council to require judges to undergo 
domestic violence training was passed by the Legislature. The council has not 
yet acted on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Domestic violence is a serious issue that permeates the entire law system," 
said Judge Mallano. "There is a need for judges to understand the plight of the 
battered person and to understand why someone batters their spouse. And judges 
need the training necessary to do a good job. But I don't like this 'required' 
thing. We should offer judges training." 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect to Judge Mallano, I bet the judges who would refuse the 
offer are the ones who need it most.

POWTER KEG; SHE'S NO LONGER SATISFIED WITH MERELY STOPPING THE INSANITY. THE, 
UH, PASSIONATE HEALTH MAVEN BLASTS INTO YOUR HOME NEXT WEEK ON HER OWN TV TALK 
SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the applause from the studio audience finally dies down, Susan Powter 
gets some congratulations from the man upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not God, exactly, but Executive Producer Woody Fraser, whose voice comes 
through Powter's tiny earphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Woody, thank you very much," she says into her body mike, although 
it looks as if she's speaking to no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaming, she turns to her staff and squeals, "My daddy said I did a good job! 
</P>
<P>
 "God," she adds at a normal octave, "I've just gone back 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a professional motivator appreciates a little boost once in awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know the 36-year-old woman about to launch "The Susan Powter 
Show," then you haven't been channel surfing. Her "Stop the Insanity" is the 
tsunami of infomercials. Men who push products by torching car hoods or baking 
cream puffs in hot-air ovens are ripples by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 She's that wild woman with the spiky platinum buzz cut who jumps around 
yelling, "Fat makes you fat!" or "You've gotta eat, you've gotta breathe and 
you've gotta move!" Then, the next minute, she's the girlfriend who makes the 
raw confession that she once wanted to kill her ex-husband and stresses that 
she's passionate, not angry.  
</P>
<P>
 Using straightforward information on food and exercise -- info, she admits, 
that isn't original -- she propels her followers, mostly women, into health, 
self-esteem and empowerment. Don't want those eight glasses of water a day? 
Don't want to munch on carrot sticks? Don't want to take an aerobics class from 
a perky Barbie doll in a thong leotard? Fine. Neither does she. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have heard her story and believed have snatched up her $79.80 
infomercial package -- including audio tapes, a video, a fat caliper and 
various guidebooks -- to the tune of more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenom has become the stuff of People magazine stories. Anyone vaguely 
familiar with Powter probably knows this much: She's a former Texas homemaker 
whose white-picket-fence life exploded when her husband left her to raise two 
young children on her own. She ate herself into a 260-pound stupor before she 
"figured it out." That is, she discovered that low-fat foods and a basic 
exercise program were her salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 But her story doesn't end minus 133 pounds later. There was a stint as a 
topless dancer, the time she was kept by a married man, the tummy tuck, the 
exercise studio, seminars, books, videos, the infomercial, a second marriage, 
the brother who blabbed to the tabloids that she never was that fat (she 
maintains she was). 
</P>
<P>
 And now the talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband said to me the other night, we're lying in bed and he's flicking 
through the channels, and he said, 'God, they'd give anybody a damn talk show 
these days!' And I said, ' Thank you! Thank you, honey, I appreciate it.' 
Actually he said 'any moron .' " 
</P>
<P>
 So here she is, in her partially furnished office in the Santa Monica studios 
where the show is taped before a audience. Sitting behind a rustic dark-wood 
desk decorated with a neo-romantic lamp, Powter exhibits the same unfettered 
energy as she does on television. She goes from zero to 60 in 1.3 seconds and 
seldom brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out of the womb with energy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She gestures with hands that end in fake coral-colored nails, her words 
tumbling out in great, long rushes. When Powter gets angry -- er, passionate -- 
the tendons in her neck stand out. Pushing out so much verbiage at once often 
results in incomplete sentences, even words. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I always do when I start explaining what the show is," she says, "is 
tell them what it isn't. There will be no tabloid issues at all . There is no 
exploiting people at all . And there's no yelling and screaming and fighting 
and if that doesn't fly on TV, it ain't gonna fly." 
</P>
<P>
 She's banking that American women are tired of watching people with 
over-teased hair blather about their addictions to phone sex. Her show will be 
celeb-free and low on experts: "Oh, please. We've been hearing from experts for 
years and it hasn't done us a damn bit of good. Women are experts. I want to 
talk to a woman who's gone through it." 
</P>
<P>
 And topics? Everything from women and heart attacks to the rain forest to 
paper versus plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A million issues. A ba zillion . Funny? I'm going to a construction site -- 
this is the truth -- I am getting up on the beam with the guys and I want to 
see what the hell they're whistling at. I've got the hat, the lunch box -- I'm 
telling you, I'm doing it. I'm so afraid of heights you don't know. Faaaabulous 
shows. I don't know why anybody didn't think of this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Fraser, a veteran of the "Home Show" and "Good Morning 
America," calls Powter "lightning in a bottle" and adds, "I've put a lot of 
people in that host seat, and she's the fastest study." 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who has already been a target of a "Saturday Night Live" sketch, 
featuring Kirstie Alley in a blonde fright wig, is the hyperbolic Powter in 
danger of becoming a parody of herself? 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get that successful in eight or nine years down the line, great," 
Fraser says with a chuckle. "But you know, she's going to have to fight that 
fight, and as long as she remains really interested in helping people change 
their lives, then she will not become a caricature of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 That life now involves shuttling between Dallas and Los Angeles with her 
family, sons Damien, 11, and Kiel, 10, from her first marriage, and husband 
Lincoln Apeland. They recently bought a home in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 When in Texas, they share a duplex with her ex-husband and his wife so their 
kids can see both parents. She turned a bad divorce into a livable situation -- 
look for it as a show topic. 
</P>
<P>
 And six years into husband No. 2, marriage still baffles her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand marriage," she says. "I'm not sure that I'm very good at 
it. . . . I'm learning how to be married and it's very hard for me. I'm not 
that good at it, and he knows it. I mean, I don't scream 'wifey-poo,' whatever 
that means. He's got his own thing, he's a musician, he does his own thing, I 
do my own thing. I'm not sure that I've decided on it yet. I'm not sure it's my 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Work is definitely her thing. But juggling a family, workouts and a TV show 
isn't enough for Powter. She has written another book, this one titled "Food." 
It will have her trademark no-nonsense information about nutrition and diet, 
plus low-fat recipes.

<P>
 "I've been working on this for eight months every day from 5:30 in the 
morning," she says. "Every day. I love this book. I love it! I can't tell you 
how excited I am. Fabulous. 'Food,' by Susan Powter. That's the title. 'Food,' 
by Susan Powter. I'm very excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I interviewed . . . I can't even tell you. I mean, books? You don't know. 
Interviews? You don't know. Researching and doing and going and talking to 
dairy farmers and everything. The FDA. We've got it all here. We took all the 
mishegosh, the muck, that everybody is confu -- I mean, HDL, LDL, cholesterol, 
saturated fat, oil, good, bad, boil, fry, what do we do with this? I broke it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 That ability to relate the basics to her audience has given Powter staying 
power, says Dr. David Heber, chief of clinical nutrition at the UCLA School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her greatest asset is that people can connect with her, and I think that's an 
important part of the therapy of obesity -- there are both psychological and 
physical aspects," he says. "She is honest and upfront in that she does not 
claim to be a scientific expert. She's taking bits and pieces from the 
scientific literature and paraphrasing it correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, because her program is grounded in common sense, Powter has not drawn 
the criticism heaped on some weight-loss gurus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swear to God, you'll understand everything when you read this book, I'm 
telling you, you're going to love it," she says, slapping the stack of "Food" 
pages next to her laptop. "And then you make your own decisions because it's 
your decision with your body. Have you ever seen cuter kids than this in your 
life? I just wanted to ask you," she says, suddenly grabbing a picture of her 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "In your life have you ever seen cuter kids than this? Now they're 10 and 11, 
they were, like, 5 and 6 here. But have you ever? I mean, c'mon. They're very 
cute kids." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Susan Powter viewers will get beginning Monday (5 p.m. on KCAL) in 
their living rooms -- the Susan Powter who will talk about anything, from her 
kids to her failed marriage to her obesity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the time when she was too fat and unhealthy to play in the park with 
her kids is still very real in her mind. So is the memory of being too broke to 
pay the electric bill. She taps into the past and her emotions easily, as if 
they sat in a shallow well. 
</P>
<P>
 When she brings up her problems, women listen. They understand the pain of 
being left for another woman, of hurting so much that they stuff themselves, 
and hurt more and stuff more. 
</P>
<P>
 Powter might not be where she is without Rusty Robertson, the 
manager/publicist who took on the struggling aerobics-studio owner back in 
Dallas. The two are practically joined at the hip, business-wise and 
emotionally. They even have the same rapid-fire patter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the planner of the future for us, and Susan makes the best of where we 
are," says Robertson, a former actress. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls their first meeting: "(Susan) walked in, bald, in a black leather 
jacket, looking great. She sat right in front of my desk and said, 'I've got 
this program and I'm saving people's lives. . . . Susan had been literally 
living below the poverty level. . . . This is a woman who truly lived on 
nothing. That's why I respect Susan more than any other woman in the world, 
including my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 With Robertson tending the big picture, Powter can work on the here and now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a balance now that I think a lot about," Powter says. "I have a 
friend staying with me for a week and . . . I spent the afternoon shopping with 
her, and that was hard for me and I told her that. I realized that I'd become 
very selfish with my time, which made me think -- is that good, is that bad, is 
that right? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically I don't ever want to stop working on stuff. The day I stop working 
I'm going to be 10 feet under. . . . The day that it's all OK is the day I want 
to have a Mack truck hit me. I mean, it's not OK. It never will be all OK. I 
never want it to be all OK. I want all of it, everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "The other day I went for a walk and I just said, 'Wow. I love this and I want 
everything and I'll take the good and the bad, you know? Who the hell knows who 
I was talking, to, I was probably talking to a ficus bush. But I mean it. I 
want . . . I want. . . . I'm willing to take the responsibility. I will work on 
the bad. I'll work toward the good, but I want it all, I just . . . c'mon, 
'cause I like it."

THE HOLIEST MOMENT OF THE HIGH HOLY DAYS; SUNG TO A HAUNTING MELODY, THE KOL 
NIDRE PRAYER MARKS THE START OF YOM KIPPUR, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. IT HELPS JEWS 
ALL OVER THE WORLD TO RECONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR 
HISTORY.

 Cantor Laurie Rimland-Bonn remembers her childhood feelings as her cantor sang 
Kol Nidre, the prayer chanted in Yom Kippur services tonight at the most solemn 
moment of the Jewish year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter what the words meant," says the musical leader of Temple 
Emanuel in Burbank. "What I got was the feeling that oozed out of him when he 
sang it. It was awesome. It felt like God was actually going to come into the 
room and scoop us up." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the one thing everyone can identify. It's been heard generation through 
generation," says Rimland-Bonn about the prayer, which is chanted just before 
sundown to begin the Day of Atonement and brings more Jews to synagogues than 
on any other day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all cry. They weep. It touches them. I know because I used to watch my 
grandma cry. The first notes would come out and she'd be bawling." 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer also connects Jews to their history. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people hear it, they are somewhere else," says Rabbi Richard N. Levy, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Hillel Council for college students. 
"They are back 2,000 or 5,000 years ago. They are at the Western Wall. They are 
in Spain during the Inquisition. Or they're in their grandmother's or 
grandfather's little shuls (synagogues). It's tied to memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Kol Nidre is a short, dry, legalistic prayer, prosaically written in Hebrew 
and Aramaic, the language of Palestinian Jews at the time of Christ. It has 
survived centuries of opposition not only by enemies and detractors of Judaism 
but by eminent rabbis, who challenged its basic concept of a blanket annulment 
of sacred vows, scholar Herman Kieval has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jews -- and most Gentiles -- don't understand its purpose, which is to 
ask God's forgiveness of promises they are unable to keep. The prayer deals 
with vows to be more forgiving, charitable or loving -- in fact, any covenant 
to improve an individual or community. But it refers only to promises made to 
God. Vows to people can only be forgiven by the other party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meaning has to do with confronting your failures," says Rabbi Edward M. 
Feinstein of Valley Beth Shalom synagogue in Encino. "You are saying 'These are 
all the things I tried to do this year and didn't get to do, and I ask your 
release from my promises.' 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of getting another chance. If you are willing to make a step 
toward God and say 'I admit I failed' and ask forgiveness, God is willing to 
forgive. But the law says you have to try hard to fulfill your promises." 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer, which will help draw about half of Southern California's 660,000 
Jews to synagogues tonight, remains a unifying force for Jews around the world. 
"It's a mysterious, mystical thing that thousands of Jews who have no other 
connection to their faith come to temple on this holiday to hear this prayer," 
Feinstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer's power comes from its haunting melody and long, if unproven, 
association with Jewish martyrdom, rabbis say. It has been chanted for 
centuries in a solemn, moving ceremony at the opening of Yom Kippur services 
and reconnects Jews to their families and to a history entering year 5755. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps create a "transcendent sense of being in the presence of God," 
Feinstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure they hear the prayer at the sundown services, workers often leave 
jobs early. Many join extended families in a reflective meal before traveling 
to the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You enter the synagogue on the holiest day of the year," says Rabbi Carole 
Meyers of Temple Sinai in Glendale. "The congregation stands. The lights are 
dimmed. With great ceremony, the ark where the Torah is kept is opened. The 
Torah is dressed in white, which it is not on other days of the year. It's a 
symbol of the purity we're hoping to achieve during the High Holy Day period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Torah is removed from the ark. In some synagogues the Torah is carried 
around the congregation so the members can kiss it and begin the process of 
asking forgiveness. In others, leaders hold the Torah while the congregation 
sings." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point the cantor chants Kol Nidre three times: first, very softly, 
like one who hesitates to ask God for a favor. Then, again, in a somewhat 
louder voice. And finally, with a raised, confident voice, like someone 
accustomed to being a member of the king's court. Many in the congregation 
quietly hum, but otherwise the synagogue is quiet. The focus is on the Torah 
and the cantor's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The chant is sung in perhaps the most haunting melody in Jewish music. "The 
melody captures sadness, faithfulness, suffering, hope, promise -- the saga of 
Jewish survival over the millennia," says Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers says the melody, composed by a cantor in 16th-Century Germany, "is 
intended to break your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A chant so eagerly anticipated by the congregation places a heavy 
responsibility on cantors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost feels as if it doesn't matter how you do anything else during the 
rest of the year," says Cantor Joseph Gole of Congregation Mogen David in West 
Los Angeles. "There's a certain nervousness and trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you start your service with Kol Nidre, it isn't something you build 
up to. You definitely have to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally to 
start on that high pitch. It's the last thing I rehearse with the choir before 
I walk into the service." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantors must ask God to forgive all previous vows so members of the 
congregation can start over, adds Rimland-Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wear a white robe for Rosh Hashanah, but when you start putting on the 
white robe for Yom Kippur, it's a little different. It becomes awesome," she 
says. "You're the person leading the congregation and you're there to motivate 
them and help them attain spiritual heights. I go with much trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of myself like a little piece of lint on the floor and here's me and 
here's God," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I like to close everything off and go in blankly so I can just 
concentrate on the moment." That requires quiet before the service. "There's 
usually a lot going on and I try to be by myself. I go in my office and shut 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many hearing the prayer will be thinking about medieval Jewish martyrs who 
swore allegiance to another religion to save their lives and chanted Kol Nidre 
to ask forgiveness of those vows. This tradition "has wound itself into the 
meaning, the emotion of the prayer," even though it is unproven, says Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, medieval enemies and detractors used Kol Nidre to vilify Jews in 
Christian Europe. Jewish law clearly stated that God could forgive only vows to 
God, not between people, but enemies insisted that Jews could perjure 
themselves in dealings with Christians and clear their consciences merely by 
reciting Kol Nidre on Yom Kippur, Kieval has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jews were uneasy about Kol Nidre for the same reason. In 12th-Century 
Spain, a critic "declared the recitation of Kol Nidre to be dangerous, since 
ignorant Jews might erroneously conclude that all their vows and oaths were 
annulled through this declaration," Kieval says. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispute also arose about whether Jews should ask to be released from past or 
future vows. Sephardic Jews ask forgiveness of promises made over the past 
year; Ashkenazi Jews seek annulment for vows to be made over the next 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year Kol Nidre will be especially poignant to many, says Feinstein. "We 
have all been through the trauma of the earthquake. We have a better sense of 
our lives in the balance. We all looked inside of who we are and what we want 
to do in life. This traumatic experience fits in with the theme of the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "On another level it seems to me the dominant theme in the media and culture 
this year has been responsibility: Who is responsible for what, and are people 
ever held responsible for what they do? That also is part of our holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally you have a real prospect of peace in Israel. We have been running for 
1,000 years and for the first time there is the possibility of security, safety 
and peace. I look at myself as part of a long chain of history, and that is 
what I felt when I saw Yitzhak Rabin shaking hands with Yasser Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 The peace process may demonstrate the importance of Kol Nidre, says Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of vows were exchanged. Maybe some were harder to keep than others. 
Once again, reality fights vows. It shows that it's important to keep 
struggling, to keep hoping, to keep working. Serious vows may take longer than 
a year to fulfill." Seeking a Fresh Start With God 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an English translation of the Kol Nidre prayer: 
</P>
<P>
 "All vows, bonds, promises, obligations and oaths (to God) wherewith we have 
vowed, sworn and bound ourselves from this Day of Atonement unto the next Day 
of Atonement, may it come unto us for good; lo, of all these, we repent us in 
them. They shall be absolved, released, annulled, made void and of none effect; 
they shall not be binding nor shall they have any power. Our vows (to God) 
shall not be vows; our bonds shall not be bonds; and our oaths shall not be 
oaths."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; CRITICIZING THE BATTERER WON'T HELP THE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the O.J. Simpson case has taught us anything, it is that domestic violence 
is more than a private family matter. We know we should help when we see a 
friend or relative locked in an abusive relationship. But most of us don't know 
how. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's advocates say understanding and support are critical, but cite common 
mistakes made by family and friends when they try to help: criticizing the 
perpetrator, trying to make decisions for the victim and losing patience. 
</P>
<P>
 A 60-year-old Southland grandmother said she learned her daughter was being 
abused after her son-in-law hit her at a family gathering. "My husband and I 
were real hesitant to get involved at first. It was their situation," she said. 
"But once she started telling us what was happening, my husband said we'll do 
whatever we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 They confronted him at the party. "He was crying. He told me how much he loved 
his family. He promised he would go and get counseling. Of course he did none 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly learned that getting away is more difficult than the standard 
talk show advice: If they hit you once, leave. "People don't understand you 
don't walk away with several children," she said. Her daughter was too beaten 
down emotionally to cope with her domineering husband. She had no financial 
resources of her own and because their home was jointly owned, she could not 
qualify for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband continued hitting her with his fists, throwing her around, 
threatening her life. The children would call them for help during fights. 
Between incidents, he'd bring flowers, buy presents. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors knew, but sided with him, the grandmother said. "She's not good 
with people. He's fabulous. If you came over and met him, you'd think he's 
wonderful. It is very scary. That is what killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she made what experts say is a common mistake. She advised her 
daughter to placate him by not angering him and improving her homemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Los Angeles psychiatrist Marjorie Braude, who chairs the Los 
Angeles City Domestic Violence Task Force, the two most important things 
friends and relatives can do is let the victim know they understand the 
problem, and provide them with hot-line and shelter numbers. "Very often the 
victim is not ready at that moment, but if she has that number in her purse, 
when that moment comes, she will use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to empower the woman to make decisions for herself, not to replace 
the batterer with someone else who's controlling her, said Rita Smith of the 
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, it's better to talk about how she deserves better treatment than to 
bad-mouth the batterer, Smith said. "The more you talk about what a bad guy he 
is, it puts her in a position of having to defend him because she chose him and 
she loves him still." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, an offer of refuge can be critical. In Los Angeles, where there are 
43,000 emergency 911 calls each year involving domestic abuse, there are only 
400 shelter beds. But it is also risky. He can track her down, vandalize the 
property or harass the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 After the grandparents called 911 during one fight, the husband was furious 
and threatened to hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the grandmother said she paid for several months rent for a house for 
their daughter and her children, enabling them to move out. Another relative 
persuaded her women's club to contribute $300 a month for food and clothing. 
The grandmother said the couple may soon be divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles can make it easy for friends and family to get discouraged. Said 
Smith: "When people think like that, I want them to remember the thousands of 
battered women every day who manage to get over those obstacles. Take a rest, a 
timeout and start working on it again. There are women alive today who wouldn't 
have been if friends and family weren't there to help."

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; GRANDPARENTS TAKING ON PARENTAL ROLES MORE OFTEN

 Grandparents assumed the roles of parents in an additional 150,000 cases last 
year, the American Assn. of Retired Persons reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of children raised by their grandparents in households with neither 
parent rose to 1,017,000 in 1993, contrasted with 867,000 in 1992, the AARP 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That rise, the organization said, is significant because it places an 
additional burden on grandparents who are already faced with problems of their 
own such as failing health or limited income. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP study, "Going It Alone: A Closer Look at Grandparents Parenting 
Grandchildren," also found that in most cases in which grandparents were the 
primary care givers, women were more often parenting grandchildren than were 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circumstances have placed an enormous responsibility on grandparents," said 
Bernice Shepherd of the AARP at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents are assuming responsibility for many reasons, including AIDS, 
substance abuse, incarceration, divorce or battering-related deaths that affect 
the children's parents, she said. 1st Semester Can Be Scary for College 
Freshmen, Parents 
</P>
<P>
 Going away to college can be both frightening and exciting. But kids -- and 
their parents -- can survive that difficult first semester, says Muhlenberg 
College's director of counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most high school seniors are fearful of leaving their old friends and scared 
they won't meet new people," says Linda Bips, director for Counseling and 
Development at the Allentown, Pa., college. "They don't realize that their 
world is about to open up with new experiences and friendships." 
</P>
<P>
 Bips says the start of college is also a difficult time for parents. She has 
this advice: "Try to step back and believe in your son or daughter's ability to 
be an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 And for college freshmen, she has these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * It's OK to feel scared, lonely and homesick during those first days and 
weeks on campus.

'90S FAMILY; TEEN ROMANCES; WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR KID BRINGS HOME A DUBIOUS 
FRIEND OR MATE? BITE YOUR TONGUE, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Who would ever believe that the teen-age daughter of a devoutly religious 
parent would bring home a boyfriend who affected a skinhead look? 
</P>
<P>
 Sherill Sedillo would. Her daughter did. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we pushed her to give him up, the more she rebelled to be with him," 
says Sedillo, of Capistrano Beach, an ethnic Jew who has converted to 
Christianity. "We did forbid the relationship, at times, but she would just 
sneak out. What could we have done, other than lock her in her room? What could 
you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so began another round in that balancing act between anxious parents and 
adolescents who are forging their first serious romantic relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 What parents do -- or don't do -- when their kids stroll in with that 
unpalatable someone can set the tone for either stubborn rebellion or a brief 
infatuation, psychologists and parents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nit-pick the kid about body piercings and purple hair and the teen alliance 
may grow stronger for the attack. The parent who resists hitting the panic 
button but watches, listens a lot and talks a little is less likely to be 
slammed out of their teen's life, says Mary Collier, a licensed clinical social 
worker for the Family Service Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceed as if you have "a huge piece of duct tape across your mouth," Collier 
says. "Start listening, because all parents lecture and they just go on and 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally parents don't want to dismiss their hunches or concerns, Collier 
says. There are some basic and obvious warning signs of trouble, like extreme 
withdrawal from family, refusal to talk, truancy, secretiveness and sudden 
abandonment of all old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But snap judgments made on the basis of appearances rather than behavior and 
actions can spark a battle. Hold that duct tape image long enough to hear the 
kid out after a few questions have been asked. Who is this kid? What does he or 
she like to do? How did you meet? When are you inviting them over? 
</P>
<P>
 The latter may embarrass teens. But Collier, who has raised four teen-agers to 
adulthood, suggests an age-old lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't hurt to have food around," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And space. Parents should say hello but keep small talk brief and find 
something to keep themselves busy and out of hovering range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allow them to just hang out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious parents might also want to look within themselves for the roots of 
their worries. A child's first steps into romance often coincide with the 
parents' middle-age rumblings, says adolescent expert Laurence Steinberg of 
Temple University. Steinberg's newest book, "Crossing Paths: How Your Child's 
Adolescence Triggers Your Own Crisis" (Simon & Shuster, 1994) explores how 
adolescence affects parents who may be re-evaluating their lives and feeling 
pangs of regret or loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "These big steps in the child's life are big steps in the parent's life, too," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In his studies, Steinberg found that fathers were particularly reminded of 
their age and midlife sags and bulges when their sons started going out with 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "On some level fathers may be somewhat jealous of their sons' freedom," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't necessarily mean that they are ripe for affairs or truly want to be 
young again, but it can exacerbate whatever midlife drama may already be 
underway, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a reminder, a very powerful reminder of one's lost youth. And I think 
it happens for mothers and daughters, too," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The coincidence of midlife and adolescence under one roof can be a collision, 
or an opportunity, Steinberg says. Parents who embraced the transition as one 
of life's normal events, generally coped well and thrived. They didn't 
anticipate extraordinary woes, so the woes didn't materialize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the type of parents who set limits, rules and curfews and talked 
about behaviors, rather than people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is a serious situation, whether it be safety, drugs or crime, then I 
think you sit your child down and talk about specific behaviors. Don't try to 
cast aspersions on the dating partner. But rather say, 'We have rules around 
here about driving and drinking or curfews,' or whatever. . . . You want your 
child to understand that it's the behavior and not the person you're objecting 
to," Steinberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Anytime the chance arises, parents can also talk in general about 
relationships, without endorsing or rejecting the sweetheart of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are still trying to figure out how to be in a relationship," he says. 
"Take it as an opportunity to discuss relationships. What's a good 
relationship? How do you tell if a relationship is getting bad? Kids are 
wondering about these things. Their parents may have some pretty good advice 
and some pretty good experience to draw on. Kids on the younger side of 
adolescence are usually interested in hearing about their parents' 
experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 And how. The Wilsons of San Juan Capistrano make dinner-table conversation and 
discussion a high priority, in part to gently feed their children their own 
life lessons and values. Joanne Wilson and her husband both were previously 
married and often share their own early mistakes in dating and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are always all ears to hear about your mistakes," Wilson says. "I think, 
too, that they see that we were human. But they also don't like us to get too 
preachy. We try to make our little statements quick and short." 
</P>
<P>
 One mother of two daughters used a variation of that tack. Her younger 
daughter dated a boy she suspected was using drugs, although there was nothing 
she could prove. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we had a lot more conversations with our kids about life choices and how 
even hanging around someone can be dangerous, without trying to point a 
particular finger at this kid," says Bonnie, who didn't want her last name 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year after the boy had been dropped by the girl, Bonnie's daughter 
asked why her parents hadn't forbidden the romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her what would she have done if I had said, 'You can't see him 
anymore, he's a bad choice.' She said she probably wouldn't have listened. I 
said that's what I thought, too. She said, 'I'm going to have to remember all 
these things when I'm a mom.' That was kind of neat," Bonnie says. 
"Unfortunately, you're just never sure you're doing the right thing. We just 
hoped so." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherill Sedillo thought she was doing the right thing, too. She and her 
husband were convinced the boy was wrong for her daughter. He was older. He 
hadn't cut all the ties with his skinhead friends. And before it was over her 
daughter was a teen mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the luxury of hindsight, Sedillo says she's not sure there's 
anything she could have done differently. It was scary. It was frustrating. But 
she discovered that a parent's disapproval can be the surest cement for a teen 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Romeo and Juliet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that if you hold them too tightly, you just lose them 
altogether," she says.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: AND THE THEME WAS BRAZILIAN FRIENDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Monday's premiere of HBO's "The Burning Season" at the Mann Bruin 
Theatre, with an after party at the Armand Hammer Museum. The film is based on 
the true story of Chico Mendes, who was murdered for trying to stop the 
torching of Brazilian rain forests. "A great deal of Brazil is on fire right 
now," said director John Frankenheimer. "It gives a real urgency to this 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's star, Raul Julia; co-stars Edward James Olmos, Sonia 
Braga, Esai Morales and Nigel Havers; director (or "field marshal," as one 
actor referred to him) Frankenheimer; plus 1,200 of the Hollywood ecosystem's 
finest including Norman Lear, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Loggia, Tracy Scoggins, 
Richard Zanuck, Terry Semel, Rob Freidman and HBO execs Michael Fuchs, Bob 
Cooper and Hutch Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Not the Snakes That Get You, It's the Burnt Toast: Co-star Kamala Dawson 
said the Mexican rain forest shooting locale "wasn't as treacherous as it 
looked." However she did say, "room service was a scary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: One woman wondered why, "it was necessary for the scene with the 
nude prostitutes to be 10 minutes long." Her male friend said, "Well, it 
depends on how you feel about ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 Scariest New Party Trend: Women who smoke cigars. Not just little cigarillos, 
but big hulking Havanas. Don't look for the fad to last -- nothing makes a 
woman look more like Rush Limbaugh than smoking a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: As usual, lots of black. Whether this was worn in remembrance of 
charred rain forest land is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocabulary: "Brazilian friendly." This was the phrase used by one organizer to 
describe the considerable effort, including two truckloads of palm and ginger 
trees plus a major supply of orchids, to transform the Hammer's courtyard into 
something forest-like. The irony that Hammer ran an oil company was not lost on 
some guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This is an honorable film, cast and acted out by people who have a 
right to do it," said executive producer David Puttnam. "The world's entitled 
to have a Third World hero who isn't depicted by a Brit or an American." 
</P>
<P>
 You Can't Please Everyone: Four members from two rain forest action groups 
held banners and passed out literature protesting the use of tropical timber in 
building the film's sets. "It's not true," said Puttnam. "But if this is the 
issue they regard as pivotal, as opposed to the potential for this movie to 
raise the profile of this desperate situation, then their group is never going 
to have more than four members."

 GOING CORPORATE: One area where Latino activists want to see more progress: 
representation on corporate boards. But today, they'll celebrate what progress 
has been made. Twelve Latino leaders who serve as directors on boards of major 
corporations will be honored at a reception at the Fluor Corp. in Irvine. . . . 
Among them: Ignacio E. Lozano of Newport Beach, editor of La Opinion, a daily 
Spanish-language newspaper in Los Angeles. He serves on four boards, including 
Walt Disney Co. and BankAmerica Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 MORNING WORKOUT: Fire officials from Garden Grove, Fullerton, Orange and 
Anaheim gathered at 4 a.m. Tuesday to witness Anaheim's switch to its new, 
regional $1.5-million state-of-the-art fire dispatch system, designed to 
improve response time to those four cities. . . . They didn't have to wait long 
to see if it worked -- the first call came in 10 minutes later. Anaheim Fire 
Chief Jeff Bowman says the city hopes that other neighboring cities eventually 
will join its dispatch service. 
</P>
<P>
 BUD'S SHOP TALK: With an alcoholic mother, Marlon Brando writes in his new 
autobiography, he rarely received a word of praise in his difficult childhood. 
But the famous actor writes fondly about two years he spent at Lathrop 
Intermediate School in Santa Ana. . . . A shop teacher there -- officials say 
it was the late Burton Rowley -- was the first to ever boast about him. Writes 
Brando: "His words of encouragement affect me to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN TO THE BONE: When the Red Cross makes its latest public stops -- Ingram 
Micro in Santa Ana today, and Hewlett-Packard in Fullerton on Thursday -- it's 
more than just your blood they're after -- it's your bone marrow. . . . It has 
a shortage of marrow donors -- primarily needed for leukemia patients. . . . 
"We only take a couple of test tubes of blood, not a pint," says project 
director Bunnie Foxcroft. "We don't call you to donate marrow until there's a 
match with someone who needs it, and that often takes years."

 BURNING BRUSHES: Not every brush fire is cause for alarm. Firefighters often 
burn wildland brush on purpose to renew plant growth, enhance wildlife and 
prevent huge fires. It's all explained in today's Valley Briefing (B5). . . . 
Controlled burns, however, can't be conducted on "no-burn days" (above), when 
air quality is unacceptable. Overall, wild-land fires account for only 1% of 
County Fire Department responses. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: He was behind the plate for the Northridge Little League team 
that captured the national title. But on Tuesday, catcher Matt Cunningham was 
doing the same thing as millions of his peers. He was in school, behind a desk 
at Nobel Junior High. Worse yet, the eighth-grader was given homework on his 
first day. . . . "We weren't ready to come back to school so soon," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 BUNCH OF TRAFFIC: For years, the Brady Bunch tied up a generation in front of 
the tube. On Tuesday, it tied up traffic. Signs -- props for an upcoming film 
based on the TV series -- slowed traffic on the westbound Ventura Freeway (B1). 
. . . The movie was filmed this summer all over the Valley: Taft High, 
Birmingham High, a Northridge butcher shop and several homes in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 POLO PREVIEW: Young athletes don't take up water polo for the money. But that 
doesn't matter to Notre Dame High's Chris Crowley, who's off to another great 
start -- 12 goals in two games. . . . Valley Sports profiles the new water polo 
season (C6). 
</P>
<P>
 SIDELINES: Cal State Northridge football coach Bob Burt compares opening night 
to giving birth. Agoura High water polo goalie Chris Miko scores an incredible 
goal. A Notre Dame field-goal kicker leads his team to victory. . . . These are 
just some of the items and notes in "Sidelines," a new, twice-weekly column 
about local sports that debuts today in Valley Sports (C6). No-Burn Days 
</P>
<P>
 The number of days AQMD designates as "no-burn days" has declined over the 
years, an indicator of improving air quality. No-burn days since 1990: 1990: 70 
1991: 79 1992: 62 1993: 45 1994*: 46 * Through Aug. 25

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; RIVAL SYSTEMS FOR VCR 
'REPLACEMENT' COULD SPARK STANDARDS WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Now that the videocassette recorder has become a fixture in American living 
rooms, consumer electronics companies and movie studios are hatching plans to 
supplant it with a newer and allegedly better technology: the digital video 
disc player. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics are expected to announce as early as this 
week a jointly developed technical specification for the new discs, also known 
as high-density compact discs. They will be able to store an entire feature 
film and promise higher quality, greater flexibility and possibly lower prices 
than videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Toshiba Corp. and Time Warner Inc. are trying to rally support for a 
competing high-density CD technology -- raising the prospect of an ugly 
standards battle similar to the infamous Betamax-VHS war of the 1970s. Toshiba 
and Time Warner say their system can hold even more data, but they face an 
uphill battle against the two companies that have controlled the development of 
compact disc technology since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie and electronics industry executives agree that a standards battle is not 
in anyone's interest. And they are united in the belief that a new home 
entertainment system, which could be on the market by next year, has plenty of 
profit potential -- even though it might not bring many benefits to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronics manufacturers hope the digital video disc player will eventually 
displace the VCR, just as audio compact disc machines have supplanted record 
players in nearly half of U.S. homes over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And the movie studios, facing a declining video rental market as cable and 
satellite television systems begin to offer a wide menu of movies on demand, 
think consumers -- who rejected the once-promising laser disc technology and 
have generally opted to rent rather than buy videocassettes -- will be much 
more likely to purchase compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual collaboration, a committee of representatives from nearly every 
major movie studio met last month to offer a list of their priorities to the 
hardware manufacturers developing the new medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a digital video disc solution is presented in a way that large numbers of 
consumers look at it and say, 'This is better than tape and better than laser,' 
then it becomes a mass product opportunity for people such as us who control 
libraries to sell the films all over again," said MGM/UA Home Entertainment 
President Richard Cohen. "The best-case scenario is it does for movie 
catalogues what CD did for audio catalogues." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's standard compact discs hold about 72 minutes of music; through 
compression technology, film studios have been able to squeeze 74 minutes of a 
movie at VHS resolution onto one of the shiny platters. In contrast, the new CD 
-- which spins twice as fast -- would hold 135 minutes of video at higher 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical format, which involves crowding the microscopic pits on the discs 
closer together, is also likely to become the basis for the next generation of 
CD-ROM discs for personal computers. It might also become a new standard for 
music CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 But many consumers might resent being asked to invest in yet another new 
technology -- which itself might become obsolete in a few years when a 
recordable CD is marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dueling formats would almost certainly slow sales. Some in the industry are 
critical of Philips and Sony for not publishing their specifications, a step 
that might help establish a standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equipment vendors, movie studios and player manufacturers have pressured 
Philips, the de facto licensing authority, to accelerate release of their HDCD 
standard" said Ralph Oshiro, director of marketing communications for Santa Fe 
Springs-based disc equipment manufacturer Optical Disc Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philips officials said they have been holding back on an announcement as 
they try to reach consensus with potential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone in the industry knows that a standards war would be a war with 
losers," said Jacques Heemskerk, Philips' project manager for writable optical 
technologies, who is trying to hammer out compromises with rival HDCD 
developers. "There is a strong realization that if there would be two proposed 
systems, consumers will say it's better not to buy. It would be a real failing 
in our industry if we could not come to a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high. Sony and Philips have had a virtual lock on the audio 
compact disc market over the past decade. Their practice of cross-licensing 
patents and charging licensing fees to other manufacturers is currently under 
an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department -- a development that has 
made some competitors optimistic that the consumer electronics giants would not 
be able to extend their monopoly into the digital video arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours has a higher data capacity," said a Warner Bros. executive who declined 
to be named. "The higher data capacity, the longer the running time, the higher 
the data transfer rate, the higher the picture quality, the more audio channels 
and the more capacity for multiple soundtracks and multiple subtitle tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say the Toshiba-Time Warner solution involves the creation of 
a double-sided CD, which could cost twice as much to manufacture as the 
single-sided version. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a common format might cause studios to delay putting their films 
into yet another new medium that may never gain widespread consumer acceptance. 
"We'd like to see consumers end up with better quality, more convenient 
delivery systems," Walt Disney technology vice president Bob Lambert said. "But 
it has to happen without fractionalizing the market into too many 
non-compatible hardware choices." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for consumers, the bigger question may not be which type to buy, but 
whether to buy at all. The digital video compact disc may not represent the 
same quantum leap as color over black-and-white or digital audio over scratchy 
analog tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's new technology, it's sexier, it's perhaps more convenient, because you 
don't have to wind and rewind," said Bishop Cheen, an analyst at Paul Kagan & 
Associates. "But like so much new technology, it's going to take getting used 
to. Our media-consuming habits die hard. Look how long it took the push-button 
phone to replace the dial phone. I don't know about your mom, but my mom still 
has a dialer." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the ultimate in CD technology is yet to come: be a CD player that 
could record at home and store a full-length movie at broadcast-quality video 
standards. However, the exotic solution may involve holographic laser storage 
techniques that haven't yet been invented. The Next-Generation CD 
</P>
<P>
 Today's standard compact disc, left, holds about 72 minutes of music or 
VHS-quality video. The data is encoded in microscopic pits on the surface of 
the disc, which is read and decoded by a red diode light beam in the player. By 
crowding four times as many pits onto the same five-inch disc, right, the 
high-density CD holds about four times as much data -- the equivalent of a 
135-minute movie at higher resolution than standard video. New CD: Boom or 
Bust? 
</P>
<P>
 Electronics and movie companies hope that the high-density compact disc player 
will become the new VCR ... 
</P>

MODEST RISE IN INDEX RESTRAINS INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: THE AUGUST FIGURE FOR 
CONSUMER PRICES GIVES A BOOST TO STOCKS AND BONDS AND EASES PRESSURE FOR FED 
ACTION. 
</P>

 Consumer prices rose at a lower-than-expected rate of 0.3% in August, the 
Labor Department reported Tuesday, helping to ease inflation concerns sparked 
by last week's wholesale price report. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors reacted positively to the latest news and analysts said the 
government report took pressure off the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest 
rates for the sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed the day at 3,879.86, up 19.52 points, 
while bond prices were up as well, pushing the yield on the Treasury's 
benchmark 30-year bond down to 7.68% from 7.71%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number was better than had been generally anticipated," said Hugh 
Johnson, chief economist at First Albany Corp. "What this simply says is that 
some of the increases we have seen at the wholesale level have not found their 
way to the consumer level." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the government reported that wholesale prices jumped 0.6% in 
August, the highest such increase in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson noted that consumer prices did not reflect the wholesale price 
increases, largely because consumers won't tolerate price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy for retailers to pass along the increases to consumers," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer prices in Southern California rose just 0.2% in August as low food 
prices offset higher transportation costs, according to the Labor Department. 
While consumer prices in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and 
Ventura counties have risen 1.1% since the beginning of the year, they rose 
only 0.1% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most financial experts predicted at least a 0.4% gain or higher in the 
national consumer price index, but falling clothing prices helped offset food 
and energy increases, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price increases were the same as those in June and July, keeping 
the consumer inflation rate at 2.9% through the first eight months of 1994, up 
only slightly from last year's figure of 2.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo & Co. economist Gary Schlossberg said the lower-than-expected 
consumer rate will allow the Fed to delay raising interest rates again when it 
meets Sept. 27. The next meeting is set for mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed will wait to see how the earlier increases will affect the economy 
first," Schlossberg said. Energy prices increased 1.4%, largely due to the 3.7% 
rise in gasoline prices, their biggest jump since a 4.3% increase last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large jump in coffee prices accounted for most of the 0.3% increase in 
food prices. Because of worldwide shortages and a freeze in Brazil, coffee 
prices rose 22% in August on top of July's record increase of 22.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said factors such as import prices, industrial prices and employment 
rates will probably push up consumer inflation in the months to come, raising 
it to 4% by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the U.S. trade 
deficit jumped in the April-June quarter to its highest level in more than six 
years, climbing to $37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade deficit, which measures America's international transactions, was up 
14.6% from a first-quarter deficit of $32.3 billion.

TENTATIVE PACT BETWEEN LUCKY AND UNION AVERTS GROCERY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a strike threat that would have affected 235 supermarkets across 
Southern California, Lucky Stores reached a tentative agreement late Tuesday on 
a new union contract with its warehouse employees and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, which would cover 1,700 workers at plants in Buena Park, Fullerton 
and Irvine, must be ratified by the rank and file. A meeting to vote on the 
agreement is set for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters Union Local 952 in Orange issued a terse statement saying only that 
the two sides had come to terms. Its leaders were unavailable for further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., and owned by American Stores in Salt Lake 
City, also had little to offer in the way of details. "We consider it a fair 
and balanced offer," Lucky spokeswoman Judith A. Decker said of the contract. 
She said the company will not provide any specifics until the agreement is 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous contract had expired Monday. Instead of going on strike, however, 
the Teamsters held off while talks continued with a federal mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Warehouse workers and drivers expressed relief that a settlement had been 
reached. "It's been like being on pins and needles," Brian Hughes, a 12-year 
Lucky warehouse worker in Irvine, said after learning of the agreement from his 
union steward. "It's been hard to sleep. It's really been nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Treharne, a supervisor at the Irvine plant, said most workers "don't have 
a whole lot of information right now" but are glad negotiations are over. "It's 
still a little tense," Treharne said. "People want to see what's been agreed 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Money was not an issue in the negotiations. Workers expect that the contract 
will contain the industry standard: a $1.70-an-hour raise over four years. 
Rather, the main point of contention was job security, which became a concern 
this summer when American Stores opened a new warehouse in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 That facility, which also serves the parent company's Sav-on Drugs subsidiary, 
is outside Local 952's jurisdiction. Its workers are covered by another local 
under a contract that pays them $4.60 an hour less than the $16.60 an hour paid 
at the Orange County warehouses. In addition, drivers are not included in that 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, Lucky transferred its liquor and wine unit from its Buena 
Park facility to the Fontana operation, where the same products are handled for 
Sav-on. The union estimated it lost 22 jobs because the drivers there weren't 
union members. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no jobs in Buena Park were lost, the Teamsters had feared the company 
would continue to shift work to other non-union employees. The company had 
wanted the flexibility to move work among its Southern California warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky also wanted to change the workweek schedule, which has required the 
company to schedule employees on five consecutive days a week, giving some 
Saturday and Sunday off and others Sunday and Monday off. The union was 
concerned that workers might be assigned non-consecutive days off during the 
week.

EPA PLANS TO CLAMP DOWN ON EMISSIONS IN NORTHEAST; SMOG: THE AGENCY'S PLAN 
WOULD APPLY CALIFORNIA'S STIFF RULES TO 12 OTHER STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that it intends to 
approve California-based low-emissions vehicle rules for the District of 
Columbia and a dozen Northeastern states from Virginia to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 If the EPA ultimately approves the plan -- which could include electric cars 
-- it would create a much larger market for "California rule" vehicles, likely 
lowering purchase costs for California drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such broad acceptance could also help California maintain the state's mandate, 
adopted in 1990, for low-emissions and electric cars, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear from the record that the emissions reductions represented by the 
petition, and more, are necessary in order to achieve clean, healthy air across 
the region," EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner also announced that the EPA will continue to hold broad-based meetings 
under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to see whether an alternative plan 
acceptable to all parties can be forged among battling auto makers, state 
regulators and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement came despite strong opposition from big auto makers, 
which are pushing to build a separate low-emissions car that would be subject 
to less stringent pollution standards and be sold in all states besides 
California. They argue that virtually the same cuts in pollution in the 
Northeast can be achieved far more cheaply under their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed," said Jason Vines, a spokesman for the American 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn. "But if there is any glimmer of hope, (the EPA) 
said discussions will continue on an alternative proposal -- and that's ours, 
and it just happens to be a better one." 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists had threatened to abandon the EPA negotiations if the 
agency failed to make by Tuesday the procedural move to declare that it intends 
to accept the states' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials and the states -- represented by the Ozone Transport Commission 
-- have said that any alternate plan would have to achieve equal or better 
emissions reductions to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan proposed by auto makers was rejected last year by the states' 
commission, which said it did not reduce pollution enough to allow the states 
to satisfy the Clean Air Act. Like California, the Northeast states must 
present air pollution control plans to the EPA by Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of these larger plans -- which include pollution sources besides 
vehicles -- the EPA must approve the current or an alternative proposal from 
the Northeastern states and the District of Columbia by Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the EPA adopts the Ozone Transport Commission petition as we hope, it 
would dramatically increase the market for electric vehicles in the nation," 
said Mike Gage, president of Calstart, the public-private consortium attempting 
to foster an advanced transportation industry in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state represents 11% to 12% of the national vehicle market, Gage 
noted, the Ozone Transport Commission region is roughly 25% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has always been some concern that (auto makers) would intensify the 
heat if it were only California," Gage said. Such a large combined market would 
"obviously be something that car makers will not ignore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Sperling, director of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, 
sees a broader advantage for California if the Ozone Transport Commission 
proposal is eventually adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 As in California, the commission plan is more flexible than federal rules 
because it sets emissions standards based on fleet averages rather than 
applying rigid requirements for every model. And this, said Sperling, could 
bring down the costs of alternative vehicles -- natural gas, electric or 
otherwise -- for California drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 A broader market "will create more economies of scale," Sperling said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ozone Transport Commission plan also adopts California's emissions-trading 
provisions, which will allow auto manufacturers to trade pollution credits 
gained when their fleet averages do better than the standard, or to buy credits 
when they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adopting the emission-trading program," Sperling said "will lead to more cost 
savings itself and it will provide them with an incentive to innovate."

JAMES FLANIGAN: CARIBBEAN CHALLENGE; U.S. IS ABOUT TO ACQUIRE CUBAN, HAITIAN 
ECONOMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether it wants to or not, the United States is about to take over 
responsibility for the economies of Haiti and Cuba as an unremarked consequence 
of Washington's latest involvement with those Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The result could be some bitter lessons in economics and politics, although 
America might also pick up pointers on helping its own inner cities. For sure, 
it will be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries are dreadfully poor, in part because of trade embargoes imposed 
by the United Nations or the United States and backed by the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick will be to find a way to bring Haiti and Cuba into the same U.S. 
system that has brought at least some improvement to other Caribbean economies. 
And success is imperative because both countries are close enough to U.S. 
shores to send their people in makeshift boats and rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy. Haiti's economy is all but gone. In 1991, when the 
Organization of American States imposed trade sanctions after the military coup 
that overthrew President Jean Bertrand Aristide, the economy's annual output 
was $370 per person, or $2.27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is much lower now; U.S. food aid is responsible for feeding 1 million of 
Haiti's 7 million people, says Ernest Preeg, a former U.S. ambassador to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding will be difficult. Haiti's infrastructure has decayed and there 
could be political opposition to needed foreign investment. Before 1991, Haiti 
benefited from the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which lowered U.S. tariffs on 
goods made in neighboring nations. Haiti at that time had more than 200 mostly 
U.S. companies manufacturing electronics, apparel and sporting goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But all departed when the embargo was imposed. In any case, Aristide -- the 
elected president whom U.S. troops may shortly restore to office -- bitterly 
denounced U.S. business people as "bloodsuckers" for paying $3 a day. Sure, 
that sounds like starvation wages, but it was three times the economy's overall 
income per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba, after 35 years of totalitarian rule and the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, is also in wretched shape -- output at roughly 45% of what it was in 
1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. It is difficult to accurately assess the 
economy because the Cuban peso no longer has real purchasing power, and most 
goods are available only for U.S. dollars in special shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollars come from Cuban exile relatives in Florida, but money from 
relatives may start coming in by way of Spain or Mexico now that the United 
States has imposed a ban on dollar transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Haitian situation, U.S. and foreign companies are clamoring 
to get into Cuba. A British trade delegation is in Havana this week. Businesses 
are attracted by the educational levels of the Cuban population -- "everybody 
has nine grades of schooling," says Andrew Zimbalist, an economist and Cuba 
expert at Smith College. Thus, foreign investors see Cuba as a kind of skilled 
East European nation 90 miles from Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 But business people may be overlooking explosive political dangers, says 
Edward Gonzalez, a Cuba expert at Rand Corp. Transition won't be easy. There is 
no leadership group -- no Lech Walesa as in Poland -- to easily succeed Fidel 
Castro and his regime, Gonzalez notes. He fears civil war will erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gonzalez argues against lifting the U.S. embargo now. Easier commerce 
would only help Castro and his hard-line henchmen, he says. It is the same 
argument that has persuaded the United States to tighten the embargo on Haiti 
in hopes of driving Gen. Raoul Cedras and his military regime from power. 
</P>
<P>
 But in both Haiti and Cuba, embargoes have only reinforced the strongmen. In 
Haiti, the black market is flourishing, with the military taking a cut and 
enjoying the contraband. In Cuba, as was the case in the old Soviet Union, the 
government runs a type of black-market racket in stores that sell only for 
dollars. Castro and his henchmen remain well fed; only the boat people look 
skinny. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is to open the economies as much as possible, lift embargoes and 
let the commerce develop, as U.S. policy has recently done in Vietnam. In fact, 
U.S. policy from Russia to China to North Korea -- everywhere except Haiti and 
Cuba -- holds that economic change improves lives and fosters democracy. But in 
the Caribbean, we favor embargoes, and that has left us, in effect, taking 
responsibility for the staggering economies of Cuba and Haiti. It's time to 
change. The United States would still have to help the Haitian and Cuban 
economies by buying their goods on a favorable basis, as it has done for years 
with other Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But then, the United States will have to help on trade even if it occupies 
Haiti -- as now seems likely. Occupation could turn out badly, as it did before 
when the U.S. military ran Haiti from 1915 to 1934. Also, the United States ran 
the affairs of Cuba for more than half this century -- and made such a mess 
that Cuba turned to Castro and Soviet communism. 
</P>
<P>
 A far better outcome would be that Cedras and his gang take a payoff and go 
into exile from Haiti, says Robert Manning, a former State Department official. 
And it would be better also if Castro accepted what Rand's Gonzalez calls the 
grand bargain: Castro leaves for exile with dignity, and the United States 
gives Cuba back the Guantanamo Bay naval base. 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound unlikely, but it's no more extreme than the U.S. government 
trying to run the economies of Haiti and Cuba when it has trouble helping poor 
people in its own South Chicago, the South Bronx and South-Central Los Angeles. 
Poor Islands in the Sun 
</P>
<P>
 The economies of Haiti and Cuba, racked by political oppression and trade 
embargos, have fallen below even these figures. Here's a comparison of gross 
domestic product and GDP per capita:

TCI PLAN TO BUY AMERICA ONLINE STAKE IS STALLED BY MICROSOFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA SUGAWARA, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest and most influential cable 
company, was poised to acquire a 9% stake in America Online Inc. until 
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates intervened, according to sources close to 
TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition is now on hold while TCI Chief Executive John Malone and Gates 
discuss whether the Vienna, Va.-based cable behemoth can invest in Marvel, the 
code name for the on-line service that Microsoft has been secretly developing, 
according to sources. The service, expected to be launched next year, would be 
a major competitor to America Online, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and Microsoft declined to comment. One source close to Microsoft dismissed 
the idea that a deal was imminent between Microsoft and TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales of on-line computer services booming at the same time that the 
much-hyped interactive television experiments are stumbling badly, companies 
such as TCI have been looking to make major investments in on-line firms. At 
the same time, on-line companies have been seeking cable partners to help them 
push into new markets. They want to use the cable networks, which are better 
designed than phone lines to carry material such as video and color graphics, 
and are looking to cable companies to provide expertise in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services enable computers with modems to use telephone lines to 
communicate with other computers. Worldwide sales of on-line services are 
expected to reach $17.8 billion in 1998, a 57% increase from 1993, according to 
Simba Information Inc., a New York-based research company. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online learned of TCI's interest a few weeks ago, one source said. TCI 
was considering buying the 9% stake in the company owned by billionaire Paul 
Allen, a co-founder of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft. Allen at one time owned 
almost 25% of America Online, but when he failed to gain management control he 
decided to sell his stake. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI officials wanted to know if America Online executives would look favorably 
on a TCI investment, sources said. America Online heartily endorsed the idea, 
seeing it as an important endorsement by a company that is expected to be a key 
player in the interactive entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week ago, all the parties were ready to sign an agreement, and America 
Online was revving up its public relations machine to announce the new 
investor, sources said. But TCI negotiators, noting that the cable company had 
partnerships with Microsoft, said it needed to check those contracts to make 
sure a stake in America Online would not present a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft got nervous when they heard" that TCI was thinking of investing in 
America Online, sources said. America Online is one of the fastest-growing of 
the on-line services and would be a key competitor for Marvel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past week, Gates and Malone have started discussions about a TCI 
investment in the Microsoft on-line service, sources said, putting the 
acquisition of the America Online shares from Allen on hold.

TOYOTA TO HIKE N. AMERICAN PRODUCTION; AUTOMOBILES: THE RISING YEN IS SEEN AS 
THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DECISION TO BOOST OUTPUT BY 48%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Corp. is boosting car production in North America by 48%, meaning 
that within three years, nearly two-thirds of the Toyotas sold in North America 
will be built there. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, said Tuesday that it is making the move 
partially because of pressure on profits caused by the decline of the U.S. 
dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker also said it plans in 1995 to shift production of all pickup 
trucks sold in the United States from Japan to the Toyota-General Motors joint 
manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif., New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 NUMMI produced 98,000 pickup trucks last year, while 86,000 were imported from 
Japan, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen has soared more than 20% over the last two years against the dollar, 
meaning that revenue earned in dollars is worth less when sent back to Japan. 
The rise also makes Japanese wages and materials more expensive in dollar 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major Japanese manufacturers have also been increasing overseas 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers have been forced to raise overseas prices to make up the 
difference in the yen. As a result, some Japanese models now cost several 
thousand dollars more in North America than comparable American-made cars. 
</P>

 Last month, Toyota announced average price increases for most of its 1995 
models of 3.3%, or $572, compared to initial 1994 prices. Honda and Nissan have 
announced similar increases, all blaming a higher yen, and Honda also plans to 
increase U.S. production. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota plans to increase North American production to 790,000 vehicles in 
1996, up from 533,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That means more than 60% of its cars sold in the United States in 1996 will be 
North American-made, up from 46% in 1993, Toyota said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant is expected to boost employment from 5,500 as 
of July to about 6,000 in 1996. Toyota spokesman Brendan Hagerty said Toyota 
does not plan any layoffs in Japan because of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 While the yen was part of the reason for the U.S. production boost, Hagerty 
said there is a more fundamental one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toyota really believes that to service a market well you have to produce 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's production announcement came a day after the first Avalon, a large 
sedan designed specifically for the U.S. market, rolled off the assembly line 
at the Kentucky plant. All Avalons, which replace the Cressida model, are to be 
built in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, as a result of the increases in North American production, Toyota 
plans to cut its exports from Japan to the United States from 554,000 vehicles 
in 1993 to about 400,000 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers also face a new U.S. regulation taking effect in October 
that will require cars sold in the United States to bear a sticker showing the 
percentage of North American-manufactured parts they contain. Japanese 
manufacturers fear that American consumers will prefer cars with high North 
American content. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is Toyota's largest market.

 Insurance Department to Close Division: The state agency will close its Los 
Angeles-based conservation and liquidation division by year-end, laying off 
about 70 employees, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi announced.The 
division, which manages the assets of about 60 failed insurers, has been 
criticized for management problems by state auditors. The unit will be 
reorganized and moved to San Francisco, a move that will pare $1 million from 
the division's $17-million annual budget, according to a department 
spokeswoman. Relocating the unit near the Insurance Department's main office 
will "substantially improve oversight, accountability and coordination," 
Garamendi said in a statement. Laid-off employees may apply for jobs in San 
Francisco, the department said.

ENTERTAINMENT; BMG PICKS ZELNICK TO RUN NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS; MEDIA: THE 
MOVE IS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE GERMAN FIRM'S EXPANSION INTO THE MOVIE 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former studio executive-turned-Silicon Valley entrepreneur Strauss Zelnick was 
named to run the North American entertainment operations of Bertelsmann Music 
Group on Tuesday, a move likely to accelerate the German media giant's 
long-anticipated expansion into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With his appointment as president and chief executive of BMG Entertainment 
North America, Zelnick will also take responsibility for revamping BMG's 
troubled RCA Records operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelnick, 37, former president of 20th Century Fox, was hired in June, 1993, as 
chief executive of interactive software developer Crystal Dynamics in Palo 
Alto. He was also a consultant to BMG, where he has developed a close working 
relationship with BMG Entertainment Chairman Michael Dornemann. Zelnick assumes 
his new job in New York on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelnick's strategy for expanding BMG into the movie business isn't likely to 
take shape for a while. In separate interviews, both Zelnick and Dornemann said 
it would be premature to discuss strategy. Dornemann insisted that BMG is under 
no time pressure to move ahead, though he acknowledged that Zelnick will help 
the company develop its strategy "in a more focused way." 
</P>
<P>
 BMG's name has frequently surfaced as a prospective buyer for such struggling 
distributors as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Orion Pictures. BMG also was reportedly 
in talks to acquire New Line Cinema last year before the independent company 
was acquired by Turner Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives expect BMG to build its movie business through 
acquisitions rather than the bottom-up approach of its fellow European 
entertainment conglomerate, PolyGram. Zelnick is also expected to actively 
expand BMG's interactive media business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be their mergers and acquisitions guy. He's a great strategic thinker," 
one executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelnick will also oversee the company's music operations, the weakest link of 
which has been RCA. Among his first tasks will be finding a new head for the 
label. RCA President Joe Galante plans to return to the company's Nashville 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelnick is unlikely to become directly involved in BMG's crown jewel, Arista 
Records, led by founder and record industry legend Clive Davis. Davis is said 
to be close to renewing his contract for $35 million over five years, with a 
possible $15-million performance bonus. Under his contract, Davis reports to an 
Arista board that will now include Zelnick. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, BMG Chairman Dornemann said that while RCA "has to get more 
movement" in expanding its market share, the goal with Arista will be to "leave 
it as it is. It has the best people running it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Dynamics initially placed its bets heavily on developing titles for 
the much-hyped 3DO game machine, which is still struggling to gain a meaningful 
foothold in the interactive market. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquest multimedia analyst Bruce Ryon credits Zelnick with moving Crystal 
Dynamics away from its attachment to 3DO, attracting investors and raising its 
profile in a crowded field of competitors. Zelnick's leaving after just 15 
months doesn't bode well for the company, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelnick, who will remain a director and shareholder of Crystal Dynamics, said 
his move reflects his desire to take advantage of a new opportunity, not any 
unhappiness at Crystal Dynamics.

SENATE VOTES TO END INTERSTATE BANKING CURBS; CONGRESS: CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO 
SIGN THE BILL, WHICH WILL ALLOW COAST-TO- COAST BANKING AFTER YEARS OF FAILED 
ATTEMPTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Tuesday approved landmark legislation abolishing decades-old 
barriers that restrict banks from operating branches across state lines, 
ensuring that coast-to-coast banking will become law after years of failed 
attempts by lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, approved 94 to 4, goes to President Clinton for his expected 
signature. The House approved an identical measure Aug. 4. Congress has been 
trying to do so since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure repeals legal barriers that date to 1927 and is likely to 
accelerate the pace of acquisitions in the banking industry, which has already 
seen its ranks shrink by more than 3,500 institutions over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers will be able to deposit checks or get a loan anywhere in the nation 
where their hometown bank has a branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the estimated 60 million people who live in metropolitan areas 
crossing state lines -- such as New York, St. Louis or Washington -- will be 
the first to feel the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is a consumer bill," said banking consultant Bert Ely. "It's going 
to allow banks to operate more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, will generate higher interest rates on savings deposits, lower 
service charges for bank customers and lower rates on loans, Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer groups and small-town banks have warned that big banks -- through 
branching -- will enter communities and drain the deposits now resting in 
community banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which revamps the 1927 McFadden Act and the 1956 Bank Holding 
Company Act, permits banks to operate interstate branch networks starting in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 States could pass a bill to permit such a move before then or opt out of 
interstate branching altogether by passing legislation before June 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the bill's enactment, healthy banks will be allowed to purchase 
banks in other states, regardless of state laws prohibiting such transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, banks that operate regionally or nationally must set up independent 
banking subsidiaries in each state. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one study, interstate branching will save the banking industry $1 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks will be allowed to merge subsidiaries around the nation that now operate 
independently into a single branch network. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank Corp., the nation's fourth-largest bank and a proponent of the 
legislation, expects to save $35 million to $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman cited savings on paperwork, as well as costs related to executive 
travel and meetings.

ENTERTAINMENT; KISSINGER TO ADVISE BOARDS OF MGM, CREDIT LYONNAIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer used to boast that it had "more stars than there are in 
heaven." Now it has almost as many media stars serving as advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Tuesday was named a consultant to 
the boards of both MGM and parent Credit Lyonnais. He joins such luminaries as 
director Francis Ford Coppola, previously named to MGM's board, and Creative 
Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, who was retained by Credit Lyonnais 
last year to advise it on what to do with MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 The specifics of what Kissinger -- now chairman of the Kissinger Associates 
consulting firm -- will do for the companies aren't clear. MGM and Credit 
Lyonnais said in a statement that they plan to tap his insight into global 
economic issues. His renowned statesmanship may also be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has rarely been at hand in recent years at the venerable studio, which 
Credit Lyonnais seized in 1992 when former owner Giancarlo Parretti defaulted 
on his loans. The bank is aiming to sell the studio, which hasn't had a major 
hit in three years, by 1997. A new slate of pictures developed by its year-old 
management team, led by former Paramount Pictures Chairman Frank Mancuso, is 
scheduled to premiere during the upcoming holiday season.

 Fluor Ends Talks to Acquire Cleanup Project: In a setback to its efforts to 
expand its nuclear decontamination business, Fluor Daniel Inc. said it will not 
take over the remaining 15 months of a federal contract to manage the defunct 
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver. The major operating unit of 
Fluor Corp. in Irvine could not reach a final agreement with EG&G Inc. in 
Wellesley, Mass., to take over its EG&G Rocky Flats Inc. subsidiary and the 
contract to manage the one-time plutonium and weapons facility.EG&G, which is 
getting out of the business, said it will continue to manage the project until 
its five-year contract with the Department of Energy expires at the end of 
1995. Because the deal fell through, Fluor Daniel decided that it would not bid 
on the next five-year contract to clean up Rocky Flats, leaving the project to 
other companies already putting bids together.

 Lawsuit on AT&T-McCaw to Be Heard: A federal court judge agreed to hear a 
lawsuit filed by Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. seeking to stop the 
$12.6-billion merger of AT&T Corp. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., a 
Bell Atlantic Corp. attorney said. However, lawyers for the companies were 
working out terms of an agreement that would include a provision permitting the 
merger to take place as scheduled on Sept. 30 but might impose protective 
orders on AT&T's ownership of McCaw. The trial of the lawsuit, which seeks to 
block the merger enjoin, is scheduled to start Nov. 1, the Bell Atlantic 
attorney said.

 Komatsu to Leave Southland: Komatsu Forklift USA Inc., citing strict 
regulations and the high cost of doing business in Southern California, said it 
will move from La Palma in late 1995 to a larger facility outside Atlanta.The 
move by Komatsu, one of the world's biggest forklift makers, will mean the loss 
of nearly 140 sales and manufacturing jobs in Orange County. Akira (Art) 
Otsuka, Komatsu's president, said the company might keep a small manufacturing 
operation in Southern California, but that will depend on demand for the 
product. He said the company now produces nearly 500 forklifts a month and will 
reach plant capacity of 600 a month by the end of next year.

 Arco Won't Develop Sunfish Wells in Cook Inlet: In another disappointment in 
efforts to increase oil production in its Alaskan oil fields, Atlantic 
Richfield Co. has announced that it will cease drilling for new crude in the 
Sunfish tract it discovered in 1991.The company plans to take a $30-million 
charge against earnings in its third quarter as a result. An Arco spokesman 
said efforts will focus on adding more wells to existing North Slope fields. 
The Sunfish reservoir "was thinner and more discontinuous than our original 
interpretation," said Bob Strode, Arco Alaska vice president of exploration and 
land.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION REPORT PUSHES DOW UP 19.52; BOND YIELDS DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reassuring inflation statistics gave stocks a boost Tuesday, and the Dow Jones 
industrial average finished 19.52 points ahead at 3,879.86. The yield on the 
30-year Treasury bond slipped to 7.68% from 7.71% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was generally mixed, but the Canadian dollar rose dramatically 
against all currencies after a weaker-than-expected showing by Quebec 
separatists in elections Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, the Dow gained more than 30 points after the government said 
consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about a 10-9 margin on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 1,142 up, 998 down and 729 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price report was a calming influence after a worrisome report 
last Friday on wholesale prices that caused a steep selloff in stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price index is considered a broader gauge of inflation because it 
covers services, which are not included in the wholesale price report. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao Chalasani, chief strategist at Kemper Securities Group in Chicago, said 
the CPI numbers suggest inflation isn't translating readily from producer to 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said investor caution is high because of upcoming statistics. The 
government reports retail sales and regional economic activity today, business 
inventories Thursday and industrial production Friday. Any of those numbers 
could reignite inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think too many people are buying into the optimism" after the CPI 
report, said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management. 
"Inflation is back and people are worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow sank almost 34 points Friday after the August producer price index 
rose 0.6%, well above expectations. The blue chip index lost another 14 points 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little better market, a little more confidence, and the money returns to 
the former leaders," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at 
Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gasoline on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled to its lowest 
price in five months, as refiners sold stocks that won't meet new environmental 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, gasoline destined for certain regions must have a higher oxygen 
content to meet the emissions standards in the federal Clean Air Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are dumping gasoline in front of this new specification," said Michael 
Busby, manager of crude and refined products trading at Northville Industries 
Corp. in Melville, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline for October delivery tumbled 2.18 cents to settle at 44.94 cents a 
gallon, the lowest price since March 30. The plunge pushed October crude down 
27 cents to $17.12 a barrel, and heating oil fell 0.95 cent to 48.12 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the new regulations go into effect, gasoline prices could shoot up, 
Busby said, because refiners are having difficulty making the reformulated 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Basic materials and technology stocks rose. The two groups had led the 
market's recent rally but had been hit by profit taking in the past two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum Co. of America rose 1 3/8 to 84, International Paper gained 1 5/8 to 
74 1/2 and Microsoft rose 1-7/16 to 57-9/16. Georgia Pacific rose 1 1/4 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks benefited from release of the latest book-to-bill 
ratio, a measure of new orders for semiconductors compared to existing 
shipments. August's 1.04 reading meant that for every $100 of products shipped, 
companies got $104 in new orders. Texas Instruments gained 1 to 75 1/8, Intel 
finished up 3/4 to 65 1/4 and Micron Technology gained 3/4 to 39 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM rose 1 3/8 to 69 1/4 after Merrill Lynch said IBM's new mainframe product 
launch represents a significant revenue opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS dropped 11 3/8 to 337 3/4. Traders cited a downgrade of the stock by 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette after the shares rose sharply in the past two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monsanto jumped 4 1/4 to 84 1/2 after saying its current president and chief 
operation officer, Robert Shapiro, would succeed Richard Mahoney as chairman 
and chief executive when he retires in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * Timberland tumbled 7 1/4 to 38 3/4. A Merrill Lynch analyst cut her earnings 
forecast on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Canadian dollar advanced broadly after Quebec separatists won a key 
election by a slimmer-than-expected margin, easing near-term worries about the 
province's quest for independence. In late New York trading, the U.S. dollar 
was worth 1.3488 Canadian dollars -- the lowest level since early March -- down 
from 1.3680 on Monday. The vote also prompted a rally in Canadian bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold closed in London at $389.25 an ounce, down from $390.80 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tokyo stocks ended higher as index-linked buying by investment trusts, 
coupled with public fund buying in late afternoon, boosted prices in thin 
trading. The German 30-share DAX index closed the session lower as DAX futures 
prices slid and players awaited U.S. inflation data. The key indicator shed 
18.52 points to end at 2,136.09. But in post-bourse trading after the U.S. data 
came in better than expected, it rose 21 points to 2,157.15.

COMPAQ TO UNVEIL AMD CHIP COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compaq Computer Corp. today is expected to unveil new models in its year-old 
Presario consumer line and base them on chips made by Advanced Micro Devices 
Inc. rather than market leader Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time a major manufacturer has used a chip maker besides 
Intel for an entire product line.While planned for some time, it is being 
announced just after Compaq Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer publicly 
criticized Intel at an industry conference in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 By relying on AMD 486 microprocessors rather than the newer and more expensive 
Intel Pentium chip, Compaq is betting consumers are more interested in saving 
money than having leading-edge technology in their machines. It will spend tens 
of millions of dollars on TV ads this fall, competing with Intel's ads for 
Pentium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue is practical functionality," said Mark Vena, brand manager for 
Presario products, saying most consumers don't require Pentium power, now 
chiefly used for graphics and video. Compaq announced in February it had signed 
AMD as a second supplier of microprocessors, the "brain" of a personal 
computer. The company said it needed another large supplier because of its 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had expected Compaq would use AMD chips in the consumer PCs. AST 
Research is expected to soon bring out consumer models based on chips by Cyrix, 
another Intel clone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq plans to promote the new Presario models as "home information centers" 
since each model has a built-in speaker phone and individual voice mailboxes. 
For $200 more, they can be equipped with a TV tuner. 
</P>
<P>
 Each model also has a CD-ROM drive, stereo speakers and a modem.

MERGER OF RALPHS, FOOD 4 LESS CHAINS DELAYED PENDING SHAREHOLDER OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An expected agreement to merge Ralphs Grocery Co. with Food 4 Less 
Supermarkets was delayed Tuesday as the companies' representatives continued to 
seek the approval of the last of six Ralphs shareholders, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards of directors of Ralphs and Food 4 Less Supermarkets -- operator of 
Alpha Beta, Boys, Viva and the Food 4 Less warehouse stores -- approved the 
$2.5-billion merger Friday, and the deal is to be finalized if shareholders 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa Cos., a Los Angeles-based firm that controls Food 4 Less Supermarkets, 
has negotiated a deal with DeBartolo Corp., which has controlling interest in 
Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said five of the six Ralphs shareholders controlling 90% of the shares 
have approved the deal but that the sixth, Paris-based Banque Paribas, has not. 
However, people close to the negotiations said a final agreement was near. 
Besides Banque Paribas and DeBartolo Corp., the Ralphs shareholders are 
Toronto-based Camdev Properties, Bank of Montreal, Cincinnati-based Federated 
Department Stores and the affiliated Federated Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies expect to merge their operations in November or December. 
Yucaipa would convert all of its Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva markets to either 
Ralphs or Food 4 Less warehouse stores. GEORGE WHITE

PEOPLE: FRIEDMAN STEPS DOWN AS GOLDMAN, SACHS CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co. said Tuesday he is resigning to make room 
for a younger management team at the nation's biggest privately held investment 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Stephen Friedman, 56, comes as Goldman is struggling 
against sharply lower earnings. While the privately held partnership is not 
required to publicly report results, Friedman described 1994 as "a frustrating 
year" in a comment on profits that was rare for a Goldman executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman will be replaced by Jon Corzine, 47, co-head of Goldman's 
fixed-income division, at the end of November. In addition, Henry Paulson, 48, 
co-head of the firm's investment banking unit, will become vice chairman and 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "While almost all of our businesses have done well this year, the firm's 
profits have been disappointing, particularly as a result of trading results in 
some of the businesses which performed extraordinarily well in the last few 
years," Friedman said in a resignation letter Tuesday to the firm's 9,000 
worldwide employees. He has been chairman since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those of Wall Street rivals, Goldman's trading profits were wounded by 
the tumble in bonds and stocks that started early this year. Last year Goldman 
earned $2.3 billion, up 75% from 1992, making it the most profitable firm on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Mahoney will retire in March 
after 12 years as chief executive that saw the company shift to making more 
consumer goods and reducing its emphasis on low-margin bulk chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old Mahoney helped groom his successor, Monsanto President and 
Chief Operating Officer Robert Shapiro, to lead the maker of Roundup herbicide 
and NutraSweet after his retirement, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of Wall Street likes Mr. Shapiro," said Harvey Stober, Dean 
Witter Reynolds analyst. "We think he has a shorter fuse, perhaps, in terms of 
his ability to tolerate things that he doesn't see as right." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, 56, is expected to be more aggressive in restructuring assets and 
"carrying out change" at Monsanto, Stober said.

MANY EMPLOYEES FAIL TO USE PENSION PLANS FULLY; RETIREMENT: STUDY FINDS THAT 
PARTICIPATION IN COMPANY PROGRAMS BY BABY BOOMERS IS 'DISTRESSINGLY LOW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers at large companies are throwing away money by failing to take 
advantage of the growing number of pension plans available to them, according 
to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick calls employee participation in 
some retirement plans "distressingly low" -- a growing concern as baby boomers 
get older. 
</P>
<P>
 In the random survey of 993 companies with more than 200 employees, 401(k) 
retirement plans proved to be the most frequently offered to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 61% of eligible employees participated in 401(K) plans, the same number 
as last year, the survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the number of firms that offer retirement benefits including 401(k)s rose 
to 89% from 78% in that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "A significant amount of employees are throwing away tax-deferred money by not 
using 401(k)," Martha Priddy Patterson, head of employee benefits policy at 
Peat Marwick, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under-using the 401(k) option could spell "big problems when people get to 
retirement age," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical 401(k) plan asks employees to set aside a part of their annual 
income for retirement, with the employer contributing half as much. There are 
several investment options, and taxes are deferred until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees are covered by so-called defined benefit plans, which do not 
require workers to make contributions but provide far less income at retirement 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other trouble spots, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Employees often opt for investment strategies under 401(k)s that are too 
conservative to meet their retirement needs.  
</P>
<P>
 They contribute on average only half of the total amount allowed, and they may 
be saving far less than their lifestyle requires, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, workers who have spent their whole life in one company receive only 
a little over half their annual income when they retire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, when you retire, your expenses don't change much," Patterson 
cautioned. She suggested that workers aim for having at least as much money 
when they retire as they earned when working. 
</P>
<P>
 Though employers are offering more retirement options to workers than they 
were a year ago, they are failing to convey the importance of retirement 
planning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few employers regularly provide any kind of retirement savings advice," 
Patterson said. "That's really quite frightening."

ACCESS TO PROBLEM-BROKER DATABASE IS PUSHED; SECURITIES: STATE REGULATORS 
SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AND WILL FORMALLY SUBMIT IT AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Investors should be allowed to use their home computers to troll through the 
securities industry's disciplinary records on problem brokers and firms, a 
group of state regulators says. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer activists on Tuesday hailed the idea, proposed by the National Assn. 
of State Securities Administrators, as a major boost for consumers seeking to 
get a fair shake in the securities markets. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Perkins, state securities regulator for Missouri, plans to formally 
make the proposal today at a congressional hearing on problem brokers. 
Associated Press obtained an advance copy of Perkins' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Direct and uncensored public access to CRD disciplinary files would mean 
speedier access to critical information for investors and also would 
dramatically turn up the heat on problem brokers," said Perkins, who heads a 
task force on weeding out problem brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRD, or Central Registration Depository, is a vast database containing all 
enforcement records against the nation's 460,000 registered brokers and 
traders, as well as 5,500 securities firms. The records, some dating to the 
early 1950s, provide details of specific securities law violations, arbitration 
settlements, fines and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRD is run by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the industry's 
main self-regulatory body. The nation's stock and commodities exchanges, as 
well as state regulators, contribute to the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has only limited access to the records, via a toll-free phone 
number run by the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD is in the midst of a $12-million upgrade of the database that would 
enable regulators to perform sophisticated surveillance and analysis of the 
records, which currently are in an outdated format that limits searching. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said state regulators envision a day in which investors could use 
computers in their homes or in public libraries to download both the corporate 
filings and the disciplinary files to check on a firm or a broker's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although experts agree that the CRD suffers from outdated technology, the 
database remains a powerful research tool. Perkins is proposing that the CRD 
files be made available on the global Internet computer network, in much the 
same way as the SEC's electronic corporate records.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; D.C. GETS ON-LINE WITH THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 After several days skulking around White House offices and talking with people 
in and out of government, I've come to the conclusion that the use of 
technology to improve citizen access to government information may turn out to 
be the Clinton Administration's most enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy are 
justifiably proud of the progress made this year on the Administration's 
national information infrastructure. One goal, according to OSTP special 
assistant David Lytel, is to "make government information easily available to 
the public." To that end, the White House has encouraged all federal agencies 
to disseminate information via the Internet, computer bulletin boards and even 
commercial on-line services. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy is a relative term. Using the Internet is still a challenge for most 
people, but it's getting better. One development is the increased use of the 
World Wide Web. The web makes it possible for agencies or companies to create 
their own menu and icon-based graphic interface, with leads not only to their 
own information but to data from other organizations. Each web site has its own 
"home page," which serves as a pointer to additional information from that and 
other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about anyone with access to the Internet can peruse web pages, but to see 
graphics you need a special type of Internet account and special software. 
Mosaic, a federally developed public-domain program, is available for Windows, 
Macintosh and other systems. Some commercial Internet providers, including 
Netcom ((800) 501-8649), provide similar software for use on their own systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it hasn't been publicly announced, the White House will unveil its 
own World Wide Web home page next month, sources say. But you don't have to 
wait to access White House documents. The White House already posts news 
releases and transcripts of presidential speeches, radio addresses and other 
documents on commercial on-line services and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers to CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online and GEnie can also access 
White House discussion forums. And anyone with access to Internet electronic 
mail can get instructions on how to obtain documents by sending an e-mail 
message to publica-tions@whitehouse.gov. The message can be blank or contain 
the word help.  
</P>
<P>
 Information from the White House and more than 60 other federal agencies is 
available via FedWorld, a service of the Commerce Department's National 
Technical Information Service. NTIS, which receives no taxpayer funds for 
information dissemination, stays in business by selling specialized government 
information. But it also offers a lot of free information and serves as a 
gateway to other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 FedWorld's databases include documents from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
the Office of Management and Budget, the Consumer Information Center and the 
Department of Agriculture. You also find federal job openings and information 
about federal grants and funding programs. Files are updated daily. You can 
access FedWorld via the Internet (Telnet fedworld) or through WWW at 
http://www/fedworld.gov. You can dial into FedWorld's electronic bulletin board 
at (703) 321-8020. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library of Congress' Marvel system is another rich source of government 
information. You can reach Marvel's main menu by typing gopher marvel.loc.gov. 
Gopher is another Internet menuing system; it doesn't display graphics, but it 
is relatively easy to use. From the main gopher, you can browse the Library of 
Congress' card catalogues and access information from federal agencies and both 
houses of Congress. Select the "government information" option and you'll be 
able to get information from the federal government and numerous state and 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in outer space? NASA Information Services -- including images from 
outer space -- can be reached on the World Wide Web by typing 
http://hypatia.gsfc.nasa.gov. How about the environment? The Environmental 
Protection Agency has an enormous amount of information available via the 
Internet. The EPA's main menu can be reached by typing gopher gopher.epa.gov. 
</P>
<P>
 Many agencies offer information on grants and contracts. The National 
Institutes of Health hasgopher.nih.gov, which provides grant and research 
information among other data. The Department of Education's web page can be 
reached at http://www.ed.gov/ or you can reach a menu of agency resources by 
typing gopher.ed.gov. Data includes a "Teacher's Guide to the U.S. Office of 
Education" and a listing of educational software you can download for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration's Web page http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/ is 
particularly impressive, especially if you have Mosaic or another program that 
makes it possible to view graphics. You can take a tour of the agency, its 
services and its offices, or click on a map of the United States to locate SBA 
offices around the country. The service provides detailed information on SBA 
programs, including those for managing, financing or expanding your business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the National Information Infrastructure Task Force, which is spearheading 
the Administration's forays into cyberspace, has its own information on-line: 
Type gopher iitf.doc.gov. Researchers, telecommunications entrepreneurs and 
nonprofit groups will be especially interested in the information about the 
grant programs. Non-Internet users can reach a similar bulletin board at (202) 
482-1199. 
</P>
<P>
 As you start to explore these information sites, you'll notice that one menu 
or home page leads to another. It's easy to get lost, but once you get the hang 
of it, it's also pretty easy to discover more sources of information. 
</P>
<P>
 Get ready for some delays when using any of these services. The on-line 
federal information sites aren't quite as sluggish as the Beltway at rush hour, 
but they're getting there. The dreaded traffic jams on the information highway 
are already upon us.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; TALKING HEADS WILL LET US 'SEE' SPEECH UP CLOSE 
</P>

 If an elderly friend tells you she hears the TV better with her glasses on, 
don't laugh. Visual clues are crucial to our ability to understand speech. 
That's why a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz 
has created a computerized "talking head." They hope that studying facial 
animation -- visible speech -- will aid research in areas as diverse as the 
learning of second languages, speech therapy for brain-injury patients and the 
development of a next generation of computer communications as a "face-to-face" 
form of electronic mail. The three-dimensional computerized image, created by 
psychology professor Dominic Massaro and research associate Michael Cohen, 
resembles a mannequin with moving eyes, brows and mouth. The features move in 
real time -- an underlying grid allows researchers to control about 60 separate 
parameters to animate the face and create the movements of speech. Using a 
text-to-speech system developed by Massaro, researchers can type in English, 
which the computer then produces as spoken language, complete with 
corresponding facial movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The work has been supported in part by the National Institute of Deafness and 
Communicative Disorders with the idea that someday printed books could be 
translated into visual speech for the hearing-impaired. While the visually 
impaired listen to audio books, the hearing-impaired could watch talking heads. 
</P>

 Glass in the Rough: With production of non-hazardous solid wastes currently 
exceeding 11 billion tons a year and landfill costs rising, all sorts of 
techniques are emerging to turn trash into treasure. An increasingly popular 
choice is vitrification -- the transformation of garbage into glass. 
</P>
<P>
 When solid wastes are melted in a special furnace, the end product has a 
composition very similar to that of natural basalt glasses such as obsidian. 
These glasses can be formed into products ranging from sidewalks or patio 
stones to premium railroad ties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the systems are expensive -- from $3 million to $4 million for a melter 
capable of handling 50 tons a day. Now Pacific Northwest Laboratory, operated 
by Battelle Memorial Institute, has developed a new melter technology called 
Terra-Vit that is supposed to make the cost of vitrified wastes competitive 
with that of landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional vitrification is expensive because it requires the chamber where 
melting takes place to be lined with special oxides of alumina, zirconia or 
silica to handle the high temperatures and the corrosive effect of molten 
glass. But Terra-Vit features an oversize design with very thick walls that can 
be made from low-cost materials such as slag from steel mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering a Better Ashtray: With secondhand smoke becoming a major concern, 
smokeless ashtrays would seem to be a good idea in places such as bars, 
restaurants and offices where smoking is still legal. But tests conducted at 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory show that the most commonly available models don't 
work. It seems they merely disperse the smoke rather than remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem lies in the filters, which are not suitable for removing the small 
particles that compose cigarette smoke. Now William Nazaroff, an associate 
professor of civil engineering at UC Berkeley and a scientist and engineer at 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, has developed a new smokeless ashtray that uses 
the same glass filters used by workers dealing with asbestos or radioactive 
compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes an ashtray could be made to retail for about $40.  
</P>
<P>
 Stack 'Em High: Computer chip designers are engaged in an endless challenge to 
squeeze more circuits into less space -- mainly using improved production 
technologies to make individual "features" smaller. But while no one is sure 
when it will happen, the time is approaching when the laws of physics will 
limit how many more transistors can be crammed into this two-dimensional space. 
So designers are now thinking in 3-D, essentially stacking chips on top of one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine Sensors Corp. in Costa Mesa, engineers remove the wire leads from 
standard memory chips, shave them down to a fraction of a millimeter and bond 
them together into a pancake-like stack, with the individual chips 
interconnected along the edges of the stack. Originally developed for the 
military, the technology makes it possible to stack up to 10 memory chips 
within the height and "footprint" of a single packaged chip. IBM Corp. has 
agreed to help Irvine Sensors commercialize its Short Stacks. Cubic Memory, a 
start-up in Scotts Valley, Calif., is also exploiting the third dimension, 
though its interconnection approach differs from that of Irvine Sensors and it 
is looking at different markets -- portable computers, notebooks, workstations 
and servers. But both companies face the same problem: how to bring the price 
of the products low enough to compete in cutthroat commodity chip markets.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; EX-IBM EXEC CORRIGAN TO

 Robert J. Corrigan, who surprised the computer industry last May by announcing 
his retirement as head of IBM's personal computer operations, is leaping into 
high-tech entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Imax Corp., the Toronto-based pioneer of giant-screen movies for theme parks 
and museums, said Tuesday that it has tapped Corrigan, 54, to be president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of IBM Personal Computer Co., Corrigan was widely praised for 
single-handedly building a strong personal-computing business while much of the 
rest of the Armonk, N.Y., company was in chaos. But when PC sales suddenly 
dropped off, IBM instituted sweeping changes, and Corrigan simultaneously 
posted his retirement notice. 
</P>
<P>
 A columnist at PC Week, a trade publication, maintained that Corrigan had been 
"beheaded by a new Armonk regime hell-bent on results through centralized 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 At Imax, which went public in June, Corrigan will enter a much smaller but 
fast-changing arena where computers and entertainment are melding. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Imax's owners is Douglas Trumbull, the motion-simulation wizard behind 
the "Back to the Future" ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Imax hopes to become the leader in providing highly technological 
entertainment outside the home, but it faces stiff competition from Iwerks 
Entertainment and Showscan Corp.

THE HUGHES CUTBACKS; AFTERSHOCK AT HUGHES; IN FULLERTON, 6,800 PONDER UNSURE 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co.'s 6,800 employees returned for another workday Tuesday but 
found their thoughts and conversations drifting back to the news that their 
plant would close next year and that hundreds of them could begin to receive 
layoff notices in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Company managers had few answers, despite the barrage of questions from 
workers about how the layoffs would be determined or which departments would be 
shifted to other company facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hughes announced a corporate consolidation that will result in 
4,400 layoffs in Southern California and the virtual shutdown of its 350-acre 
Fullerton facility by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The managers around here will say 'decisions are still being finalized' 
whenever they're asked about a specific job," said Tony Duenas, a command and 
control systems engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think even the middle managers here know what's going to happen, 
they're just being politically correct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Fullerton, the Hughes cutbacks will occur in El Segundo, where 
Hughes has 7,800 workers, and at some of Hughes' smaller defense systems 
plants, such as in Long Beach and Santa Barbara. Production from the company's 
surface ship systems division -- now in Fullerton with about 350 workers -- 
will be shifted mostly to Tucson and partly to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will provide laid-off workers with 60% of their salary for up to 
12 weeks, depending on their tenure, along with company-paid medical benefits 
for three months and $1,000 to help pay for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 Duenas, 44, and others compared notes and discussed their options should they 
be among those to lose their jobs. Despite the grim news, employees said they 
mostly tried to keep an upbeat attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 They faced constant reminders, however, of the plant's fate. Some meetings 
started late because workers were still talking about Monday's announcement, 
employees continued to send off a heavy load of electronic mail and there was 
plenty of gallows humor. One joke making the rounds, workers said, was that 
after the consolidation, it would be easy to get promoted because all of the 
smart people would have left voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were trying to get back to work, but it wasn't completely there," said 
one union representative at the plant. The Carpenters Union represents about 
1,000 workers in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few meetings with managers, but we've still got contracts and 
projects going that we have to work on," said engineer Mario Obejas, as he 
paused just outside the door to one of the enormous beige buildings on the 
rolling Hughes campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Dahlberg, one of the two senior managers at the Fullerton plant, held a 
question-and-answer session for workers early Tuesday morning. But he had few 
of the specifics that the workers were seeking, and employees were told that 
they would have more details in 30 to 60 days. In fact, it was unclear where 
Dahlberg himself would be relocated, some employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlberg recently had a custom-built house completed in Villa Park. But now, 
like many other Hughes workers in Fullerton, he was looking at a much longer 
commute if he were to transfer to an office in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Erickson, an engineer with the undersea systems division, which is 
expected to move to El Segundo, said many of his co-workers worry that longer 
commutes will mean they have less time to spend with their families. At a 
meeting with managers, he said, "One woman asked if the company was planning to 
provide her children with day care." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is too soon for the company to have answers to such specific questions, 
said a Hughes spokesman. "Everyone wants to know how it is going to affect them 
personally and we just don't know yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers said they think the company knows more details about the 
consolidation plan than it has revealed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm not as worried as I could be," said mechanic David Lopez, who has 
been in Fullerton for 16 years. "It's some people, especially single parents or 
(those who are) close to retiring" that would be hardest hit by a layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 45, said the mood at the Fullerton plant Tuesday was "as if you'd just 
missed an airplane or a bus" -- with much anxiety about whether the next one 
would have room for all the passengers. But he said he is "trying to be 
optimistic" about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 If offered a transfer to either El Segundo or Long Beach, Lopez said he will 
probably take the offer even if it means a longer commute than the half-hour it 
now takes him to drive from Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said he came to Hughes after working as a hairstylist in Oxnard. After 
beginning as a relatively unskilled mechanic, he was trained for the advanced 
assembly tasks of several different Hughes divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 If laid off, Lopez said, he would likely research job opportunities at smaller 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd just want to add my application to a pile, you really need 
to know something about a company before you just go in and apply," he said. 
"I'd say to them something like, 'I'll work for you for two weeks, and if it 
doesn't work out then you don't have to pay me,' " Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 About 700 employees will remain at two Hughes buildings at the Fullerton site. 
One of them, Connie Matthis, 45, said those in her division expect Hughes will 
eventually shut the remaining buildings some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't last more than a couple or three years," she said while talking 
with other employees during a late-morning cigarette break outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthis said she wakes up at 3:30 a.m. each day to make the drive from 
Inglewood in time to begin her shift at 6 a.m. as a microelectronic assembler 
in Hughes' radar division. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had heard most of Monday's announcement in advance from her 
landlord, a Hughes employee at another site. But while her job seems safe from 
the present round of cuts, Matthis said she doubts the 18 years she has worked 
in Orange County with Hughes will assure that she will be offered a transfer 
rather than a layoff notice in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, look at the economy today -- I don't think you can stay in one 
place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes has said it will try to match present employees with future job 
openings. But individuals will have to put some effort into such searches as 
well, Matthis said, referring to a copy of Hughes' current job listings she 
carried. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tony Duenas came to work for Hughes in 1973 after graduating from Cal State 
Long Beach with a degree in electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not expected to stay at the company this long, but said the chance to 
work on air traffic and air defense systems has kept him interested. Duenas has 
also worked on Hughes projects overseas, including three years in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Job security is a frequent topic of conversation these days, he said. Late 
last year, Duenas moved his wife and children to Saudi Arabia where he worked 
on an air defense project that is expected to last at least another five years. 
After only two months, Duenas was recalled to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was fortunate that he and his wife hadn't sold their house in Norco 
before they left. Instead they had left their college-age son and his 
grandmother there. "We had all our furniture, our cars here waiting for us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duenas said he expects his current job will be moved to Long Beach along with 
his division, which would add another 30 minutes to his drive. "I guess I'll 
have to get into a van pool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obejas of Huntington Beach, whose job involves air traffic systems, said he 
received a phone message from his mother in Miami Tuesday morning after she had 
seen a televised report of the plant closure. He planned to tell her that she 
shouldn't worry, because with his division is likely to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Though others are studying their career options as Hughes downsizes, Obejas 
said, he isn't worried yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I don't see a need to re-evaluate. Had I not been one of the ones 
whose division is being kept, then I think it would be time to take a deep look 
at all my options." 
</P>
<P>
 Obejas, 35, said that many employees blame President Clinton and congressional 
Democrats for the budget cuts that have hurt the local defense industry, 
although he thought that was "misdirected frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheney was downsizing too," he said, referring to Dick Cheney, secretary of 
defense under President George Bush.

FORKLIFT FIRM ANNOUNCES MOVE TO GEORGIA; INDUSTRY: KOMATSU JOINS THE EXODUS 
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NEW SITE OFFERS MORE CAPACITY AND FEWER RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Komatsu Forklift USA Inc. said Tuesday that it is joining the exodus from 
Southern California. The company, one of the world's biggest forklift 
manufacturers, said it is leaving its La Palma plant in late 1995 for a larger 
facility outside Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will mean the loss of nearly 140 sales and manufacturing jobs from 
Orange County, which was hit hard Monday when Hughes Aircraft said it was 
closing most of its Fullerton complex and laying off or moving 6,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Komatsu joins a parade of smaller companies that have given up on the 
regulations and cost of doing business in the Golden State over the past few 
years to seek more friendly business environs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira (Art) Otsuka, Komatsu's president, said the company might keep a small 
manufacturing operation here, but that would depend on demand for the product. 
He said the company now produces nearly 500 forklifts a month and will reach 
the plant's capacity of 600 a month by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new plant, to be built in Covington, Ga., will be able to produce 
up to 1,000 forklifts a month, Otsuka was not optimistic that the La Palma 
plant would remain open much beyond a break-in period for the Georgia facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not determined yet who will come with us," he said. "We do not know 
exactly how long we will have parallel operations there and here, and we don't 
know how the market will be then." 
</P>
<P>
 Production at the La Palma plant is restricted by state air quality 
regulations that prohibit the painting of more than 600 forklifts a month, 
Otsuka said. There are no such restrictions in Georgia, he said. In addition, 
labor costs and other fixed expenses are lower in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Komatsu Forklift, a subsidiary of heavy equipment maker Komatsu Ltd. in Japan, 
also wants to be closer to its customers. As many as 80% of its forklifts are 
sold east of the Mississippi, Otsuka said. In addition, transportation costs 
are unusually high because most of the heavy parts for making the forklifts 
come from Michigan and other Eastern and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, the government of the state of Georgia, the county and the city are 
offering financial incentives," Otsuka said. Among the inducements, he said, 
are tax concessions, free training for workers and incentives for plant 
construction.

THE HUGHES CUTBACKS; THE REAL JOB WILL BE HOW TO FIND WORK; LAYOFFS: LEARNING 
NEW SKILLS AND LOWERING PAY EXPECTATIONS ARE NECESSARY, EMPLOYMENT SPECIALISTS 
WARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Employment specialists say that defense workers like the 4,400 soon to be laid 
off by Hughes Aircraft Co. face a tough time in today's job market. 
</P>
<P>
 The high wages, generous benefit packages and highly specialized jobs that 
made aerospace work a career choice for many now makes those workers difficult 
to remove from the unemployment line, the employment specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a pretty harsh judgment, but even aerospace employers admit that 
it's true: Daniel J. Frownfelter, director of Hughes Aircraft Co.'s defense 
conversion adjustment program, said the average time between jobs for a newly 
laid-off aerospace worker in Southern California is 15 months. That compares to 
six months for most others. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the Hughes employees to be laid off in Southern California over the 
next 16 months -- 800 to 1,000 of them expected to be Fullerton employees -- 
the company has set up retraining and employment centers using a $6-million 
federal grant and $1.7 million in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding them jobs won't be easy: Many will have to learn new skills and 
most will have to dramatically cut back their pay and benefit expectations. 
They will be guided to careers in transportation and warehousing, international 
trade, telecommunications and health care, job specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is difficult for many of them to make the transition," said Jane 
O'Grady, administrator of the Job Training Partnership Act program in Orange 
County. Attitudes and acceptance of the way things are can be really important 
to successful job hunting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that several times when we have helped (former aerospace) people find 
jobs for $40,000 a year, we've found that they were holding out for $60,000. 
They don't see that sometimes you have to step down to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquie St. James is finding out the hard way. St. James, who was a production 
control administrator at Hughes' Fullerton campus, was laid off in May. She 
said she's been rejected so many times since then that she despairs for the 
Hughes workers expected to be laid off in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Her aerospace credentials are heavy baggage in interviews, St. James said, 
seemingly outweighing her college degree in business and six years in a Hughes 
management program. 
</P>
<P>
 At one major corporation in Brea, where she lives, St. James said she was told 
by a prospective employer that he had "seen people from Hughes at the store in 
the middle of the work day and wondered if there's any work ethic there. People 
think there is a lot of fluff in the aerospace industry, and they don't want to 
take a chance on hiring you." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that will help, suggested Costa Mesa job skills trainer Anthony 
Burnham, is to learn how to market achievement instead of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a few aerospace people come through our program, and they have 
been very bright, very technically aware, people with a lot of seniority," said 
Burnham, whose Pro-Active Institute trains people in how to re-enter and 
compete in the job market. "But they don't really know much about what's 
required to market themselves in today's workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, he said, aren't hiring people who talk of their years of loyal 
service. "They're hiring skills and results, not loyalty," he said. "So you 
need to learn how to quantify, so you can sit down and tell an interviewer in 
dollars earned and percentages gained and hours saved just what it was that you 
achieved in your previous job."  
</P>
<P>
 For its own workers, who are scheduled to start receiving layoff notices in 
six weeks, Hughes intends to conduct an intense retraining program, said 
program director Frownfelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Each laid-off worker will receive eight weeks' notice, and during that time 
there will be an extensive effort to find another job with the General Motors 
Hughes Electronics group of businesses, he said. If that doesn't work, or if an 
employee rejects another job with the company because he or she doesn't want to 
relocate or to do that kind of work, then the company's retraining program 
kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage job hunting, he said, Hughes has designed its severance package 
so that laid-off employees who don't actively pursue new jobs will lose their 
severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off employees also will be encouraged to seek outside employment during 
the eight-week period between their notice and their termination date, 
Frownfelter said. Job centers equipped with telephones, fax machines, employer 
guides and other tools needed to help with outside job searches are being set 
up.

 Those same centers will operate as headquarters for retraining programs for 
Hughes employees who don't find jobs within the company. The centers will be at 
the Fullerton plant, in Rancho Cucamonga and in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 The retraining programs are administered by a Los Angeles-based company called 
Defcon and are offered through a variety of public and private schools. Hughes 
will pay the first $1,000 in training costs, Frownfelter said. Government funds 
will cover the remainder.

AST RESEARCH FACES SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer maker AST Research Inc., already facing two lawsuits alleging that it 
misled investors early this year, was sued again Tuesday by shareholders who 
said the computer maker duped them about its financial condition this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest class action was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by the 
same law firm that filed one of the lawsuits in March.It came 12 days after the 
company's stock price dropped nearly $4.94 a share to $13.06 a share after AST 
revealed that it expects to post a large loss, instead of the expected profit, 
for the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 AST lawyer Robert Vanderet said the latest lawsuit against the Irvine-based 
technology company "appears to be another knee-jerk abusive securities fraud 
suit of the kind that are routinely filed after the announcement of adverse 
financial news."

TMI TRANSFERS INVESTORS' SUIT FROM O.C. TO L.A. FEDERAL COURT

 Lawyers for Teachers Management & Investment Corp. said Tuesday they have 
transferred a lawsuit filed against the Newport Beach investment fund from 
Orange County to U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Four investors sued the 26-year-old fund on Aug. 23 in Orange County Superior 
Court alleging that its operators lost $100 million of client funds through 
fraud and racketeering.The suit seeks appointment of a receiver, alleging that 
TMI, which marketed real estate investments to teachers across California, is 
now insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Company owners Maurice B. Shuman and James R. Martin, who have denied the 
allegations, maintain that the downturn in the real estate market is 
responsible for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on whether to appoint a receiver for the company had been scheduled 
for next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably won't be a hearing then," said David Grant, partner with Grant 
& Laubscher), the Irvine law firm representing TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said TMI wanted the suit moved because federal courts are generally 
better suited to "manage the complex issues involved in the lawsuit, including 
TMI's efforts to put the issues to either a vote of the limited partners or 
arbitration." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer for investors called the move by TMI a "judge-shopping" ploy. "They 
can try and pick whatever judge they want, but the day of justice will come," 
said Ron Rus, who represents the plaintiffs.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL CO-FOUNDER QUITS BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Security Environmental Systems Inc. said Tuesday that co-founder Stephen 
Grossman has resigned from the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental, based in Huntington Beach, would not give a reason for 
the resignation by Grossman, who stepped down as president more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, co-founders Jonathan Grossman and Alfred Grossman, both of whom are 
board members, have renegotiated their contracts with Security Environmental, 
the company said. President Ellen Batzel has reduced their salaries and 
broadened the termination clause of their contracts, the company said, and the 
two have turned their voting power over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Grossman's annual salary was reduced to $90,000 from $125,000. Alfred 
Grossman's was reduced to $60,000 from $125,000. A company spokesman said the 
decision to reduce the Grossmans' salaries was made as part of an overhaul of 
the entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman family members are still major shareholders in Security 
Environmental. Of the 3.5 million outstanding shares of the company's stock, 
which trades on the Nasdaq market, the Grossmans own about 1.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental, founded in 1972, collects and disposes of hazardous 
waste.

 Groundwater Remediation Inc.: The Orange County company, which cleans 
contaminated soil and ground water, said Tuesday it is being purchased by an 
environmental holding company based in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 EIF Holdings Inc. of Honolulu said it expects to close the deal by the end of 
the month.Terms were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 EIF Holdings is in an acquisition phase, Executive Vice President Andy 
Kasianchuk said. Groundwater Remediation, based in Orange, was an attractive 
target primarily because it has a presence in California, he said. "It is a 
small company, but through our eight offices in California we will be able to 
market its services." 
</P>
<P>
 Groundwater Remediation, which is also involved with the construction and 
servicing of underground tanks, will continue to provide services in 
California, Nevada and Arizona.

A TAMER GAME FEED; AFTER A FINE LAST YEAR, CHARITY BARBECUE WILL BUY MEAT, NOT 
HUNT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 26 years it's been a fall ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by promises of camaraderie and good food, as many as 500 hunters and 
their friends -- including some prominent Orange County citizens -- pay $75 for 
tickets to the Wild Game Feed barbecue near Irvine Lake where they play 
volleyball, toss horseshoes and eat such game as antelope, boar, elk, mountain 
goat, buffalo and caribou. Publicized only by word of mouth, the all-male 
gathering has raised thousands for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual will be on again this Friday, but with one important difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of feasting on animals killed by the hunters, participants will be 
spreading their tables with meat bought from wild game producers in Texas and 
Wyoming, as well as local supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: a raid last year by state Fish and Game officers that shut down 
the feed, just before the feast was served. Organizers paid $33,790 last week 
to settle a lawsuit charging them with violating state regulations against 
selling meat obtained by hunters holding sport, rather than commercial, 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nothing but extortion," said Denny Vopat, a Wild Game Feed founder who 
works in the sporting goods industry. "We did this for 25 years under the Fish 
and Game's noses. If they thought we were wrong, they could have driven up in 
their car and said, 'Hey boys, you're illegal,' and we'd have stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Howard Clark, president of Wild Game Feed Inc., which puts on the event: 
"We absolutely, positively had no thought that we were reselling the game that 
was donated." 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game officials and the district attorney's office saw the 
matter differently, however. The civil lawsuit eventually filed against the 
event's organizers charged them with conducting the unlawful business practice 
of selling meat without the proper hunting license, and false or misleading 
advertising for promising to serve meats -- such as mountain lion and black 
bear -- which were not actually available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most just and fair way of resolving this," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Matthew Anderson said of the settlement, adding that there was no evidence of 
intent to break the law. "The remedy . . . seems to address the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, organizers say, the legality of the event had never been questioned, 
despite the routine attendance of police chiefs, sheriff's deputies, judges, 
politicians and, according to Clark, state Fish and Game Commissioner Gus Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen was in Washington Tuesday for confirmation hearings on his nomination as 
an Interstate Commerce commissioner and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Langhauser, a retired Orange County Central Municipal Court judge now 
living in Palm Desert, said that he himself attended the event at least four 
times and never questioned its legality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever thought about it," he said. "You just had a lot of food (game) in 
your refrigerator and you brought it down and gave it to the guys. What could 
be illegal about that? Somebody has to get some money for it to be illegal and 
these guys never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Among recipients of the annual charity -- which netted several thousand 
dollars a year -- were the Sierra Club, Ducks Unlimited (a national group 
fostering habitats for wildlife), crippled children's programs and campership 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pretty classy bunch of guys," Langhauser said. "It was very 
pleasant. Just a bunch of guys getting together who knew each other from a bar 
or from work. I met some very nice people as a result; they were kind of the 
movers and the shakers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering got started in the mid-1960s when a small group of hunter 
friends gathered at a restaurant in Orange to "talk about politics, hunting and 
fishing," said Grant Clark, 70, (no relation to Howard). Among the group's 
founders, he said, was Pete Winslow, then an Orange County marshal. Later, 
Clark said, the group met for a barbecue in the back yard of one of its members 
and eventually began holding its annual fund-raiser in parks. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the gatherings spread, prominent citizens began showing up. At one 
time or another, organizers say, they included a state senator, President 
Richard Nixon's chief pilot, at least one professional athlete, developers, a 
former county sheriff and numerous other law enforcement officers and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just grew and grew like Topsy," Grant Clark said. "Everyone wanted to 
come; we had every known animal" on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's menu seems no different, despite the fact that everything on it 
was bought rather than donated. In addition to such meats as venison and 
"African game," it promises turkey, duck, pheasant, quail, goose, salmon, 
clams, albacore, yellowtail, trout, sea bass and blue marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 To help defray the cost of settling the lawsuit and pay for buying the meat, 
organizers say, the price of tickets has been raised from $75 to $85. The 
increased costs is likely to significantly decrease the amount of money raised 
for charity, said Howard Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, organizers said, all the tickets -- some 500 -- had been sold.  
</P>
<P>
 And so on Wednesday night, as they do every year, a few of the guys will go 
down to the barbecue site near the lake to begin preparing the fire pits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got grandfathers, fathers and sons coming to this thing," Howard Clark 
said. "It's limited to people who get along well and enjoy this type of 
activity. People think we're a bunch of bad guys, (but) it's for friends of 
friends to come out and enjoy the day."

TOLLWAY SUIT ARGUED BEFORE APPEALS PANEL; COURTS: JUDGE QUESTIONS 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OFFER OF ALTERNATIVES TO PUTTING ROADWAY THROUGH LAGUNA 
CANYON. RULING IS DUE LATER THIS YEAR ON WHETHER NEW STUDIES SHOULD BE MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A skeptical U.S. appeals court heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit by 
environmentalists to force a key federal agency to further study a planned 
4.7-mile section of tollway that cuts through Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard Joel R. 
Reynolds, attorney for Laguna Greenbelt Inc., criticize an environmental study 
done on the roadway and offer several alternatives to the road's cleaving the 
environmentally sensitive canyon. But the concept was questioned by one of the 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If alternatives are proposed, is there anything in the law that says they 
have to be considered?" asked Judge Alex Kozinski, referring to federal 
environmental laws, which do not require agencies to adopt alternatives even 
when proposed in their own environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court is expected to issue a ruling later this year in the suit, 
which charges that a federal agency did an inadequate environmental study of 
the project before giving its approval to the current route, which runs 17 
miles between San Juan Capistrano and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the disputed stretch in the canyon was halted last September when a 
federal judge issued an injunction against construction in the canyon, so both 
sides could argue the outstanding issues in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency and the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, which want to build the disputed link between 
Newport Coast Drive and El Toro Road, countered the environmentalists' claims 
by saying that numerous alternatives were considered by the agencies, and that 
many steps are being taken to protect the canyon's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attorney John L. Flynn said that much of the habitat surrounding 
the proposed road through Laguna Canyon would be targeted for development today 
had it not been converted to a greenbelt as part of the controversial tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of acres of this greenbelt would not be committed to open space 
were it not for . . . this (toll road)," said Flynn. There was no dispute from 
Reynolds to Flynn's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn maintained that the federal agency's study was more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side argued for 20 minutes before the panel, which also included 
Appellate Judges Wilfred Feinberg and Mary M. Schroeder. The case was argued at 
the end of the morning session in a mostly empty courtroom. There was a handful 
of environmentalists present to hear the give and take. After the hearing, both 
sides predicted the judges would rule in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds argued that the Federal Highway Administration, the agency of the 
Transportation Department that approved the tollway, failed to study the use of 
bridges, viaducts and tunnels as alternatives to leveling hills and filling 
ravines in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn countered, saying the tollway agency plans to build 78 structures, 
including bridges and animal crossings, in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the courtroom, the environmentalists suggested that an acceptable 
compromise would reduce the number of lanes in the canyon from six to four. 
Reducing the number of lanes would mitigate damage to the environment and 
wildlife in the area, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redesigning the project as a downsized facility would be beneficial, but 
there was never any discussion of it," said Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating two lanes would defeat the purpose of the tollway, Flynn answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's simply not going to accommodate the volume of traffic required by (the 
project)," said Flynn. "It's got to satisfy the demand for volume for which 
this project was designed." 
</P>
<P>
 According to tollway agency figures, the toll road would accommodate 150,000 
vehicle trips per day when it is completed by 1997. After the bonds that were 
sold to finance the $800-million project are paid off some time next century, 
commuters will be allowed free access to the road, and officials estimate that 
usage will then increase to 160,000 trips per day. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also did not appear impressed by Reynolds' argument that the federal 
transportation agency erred in assuming that the tollway would be built when it 
did projections about the road's impact on development and growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the federal agency never analyzed the area's growth without the 
toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to do projections that don't include the toll road," he said. "The 
road is on all of their maps." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said it is impossible to calculate what South County would be like 
without the tollway, since the thoroughfare has been a part of the Orange 
County master plan since 1976 and its construction was a part of most 
development plans for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (tollway) has contributed to growth. We have never denied that. But it's 
impossible to say to what degree," said Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Justice Department attorney Ellen J. Durkee, who represented the Federal 
Highway Administration, argued that environmentalists had an all but impossible 
task if they are trying to prove that the federal agency did not do an adequate 
environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have to prove that the (Federal Highway Administration) was 
wrong at every step of the way," said Durkee. "That's a lot of hoops to jump 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway agency officials said the environmental review process took about 20 
years, and U.S. Department of Transportation authorities in 1992 delayed 
approval of the final environmental report for 16 months while they consulted 
with other federal agencies.

POLICE PONDER CALLS TO TALK SHOW, HOME OF MISSING WOMAN; INVESTIGATION: RADIO 
CONTACT IS BELIEVED A HOAX, BUT MOTHER OF FULLERTON COLLEGE STUDENT IS 
UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE OTHER.

<P>
 The search for a 20-year-old Placentia woman who disappeared a week ago took a 
bizarre turn Tuesday as police investigated phone calls made to her home and to 
a radio station by someone claiming to be the missing Fullerton College 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the call to an Iranian talk-radio program Monday night was 
a hoax. But they acknowledged that Mahtab Ghalandar might have telephoned her 
mother earlier that evening to say she was being prevented from coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure would like to decide that it was her," said Detective Corinne Loomis, 
adding that investigators have no clues concerning Ghalandar's whereabouts 
since she vanished from a bus stop across from Fullerton College on Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect foul play in the disappearance but doubt that Ghalandar was 
abducted by force from the busy bus stop on Chapman Avenue, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, detectives think Ghalandar was approached by an acquaintance who gave 
her a ride, Loomis said. However, there are no suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go look at that area in the afternoons, it's just swarming with 
people," Loomis said of the bus stop where Ghalandar was last seen by a 
classmate about 2:15 p.m. "There are people everywhere. . . . I don't think she 
could have been taken by force." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar and her family moved to Placentia a year ago from Iran. Though she 
speaks little English, Ghalandar made friends at Fullerton College as well as 
in the county's Iranian community, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two telephone calls were among the few leads investigators had in the 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call was placed Monday about 5:30 p.m. to the Placentia apartment 
that Ghalandar shares with her parents and 12-year-old sister, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ghalandar's mother answered the phone, the caller said "Mom?" according 
to Loomis. The mother excitedly responded "Mahtab?" prompting the 12-year-old 
sister to cry hysterically, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ghalandar's mother tried to calm her younger daughter, the caller said that 
she was "OK" but that "they" would not allow her to come home, Loomis said. 
Without further elaboration, the caller hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the commotion, Ghalandar's mother told police through an interpreter 
that she was only 50% sure that the voice on the phone was that of her 
daughter, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second call was made about three hours later to an Iranian radio station 
based in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The female caller told a talk radio audience that she ran away from home 
because her parents were too strict, Loomis said. The caller said she planned 
to stay away for about a week. At first, the caller was reluctant to give her 
name. But she eventually identified herself as Ghalandar, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller refused to say where she was calling from when asked by the radio 
interviewer, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Monday night played a recording of the interview to family members, 
who all agreed that the voice was not that of Ghalandar, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they doubt Ghalandar ran away from home, noting that she had plans 
with her sister the afternoon she vanished and had scheduled an outing with a 
friend for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dead in the water," Loomis said of the radio station call. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar's family and friends, along with Placentia police, have posted more 
than 200 flyers around the Fullerton College area. Ghalandar is 5 feet, 5 
inches tall, weighs 140 pounds and has dark brown hair and brown eyes. She was 
last seen wearing at oatmeal-colored shirt with flowers on it and a gold chain 
with Arabic letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Police urge anyone with information in the case to call them at (714) 
993-8164.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 101 DALMATIANS? SOMETIMES IT MUST SEEM SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day, Randy Warner is surrounded by Dalmatians. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, he had three dogs, but that changes day to day: He has been 
known to have as many as 15 running around his one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started 10 years ago, Warner says, when he spotted a Dalmatian at a dog 
pound that was going to be put to sleep because it didn't have any polka dots. 
He took the dog home, even though he had been looking for a blue-eyed collie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Costa Mesa dog trainer has adopted hundreds of Dalmatians from 
pounds across Orange County, and then tapped into his dog-lovers network to 
find them homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Warner has had his problems. He has been kicked out of six 
apartments in three cities, jailed for code violations three times and cited 
countless more times by animal control officers for having too many dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warner, 40, keeps on. And people continue to drop homeless dogs at his 
doorstep -- wherever he may live. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he says, he gets anonymous tips from workers at dog pounds who 
can't bear to see another Dalmatian put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go through 40 pounds of dog food a week," Warner said while sitting in his 
apartment, which has a small yard. "But a lot of my neighbors don't understand 
what I do. I have a lot of enemies and I have a lot of friends, but I'm not in 
this to make friends, I'm in this to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 He belongs to the Southern California Breed Rescue Assn. and trains dogs at 
his school, the California Canine College. 
</P>
<P>
 While Warner's love for the Dalmatian has made him nomadic, it has also 
brought him moments of fame: He has appeared on the David Letterman and Arsenio 
Hall television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Letterman show, one woman had written in to tell the host to buy a new 
shirt because she was sick of seeing the same ones each week. To which 
Letterman responded, "Lady, I need a new shirt like I need 51 Dalmatians on my 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Warner came marching onstage with 51 dogs in tow.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; POLICE, FIRE SPARED CUTS IN BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a budget for the new fiscal year 
that preserves police, fire and maintenance services at their current levels. 
The budget was balanced by cutting $2 million through a series of restructuring 
moves at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said the process of drafting the $27.2-million budget 
was "a long one and a difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
 "We started several months ago working with staff to evaluate the entire 
budget, top to bottom," Parker said. "One of the things we did was a tremendous 
amount of community outreach to determine our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The top concern that emerged from a community values survey and other sources 
of feedback from residents was that the city should maintain its commitment to 
public safety, Parker said. The second-highest priority was "keeping the city 
clean and looking good," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been faced with "a severe budget challenge" over the past three 
years, according to City Manager Frank Benest. Inflation has led to higher 
costs for employee salaries, materials and equipment, while the recession has 
cut into tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Further exacerbating the city's financial problems was the loss of $6.3 
million in state funding since the 1991-92 fiscal year, Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said the city responded by cutting "a little bit of everything" at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recognizing the situation wasn't going to change -- we realized we needed to 
make some major restructuring in the way we do business," Parker said. This 
included the elimination of 32 vacant or soon-to-be-vacant positions at City 
Hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also saving money by contracting out certain services, recruiting 
volunteers to help at the police and fire departments and using technology to 
enhance productivity. ALAN EYERLY

<P>
 The state has given $309,000 to fund emergency housing programs for homeless 
people in the county.

 The money was made available under the State Emergency Housing and Assistance 
Program. The money will be given to groups that provide shelter as well as 
"self-sufficiency development" programs to homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the state program is to make homeless people self-sufficient. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; YOM KIPPUR, JUDAISM'S HOLIEST DAY, BEGINS AT 
SUNDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yom Kippur, the holiest and most solemn day on the Jewish religious calendar, 
begins at sundown tonight and runs through Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews who observe Yom Kippur spend the "Day of Atonement" fasting, praying and 
refraining from work. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday marks the end of a 10-day period of repentance, which began last 
week with Rosh Hashanah, which commemorates the beginning of a new year on the 
Jewish calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who observe the holiday, Yom Kippur is a time to have one's actions 
judged by God. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews beg God to inscribe them in His "Book of Life" for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The high holidays also mark the busiest part of the year for Orange County 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some congregations have moved their services into auditoriums and 
hotel meeting rooms because their temples could not handle the large crowds. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO REVIVE BALBOA BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a land use plan that will guide municipal 
efforts to revitalize the Balboa Peninsula business district for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid mixed reactions from peninsula residents and business owners, the council 
voted 6 to 0 Monday night to support the Central Balboa Specific Area Plan, the 
result of three years of committee study and negotiation.Councilwoman Jean Watt 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope a concerted plan to make the business district more 
visible, provide easy access and add parking for visitors will help lure 
businesses into vacant buildings and storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's like a blueprint for the future," Mayor Clarence Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents fear the plan will draw businesses geared for visitors 
without serving the needs of peninsula residents. Property owners are concerned 
the plan's design standards will force them to remodel to conform to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two dozen 'he's gotta dos' that . . . (a business owner) doesn't 
gotta do right now," property owner Clarence Herberts told the council. "We're 
not living in old Russia; we're living in Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Other business owners touted the plan as a way to clean up dirty sidewalks and 
spruce up an area that draws primarily young, low-spending customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Features of the plan include planned restriping of a city parking lot at the 
foot of the Balboa Pier to add 109 parking spaces without removing trees or 
expanding the lot; use of decorative pavers, street lamps, benches and planters 
to unify the district; design review for new facades or remodeled stores, to 
establish continuity while encouraging innovative design; and improved signs to 
direct visitors to businesses and parking by funneling traffic out of 
residential neighborhoods. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOL BOARD WILL NOT JOIN CONSORTIUM YET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea Olinda Unified School District board members have decided to see if the 
city approves a plan to develop Olinda Heights before joining a consortium led 
by the Cal State Fullerton Foundation that favors low-income housing for 
university and school district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has yet to consider the project, and trustees feared that by 
joining the consortium now, city officials would consider the move as an 
endorsement of the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials said the consortium would offer school district employees 
the opportunity to buy affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Resources Inc. wants to build 867 homes on 277 acres in Olinda 
Heights. The foundation wants 395 of those homes made available for affordable 
housing for faculty and other university employees. The consortium wants an 
additional 232 homes made available to employees of several surrounding school 
and college districts. 
</P>
<P>
 If school districts do not join the consortium, the 232 homes would be offered 
at market value, said Bill Dickerson, executive director of Cal State Fullerton 
Foundation. To join the consortium, school and college districts each must pay 
a $5,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda school trustees said they favor low-income housing for district 
employees but did not want to commit $5,000. They said the district's teachers 
and classified employees unions will be told that they may join the consortium.

<P>
 The Costa Mesa High School varsity cheerleading squad has made it to the 
National Cheerleading Finals in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad, called Spirit Leaders, finished first among 50 high schools from 
across the state in a meet at UCLA last month, sponsored by the United Dance 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the cheerleaders performed the dance that catapulted them into 
the national finals during a pep rally in the high school's main gym. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one obstacle in the way of the competition in Orlando, Fla.: The girls 
must raise $20,000 to pay for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to raise the money by February," said an anxious Lance 
Thompson-Hailstone, whose daughter, Rachel, a junior, is a member of the squad. 
"That means we need a lot of commitment and a lot of help, because it's a lot 
of money in such a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 While the cheerleaders are out hawking entertainment booklets that offer 50% 
off at fancy restaurants and fast-food chains around the county, parents are 
trying to contact possible sponsors, said Thompson-Hailstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Carwashes and garage sales will also be held. 
</P>
<P>
 If the girls compete in the finals, it will do wonders for the reputation of 
the high school, parents and teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very prestigious," said Thompson-Hailstone. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Joanne Shimpock at (714) 556-3192. Contributions 
can be sent to Costa Mesa High School, c/o Spirit Leaders, 2650 Fairview Road, 
Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COMMISSIONERS APPROVE PLANS TO BUILD 
RECREATION AREA FOR DOGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing from vocal dog lovers who support a dog park, the city's Parks 
and Recreation Commission has given preliminary approval for a recreation area 
for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners on Monday suggested cutting some amenities, such as drinking 
fountains, a wrought-iron fence, trees and some benches, to reduce the original 
$90,000 cost estimate by more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners also said they hope the park on Street of the Golden Lantern 
can be built with donations from local animal rights groups or dog owners who 
would no longer have to trek to Laguna Beach's "Bark Park" to let their dogs 
run loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not just talking about dogs, you're talking about people," said Parks 
and Recreation Commissioner Mark DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that by building a dog park, the city will move beyond just developing 
sports fields for local youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another angle we need to complete for the people of Laguna 
Niguel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is planned for two-thirds of an acre of vacant land next to Fire 
Station No. 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Dog owners had inundated the commission with stories of friendships created 
among people who take their pets to Laguna Beach's dog park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole ambience that isn't at any other park," said Liz Lafferty, 
who takes her puppy to the Laguna Beach park about three times a week. Visitors 
"have something in common, while at other parks people go off in their own 
family clusters. The feeling is almost always one of ease. It's quiet, pleasant 
and upbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners plan to notify animal rights groups such as the Dana 
Point-based Animal Rescue Foundation, or ARF, when the final cost estimate is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to see how much money the groups could raise for the installation 
and upkeep of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 ARF has already pledged to support fund-raising efforts. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; A QUILT THAT IS SEWN WITH THREADS OF FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pile of children's posters that came to Esther Dendel's crafts studio four 
years ago could have aged on parents' refrigerators and been relegated to some 
dusty box. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 23 of those works have been meticulously re-created in fabric by the 
18 women of Dendel's quilting circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The final product -- which was stored at the Orange Central Library until 
funds could be found to buy a frame -- was unveiled for the City Council on 
Tuesday before it was hung in the children's section of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The women who spent close to a year stitching the quilt still value the time 
they spent creating it. Quilts, which have gained popularity in recent years, 
now sell for as much as thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are seeing quilts as an art form now," Dendel said. "Before, it was a 
way of using up scrap." 
</P>
<P>
 Dendel, 84, and her husband, Jo, who had crafted mosaic panels for the library 
in their Costa Mesa workshop, were originally asked by library officials to 
make mosaics of the children's drawings. Dendel's arthritis, however, ruled out 
the heavy work. 
</P>
<P>
 So, she suggested asking the craftspeople who use her studio to make a quilt. 
Some, like Marylin Kattan -- a professional quilter -- were skilled in sewing. 
Others were jewelry makers or potters or weavers. They divided up the often 
tedious work of tracing the drawings of children's books onto applique squares. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they shared the confidences of a group that works closely. 
"It's surprising some of the things people will reveal about themselves," 
Dendel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work projects always come to an end, but this one was not hard to give up, the 
women said. "We could give up the product because we had the process," Dendel 
explained. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PETERS GETS TEACHER AT HOME UNTIL CLASS 
FOUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 6-year-old boy at the center of an ongoing battle over the inclusion of 
special education students in mainstream classes has been assigned a home 
school teacher until a stalemate over his permanent school placement ends. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher with the Ocean View School District began working with Jimmy Peters 
at home Monday, Supt.James R. Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions with the boy's father are continuing in an effort to find Jimmy a 
permanent class. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the district's opinion, home teaching does not replace school," Tarwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the home school program, the boy will receive five hours a week of 
academic lessons, five hours a week of speech therapy, 1 1/2 hours a week of 
special physical education at school and two hours a week of occupational 
therapy at a special center, Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters, the boy's father, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had planned for Jimmy to start school last week at Circle View 
Elementary, where school officials spent $5,000 on arrangements, including 
special training for a teacher and an aide, and preparing a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Peters pulled his son from the school, saying the district's efforts 
were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View administrators filed suit against Jimmy last spring seeking to 
remove him from a Circle View kindergarten class, saying he was disruptive and 
prone to violent outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge later sent Jimmy back to the class for the final days of 
school amid protests from some parents of his classmates. ANNA CEKOLA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has changed the business hours at its headquarters on 
Acacia Parkway, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Dave Abrecht said that under the new schedule, which took effect 
Saturday, non-emergency matters, such as requests for insurance reports, will 
be accepted from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday at the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby and front desk are closed for business on Sundays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes will enable the department to provide better service because all 
desk employees will be available during the designated business hours, Abrecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every effort is being made to deploy our limited resources in a manner that 
has the most impact on community safety," he said. "This will allow us to place 
a majority of our . . . personnel in the field, solving neighborhood problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Business hours were previously 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily. The new schedule 
is the result of a recent study that indicated the hours that people are likely 
to conduct non-emergency business, Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, members of the public may still make non-emergency police reports by 
telephone between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. every day, he said. BERT ELJERA

 A delegation of Christian leaders visited North Korea earlier this month to 
explore the possibility of exchange visits with religious groups there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Wooding, founder and president of a Garden Grove-based ministry, met in 
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with North Korean leaders, including Choe 
Thae Bok, secretary general of the nation's ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation was led by David Cho, a Korean American Christian leader who 
helped arrange the recent visits to North Korea of evangelist Billy Graham and 
former President Jimmy Carter, Wooding said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooding said the delegation included Michael Little, president of the 
Virginia-based Christian Broadcasting Network, and Charles Wickman, pastor of 
the Kempsville Presbyterian Church of Virginia Beach, Va., and executive 
director of the Center for American-North Korean Understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 While in North Korea, the U.S. delegation met with officials of the Christian 
Federation of North Korea, one of the few religious groups the government 
allows to operate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooding said that CBN might be allowed to broadcast a Korean-language version 
of the popular "Superbook" series of animated Bible stories, which has been 
translated into 34 languages. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; OFFICIALS FIND SOURCE OF BLUE PLASTIC DEBRIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard officials have determined that hundreds of small, sky-blue 
plastic spirals and sponges that washed up on local beaches this summer were 
inadvertently released into the San Gabriel River by two Long Beach electric 
generating stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The inch-long spirals and sponges, considered nontoxic by county health 
officials, are flushed through power-plant pipes to scrub away algae. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power admitted responsibility for all 
of the sponges and a small quantity of the spirals, which were released from 
the Haynes Generating Station in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Southern California Edison Co. spokesman said that after a thorough 
investigation, company officials determined that none of the blue spirals came 
from Edison's Alamitos Generating Station, located directly across the San 
Gabriel River from the Haynes power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes station Supt. Kenneth Bosworth said the DWP power plant typically uses 
the sponges instead of the blue spirals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to point fingers at each other," Bosworth said. "We could have 
lost a small number of those blue rubber spirals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard inspected operations at both electric generating stations. 
Neither plant will be fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to require both facilities to change how they retrieve these 
things after use," said Lt. Mark Cunningham, chief of the Coast Guard marine 
environmental response division. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gordon Labedz, an environmental activist with the Surfrider Foundation and 
a Seal Beach resident, said hundreds of the blue spirals have littered beaches 
during the summer but only a few have washed up in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never noticed them before this summer," Labedz said. "I've been noticing 
the blue sponges for years."RUSS LOAR

<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that would set 
guidelines for land development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It voted 4 to 0 on Monday to approve a subdivision ordinance updating the 
city's development laws for the first time in more than 20 years. Councilman 
Charles E. Sylvia was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will reflect changes in state law and recent court rulings 
relating to how land is parceled or combined for development, City Atty. Thomas 
W. Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key provision requires developers to notify neighboring property owners 
before dividing or combining lots for housing or commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the ordinance would require developers to set aside areas for 
public uses in proposed developments. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed low-income housing project for people with the AIDS virus that has 
so far enjoyed strong support from this city will be examined by the Laguna 
Beach Planning Commission tonight at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners will also consider two other projects that have stirred public 
interest: construction of a reservoir in the Top of the World neighborhood and 
the redevelopment of an oceanfront parcel that includes the old Fahrenheit 451 
bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.2-million housing project calls for the renovation of a building at 480 
Mermaid St. and construction of 25 one-bedroom apartments where people infected 
with HIV can live independently.Laguna Beach, which has by far the highest per 
capita incidence of AIDS in Orange County, has already allocated $736,000 to 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The major funding for the development will come from a $1.8-million federal 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending that the commission endorse the plan before 
forwarding it to the City Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is also recommending approval of a conditional use permit and 
coastal development permit for construction of a 3-million-gallon water 
reservoir next to Alta Laguna Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After previously resisting the project, the City Council helped clear the way 
for the tank's construction in May by striking an agreement allowing the Laguna 
Beach County Water District to buy the reservoir site. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's earlier resistance to construction of the tank on an 
environmentally sensitive knoll became a politically charged issue after last 
fall's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 In another controversial matter, commissioners will also decide whether to 
approve a plan to redevelop a bluff top next to the Hotel Laguna, including the 
old Fahrenheit 451 bookstore. LESLIE EARNEST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. has appointed a former colleague with the San 
Marino Fire Department as assistant fire chief of the Westminster Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said Tuesday that Timothy J. Murphy has been picked from more than 40 
applicants to serve as second in command of the city's 63-member department, 
which is in the midst of a City Council-authorized reorganization of its 
management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, DeMonaco appointed Donald C. Tully division chief in charge of fire 
prevention, and this month, DeMonaco is expected to name the head of the 
paramedics and training division. 
</P>
<P>
 The council ordered the changes last year to control the department's overtime 
expenses, improve its efficiency and make top-ranking officials more 
accountable by stopping the practice of rotating positions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, Murphy was a battalion chief in the San Marino Fire 
Department, where DeMonaco was fire chief for four years until he was appointed 
to head the Westminster department last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As assistant fire chief, Murphy will be responsible for operations, serve as 
the department's spokesman and be acting fire chief in DeMonaco's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to earn $6,200 to $7,200 a month under a salary schedule 
recently approved by the council.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD SETTING ITS GOALS FOR NEW 
YEAR

<P>
 Dealing with multicultural students and pressing on with technology programs 
are among priorities the Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees hope 
to tackle this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year the board wants to identify certain goals for that school year in 
an attempt to improve the district and to move the district ahead into the 21st 
Century," trustee Larry R. Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sept. 22 meeting, trustees are expected to decide which goals to 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees at last Thursday's meeting agreed to continue working to resolve 
overcrowding at the three middle schools, develop programs to modernize schools 
and decide what to do with the district's nine vacant school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Among new issues identified were to deal with unfunded state and federal 
mandates that place financial burdens on the district, ensure a nutritional 
lunch program, and monitor the voluntary uniform policy at Roch Courreges 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Robert Sedlak said working with parents and students to bring 
the ethnically diverse school populations together is among his new goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said, for example, that some parents have misconceptions about English 
and non-English speaking students in the same classroom: "Every classroom is 
conducted in English and students who aren't proficient in English are given 
tutoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Barbara Vogel said she'd like to see the district "toughen up academic 
standards." Trustee Julie Hoxsie said board education on special education 
issues and a districtwide disaster preparedness program top her list. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Catherine Hacker wants to look at the district's deferred maintenance 
program to ensure that children on the playground are as safe as when they are 
in the classroom. DEBRA CANO

MOTHER OF 2 HIT IN GANG CROSS-FIRE DIES; NO ARRESTS MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old woman who was shot in a gang cross-fire last weekend died of her 
wounds Monday without regaining consciousness, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Corona of Westminster had been in critical condition since the shooting 
in the 1300 block of West Pine Street.She was sitting in a parked vehicle when 
occupants drove by and began firing at another car, according to Sgt. Dennis 
Rios. The shooting was gang-related, Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupant of one of the cars, Gabriel Chairez, 23, is still hospitalized 
with bullet wounds, police said, and a second occupant, Charles Camacho, 18, 
was released after being treated for minor wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona, the mother of two small children, had just left a Mexican restaurant 
when the shooting occurred. She held two jobs to support the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona's family could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in the case, Rios said, and the investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings took place near where police staged one of the city's largest 
gang crackdowns last week. In that sweep, more than 100 people were indicted on 
drug and other charges.

ORDER TO STRIKE FLAGS ESCALATES CITY BATTLE WITH BUSINESS; LAW: NEW TIRE STORE 
CITED FOR FLYING 23 WHEN ORDINANCE ALLOWS ONLY THREE. OWNERS CLAIM THE RIGHT TO 
DISPLAY ALL THEY WANT AND VOW TO GO TO JAIL BEFORE TAKING ANY DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A weeklong battle over Old Glory escalated Tuesday when city code enforcement 
officials fired off a citation to the owners of a new tire store for displaying 
too many American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The citation warned Big O Tires co-owners and self-proclaimed patriots Mike 
Altman and Ryan Christensen they have until Thursday to take down at least 20 
of 23 flags or face fines and a possible six-month jail sentence. A 27-year-old 
sign and banner ordinance forbids citizens from flying more than three American 
flags on a property at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman and Christensen vow their Stars and Stripes display on West Lincoln 
Avenue isn't coming down and that they'll go to jail if necessary to keep the 
flags flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way we are taking down the flags," said Christensen, 33, a former Eagle 
Scout and Boy Scouts leader. "This is a First Amendment right protected under 
freedom of speech and guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 But to city officials, the flap over the flags isn't about the Constitution, 
it's about aesthetics. They say the ordinance was enacted to reduce visual 
clutter. 
</P>
<P>
 If at least 20 of the flags are not retired Thursday, code enforcement 
officials warn, they will initially fine the businessmen $55. The pair would 
receive similar fines upon additional inspections as long as the flags continue 
to fly. Ultimately, the penalty could reach a fine of $1,000 and up to six 
months in jail for violating the code, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Altman, 32, who served in the Navy: "My reaction to that is if they (the 
city) want to come take them down, let them do it. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmish started last week when city officials told the businessmen their 
proposed flag display would violate city codes. The pair say they found the 
rule "ridiculous" and spent $3,000 anyway to install the flags last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said he plans to meet with city officials next week to discuss 
obtaining a variance for the flags. But if the city grants the variance, he 
said, it wants $800 for the special permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I should have to pay close to $1,000 to fly the flag," Altman 
said. "That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The businessmen argue a state law, which supersedes the city ordinance, 
protects their right to fly the 23 flags. The state law prohibits limiting 
displays of the American flag for "solely aesthetic considerations," but does 
allow restrictions if the flags are used for advertising purposes.

OPTIMA TO PRESERVE 'NET' OF DOCTORS KNOWN TO AID POOR; HEARING: PROVIDERS WILL 
BE FORCED TO CHANGE UNDER COUNTY'S NEW MEDI-CAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM, 
CHAIRMAN WARNS. ACCESS IS STILL THE TOP PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Preserving the "safety net" of physicians, community clinics and hospitals 
that long have served the poor should be a high priority, everyone agreed at a 
hearing Tuesday to discuss a new health care delivery system for Orange County 
Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board of directors of OPTIMA, the agency that will develop a 
countywide Medi-Cal managed care system, warned that these traditional health 
care providers will have to make changes, such as forming full-service networks 
or joining existing health maintenance organizations, to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changes are going to have to take place. We are not going to have the status 
quo. I think that is the message," OPTIMA Chairman John R. Cochran said at the 
hearing to obtain public reaction to options for designing the new health 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the three-hour hearing, Westminster Councilman Tony Lam 
presented a petition signed by 4,500 Vietnamese residents asking that they 
retain the right to choose their physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and other 
services and "not have to follow a bureaucratic and complex health care 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hung Ong, speaking for the Vietnamese Medical Assn. and the Vietnamese 
Physician Assn. of California, said there are 40,000 Vietnamese on Medi-Cal in 
the county already receiving adequate treatment from Vietnamese physicians who 
"faithfully cared for them through years of decreasing reimbursements and 
increasing bureaucracy and continued to stand by them even when the state was 
paying with IOUs that no bank honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Ong said such physicians have "earned the right to be preserved as a special 
provider category, part of the health care safety net." 
</P>
<P>
 Cyndy Johnson, managing director of the Pacific Health Care Policy Group who 
is serving as a consultant to the OPTIMA board, said that an astoundingly large 
number of people eligible for Medi-Cal in Orange County, many of them children, 
are not getting medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Less than half of those eligible for Medi-Cal (in Orange County) use the 
services," she said. By contrast, she said, 88% of those eligible for Medicaid 
in New York get medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of OPTIMA, she noted, is to improve access to health care for 
Orange County residents dependent on the state program whose low reimbursement 
rates have historically discouraged physicians from participating. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson cautioned that even under a proposed new system in Orange County that 
would pay primary physicians a monthly fee for each patient, medical services 
will be limited by Medi-Cal's severe budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very poorly funded Medicaid system in the county and the state, the 
likes of which I have seen only in the very deep South," Johnson said. "There 
is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollars can be stretched, she said, through a system that will shift 
more care away from hospitals and hospital emergency rooms and toward primary 
care physicians.

TALKS UNDER WAY FOR U.S. TOUR BY MICHAEL JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jackson, whose recent headline-making has been largely limited to the 
allegations of child molestation and his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, 
appears ready to launch a campaign to refocus attention on his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions are underway for Jackson to begin his first North American concert 
tour since 1989 -- possibly as soon as February, sources close to the singer 
confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No dates have been booked, but word is circulating among concert promoters 
around the country that the trek would probably concentrate on 15,000- to 
20,000-seat arenas rather than stadiums. Dates reportedly are also being 
explored for European shows as soon as November. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is completing work on five new songs that will be included in 
"History: His Story," a greatest-hits album that is scheduled to be released by 
Epic Records in November.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's representatives would not confirm the tour plans, but concert 
industry experts say that the timing would make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 36, had just started a world tour in Asia in the summer of 1993 when 
allegations were made that he had sexually molested a teen-age boy. Numerous 
shows were subsequently either postponed or canceled before the tour was 
ultimately scrapped in November when the singer said he needed treatment for an 
addiction to a painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, there was much public speculation about whether the allegations 
would permanently damage Jackson's image as an entertainer. But with a 
settlement in that case and his recent marriage, there's a perception that the 
time is ripe for Jackson to try to reclaim his self-proclaimed status as the 
"King of Pop." 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael needs to reconnect with his audience," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor 
of the concert industry trade magazine Pollstar. "And he really needs to do it 
in North America." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bongiovanni and others in the concert industry warned that Jackson should 
not assume that his drawing power is unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should certainly not play stadiums," says Bongiovanni, referring to the 
strategy of the 1984 stadium tour that he did with his brothers. "That's too 
risky." 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus also is that Jackson should not be tempted by the high prices -- 
$100 and more -- commanded this year by such acts as Barbra Streisand and the 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a new basis for ticket prices," says Denver-based concert 
promoter Barry Fey. "Even Michael Jackson will not be viewed the same as 
Streisand, Pink Floyd or the Eagles. But Michael has never been inclined to 
charge an outrageous ticket price." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson made his first public U.S. appearance since the surprise May wedding 
when he and his wife opened Thursday's MTV Video Music Awards in New York with 
a kiss. Though the couple was warmly applauded, industry observers say the real 
test of the last year's impact on Jackson's popularity won't be known until the 
album goes on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers feel the tour will be an even bigger measure of Jackson's fan 
support. One reason for going on the road in February, Bongiovanni said, is 
that the market won't be as competitive as it is normally in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's first public performance since last year could come on Oct. 8 for an 
Elvis Presley tribute concert in Memphis. He and Presley-Jackson are rumored to 
be part of the performing lineup for the show, which also will be televised as 
a pay-per-view special.

THE REINVENTING OF WALTER BECKER; POP MUSIC: STEELY DAN'S RESIDENT RETICENT 
ARTIST SINGS HIS OWN SONGS ON A NEW SOLO ALBUM, '11 TRACKS OF WHACK.' HE 
PERFORMS TONIGHT AT THE BLOCKBUSTER PAVILION IN DEVORE. 
</P>

<P>
 Faye Dunaway's isn't the only mystery voice around. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two decades in the public eye, formerly close-mouthed Steely 
Dan co-founder Walter Becker put himself into the public ear in a direct way 
for the first time last summer on the duo's reunion tour by singing a few new 
numbers of his own. Becoming a lead vocalist this late in the game, and in 
front of tens of thousands to boot, bespeaks a certain confidence, one would 
assume. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's not so much confidence as just sheer arrogance," corrects 
Becker, 44, perhaps not speaking entirely with tongue in cheek. He'll do it 
again as this year's Steely Dan tour visits the Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore 
tonight and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that very attitude of Becker that led to his solo album "11 Tracks of 
Whack." The long-in-the-making project -- due in stores Sept. 27 -- was 
co-produced by the other half of Dan, Donald Fagen, returning the favor that 
Becker provided in producing Fagen's '93 solo album "Kamakiriad." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Becker is plagued by delusions about the average concert-goer's 
interest in his vocal chops. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we originally started last summer, I was doing four songs, and it was 
ridiculous," he says, recalling the audience's anxiety as each new solo number 
crowded a favorite oldie out of the set. "We had it down to two numbers by 
about the third show," Becker admits, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagen is more explicit about the mettle required of his cohort. "I think it 
was difficult for him to go out and sing his tunes for the first time. It's 
pretty courageous that he's doing it," says Fagen, in a separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that he isn't a great singer -- I think he is in his way, and he's got a 
really distinctive voice. . . . But I'm singing all this familiar stuff in my 
familiar voice, and then for him to get out there and do unfamiliar material 
with a voice no one's ever heard. . . . Last year, if people heard something 
unfamiliar, they'd take that opportunity to go get some steamed clams. And that 
was their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we're not seeing that. On one hand, because the album's release is 
imminent, I think people are more interested in it. And also Walter does have 
more confidence this year in his singing, so maybe it's a little more 
commanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Fagen finds it "ironic" that he became the singer in the partnership. When the 
two met at Bard College in Upstate New York in the late '60s, Becker had been 
singing and playing harmonica in front of blues bands since high school, while 
Fagen wasn't yet crooning at all except to demonstrate his songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the duo unofficially split after "Gaucho" in 1980, Becker concentrated 
on producing rather than writing. As a corrective to Steely Dan's legendary 
perfectionism, this control-room stint was useful, Becker maintains, although 
hardly all-satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of money I made producing records was insignificant compared to 
what I was making from the (Steely Dan) royalties. But there probably was some 
sort of Protestant work ethic involved, especially after my son was born. You 
have a kid and it's like, 'He's gotta go to college! Gotta have some clothes!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But mostly it was that I missed it and wanted to get back involved but didn't 
want to become involved on the obsessional level that I had been. . . . So 
producing was good in that way: You could go and do it and not fret over it, 
and it was kind of your job to be a little detached from it and help the artist 
by providing that point of view that was not so inside of the thing, and then 
come home and forget about it. . . . But more and more I got the feeling . . . 
of '(Expletive), I wouldn't do it this way.' I had that thought enough times 
that it became a do-it-or-hold-your-peace kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting "11 Tracks" bears far less resemblance to a Steely Dan album 
than Fagen's two solo efforts have. Becker has no problem admitting that his 
tunes are less "harmonically sophisticated" than Fagen's. For his part, Fagen 
-- whose writing is keyboard-derived -- says, "It's obvious a lot of Walter's 
things are more the type of things a guitar player would write, more derived 
from folk music and folk-rock, although he also had a jazz background, as a 
listener, like I did. . . . And with chords, oddly enough, harmonically, he'll 
sometimes do something much weirder than I would do offhand." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's and Fagen's lyrical sensibilities are certainly in sync: The album, 
while surprisingly sweet in spots, like Fagen's, also features titles -- 
"Cringemaker," "My Waterloo," "Junkie Girl" and "This Moody Bastard" -- that 
suggest an ongoing distrust and hearken back to the days Steely Dan was accused 
of misogyny at worst and misanthropy at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this often dark outlook square with Becker's recent life story, which has 
him surviving drugs and Steely Dan, going through a literal and figurative 
detox, marrying, settling down and child-rearing in Maui and living happily 
ever after? 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kind of publicity shorthand, that was pretty much the case, that 
scenario. I'm not as depressed as I was at the time, in the '70s and early 
'80s. But those are still the interesting things to write about, let's face it. 
That hasn't changed that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously I was drawn toward this mood or this perception of the world that I 
had, and I experienced it and wallowed in it until I was tired of it. And I had 
so thoroughly immersed myself in it that I was able to move away from it 
without ever feeling like, 'Wow, geez, I never quite got to do this' or 'If 
only I could've done that.' It's something you go through. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about the things you went through in adolescence, how silly or 
distant you feel from them now, that's how I feel about that. I'm not saying 
that I have the most chipper disposition in the world or that that seems 
utterly alien to me, but, on a general basis, I have a very different outlook 
than I did." 
</P>

IT'S ALL IN THE (GROUND-BREAKING) FAMILY; TELEVISION: AS A SITCOM CENTERED ON 
ASIAN AMERICANS, 'ALL-AMERICAN GIRL' IS BEING MONITORED BY ADVOCACY GROUPS 
CONCERNED ABOUT RACIAL STEREOTYPES. WELCOME TO THE PRESSURE COOKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "All-American Girl" may have one of the safest-sounding titles of the new 
season. And, on the surface, the premise of the ABC sitcom couldn't be more 
innocuous: 
</P>
<P>
 Spirited, boy-crazy college student in her 20s constantly clashes with her 
strong-willed, conservative mother and other members of her traditional 
middle-class family. Works part time at a cosmetic counter and likes to hang 
out with her girlfriends at the college cafe.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet people keep telling the show's producers and writers that they're stepping 
into a minefield -- because the family at the center of the show is Korean 
American. The series marks the first time that Asian Americans have played all 
the principal roles in a network series. 
</P>
<P>
 "All-American Girl" stars stand-up comic Margaret Cho, and much of the show's 
material is autobiographical. She plays Margaret Kim, who often butts heads 
with her mother (Jodi Long), who wants her daughter to marry a nice Korean boy, 
preferably with a very good job. Also in the family is her father (Clyde 
Kusatsu), who understands Margaret better than her mother does; her brother 
(B.D. Wong), a resident doctor at the college; and a hip, outspoken grandmother 
(Amy Hill). 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of a prominent Asian American cast has had several local groups 
concerned that "All-American Girl" might feature racial stereotypes that have 
long plagued the portrayal of blacks and other minorities on television. For 
weeks prior to the broadcast of tonight's premiere, Asian American groups have 
been monitoring the series' progress -- scrutinizing the pilot, reading scripts 
and attending tapings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, many members of the groups have praised the show, saying that the 
concept of "All-American Girl" is long overdue for a mainstream audience, and 
that the series will help shatter stereotypes about Asians, particularly Korean 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very optimistic about what we've seen, and feel it's very significant 
that this is being tried," said Guy Aoki, head of the Media Action Network for 
Asian Americans. The organization has denounced images of Asian Americans in 
the films "Rising Sun" and "Falling Down." 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki added, "If there is one Asian group that needed a show like this to take 
care of the misunderstandings people have about them, it's Korean American. We 
see a family, and we don't see rude grocers who shoot people randomly. I don't 
think this show will solve all the problems, but given a chance to grow, it 
will sure help." 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate their appreciation for the series, the organization is honoring 
the show's creator, Gary Jacobs, with its Media Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumi Haru, president of the Assn. of Asian Pacific Artists, said: "I'm glad 
television is finally doing something with Asian Americans, and the buzz is 
good. This is healthy stuff, to show the generational and cultural differences 
that all of us go through. It's very true to life and should generate a lot of 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have reservations about the series. Jerry Yu, executive director of the 
Korean American Coalition, said some members of his community advocacy group 
were bothered by the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the pilot, and a lot of people didn't think it was funny," Yu said. 
"It showed the older people in the family not speaking English very well. There 
was a funny confusion of various Asian cultures. Much of the stuff from the 
show was not from the Korean culture." 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed that concerns about the show's images may have been increased by the 
Los Angeles riots and other media portrayals of Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this show had come on five years ago, there would not be all this 
sensitivity surrounding it," Yu said. "But in the last two or three years, 
there have been so many examples of negative stereotypes. Even though it's not 
the mission of this show to be anything more than entertaining, I hope they do 
their best not to exploit the kind of sentiment that may exist out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, the show's creator, said he is aware of the scrutiny by local Asian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this tremendous responsibility, especially in these days of political 
correctness when it's so easy to run afoul of people's expectations," said 
Jacobs. "And comedy is a huge target for people who have an ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said that portions of the pilot have been re-shot to make Cho's 
character a college student (she had been working full time before), and Wong's 
character, who was married, is now single and living at home. The family's 
accents and stilted speaking patterns in the pilot will be modified in 
subsequent episodes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A Korean consultant is on the set and the show has two Asian American writers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those writers, Elizabeth Wong, said, "This is not a show that deals 
with politics. It's an 8:30 show that deals with family dynamics. That's what 
we're interested in. But I very much feel a lot of pressure. This is a show I 
really care about. It reflects a lot of who I am, and who Margaret is. But if 
we focus on telling good stories, that's the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * "All-American Girl" premieres at 9:30 tonight and thereafter will be seen 
Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). The first episode 
was not available for review.

ONE-STOP SHOPS FOR ARTS GET ON TRACK; NEW COMPLEX IN FORMER RED CAR STATION MAY 
HELP REVIVE GALLERY SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Can a former Red Car trolley station be the savior of Southern California's 
depressed gallery scene? Hop on board to find out. Next stop: Bergamot Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Santa Monica arts complex, developed by contemporary art dealer Wayne 
Blank of the Shoshana Wayne Gallery, is scheduled to open Saturday. A dozen 
galleries -- offering everything from contemporary paintings and sculpture to 
vintage photography, African art, artist-designed furniture, art glass and 
American collectibles -- will open their doors on a sprawling, 5 1/2-acre site 
at 2525 Michigan Ave., near the intersection of 26th Street and Olympic 
Boulevard. Visitors also will get their first look at other components of the 
five-building complex, including a cafe, architects' offices, a bookstore and a 
frame shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really elated that it's finally happening and that we are opening on 
schedule," Blank said, as construction crews worked overtime to meet deadlines 
and his fellow dealers prepared to install inaugural exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a vision of this complex, and I never doubted that it would become a 
reality," he said. "But I am surprised that it has turned out to be so 
interesting architecturally and that the community has gotten behind it so 
strongly. We've had a great response to the project. Everyone seems to look at 
it as a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Named for a Red Car trolley station that occupied the site until the 1950s, 
Bergamot Station was purchased in 1984 by the city of Santa Monica for Metro 
Rail-related use. When plans for the property failed to develop, Blank 
persuaded city authorities to let him transform it into an art center. His 
dream was to provide affordable facilities for art dealers while creating an 
inviting destination for art lovers. There would be an enticing mixture of art 
in a pleasant ambience that offered easy access, plenty of free parking and a 
place to hang out over a snack and a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which has taken shape over the past year, was greeted with 
considerable skepticism when Blank took over the property. Doubters, who dubbed 
the project "Wayne's World," questioned Blank's ability to strike a deal with 
the city, renovate the ramshackle buildings and attract respectable tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lure of low rent -- only 75 cents a square foot, less than half the 
going rate around town -- coupled with the promise of a collegial atmosphere 
eventually won support from the art community. Much remains to be finished on 
the buildings and grounds, but the participation of such leading dealers as 
Patricia Faure, Rosamund Felsen and Burnett Miller has lent an air of prestige 
to what once appeared to be a rather shaky concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergamot Station has also gained a substantial backer in television comedy 
producer Tom Patchett, known for his work on "The Bob Newhart Show" and "Alf." 
Patchett originally checked out the development as a place to store part of his 
vast collection of contemporary art and Americana. But one thing led to 
another. He began to think of opening a small show space, then rented an entire 
building with a cavernous, museum-style showcase for his American collectibles 
and a smaller commercial gallery for exhibitions of contemporary art. In June, 
he became Blank's financial partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the lines are drawn much too definitively between fine and 
not-so-fine art," Patchett said. "What I would like to do in my exhibitions is 
to lead people on a path that makes connections between everyday objects and 
the art of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants say that affordable space attracted them to Bergamot 
Station, but they offer a variety of reasons for joining forces there. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a natural progression from being with Turner/Krull to moving 
into my own space at a very fair price," said Craig Krull, who deals in 
photo-based art and will open at Bergamot Station with a show of architectural 
photographs by Julius Shulman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a more reasonable way to do business," said Lois Lambert, who has moved 
her 6-year-old Gallery of Functional Art from its former home near the Santa 
Monica Museum of Art. "I will get a lot more space -- 3,000 square feet -- for 
less money. That will give me a chance to do what I like, which is to show 
furniture and objects made by artists. I also like the idea of having a variety 
of arts in one location. The energy is really nice." Her opening show, "Great 
Movements in Art," features artist-designed tables, chairs, dressers and 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosamund Felsen only last week confirmed plans to move her gallery from West 
Hollywood to Santa Monica. Although she won't open until Nov. 15, with 
paintings by Marc Pally, she said she is so excited she can't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen groups of galleries before in mini-malls or strip malls," Felsen 
said. "But this seems a little bit different. It's a separate entity, and it 
isn't just galleries. There are architectural offices and related activities, 
so I think it will attract a broad audience. It will get a lot of attention and 
create excitement. There's parking for 400 cars, so that makes it easy for 
people to come and spend time there. I think it's going to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergamot Station is "a unique opportunity," according to Ernie Wolfe, a dealer 
of African art who will retain his West Los Angeles gallery while opening a 
space in Santa Monica. "In terms of the evolution of art complexes -- one-stop 
shopping -- this is the most highly evolved example of the form," he said. 
"People don't have a lot of time these days. By being a single destination on 
Sawtelle, as I have been all these years, if I didn't cajole people into 
coming, they didn't come. It was a lot of work. It still will be -- that comes 
with the territory -- but people will have a lot of reasons to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said he considered moving into Santa Monica's Colorado Avenue complex a 
few years ago, "but with the kind of thing I do -- whether you call it 
idiosyncratic or weird -- being another slice in a loaf of bread just doesn't 
work for me. Here I can put my imprimatur on a different kind of space. I will 
have a lot of flexibility; with the two spaces I can do any weird thing I 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening slate of exhibitions includes a sculptural installation by Joel 
Otterson at the Shoshana Wayne Gallery (which Blank operates with his wife, 
Shoshana); paintings by Ellen Phelan at the Patricia Faure Gallery; photographs 
by Henri Cartier-Bresson at the Peter Fetterman Gallery; paintings by Leonard 
Koscianski at the Robert Berman Gallery; mixed-media works by Giuseppe de Piero 
at the Sherry Frumkin Gallery; and light installations by Steven V. Correia, 
Richard Godfrey and Steve Schauer at the Patricia Correia Gallery. Saturday's 
opening reception is 7-9 p.m.

KOST-FM OFFICIALLY LIFTS BAN ON SAME-SEX MUSIC CALL-INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid plans for a massive gay call-in Monday night, KOST-FM (103.5) permanently 
lifted its long-standing ban on same-sex music dedications during its nightly 
"Love Songs" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming director Jhani Kaye called the decision "overdue. This is 1994, 
and we've seen gay topics frequently discussed on the TV and radio talk shows. 
We're not leading the way. We're just playing catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Werbel, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation, expressed pleasure that "a major radio station is acknowledging 
gays and lesbians and their relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 KOST had been experimenting with same-sex dedications for the past month. 
Monday's call-in, which helped tie up the station's phone lines for hours, had 
been promoted in five gay and lesbian publications, and in leaflets passed out 
in West Hollywood, as a means of convincing station executives to continue the 
dedications. GLAAD officials weren't aware of another local station that has a 
permanent policy permitting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical was a call from Daryl in Glendale, who had just broken up with "the 
true great love of my life," Bill. Daryl told the deejay and the radio audience 
that he hoped he and Bill might some day get back together, and dedicated the 
song "Angel" to his ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed of the call-in hours before it was to begin, KOST general manager 
Howard Neal expressed surprise but nevertheless welcomed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a radio station, our license is issued by the entire community. We want to 
be responsive to all segments of the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifting of the ban began last April with a phone call to KOST by 
19-year-old Raul Caudillo, a student at Pasadena City College. Caudillo wanted 
to dedicate a song to his boyfriend, Brian Dreesman, a fellow student and 
part-time helicopter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Caudillo was told by the deejay, however, that same-sex dedications might 
corrupt young listeners and were against station policy unless the dedication 
was made using initials or a nickname, such as "Poochie." 
</P>
<P>
 Caudillo told Dreesman about the station's refusal, and Dreesman wrote KOST a 
six-page letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I remained gay after being bombarded all my life exclusively with 
heterosexual images, what are the chances that a small amount of homosexual 
images will change the children who are heterosexual?" he wrote. The ban, he 
said, is "socially destructive and morally wrong. . . . You are hurting those 
who are gay by depriving them of urgently needed role models and a place in 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye found the letter "passionate and convincing," and discussed it with his 
staff. In early August, he wrote Dreesman that KOST was tentatively lifting the 
ban to "see what kind of reaction we receive. We trust it will be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreesman soon called to dedicate a song to Caudillo. "The deejay asked me 
about Raul. She asked what I liked about him and why. She asked how long we had 
been together. I told her we'd been together for a year, and how much I liked 
his good heart and courage. It seemed like we were talking on the air an extra 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The weeks since that and similar dedications went out have been marked by "an 
overwhelmingly positive response," Kaye said. "We've received numerous letters 
and phone calls supporting the new policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday afternoon, Neal declared that the policy would be permanent.  
</P>
<P>
 Told of his victory by a reporter, Dreesman pronounced himself "absolutely 
elated. I've been studying Martin Luther King and Gandhi all my life. This is 
the first time I've had the chance to apply what I've learned."

STORM BREWS OVER PROSPECT OF RECYCLED WATER IN BEER; SEWAGE: MILLER CO. IN 
IRWINDALE IS SUING TO HALT $25-MILLION PROJECT. DISTRICT DISMISSES CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From "the land of sky-blue waters" to "pure, Rocky Mountain spring water," the 
imagery of pristine lakes and streams has helped sell American beer for 
decades. So, what is a brewer to do when it finds out some of the water it uses 
to make beer is going to come from the sewer? 
</P>
<P>
 If the beermeister is Miller Brewing Co., the nation's second-largest brewer, 
the answer is not to go with the flow. Late last week, Miller filed a lawsuit 
to stop one of the region's most ambitious water reclamation projects, a 
$25-million plan by San Gabriel Valley water authorities to make drinking water 
out of effluent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project will irreversibly pollute the basin," the suit charges. The 
treated water will contain a host of contaminants -- from harmful bacteria to 
industrial chemicals with the "only question being how disastrous the 
contamination will be," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many areas of Southern California, the San Gabriel Valley is trying to 
reduce its dependence on dwindling and increasingly costly water imported from 
Northern California and the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, which 
serves about 1 million people, voted to move ahead with plans for a nine-mile 
pipeline that would transport reclaimed drinking water from a sewage treatment 
plant in Whittier to land near Miller's Irwindale brewery. From there, the 
treated water would trickle down into the valley's underground water supply to 
replenish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides reducing the valley's dependence on imported water by one-quarter to 
one-third, the project would capture some of the 50 million gallons of potable 
waste water now being flushed into the ocean every day from local sewage 
treatment plants, said Robert Berlien, general manager of the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local officials insist that the project is no different from other 
reclamation efforts that have safely supplied recycled drinking water from 
sewage treatment plants to millions of people in about 50 Los Angeles and 
Orange County communities for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the officials say, is suing to protect the company from bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Made from sewer water" is not the sort of slogan you sell beer with, Berlien 
said. But the lawsuit, he said, will only generate more unwanted publicity for 
the brewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's lawyers insist that they are trying to protect the valley's principal 
water source -- the San Gabriel aquifer -- which would receive the treated 
waste water. "This is not a public relations thing," Los Angeles attorney Terry 
Kelly said. "If you are making a food product you want to make sure that the 
ingredients are pure. Nor do we think that people ought to be drinking from a 
water source that's getting a daily dose of effluent." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the San Gabriel aquifer is already so polluted that it has been a 
national Superfund site for 10 years because of high concentrations of volatile 
organic compounds, which come from agricultural runoff and industrial dumping 
and can break down into human carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Kelly said, the brewery has never detected any chemical contamination 
in its water although its wells are close to one of several plumes, or heavy 
concentrations, of contamination in the aquifer. "It is extremely pure water 
that comes out of those wells," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's Irwindale plant, one of seven operated by the company nationwide, 
employs 850 people and draws about 860 million gallons of water each year to 
produce more than 5 million gallons of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit acknowledges that some Southern Californians have been drinking 
recycled waste water for years, but contends that "scientific data leaves it 
unclear whether or not that use has harmed the health of local residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit invokes an Orange County study of treated waste water that found 
"high levels" of the bacteria that causes Legionnaire's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials respond by saying treated waste water from the same Whittier 
plant that would supply the San Gabriel Valley has been flowing to homes in 43 
Los Angeles County communities since the 1960s. For more than a decade, plant 
personnel have conducted monthly tests for viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 761 samples, the testing turned up one virus, "the same you would find in 
regular old rainwater and even less than you might find in Colorado River water 
because of the tourists and other pollutants" affecting it, said Earle 
Hartling, the Whittier plant's water recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartling and Berlien also cite a 1984 study by UCLA's School of Public Health 
that found no evidence of health problems among residents drinking reclaimed 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the planned operation follows the treatment requirements that we've put 
forth and is consistent with existing operations, there should be little to no 
risk at all," said David Spath, chief of the technical programs branch of the 
drinking water division of the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Spath said the Orange County study that found legionella bacteria in treated 
water was inconclusive. "It's not clear whether those organisms were alive and 
viable or whether their number was any greater than what is found in ordinary 
drinking water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed San Gabriel water recycling project is actually a five-step 
operation. Initially, solid waste is removed through sedimentation and then 
aeration. Next, the water is filtered through sand and charcoal, then 
chlorinated. But the most important step in the process, say many experts, 
occurs later, after the chlorinated water leaves the treatment plant and is 
piped onto the ground. There, percolation through the soil is supposed to 
filter out any remaining contaminants before the water reaches the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chlorination doesn't get everything. But chlorination and (percolation) 
usually work pretty well in tandem," said Scott Summers, an associate professor 
of environmental engineering at the University of Cincinnati who specializes in 
drinking-water treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miller lawsuit argues that the ground near the brewery is too porous to 
allow natural filtration before the water reaches the aquifer. Water officials 
disagree, insisting that the water will be in the ground for at least six 
months -- the minimum time prescribed by state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the beer company were not suing, it would take two years to build the 
pipeline and bring the recycled waste water to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad jokes, however, have already started flowing. "The beer aged in 
porcelain, that sort of thing," Berlien chuckled.

COLUMN ONE; WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUNG GENIUSES?; THE CHANG SISTERS, AGES 6 AND 8, 
ARE TRYING TO ATTEND COLLEGE. BUT THEY ARE CAUGHT IN A CROSS-FIRE BETWEEN THEIR 
PARENTS AND OFFICIALS WHO ARE THREATENING TO ARREST THEM, SAYING THEY SHOULD BE 
IN GRADE SCHOOL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Chang sits at her desk in the front row, listening carefully and taking 
notes. With her baseball cap and book bag, she looks like any 8-year-old 
student -- except this is college calculus and she is here against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan, like her brother and two sisters, is trying to get a college education 
without the bother of graduating from third grade. But this semester, she has 
been officially barred from community college and threatened with arrest if she 
keeps attending class. 
</P>
<P>
 In her second year at College of the Redwoods, the pint-sized scholar has 
become a college drop-in, explaining in a soft voice that she loves calculus 
but didn't much care for her year in elementary school. "The kids were mean," 
she recalled. "They said mean things." 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the four Chang children, who range in age from 6 to 13, has 
touched off a heated debate over what is the best education for brilliant 
youngsters -- studying differential equations or learning how to get along with 
children their own age. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the controversy is a cultural clash: On one side is John 
Chang, a Taiwanese immigrant so determined to get his children a college 
education that he was once arrested and hauled off the wooded campus in 
handcuffs. On the other side are college administrators who contend that 
cash-starved community colleges should not take the place of the beleaguered 
public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a test case of statewide policies restricting enrollment in community 
colleges," said Cedric A. Sampson, College of the Redwoods president. "The 
bottom line is, we're full up and we can't become an alternative delivery 
system for K-12." 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs are considered to be an enigma in this forested coastal region 270 
miles north of San Francisco, where the population is 90% white and isolated 
from the rest of the state by what residents call the "Redwood Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 While the children have the support of many fellow college students and 
teachers, some see the eccentric John Chang as a zealot who is seeking to 
measure his own self-worth by the success of his children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs reveal few details of their background and remain a mystery even to 
their friends. Neither parent has a job or visible means of support, but they 
devote themselves to teaching their children at home. And for the most part, 
the quiet, well-mannered youngsters keep to themselves, without other friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no argument that the youngsters are bright. The two older 
children began their college studies by the age of 10; recent IQ tests of the 
younger children place them in the gifted range. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs were so intent on enrolling all four children in community college 
that the family moved here from Chico a little over a year ago after Butte 
College refused to admit the three girls. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, College of the Redwoods, just south of Eureka, accepted all four 
children. They completed at least three courses in academic subjects during the 
fall, 1993, semester, including Joan, who got an A in algebra at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the college admitted 10-year-old Mimi and 13-year-old Matthew 
because they had shown their ability to study at the college level. Indeed, 
Matthew had received an associate's degree in mathematics from Butte College 
when he was 11. At College of the Redwoods, he was named "Outstanding Physics 
Student" for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, however, refused to readmit Joan and her 6-year-old sister, Karen, 
this fall. He said he had not seen proof that the home-schooled youngsters met 
the college's entrance standards or that the local school district could not 
provide the courses they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, when Joan and Karen began attending math classes at College of the 
Redwoods anyway, Sampson sent the girls letters warning them they could be 
arrested for trespassing and face up to six months in jail. Coming to class, he 
wrote, "constitutes a willful disruption of the orderly operation of the 
College." 
</P>
<P>
 The polite but persistent Mr. Chang, who apologizes for his scraggly, gray 
beard and a missing lower tooth, says his children are the victims of racial 
bias. He even filed a discrimination complaint with the FBI, but the agency 
declined to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very closed society," Chang said in heavily accented English. "They 
worry that my children are doing better than their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson rejects any notion of prejudice, noting that the college admitted the 
two older children. But he said there are clear cultural differences between 
the college and Chang, who does not accept the American idea that learning 
social skills in elementary school is a valuable part of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some other cultures, a very high priority is placed on rote memory and 
regurgitation," Sampson said. "They go all day, they study after school, and 
the parents drive them hard. You can't impose that model on the American 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 It is so unusual for one family to produce four prodigies that Chang's critics 
believe he must be pressuring his children to achieve beyond their natural 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Changs deny they have forced their children to excel and insist that 
it is the children's thirst for knowledge that drives their accelerated 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never pushed our children, just encouraged them," said their mother, 
Mary Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Chang: "We've been pushed by our children. We were assigned to be 
their slaves. We did not make the children what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 American educators who specialize in teaching gifted children stress the 
importance of balancing challenging academic work with the opportunity to adapt 
socially. Ideally, they say, gifted children should receive individualized 
instruction in a setting with youngsters the same age. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really believe children should be kept with their age groups," said Anabel 
Jensen, executive director of The Nueva School for gifted children in 
Hillsborough. "I have a kindergartner reading at a high school level, but he is 
in a kindergarten class. Emotionally, he is not a high school student." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson said there are a variety of options for the two younger girls' 
education, including finding a program for gifted students in the public 
schools, enrolling them in private schools or hiring tutors. "He could find 
assistance. But what he wants is the college's certification that his children 
are prodigies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chang, the college's refusal to accept his younger daughters has been 
wrenching. He pulled Karen from her algebra class after Sampson's arrest 
threat, but has continued sending Joan to calculus. At the start of class 
Friday, a security guard handed Joan another letter from Sampson renewing the 
threat of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from their community college courses and brief stints in public school, 
the children have received their education at the Changs' home school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs are vague in describing their home study program. They do not hold 
organized study sessions, they said, but allow the children to study whatever 
they wish. The children are so absorbed by their studies, Chang said, he has 
trouble getting them to take a break to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Television also is an important teacher. The Changs speak Taiwanese at home, 
so the children have learned much of their English from TV. Watching 
educational channels is encouraged; the PBS show "Mathnet" is a family 
favorite. Programs with violence and sex are not allowed. "No kissing," Chang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents give the youngsters all A's in their home study courses, but have 
permitted little outside monitoring of their progress. They have complied with 
a state law requiring them to register their home study program as a private 
school but have avoided standardized achievement tests -- even though high 
scores could prove the children's readiness for college. 
</P>
<P>
 At College of the Redwoods, where students pay $13 a unit, John Chang has 
closely tracked his children's work, talking frequently with their instructors, 
hanging around outside their classrooms and peering in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 College administrators found Chang's presence so disruptive last spring that 
they called Humboldt County sheriff's deputies, who arrested him for 
trespassing. The charges were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a point at which parental involvement in a child's education is 
excessive," said Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Redwoods also obtained a court order limiting Chang's access to 
certain areas of the campus, such as the library. But Chang frequently wanders 
the campus anyway, skulking in hallways and hiding around corners to evade 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue for us is, how do we enforce our policies against a person who is 
very determined and won't take no for an answer," Sampson said. "We're having 
trouble enforcing a state policy because Mr. Chang is determined his children 
should have a college education -- an American inexpensive college education -- 
without following our rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs live in a modest apartment in the little town of Loleta, a few 
miles south of the college. The living room is furnished with mattresses on the 
floor, a table with educational books and a large television. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent interview, the Changs provided little opportunity for the 
children to speak for themselves as Chang hovered nearby, monitoring their 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs also declined to talk much about themselves, and refused to divulge 
many details about their past. 
</P>
<P>
 According to their sketchy outline, both parents emigrated from Taiwan about 
20 years ago and were married in the United States. Both said they graduated 
from college. John Chang said he is in his 50s and has more than one college 
degree, but the Changs will not say what college they attended or what subjects 
they studied. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, John Chang said, he was a good student, especially in math. But he 
was forced to start working at 4, he said, and was working full time by 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, apparently, neither parent is employed, but Chang said the family is not 
on welfare. "Call me a retired businessman," he said, declining to say more. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, the Changs were living in semirural Chico, 90 miles north of 
Sacramento, where they touched off their first local controversy by trying to 
transfer their two older children from elementary school to Butte College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said he realized Matthew was unusually bright when he learned his 
multiplication tables one afternoon before he turned 7. Matthew skipped first 
grade, but was soon getting beaten up regularly by classmates because of his 
better grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs arranged for him to start taking classes at Butte, but 
administrators balked at admitting him as a full-time student. The Changs 
appealed to the Butte County Board of Education and won the right to enroll 
him. He received his math degree in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mimi was 5, Chang said, she started asking to go to college like her big 
brother. Chang tried to enroll her when she was 7, but Butte College refused to 
admit her. He alleged she was a victim of racial discrimination and sued the 
college to let her in, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Changs then began searching for a community college that would accept 
their children. Last year, the family moved to tiny Loleta because they thought 
College of the Redwoods had agreed to admit all four children. 
</P>
<P>
 They have had no problem keeping Mimi enrolled. Like her brother, she has done 
well in her studies, receiving A's in classes where grades were awarded. She is 
on track to graduate next summer at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen began her college career at 5. In the fall of 1993, she received credit 
for taking basic courses in English, reading and writing -- classes considered 
remedial for adults. She received her only grade, an A, in beginning swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Joan, then 7, received credit for basic reading and writing 
courses, along with As in algebra and beginning swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 But after their first semester, college officials began to question whether 
the two younger girls needed to study at a college level and refused to readmit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls continued attending classes last spring even though they were not 
enrolled. But this semester, when the girls returned, the college threatened to 
arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have finally reached the limit," Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning letters prepare the way for possible intervention by the county 
child protective agency if the Changs persist in sending the children to the 
campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people recognize on the face of it that a 5- and 7-year-old don't belong 
in college," he said. "These children belong in the K-12 system. We have no 
evidence they can't get what they need there. We only have Mr. Chang's word, 
and he is forcing the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The college president acknowledges he has cast himself in the role of the ogre 
in this drama: "It's the big institution against these cute little kids," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students who have taken classes with the children support their bid to 
attend the college. Some say the youngsters understand complex mathematics 
better than they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students love them," said Bob Cramer, 50, who is taking calculus with 
Joan and doubles as her baby-sitter. "Joan told me in class today, 'This is 
fun.' I'm pulling my hair out and this 8-year-old girl tells me, 'This is fun.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 But Rita Dickens, another calculus student, questions whether the parents have 
contemplated how destructive it may be for the children to lose their 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, 'Poor kid. That's a lot of work, genius or not,' " Dickens said. 
"The kid might be smart, but maybe she'd be better off being a kid. At least 
they're not getting into drugs, but this may be just as bad in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 The children also have the backing of some faculty members who believe all 
youngsters should have the chance to study to the limit of their ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in education spend a lot of time talking about diversity. This is 
another kind of diversity," said one instructor who asked not to be named. 
"Who's to say that children can't learn mathematics at a very early age but 
don't because our school system says they're not ready? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Mr. Chang," he added. "The children are adorable. I hope he succeeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Even adversaries like Paul Mendoza, the vice president of student services who 
has battled with Chang for much of the past year, praise the children. "They're 
beautiful kids," he said. "They are not causing disruption. They are 
well-behaved children." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the Chang children has highlighted the diminished ability of 
community colleges to accept whoever wants to take a course. State spending 
cuts have forced administrators to turn away students, especially in the areas 
of math and English. College of the Redwoods, for example, has cut its 
full-time equivalent enrollment from 5,099 last year to 5,028. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be open to everybody. Now we have to restrict enrollment," Sampson 
said. "We're a public commodity and we're having to ration it. We have had to 
set priorities for who gets in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Changs succeed in enrolling all their children at College of the 
Redwoods, their troubles will be far from over. Even now, Matthew is more than 
ready to move to a four-year institution so he can study to become a doctor, 
his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about my son," Chang said. "I have to find a good medical school for 
him."

U.S. ESCALATES PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST HAITI'S LEADERS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

 Last weekend, after weeks of careful planning, a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo 
plane flew low along the coast of Haiti, dropping thousands of white leaflets 
with a picture of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and a poetic pledge 
for his return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun of democracy . . . the light of justice," the leaflet promised in 
Creole, the language of Haiti's poor. "The warmth of reconciliation . . . with 
the return of President Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 They were "very nice leaflets," a senior U.S. official said wistfully. Only 
one problem: "The wind changed, they got blown the wrong way and ended up in 
the water." 
</P>
<P>
 In a massively orchestrated campaign of psychological warfare, the Clinton 
Administration has drawn on every weapon in its arsenal to push Haiti's 
military dictators toward quitting -- from leaflets and radio broadcasts to 
dispatching dozens of warships and thousands of troops. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. patrol boats have darted near Haiti's shores, and small aircraft have 
buzzed the capital of Port-au-Prince. Public and private messages have been 
sent to Haiti's ruling generals saying that if they stay, they risk being 
captured and turned over to their enemy, Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 In another effort to turn up the pressure -- and build public support for an 
invasion -- the White House announced that President Clinton will address the 
nation Thursday evening on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday, rattling the biggest saber of all, the Navy sent the aircraft 
carrier America steaming toward the Caribbean to ferry Special Forces 
paratroops who would drop into Haiti to seize key facilities as part of an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, officials have said, is to make the Haitian leaders "hear footsteps" 
-- to convince them that after months of indecision, Clinton is serious about 
invading. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with the leaflets, psychological warfare is turning out to be a 
difficult and sometimes frustrating enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have been watching and listening closely for some sign that 
Haiti's ruling generals are getting rattled -- but the signs, they acknowledge, 
are still maddeningly inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some indications that they are beginning to focus on it," a senior 
official said. "But they only really began to notice last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is still escalating, officials said, hinting that the Haitians 
soon will be hit with more communications, including false radio messages and 
other signs of imminent invasions that will force them to stay on 
psychologically debilitating 24-hour alerts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration plans to continue its very visible 
preparations for a real invasion, on the theory that only real deployments can 
convince the Haitian leaders that they face a real danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Those measures are expensive. Operating the America alone costs more than $1 
million a day. But psychological warfare is cheaper than the real thing, 
officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there's a 50-50 chance" that the generals might give up without a 
fight, one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that all the parts of a U.S. invasion force would be in 
place by next Tuesday or Thursday, a timetable that seems to be holding true as 
more ships and combat troops are readied for the military operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures already taken: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. warships deliberately sailed within a few miles of Port-au-Prince and 
other Haitian towns over the weekend and sent helicopters and patrol boats even 
closer to the shore -- drawing curious crowds and touching off new rumors of 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 * As the America left Norfolk, Va., with military support personnel assigned 
to the Army's 18th Airborne Corps, Pentagon officials pointedly noted that its 
mission includes carrying the Special Forces units that would be used to seize 
airports and communications centers in Haiti in the moments before an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Army's 18th Airborne Corps at Ft. Bragg, N.C., remains on alert and, 
according to Pentagon sources, would be the first ground troops of a force of 
about 20,000 to land in the island nation in an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eighteen hundred Marines assigned to the amphibious assault ship Wasp began 
ground exercises in Puerto Rico that included the firing of live rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thirteen cargo ships are being readied at Eastern and Southern ports to 
carry heavy equipment and supplies to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dwight D. Eisenhower, another aircraft carrier, and the Mount Whitney, 
an amphibious command ship, are being reconfigured this week in preparation for 
service in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 * A light-infantry contingent of 2,000 from the Army's 10th Mountain Division 
is being sent later this week aboard the Eisenhower to the Haiti shoreline, 
where the troops will wait "within eyesight" of the beach and conduct mop-up 
and peacekeeping operations on the island nation should any invasion take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior U.S. military leaders consider the series of public announcements 
to be confusing, if not wrong, noting that conventional military wisdom holds 
secrecy as the greatest component of any invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done other buildups like this before and you wouldn't even have known 
it," one Pentagon official said. "But this one has been very public. It's been 
saber rattling to the max. It's brinkmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Others wonder if the stream of announcements is even getting through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haitians don't read our papers or see our TV," a senior Pentagon planner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we doing this just to scare them?" another official asked. "And what if, 
after putting all this hype out on the street, we don't invade? (Military 
leader Lt. Gen. Raoul) Cedras is going to laugh at us."

LAPD REVAMPING PROBES OF SHOOTINGS BY OFFICERS; REFORM: CHIEF SEEKS SHORTER 
INQUIRIES, BROADER POOL OF INVESTIGATORS. MOVE COULD MAKE POLICE EASIER TO 
PROSECUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from prosecutors and police commissioners to reform the way it 
investigates officer-involved shootings, the Los Angeles Police Department has 
begun a series of changes that are intended to speed up investigations but also 
may make officers, in some cases, easier to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal LAPD documents obtained by The Times reveal that Police Department 
officials are seeking to restructure the officer-involved shooting team, the 
unit that historically has investigated all shootings by Los Angeles police 
officers. Police Chief Willie L. Williams said last week that he expects the 
changes to be made soon, but stressed that he generally is satisfied that the 
department is doing a good job with its investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing all the right things, but you have to reach all over the 
organization for the chief and the commission to get the big picture," Williams 
said. "We need more of our best people to assist in the investigation of a 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the changes already have begun. As the restructuring plan moves 
through the bureaucracy, Williams has asked to be notified immediately after 
any questionable shooting, and says he has intervened in several investigations 
in which criminal charges against an officer seemed possible. For now, however, 
he has stopped short of endorsing a more radical procedural change advocated by 
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti and his prosecutors have complained that the LAPD's system for 
conducting internal investigations -- particularly its practice of ordering 
officers to give statements about a shooting incident -- creates legal problems 
in cases in which criminal charges might be warranted. To remove such obstacles 
to prosecution, Garcetti would like the Police Department to end its practice 
of taking "compelled statements" from officers in shooting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the debate is a concern by some observers that the LAPD's 
officer-involved shooting team is less of an aggressive investigative unit than 
a protective shield that buffers officers from prosecution and insulates the 
city from liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the unit has strong defenders, and the debate over remaking it has divided 
police and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes and proposed changes initiated by Williams are partly in response 
to concerns raised by Garcetti, but have met resistance from some of the 
chief's top deputies, most notably Bernard C. Parks, who was demoted from his 
assistant chief's post Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who has clashed with Williams on a number of issues, criticized the 
proposed changes in a candid memo to his boss May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our current system works well for the department and the community we serve," 
Parks wrote. "Although Mr. Garcetti doesn't like the product we send his 
office, it is a far more complete package than he will receive if the 
recommendations in this report are implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Williams' proposed restructuring -- which will require Police Commission 
approval -- police shootings would no longer be the exclusive purview of the 14 
members of the officer-involved shooting team, but would be handled by 
detectives throughout the department's robbery-homicide division. That would 
broaden the pool of investigators reviewing such shootings and would expand the 
unit's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Bill Hall, who heads the unit, said the reorganization would deprive 
the city of valuable expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said his shake-up of the unit has been in the works for more than a 
year. It grows out of an increasingly bitter disagreement between the LAPD and 
the district attorney's office about how to best investigate the 100 or so 
incidents every year in which Los Angeles police shoot at suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shooting team often uncovers mistakes that are serious enough to 
warrant retraining or discipline, the vast majority of those cases do not 
result in criminal charges. In fact, only one or two police shootings a year 
raise serious questions of criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of the Police Department yielding to prosecutors has stirred 
concern at the police union, where officials worry that new investigative 
procedures could expose officers to protracted criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the union can't help but fear the worst for our people," said Hank 
Hernandez, general counsel for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the 
union that represents rank-and-file officers. "The changes he is proposing to 
make will expose officers to criminal sanctions and expose the city to 
additional civil liability." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the union's reservations, others are pushing for change, and three key 
players have emerged in the complicated debate: Williams, Garcetti and Police 
Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has one agenda -- eliminating obstacles to possible police 
prosecutions -- while Enrique Hernandez and Williams have another -- speeding 
up the process and ensuring its integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, Garcetti and Hernandez are scheduled to hold a rare joint session on 
the reorganization today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they bring different agendas to that meeting, one issue on which all 
sides agree is that shooting investigations take too long to complete and 
review. In some cases, those probes have taken more than a year, during which 
time officers must work under a cloud of possible administrative action or even 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem and headache that I had is that on average it took a year 
to get an officer-involved shooting down to the Police Commission, which I 
found to be intolerable," Williams said. "One of the biggest complaints I heard 
from personnel on my first round of roll-call trainings was: 'Chief, I haven't 
heard (about) this shooting eight or nine months ago. I'm hearing it's OK, but 
until you and the commission say it's OK, I'm still on the hook.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To move the system faster, Williams has asked that all shooting reviews be 
completed within six months, and said he hopes the other proposed staffing 
changes will speed the process even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall has defended his unit's work and argued that the delays in completing 
shooting investigations are the fault of higher-ups who control the review 
process, not the investigation itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the motivation to find a quicker resolution to these incidents 
is a good one," Hall said. "But I see nothing in any of the proposals that will 
speed this up." 
</P>
<P>
 The time needed to conduct police shooting investigations also troubles 
commission President Hernandez and Garcetti. The district attorney complained 
that delays make it difficult for his office to assess whether criminal charges 
are warranted in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But the primary disagreement between police and prosecutors arises out of LAPD 
officials' longstanding practice of forcing officers to give interviews to 
Police Department investigators probing the events surrounding a shooting. 
Because those statements are given under threat of firing, they cannot be used 
in any subsequent criminal case -- all defendants have a right against being 
forced to incriminate themselves, and courts have found that statements taken 
under threat of firing violate that right if they are used against the 
defendant in a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Under LAPD practice, officers are ordered to give an interview after first 
being promised that their statements will not be used against them in any 
criminal proceeding. That can create problems later, however, because the 
department circulates copies of the compelled statements to investigators and 
to other officers involved in a shooting who may be facing discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it extremely difficult for prosecutors to use those witnesses in 
any trial because courts may find that they have been "tainted" by their 
exposure to the compelled statements from others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem for a prosecutor is once the compelled statement is disseminated 
to other witnesses, the prosecutor has to show that they are not tainted," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven D. Clymer, one of the lead prosecutors in the 
Rodney G. King civil rights trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with complications such as that, the district attorney has sought to 
have police officials discontinue the practice of forcing officers to give 
statements in shooting cases and in cases in which suspects die in custody. 
Abolishing that system would make it easier to bring charges against police 
officers but also would make it harder to investigate the cases internally, 
since officers could refuse to speak to Police Department investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, however, strongly recommended against any move that would not force 
officers to give statements to police investigators. Those statements, Parks 
argued, are essential to the department as it conducts its internal review of 
shootings and decides whether administrative action is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview last week, Williams said he had decided not to abolish the 
taking of compelled statements but pledged to personally review any 
questionable shooting and decide for himself whether the officers ought to be 
questioned under threat of firing. 
</P>
<P>
 In some recent cases, Williams said, he has asked investigators not to take a 
statement from the officers immediately because prosecutors might be hampered 
by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, prosecutors have not been satisfied with that arrangement. Among other 
things, they are concerned that a prosecutor, not the police chief, should be 
the one to decide whether and under what circumstances officers are questioned. 
Predictably, that idea concerns union leaders and the rank-and-file officers 
they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want officers being treated like criminals," said the union's Hank 
Hernandez. "The investigation of a shooting involving a police officer is 
different from any other kind of investigation. They can't be treated the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such strong feelings on all sides, Williams has delayed a final 
decision on the issue for months, wrestling with a number of options. Enrique 
Hernandez, the Police Commission president, said he has become increasingly 
eager to see the issue resolved, adding that he hopes the meeting today can at 
last settle the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that we can reach a conclusion that is acceptable to all the 
parties," he said. "It's not good for this to be in a state of flux, which it 
has been for some time."

THE TIMES POLL; 62% WOULD BAR SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supported by virtually every segment of the electorate, Proposition 187 -- the 
ballot initiative denying most government services to illegal immigrants -- 
would win by an overwhelming margin if the November election were held today, 
the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely voters, the sweeping measure is favored by 62% to 29%. Among all 
registered voters, the split is almost identical: 62% to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, a coalition of mainstream education, health and law 
enforcement organizations have launched a drive to defeat the measure, which 
includes a provision that proponents acknowledge runs counter to a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision mandating public education for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll Director John Brennan cautioned that the poll was taken before either 
side has begun an intensive ad campaign and noted that many voters remain 
unaware of the details of the measure. But Brennan said the current 
across-the-board support, fueled by a strong anti-immigrant tide, presents the 
opponents with a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll showed that Proposition 187 is favored by Democrats as well as 
Republicans, middle-of-the-roaders and conservatives, and voters of both sexes 
and all age groups, income levels and educational backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among the small base of Latino registered voters -- Latinos account for 
less than 10% of the electorate but make up about 25% of California's 
population -- the restrictive measure was favored in the poll by 52% to 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the reason most often cited by poll respondents for supporting 
Proposition 187 was a strong gut feeling rather than any specific provisions in 
the measure. Among registered voters, 34% of those who favor it said they would 
vote for Proposition 187 because "something has to be done" about illegal 
immigration. The next most frequently cited reason -- given by 18% of 
Proposition 187 supporters -- was that the measure would stop immigrants from 
using public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the pro-187 momentum seems founded on sheer frustration rather than 
on specifics," Brennan said. "It's as if some people are saying: 'Do something, 
anything, no matter what it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A second get-tough measure on the November ballot, the "three strikes" crime 
initiative that calls for prison sentences of 25 years to life for third-time 
felony offenders, also is finding strong support, according to the Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely voters, Proposition 184, which mirrors state "three strikes" 
legislation that took effect earlier this year, is favored by 59% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high levels of support for both measures, "there's still a fairly 
high level of indecision," Brennan said. "That leaves room for campaigns to 
move voters around." 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents were asked a pair of questions about each initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Proposition 184, 46% of likely voters who read only the ballot 
label said they had not heard about the measure or did not know how they would 
vote. Among those who were aware, supporters far outnumbered detractors, 42% to 
12%. 
</P>
<P>
 With the measure on illegal immigration, 44% of likely voters said -- before 
being read a longer summary -- that they had not heard or read anything about 
the measure or didn't know how they would vote. But those already knowledgeable 
backed it by a wide margin of 39% to 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 already has over twice as many core supporters as 
detractors," Brennan said. "The opponents have their work cut out for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The readings of 59% to 29% for Proposition 184 and 62% to 29% for Proposition 
187 came after poll takers summarized the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two months before the election, two other major issues -- 
Proposition 186, which calls for a state-run health system, and Proposition 
188, the tobacco industry-backed initiative to establish statewide regulations 
on smoking restrictions -- have made a weaker impression on voters. About 
two-thirds of likely voters have not heard enough about the measures to form an 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer health initiative, which could involve $75 billion in 
government funds to administer a statewide health system, trails by a wide 
margin -- 23% to 63%. Those results were obtained after the measure was 
described. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking initiative is a statistical tossup. Among likely voters, 47% are 
in favor and 45% opposed. Those figures were based on a description of ballot 
language. Respondents were not told that the measure is backed by tobacco giant 
Philip Morris. Other polls have shown that voters turn against the measure when 
so informed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,503 adults statewide, 
including 1,165 registered voters and 721 likely voters, from Sept. 8 to Sept. 
11. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is 3 points in either 
direction; for likely voters it is 4 points in either direction. The margin of 
error for certain subgroups of voters may be somewhat higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The responses to Proposition 187 and related questions make clear that 
immigration remains a hot issue in California, trailing crime and the economy 
and running neck and neck with education as the most frequently mentioned 
problem facing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times poll last September, 92% of registered voters said illegal 
immigration into California was a problem. In the new poll, the figure was 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, 42% of the state's registered voters say in the new poll that they 
believe that legal immigration into California is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there is little evidence that Proposition 187 -- or for that 
matter any of the other ballot measures -- is motivating people to vote. Only 
6% of the voters said that Proposition 187 would particularly motivate them to 
show up to cast ballots, compared to 19% for the governor's race between 
Republican incumbent Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11% of Latino registered voters said they would be particularly motivated 
to vote by Proposition 187, and the poll showed no indication of a surge in 
Latino voter registration. Nor did the poll show a bloom of motivation by those 
describing themselves as political conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, co-authored by a pair of former federal Immigration and 
Naturalization Service officials, would bar illegal immigrants from public 
schools, non-emergency health care and social services. To accomplish its 
goals, police, school officials and health providers would be required to ask 
people about their citizenship or immigration status and to report those they 
suspect of being illegal to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors acknowledge that the school provision flies in the face of a 1982 
U.S. Supreme Court decision declaring that undocumented children are entitled 
to a public education. But they say the initiative would trigger a new legal 
challenge in which the court could reverse itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors say the measure would result in the deportation of some illegal 
immigrants, the "self deportation" of others who no longer qualify for 
government services and the establishment of an environment that would 
discourage further illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including the state School Boards Assn., the California Teachers 
Assn. and PTA, counter that the measure does nothing to strengthen the nation's 
borders, places at risk up to $15 billion annually in federal funding to 
California and would establish a "police state" mentality in which all 
immigrants and people of color or with accents would fall under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 By 75% to 18%, voters said they believe it is hard to tell the difference 
between illegal and legal immigrants in California. Regardless, 61% of those 
who said it was difficult to differentiate said they would vote for Proposition 
187 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly a problem," said one respondent, a Sacramento lawyer, 27, who 
is a registered Democrat and a third-generation Latino. "But sometimes people 
have to bear the brunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate hearing myself say these things," she continued. "But I just think 
something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Poll respondents said the two greatest problems caused by illegal immigration 
were the use of government services and welfare -- cited by 43% -- and taking 
jobs from Americans -- cited by 22%. Only 7% of respondents said they believed 
that illegal immigration causes no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Most voters said they have had some contact with illegal immigrants, including 
23% who said they have seen illegal immigrants on the street or in their 
neighborhood. Among those voters who had seen immigrants on the street, 71% 
said they would vote in favor of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 41% of registered voters said they have not come into contact with 
illegal immigrants in the last few years. Nonetheless, by 59% to 28%, those 
with no contact said they supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who oppose the measure list reasons including the public school 
prohibition, beliefs that the initiative is "poorly written," "inhumane" or 
"costs too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather spend the money on beefing up the border," said one poll 
respondent, a 64-year-old bookkeeper from Glendale, who is a registered 
Democrat. "You have a problem, you go to the source, right?" How the Poll Was 
Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,503 adults statewide, by telephone, Sept. 8-11. 
Included in the sample were 1,165 registered voters and 721 likely voters. 
Numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit 
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be 
contacted. Interviews were in English and Spanish. The sample was weighted 
slightly to conform more closely with census figures for sex, race, age and 
education. The margin of sampling error for the total and registered voter 
samples is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for likely voters it is 4 points. 
For certain subgroups, the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results 
can also be affected by factors such as the wording of questions and the order 
in which they are presented.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MERGERS' BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS OFTEN OVERSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the recent spate of merger announcements -- from Lockheed-Martin Marietta 
to Federated-Macy to Yucaipa-Ralphs Grocery -- the issue of what happens to 
prices after companies join forces has bubbled to the top once again. 
</P>
<P>
 So when companies conspire to combine, do consumers end up paying more for 
goods and services? 
</P>
<P>
 Economists love to straddle the fence on this one. But one thing is clear: The 
claims of many merger partners that their unions will result in economies of 
scale that translate into savings for customers are often simplistic and 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Such savings are often confined to the early months or years of a merged 
corporation, with few lasting effects, antitrust experts say. And even if the 
new efficiencies live on, they can frequently be offset by the price freedom 
that reduced competition creates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the merger expected to be announced shortly between Ralphs and the owner of 
Alpha Beta, a single company would garner 27% of Southern California's grocery 
market -- a figure that sounds alarm bells for several antitrust experts 
despite the relatively robust supermarket competition that would remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the consumer's point of view, when you have over-concentration and 
reduced competition over time, you're going to have higher prices," said John 
K. Van de Kamp, a former California attorney general who challenged 
high-profile grocery store mergers in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 From this country's beginning, Americans have vacillated between loving and 
hating big business. By the late 1800s, vast wealth had accumulated in the 
hands of individuals and companies. Hostility against monopolies in general 
and, specifically, the Standard Oil Co. "trust" built by John D. Rockefeller 
led to passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. Under that law, many 
individuals and firms were punished for fixing prices or agreeing to share 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1914, legislators had concluded that trust-busting alone was not enough. 
That year, the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed unfair price discrimination and 
mergers that would substantially reduce competition or tend to create a 
monopoly. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission was established as a 
regulatory body. 
</P>
<P>
 All the safeguards, however, have not deterred businesses from embarking on 
waves of bigger-is-better consolidation: mergers in the 1920s, the formation of 
conglomerates in the 1960s and 1970s, the leveraged buyouts of the 1980s and 
the renewed merger mania of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Logic would dictate that prices have ratcheted upward from all this merging. 
But a number of what economists like to call "confounding variables" -- global 
trade, inflation, cuts in defense spending, recessions, improvements in 
technology -- routinely intervene to mess up the tidy formula. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, in recent times, an automatic link between mergers and higher 
prices has proved tricky to establish, academicians say. "It's difficult to 
point to any industry where mergers have created monopoly power . . . and 
increased prices," said Randolph Westerfield, dean of the USC School of 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's ardor for antitrust enforcement has waxed and waned. During 
the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, for instance, 
officials gave their blessing to mega-deal after mega-deal among department 
stores, grocery stores and manufacturers. In many cases, they cited the 
economic benefits that could result as U.S. companies pooled their resources to 
compete in an increasingly global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Clinton Administration has given the appearance, at least, of 
scrutinizing mergers more closely. And officials say the issue of whether 
mergers will hit consumers in the pocketbook is always foremost in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to boil merger analysis down to one question, it is: Will prices 
go up after the merger?" said Steve Sunshine, a deputy assistant attorney 
general in the antitrust division at the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief goal at Justice and the FTC, which share responsibility for 
antitrust enforcement, is to stop any mergers that would prove 
anti-competitive. And generally, academicians and economists agree, they 
succeed. However, "some undesirable mergers squeak through," acknowledged 
Richard Gilbert, chief economist in Justice's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
 Take two airline mergers approved in 1986 -- over the objection of the Justice 
Department -- by the Department of Transportation, which then had such powers. 
A 1991 study by Justice showed that the merger of TWA and Ozark caused a slight 
increase in fares and a significant reduction in service. Meanwhile, the union 
of Northwest and Republic caused substantial increases in fares and a big loss 
of service. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the FTC's Bureau of Economics found mixed results when it looked into 
the effects on product prices of "horizontal" mergers -- unions between two 
competing companies selling a similar product or service. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case study, the economists showed that prices rose substantially after 
the merger of two firms that produced titanium dioxide, a pigment used to make 
paints, paper and plastic. Yet an analysis of the union of Hawaii's only two 
cement producers revealed a significant decrease in prices, attributed to 
efficiencies created by the merger along with Hawaii's access to low-cost Asian 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of murky picture is often the result when economists set out to 
assess how prices behave after a merger. So many changes can intrude -- a 
factory explosion, the entry of a new competitor, a natural disaster -- that 
it's tough to pinpoint precise causes. 
</P>
<P>
 To a great extent, whether prices rise or fall after a merger, economists say, 
depends on why the companies merged in the first place. Recent defense and 
banking mergers, for example, generally have been reactions to shrinking 
markets and are motivated by the need to survive -- a rationale usually 
endorsed by regulators. Another "good" motive would be the replacement of bad 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 But companies' arguments that a merger or acquisition will achieve economies 
of scale that can be passed on to customers as lower prices are "very 
overblown," said USC's Westerfield. Such efficiencies often are one-time 
phenomena and not an ongoing savings to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most evidence suggests that economies of scale come pretty early (in a 
merger) . . . and don't really justify a lot of 'M & A' activity," Westerfield 
Said. "If economies of scale were that significant, there wouldn't be any small 
banks out there, and there are plenty of small banks doing quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to prices, regulators must consider a merger's likely effects on 
service and innovation -- factors that are even harder to measure. Concern over 
innovation recently led the government to block two mergers between makers of 
personal finance software -- Intuit with Legal Knowledge Systems and ChipSoft 
with Meca -- that routinely had leapfrogged each other with inventive products. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups have taken aim at the banking industry, where they say an 
ongoing consolidation has had a chilling effect on services. After Bank of 
America swallowed Security Pacific National Bank, critics watched in dismay as 
some services disappeared and various nuisance fees materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are being charged for using the teller rather than the ATM," 
complained Anna Alvarez Boyd, director of advocacy for Consumer Action, a San 
Francisco group. 
</P>
<P>
 With antitrust enforcement lax at the federal level during the Reagan and Bush 
years, state attorneys general began to take a lead on challenges, which are 
perceived as politically popular. California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren is expected 
to look closely at the Ralphs-Yucaipa deal. 
</P>
<P>
 And in New York, the state attorney general's office has threatened to block 
the merger of Federated and R.H. Macy and to undo Kraft General Foods' 
acquisition of RJR Nabisco's ready-to-eat cereal business. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in both cases is what decreased competition might mean for prices. 
Despite the already high cost of cereals, the Kraft-Nabisco merger has its 
backers. One consultant serving as a pro-merger witness said consumers could 
actually benefit because the companies' joint market share -- 15% -- would 
strengthen their stance against Kellogg and General Mills, which between them 
own about 60% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, consolidation of outlets in highly localized market areas is also 
of concern in the planned Ralphs-Yucaipa merger. The potential of too much 
local "market power" prompted California's attorney general years ago to 
successfully fight a similar merger between two grocery powerhouses -- Lucky 
and Alpha Beta. 
</P>
<P>
 How did consumers fare? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident grocery prices would have been considerably higher had that 
merger gone through," said Michael Strumwasser, an attorney with a Santa Monica 
public interest law firm who at the time was a special assistant to Van de 
Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in retailing in general, one consulting firm has found no evidence of 
rising prices in the wake of the 1980s merger boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, reduced competition is, sooner or later, likely to injure 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a supermarket merger," said Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe consumers will pay a dime more for milk," Shapiro said. "That sort of 
power won't ruin people's lives, but it will take its toll. People don't want 
to drive a mile or two to save a dollar on a basket of groceries."

CRIME BILL IS LAW AND DEMOCRATS HOPE FOR GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For at least a generation, ever since Richard Nixon made "law and order" a 
centerpiece of his 1968 presidential campaign, crime has been among the 
strongest weapons in the Republican Party's arsenal of political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But with President Clinton's signing of the crime bill Tuesday, Democrats hope 
that they finally have built a workable shield on the issue. Indeed, in a fall 
campaign season that promises little but pain for Democrats, passage of the 
crime bill has become one of the party's few bright spots -- one that 
congressional candidates are vigorously exploiting in races across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Republicans are not yet ready to abandon the field. As 
Democrats trumpet the bill's popular features -- a "three strikes and you're 
out" law, federal aid to put more police on the streets, a ban on 
military-style assault weapons, new federal death penalties and funds for crime 
prevention programs -- Republicans already have continued to sound the 
complaint that they issued during the congressional debate on the bill this 
summer: too much spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting claims in that debate, however, should not obscure two 
substantial developments. First, Clinton can rightly say that, in winning 
passage of a crime bill, he succeeded in breaking a six-year jam in which gun 
control opponents on the one side and death penalty opponents on the other had 
been able to block passage of any bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton emphasized that point in signing the bill Tuesday. Surrounded by 
police officers, clergy and members of Congress on a flag-decked stage, Clinton 
hailed the bill as an example of how Washington gridlock can be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six years, Washington debated a crime bill without action while more and 
more children died and more and more children became criminals and foreclosed a 
productive life for themselves," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, at last, the waiting ends," he added. "Today the bickering stops, the 
era of excuses is over, the law-abiding citizens of our country have made their 
voices heard." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, that claim has not helped Clinton much. Pollsters who have conducted 
surveys recently said that voters give Clinton credit for having stood up for 
the bill's assault weapons ban and for fighting the National Rifle Assn. But 
the President's overall popularity has continued to slide in recent weeks and 
the polls show little indication that the crime bill has altered that trend. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides blame that fact on the intensity of Clinton's opponents. 
"When you get $25 million of opposition shoved down your throat, it has an 
impact," said one White House official. Aides hope that, with more events like 
Tuesday's aimed at reminding voters of the parts of the bill they like, they 
can begin to overcome that impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Clinton, however, the bill's second impact is noticeable. While 
individual Republicans -- California Gov. Pete Wilson is a notable example -- 
continue to find that they can make substantial gains by labeling their 
Democratic opponents as "soft on crime," the GOP as a whole appears to have 
lost its once-exclusive hold on the issue. Democrats cannot claim to have 
captured the issue for their own but at least they no longer are running from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 One prime example is Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). At Tuesday's ceremony, 
Feinstein stood directly behind Clinton, visible from almost any camera angle, 
and smiled broadly as Vice President Al Gore praised her for her sponsorship of 
the bill's assault weapons ban. In the last week, Feinstein has called a series 
of press conferences to discuss the bill and has picked up the endorsements of 
several police organizations, including some that opposed her in the past, 
because of her work on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime was an issue we owned forever and ever," said Bruce Blakeman, who heads 
campaign research in the polling firm run by Richard B. Wirthlin, who was 
Ronald Reagan's pollster. Republicans lost their lock on the issue after the 
1992 election and so far they have been unable to get it back, Blakeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, after years of pushing for "tough on crime" measures, some 
prominent Republicans now have begun arguing a different line -- that nothing 
Washington can do will make much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "When youth gangs are the dominant form of social organization in many of our 
cities, new laws are irrelevant. When 11-year-olds murder and are murdered in 
turn, enhanced penalties are irrelevant," former Vice President Dan Quayle said 
in a recent speech in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are counting on the hope that voters have not yet grown that 
skeptical. "Members can go home and say to their constituents: 'I voted for 
three strikes, I voted to put more cops on the street.' It's a way of saying, 
'I'm not an out-of-touch liberal,' " said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. "It 
gives us increased legitimacy in what used to be a Republican area." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidates have been quick to tout key elements of the bill in 
their speeches and advertisements. Generally, candidates have talked about 
specific parts of the bill, rather than the overall package -- reflecting the 
fact that, while many of the bill's parts are extremely popular, voters remain 
less certain about the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Party strategists hope that the crime issue will help particularly in the 
Northeast, the industrial Midwest and California, but concede that it will be 
of less utility in the South and Rocky Mountain states, where Democrats seem 
headed for their worst losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats concede, however, that Republican attacks, coupled with pre-existing 
voter skepticism about Washington, have left voters with doubts about the 
bill's contents.

180 NATIONS ADOPT POPULATION PLAN; GROWTH: U.N. CONFERENCE ENDS BY APPROVING 
PROGRAM TO LIMIT WORLD'S PEOPLE TO 7.2 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. IT 
GETS PARTIAL ENDORSEMENT FROM THE VATICAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over a chorus of reservations from Latin American and Islamic countries still 
troubled about abortion and family issues, nearly 180 nations adopted a 
wide-ranging plan Tuesday on global population, the first in history to obtain 
partial endorsement from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, approved on the final day of the U.N. population conference here, 
for the first time tries to limit the growth of the world's population, by 
preventing it from exceeding 7.2 billion people over the next two decades. It 
sets aside a focus on issues of contraception and demographic quotas alone in 
favor of broad new health care programs and the freedom for families to choose 
how many children they have. 
</P>
<P>
 It establishes a controversial new category of "reproductive rights" and 
emphasizes improving health, education and living standards for women in the 
expectation that they will then elect to have smaller families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican, whose battle over the abortion issue dominated the nine-day 
International Conference on Population and Development, elected not to support 
contentious chapters dealing with abortion, extramarital sex and adolescent 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Holy See said there were enough positive elements in the program of 
action -- including its linking of population to development, its stand against 
coercion in population policies and its promotion of women's status and the 
family -- that the church wished for the first time to join in an international 
consensus on population policy, if only partially. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Church refused to join either of the past two global 
population programs, adopted in 1974 in Bucharest, Romania, and in 1984 in 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that the Holy See has done in this consensus process should be 
understood or interpreted as an endorsement of concepts it cannot support for 
moral reasons," Archbishop Renato Martino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially nothing is to be understood to imply that the Holy See endorses 
abortion or has in any way changed its moral position concerning abortion or on 
contraceptives or sterilization nor on the use of condoms in HIV/AIDS 
prevention programs." 
</P>
<P>
 A flock of nations shared the Vatican's objections but elected to simply 
record them and join in a full consensus on the plan of action. The 
reservations -- from Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, the 
United Arab Emirates, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Venezuela, 
Costa Rica, Paraguay, Brunei, Malta, Libya, Yemen and Iran -- diminished the 
broad consensus that U.N. officials had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other nations, including Egypt, Pakistan, Algeria, Afghanistan, Syria, 
Kuwait, Ghana, Jordan, Malaysia, Djibouti, Maldives, Indonesia and Tunisia, 
emphasized that the plan could be implemented only in the context of their 
Islamic laws, religion and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy E. Wirth, U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of 
the U.S. delegation, was nonetheless upbeat. "The consensus was much broader 
than anything we thought was going to be possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would remind you that two years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio, nations 
couldn't even talk about the problem of population, it was so contentious. 
Imagine how much progress we've made in the last two years, when we cannot only 
talk about this and talk about it honestly and openly, but we can also come to 
agreement on a very, very progressive document," Wirth said. "I think the world 
is never going to be the same after Cairo." 
</P>
<P>
 Feminist organizations around the world, which had pushed for the idea that 
empowering women is the key to curbing population growth, were jubilant about 
the plan, though it fell short of the goal quietly expressed by many of making 
safe, legal abortion available worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it states that abortion is not to be used as a family-planning tool 
and emphasizes the responsibility of nations to deal with the health 
consequences of unsafe illegal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very close to everything we hoped it would be. It's like 98%," said 
Joan Dunlap, head of the International Women's Health Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Population programs and policies have failed in many countries because they 
had no roots, and they have failed because they have not been just," she said. 
"This approach says we need to focus on women's fertility. It has shifted the 
focus to the individual woman and says if we meet her needs, not only is that 
just and humane, but we judge it will have a very successful demographic 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But the International Right to Life Federation said the strong language 
emphasizing that abortion is not to be promoted for family planning, plus the 
widespread concern about the issue on the part of Latin American, African and 
Muslim countries, indicated that the conference was "clearly a defeat for the 
Clinton Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be difficult for those governmental and non-governmental 
organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere who are dedicated to promoting abortion 
in the developing world to claim that this conference gave them a mandate to do 
so," the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican officials said much of the world may not yet be ready for the kind of 
far-reaching proposals envisioned in the program of action. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were new ideas, and the capacity to receive these new ideas was not 
fully as open as some of the planners expected," said Bishop James McHugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the head-butting on abortion prompted new calls for review of the 
Vatican's status as a full member in the United Nations, church officials said 
their vigorous input on abortion and family issues was a necessary ingredient 
of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any international effort, any international conference that attempts to run 
itself purely on secular principles, is doomed to failure," McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a wide bloc of Islamic nations proved to be among the Vatican's 
staunchest allies, arguing against non-traditional unions that might include 
homosexuality, safe sex and discussion of "individuals' " sexual activity, as 
opposed to sex within marriage.

JUDGE SHOULD BE REMOVED, PANEL SAYS; COURTS: A SAN DIEGO COUNTY JURIST IS 
ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT FOR TAKING GIFTS FROM MAN AFTER AWARDING HIM $5 MILLION 
IN A TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare move, the state Commission on Judicial Performance recommended 
Tuesday that San Diego County Superior Court Judge G. Dennis Adams be removed 
from office for "willful misconduct," including accepting gifts from a car 
dealer and the man's attorney three years after awarding the dealer $5 million 
in a non-jury civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also said Adams, 53, failed to disclose that he had accepted 
gifts from other litigants, gave an attorney legal advice on cases being heard 
by other San Diego judges, failed to recuse himself from cases involving law 
firms that had given him gifts and acted in bad faith when he gave inaccurate 
or misleading answers to questions from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Adams' actions constituted "conduct prejudicial to the administration 
of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute," the commission said 
in a 22-page report to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the incidents cited in the commission's report involved San Diego 
car dealer James Williams and his attorney, Patrick Frega. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that Williams sold the judge a Mercedes-Benz and a Jeep 
for less than the public would have paid, repaired the Jeep at a discount and 
put new wheel rims and detail work on the Mercedes for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the commission said Adams violated the Code of Judicial Conduct 
by attending a victory dinner party to celebrate Williams' receiving the 
$5-million judgment, along with $2.5 million in interest from Security Pacific 
Bank. The party was hosted by Frega, who made other gifts to the judge, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, while the judge was writing a novel with Frega, members of 
Frega's law firm, including his partner, were appearing in cases in Adams' 
courtroom, according to the commission report. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Adams said he would challenge the commission's 
recommendation to the state Supreme Court, which has the authority to remove 
the judge or take less stringent action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I truly regret some of my past actions, my conduct does not warrant 
removal from judicial office," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams -- first appointed to the Municipal Court bench in El Cajon in 1975 and 
a Superior Court judge since 1979 -- was suspended Tuesday morning. He is the 
first judge the commission has recommended for removal since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's action follows months of criticism that it is meting out too 
little discipline and acting in secret too frequently. A measure to reform the 
commission has been placed on the November ballot after overwhelmingly passing 
in both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require that all proceedings against a judge be open after 
formal accusations are filed. All the hearings involving Adams -- conducted by 
a special masters panel of three judges -- were held in secret, although word 
of the inquiry leaked to the news media. The report of the special masters did 
not become public until Tuesday, when it was released along with transcripts of 
17 days of hearings held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams asserted that the commission's action should be viewed in light of the 
political controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the commission's recommendation is not based so much on my 
circumstances as it is on circumstances confronting the commission," he said. 
"It appears that I am being sacrificed by the commission so it can justify its 
existence to a very critical Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams and his attorney, Charles R. Grebing, expressed disappointment with the 
commission's conclusion that he had engaged in "willful misconduct." They noted 
that the special masters concluded that Adams' actions constituted negligence 
rather than intentional misconduct. In addition, the masters concluded that in 
some instances Adams was guilty of conduct prejudicial to the administration of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see him as an unusually competent and innovative judge who used poor 
judgment in certain instances, rather than as a scoundrel who has disgraced the 
bench," the special masters concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eight-member commission came to a different conclusion, stressing that 
"full consideration of the totality of (Adams') conduct and the explanations he 
provided in his written responses and in his testimony has led the commission 
to the conclusion that (Adams) engaged in more than mere negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission launched its probe of Adams and five other San Diego judges in 
1991. Four of the other judges received light discipline and the fifth resigned 
last year, citing health reasons.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON JOINED BY BENNETT AT FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, the former education secretary who has been an 
intellectual godfather to Mike Huffington's U.S. Senate campaign, joined the 
Republican candidate Tuesday for a fund-raiser and a panel discussion about 
social values. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's best-selling "Book of Virtues" was the subject of Huffington's first 
television commercial of the campaign and he is a leading advocate in 
Washington for ending government welfare, a proposal Huffington has described 
as the central theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Bennett and others joined a seminar staged by Huffington that 
sought to contrast the conservative and liberal visions of poverty and 
compassion. They argued that government welfare has fueled the nation's 
burgeoning social problems and that community volunteers and private groups 
must assume more responsibility for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supporters of the welfare state seem to talk like they have a monopoly on 
compassion," Bennett said. "Well, they don't. The measure of real compassion is 
to make that sacrifice (of time or money). The cynical approach is to write the 
(government) check." 
</P>
<P>
 The event at the Biltmore Hotel was billed as "an attempt to supplement the 
sound bites and TV commercials" that have been the primary vehicle for 
political campaigns, particularly Huffington's generously self-financed effort 
to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 At heart, the panel was more political than academic. Huffington campaign 
crews filmed the event for a future commercial. The supportive audience of 
about 30 people was gleaned largely from Republican groups. 
</P>
<P>
 During the discussion, Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, 
shed little light on some of the questions raised by critics, who doubt that 
private sources are willing to or can afford to support the nation's indigent. 
Much of the discussion also focused more on a description of the problems than 
on how a public-to-private transition might work. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare is "just giving somebody a check and telling them to go home, be quiet 
and don't bother us," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington officials said the panel was the first of three such events -- all 
exploring the welfare theme -- they hope to stage during the campaign. They 
believe the welfare issue is fertile political ground, as evidenced by the 
attention it has received from other politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Both President Clinton and former Vice President Dan Quayle gave major 
speeches recently about moral values and related government policy that 
substantially overlapped the message in Huffington's campaign. All three men 
say a lack of individual responsibility, inattention to values and 
out-of-wedlock births are among the major contributors to America's social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 After the morning seminar, Bennett also helped Huffington by attending a 
fund-raiser in Orange County. With an audience of more than 400, it was the 
largest fund-raiser Huffington has held in a political campaign that he has 
financed almost entirely from his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most candidates, particularly Feinstein, Huffington has spared little 
time in his campaign for private fund-raisers. But he has two other big-name 
Republican events on the schedule, one Friday with former Housing Secretary 
Jack Kemp and another next month with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Huffington campaign funds are still expected to come from 
the candidate. But a spokeswoman said Tuesday the fund-raisers are a needed 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not have limitless funds," said Jennifer Grossman. "Our goal is to 
raise as much money as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those attending the fund-raiser in Irvine Tuesday said they did not 
mind contributing to a candidate who is spending his own money. Beverly 
Creedon, a donor from Newport Beach, said, "If (people) believe in the same 
values he does, I think you should contribute to that."

LINE OF FIRE; SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL CHIEF TACKLES COMPLEX INS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his cowboy boots and rumbling Texas drawl, the colorful Gustavo De La 
Vina has come to personify the U.S. Border Patrol's struggle to hold the line 
at the San Diego-Tijuana border. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina was recently promoted to western regional director of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service after serving four years as chief of the 
Border Patrol sector here, the agency's busiest outpost. He led a campaign to 
fortify the border during a key chapter in the region's history, when illegal 
immigration surged to political prominence. Now De La Vina is leaving the 
trenches of "the line" to head an overworked bureaucracy extending from the 
California international boundary to Montana to Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he moves on, De La Vina must resolve a dilemma that is testing his 
shrewd and measured approach to the border's treacherous politics. Gov. Wilson 
has demanded an El Paso-style "blockade" by the Border Patrol in San Diego; 
just Tuesday, Wilson's challenger Kathleen Brown also issued a call for a 
border crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina, however, insists that deploying a wall of agents on the front 
lines would only provoke violence because of the greater volume and desperation 
of migrants here. So he has decided to accelerate a gradual buildup instead, 
effectively doubling the number of agents guarding the border by October. In 
contrast to the El Paso blockade, which has virtually shut down a 20-mile 
stretch of the Rio Grande, some of the San Diego agents will be positioned 
inland to intercept crossers after they enter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a solid approach," De La Vina said. "It's not as dramatic as the El Paso 
operation. (But) we worked so hard to eliminate the violence and try to make it 
a more controllable, peaceful-type situation, that any operation that would 
result in a volatile situation I don't want to touch." The final decision will 
be made by Justice Department officials in Washington, De La Vina said. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina's promotion has been welcomed by law enforcement officials, 
immigration control activists and even a few critics of the agency, who praise 
him for imposing a semblance of order at the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sensible regime of control in place," said U.S. Atty. Alan D. 
Bersin in San Diego. "He has been calm where others expressed panic. He has 
been consistent where others have jumped back and forth with the political 
wind." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some immigrant advocates and INS insiders question whether 
this 25-year veteran of the Border Patrol -- an agency they say is plagued by 
flaws in hiring, supervision and internal policing -- can effectively run an 
array of complex service programs at a delicate political moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was particularly troubling was that he should be named at this time, 
with the anti-immigrant debate as out of control as it is," said Claudia Smith 
of California Rural Legal Assistance. "He's a bit of a cowboy, and the job 
doesn't call for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Palacios Skorepa, who directs a Latino social services center in San 
Diego, takes a different view. Skorepa said she has clashed with De La Vina 
several times. But she said he has become more open to community and civil 
rights concerns, citing the formation of a Border Patrol citizens advisory 
panel on which she serves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember that at first he was very brash," she said. "He has made some 
real great strides personally and in understanding the importance of the 
involvement of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether his background qualifies him for the job, De La Vina said: "I 
was able to manage San Diego, the largest sector in the United States. I'm not 
only dealing with enforcement, I'm dealing with international issues, with a 
lot of the political issues, with a whole spectrum of issues from the 
community. The way I look at it is if I was able to survive San Diego, I think 
I've got a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Under President Clinton, the regional director's job has regained power that 
was diluted in a George Bush-era reorganization of the underfunded, often 
demoralized immigration service. De La Vina will earn about $110,000 a year in 
the new job, which is based at regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 His top priorities include deciding the fate of Border Patrol freeway 
checkpoints in north San Diego County, where traffic, chases and accidents have 
generated opposition to the agency's operations -- especially the Interstate 5 
checkpoint near San Clemente. In addition, Brown and other politicians have 
said the agents at the inland stations would be more effective guarding the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the border buildup reduces illegal crossing, which has already 
declined 15% this year in San Diego, De La Vina leans toward shutting down the 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to take a look at the checkpoint situation," said De La Vina. "It 
might have worked several years ago, but we are up to five or six thousand 
vehicles per hour going through those checkpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, De La Vina said, he wants to relieve a paperwork backlog and 
long lines at the Downtown Federal Building with computerization and the 
creation of more satellite offices in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of Mexican and Spanish immigrants, the 55-year-old De La Vina -- 
known widely as "Gus" -- grew up in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas. He 
served as chief of the Border Patrol Academy in Georgia and assistant chief in 
El Paso before taking command in San Diego, a choice assignment but also a 
lightning rod for the media and politicians in California and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the borderlands seethed with violence and confrontations. High crime 
statistics reflected the danger to migrants. The tattered chain-link border 
fence was a symbol of chaos; crowds gathered nightly in U.S. territory and 
clashed with frazzled agents. There were riots, shootings and recurring 
complaints that the Border Patrol used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief set about demarcating his turf. Authorities erected metal fences 
along the 14-mile strip, installed high-intensity lights, built new roads and 
other fortifications. They established effective cooperation with Grupo Beta, a 
Mexican police unit formed in 1990 to protect migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, crime along the border has declined in many categories -- murder, 
rape, rock-throwing at agents. The zone has become safer for illegal crossers, 
yet more difficult to traverse without being caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back at those days, and I go out to the field now, it's a big 
difference," De La Vina said. "People were dying out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the agency has benefited from the discovery by 
politicians of the potent border issue. De La Vina has shared the obligatory 
rugged backdrop of the Tijuana River Valley at press events with the likes of 
presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan, Gov. Wilson and Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.). After years of neglect, the Border Patrol has gained unprecedented 
increases in funding, agents, support personnel and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina was partially a lucky recipient of a political trend. But his mix 
of charm and hard-nosed cop talk has made him an effective pitchman, 
particularly because Border Patrol officials are not always comfortable in the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gus is the best thing the patrol had going for them," a government official 
in San Diego said. "He'll talk to people. He's a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, critics charge that the quest for resources spurred De La 
Vina to exaggerate the magnitude of the immigrant influx. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has misused his bully pulpit," Smith of California Rural Legal Assistance 
said. "He has bandied apprehension figures about without putting them in 
context." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates also clashed with De La Vina regarding problems that have 
hurt the entire agency: alleged abuse of suspects and a disciplinary system 
that is criticized by the agents themselves. Smith asserts that commanders 
refuse to admit wrongdoing by the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bunker mentality," Smith said. "He doesn't countenance any 
criticism. Every complaint we have filed has been found to be unsubstantiated." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, federal officials cite concrete indicators such as reduced 
shootings by agents -- San Diego went more than three years without a fatal 
Border Patrol shooting. U.S. Atty. Bersin said De La Vina "has entirely changed 
the nature of the problem at the border. And in so doing, he has saved lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, this year the sector has experienced a flurry of five 
agent-involved shootings, one of them fatal, and several misconduct cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and Border Patrol chiefs say they are speeding up a cumbersome 
oversight process that has made investigations drag on for years. For example, 
officials say privately that commanders will probably recommend dismissal of an 
agent who shot and wounded an unarmed border-crosser near the Tijuana River 
levee in July -- an unusually rapid turnaround for such a case. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an effort to break a notorious code of silence among agents, federal 
authorities are investigating a group of officers who allegedly harassed a 
co-worker for reporting an incident in which a migrant was hit by a thrown 
rock, De La Vina said. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina's adjustment to a new white-collar arena will depend on the aides 
with whom he surrounds himself, observers said, and his ability to focus the 
varied, sometimes conflicting missions of the INS -- naturalization, asylum and 
detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigration service veterans regard De La Vina's appointment as a "big 
gamble," one official said. But he added: "If he's getting good advice, his 
instincts will serve him well."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON, BROWN CLASH ON IMMIGRATION; DEMOCRAT 
BLASTS PROPOSITION 187, WHILE THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES A TELEPHONE CAMPAIGN TO 
PRESSURE CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The candidates for governor sparred sharply Tuesday on the emotional and 
politically powerful turf of illegal immigration. Democratic nominee Kathleen 
Brown derided Gov. Pete Wilson's support for a controversial 
anti-illegal-immigrant initiative as a "cheap political trick" while Wilson 
turned his fire on President Clinton for failing to stem the flow of illegal 
immigrants into California as he has into Florida and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, state Treasurer Brown cautioned Californians not to let fear 
dictate their views on illegal immigration, and broadened her plan for stemming 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 350 members of the Commonwealth Club, Brown for the first 
time called for the closure of two highway checkpoints in northern San Diego 
County. She said she favored redeploying the 200 Border Patrol agents who staff 
those checkpoints and hiring more than 1,000 new agents, to ultimately double 
the current law enforcement presence at the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear: . . . Our policies must be tough. Our borders must be 
controlled. And our laws must be enforced," said Brown, who said she has urged 
Clinton to expedite the payment of immigration-related funds earmarked in the 
newly signed federal crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "But let me make one other thing clear: Our policies must not just be 
politically expedient. . . . They must be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the 48-year-old Democrat scathingly criticized Proposition 187, 
which would deny illegal immigrants public education and government-funded 
health care. Brown pointedly compared the initiative to shameful moments in 
California history, such as the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 And she denounced Wilson, who has indicated his support for the measure, for 
"scapegoating" and for airing "inflammatory" television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will tell you, it is really difficult when you are running against someone 
who will do anything and stop at nothing, who runs pictures on television of 
people running hither and yon," she said, referring to one Wilson ad that 
showed Mexicans sprinting across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, she continued, is "fanning fears. I've tried not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the Republican governor came out swinging at Clinton, escalating 
his letter-writing campaign against the President's immigration policies by 
announcing an effort to besiege the White House with telephone calls from 
Californians angry about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, the Wilson campaign will air 10-second ads asking 
Californians to call Clinton to register their views. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California want something done about illegal immigration and 
they want it done now," Wilson said at a Los Angeles press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad critically compares the President's response to the illegal immigration 
of Cuban refugees into Florida and of Mexican nationals into Texas with what 
Wilson decried as his inaction in dealing with the flow of illegal immigrants 
into California. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep Cubans from overwhelming Florida's coast, the President sent U.S. 
military officials to intercept rafting refugees and has interned them in the 
Guantanamo Bay naval station along with Haitians who also sought refuge in 
Florida. In recent days, the White House and Cuban leader Fidel Castro came to 
an agreement that will increase the level of legal immigration to the United 
States but is meant to stop the illegal flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration also mounted an effort in El Paso in which a 
beefed-up Border Patrol presence created a virtual human wall against illegal 
immigration in that formerly popular destination. In the first six months of 
operation along the 20-mile line, illegal immigration fell 73%, according to 
Border Patrol officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson argued that California deserved as much attention from the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem here is far worse than in Florida, but we have seen from the 
White House nothing but promises," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad asking Californians to call Clinton includes video of Wilson and the 
telephone number of the White House switchboard. It pointedly does not include 
a reference to Brown, but Wilson clearly meant to tar her by association. The 
airing of the ad is timed to Clinton's Sunday visit to California for a Brown 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a Brown fund-raiser in San Francisco, First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton characterized Wilson as a nagging pen pal because he has so often sent 
missives to the President about California problems. Wilson archly defended the 
practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House seems to have stopped opening my mail," he said. "Perhaps 
it's because the First Lady objects to my writing her husband so often. . . . I 
will quit writing letters if in fact they do something about the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he did not include Brown in the ad because "Kathleen Brown 
has no jurisdiction" over immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject matter has clear importance in the governor's race. A Los Angeles 
Times Poll published Tuesday found that by a margin of 49%-22%, voters think 
that Wilson can better handle the problems associated with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech, Brown said that she, like Wilson, supports suing the federal 
government for federal immigration dollars that are owed to California. But she 
noted that Wilson, as a senator, voted for federal mandates he now opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight years ago he was a supporter of federal mandates," Brown said. "Now, in 
a tough reelection campaign, he's an election-year plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reiterated several proposals that she has made in the past, including 
increasing penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal workers, creating 
tamper-proof Social Security cards, charging a $1 border crossing toll and 
deporting illegal felons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the crime, serve the time, on your own country's dime," she said of the 
last proposal, which prompted brief applause. "It's very simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said she understood why Proposition 187 sounded to many people like 
a simple solution to illegal immigration. But she warned that it would have 
dire consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, denying all these public services absolutely is 
reasonable," she said. "But when you talk about throwing kids out on the 
streets, let me tell you what I see. I see more kids on the corner. I see more 
uneducated youngsters. I see more gangs. I see more guns. I see more graffiti. 
. . . And I see it costing me more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Most alarming, she said, is that Proposition 187 seeks to require health care 
personnel, educators and law enforcement authorities to report anyone they 
suspect of being an undocumented immigrant to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it fails to tell you is exactly how you're supposed to determine that 
reasonable suspicion. Is it by the color of one's skin? Is it by the accent? 
The last name maybe? Maybe the way you dress?" she said. "It doesn't tell you 
how to do it. What it does do is create a Big Brother that would only make 
matters worse."

SINGLES HAPPY BUT LOOKING FOR TRUE LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life is good, said Michael, 28, who was eating alone and reading a book at a 
Costa Mesa coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 A good job. A new car. An apartment in Newport Beach. A devoted cat. No wife 
or ex-wife. Enough girlfriends, but none of the serious kind, he said. Marriage 
can wait, maybe forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael is one of the estimated 838,000 single adults in Orange County, a 
group that is close to constituting half the total adult population. Two-thirds 
are white and not yet 40 years old. More than half have attended college, but 
in 1990 only 4 in 10 had an income over $20,000. Women slightly outnumbered 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times Orange County poll on the attitudes and lifestyles of unmarried 
residents found that the vast majority of singles, like Michael, say they are 
happy with their lot. But unlike Michael, most of the 500 single adults 
interviewed in the random telephone survey in late June said they want to 
forsake the single life and marry. In Orange County, meeting people is easy, 
they said, but finding the right mate is hard. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates also found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * There are few playboys out there. Two out of three single men who were 
dating described themselves as monogamous; with women, it was more than 
three-quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Good looks and wealth seem to be the important dating assets that 
stereotypes indicate they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although singles are more satisfied with their leisure time than adults in 
general, they are much less satisfied with their love lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The love life ratings of singles are tied to the reality that only half are 
now dating," Baldassare said. "Unmarried women tend to be more satisfied than 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 Belying the image of the swinging single who disdains marriage to date a 
number of women, nearly half of all single men described themselves as 
monogamous and 4 in 10 as celibate. Only 15% of men and 4% of women reported 
dating more than one partner at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The playboy was a myth," said sociologist Jerome Kirk, professor emeritus at 
UC Irvine. "The sexually active person taking on all comers may have been a bit 
of a folk hero 25 years ago, but it wasn't emotionally very satisfying. So I 
think the pendulum has gone back the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays in Orange County, about half of all singles are dating, but 
enthusiasm and opportunity decline with age. Only a third of the middle-aged 
singles were dating, only a fourth of the oldest singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get all the female attention I need," said Arthur, a Laguna Hills Leisure 
World resident who would give his age -- 73 -- but not his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more widows than widowers here. But I don't go out on dates. 
Mostly, it's just hanging around with friends, men and women." 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-aged group appeared to be the most frustrated. About 4 in 10 wanted 
to date but did not. About half said they were celibate. More than half of the 
55-and-over singles said they were no longer interested in dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a much larger number of elderly women living alone than a 
generation ago," said Andrew Cherlin, a Johns Hopkins University sociologist. 
Women still tend to outlive men, but few widows nowadays seek living quarters 
with relatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common living arrangement for women over 60 is living by themselves. 
They don't want to live with their children, but they want to live nearby. Most 
elderly people are happy to live independent lives. It's a mistake to think 
they are unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 The great majority of singles say they believe in "true love," would like to 
be married and find it easy to meet other singles like themselves in Orange 
County. So why do fewer than 4 in 10 have a serious romance under way? 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of spouse are they looking for?" asked Frances Goldsheider, a 
demographer at Brown University. "If their standards are so impossibly high, 
they will remain single." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somewhat depressing," said Jim Gollner, 39, of Yorba Linda, now 
divorced. "Women want to check your financial statement. When I date we go out 
in my old truck, and it ends with one date. A couple girls said they were 
looking for a Clint Eastwood type. Back when I was young, you could meet 
someone and go to dinner and it wasn't a big thing. Now to go to dinner almost 
takes a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Poll results reflect the conflict. Two-thirds of singles said most singles 
they meet are predominantly interested in looks. More than half said most are 
interested in material wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when asked about their own priorities, singles put these two factors at 
the bottom of the list. About 7 in 10 said a fun-loving, outgoing personality 
and shared values are very important and about 6 in 10 listed intelligence as 
well. Women sought shared values and intelligence more than men did. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the old stereotypes seem to persist. Men are more likely than women 
to admit that looks are at least somewhat important, and women place relatively 
higher emphasis on wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emblems of good looks and wealth are powerful, that's undeniable," said 
Paul B. Whittemore, a Newport Beach psychologist who counsels dating singles. 
"They are not the whole story, but they are what get you noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There tends to be a deep program in men and women to try to get the best that 
they can. Women, for example: For a billion years, females have been programmed 
by evolution to seek out the strongest mate with greatest resources -- the best 
nest." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of all singles rated Orange County an excellent or good place to 
be. Those polled singled out Newport Beach and Huntington Beach most often as 
the best places for singles to live.

CANADIAN FEDERALISTS SEE NO THREAT IN QUEBEC RESULTS; POLITICS: DESPITE VICTORY 
BY SEPARATISTS, DEFENDERS OF UNITY NOTE THEIR FAILURE TO WIN A MAJORITY OF 
VOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defenders of Canadian national unity expressed confidence Tuesday that they 
can defeat efforts by the newly elected separatist government of Quebec to 
achieve independence for the mainly French-speaking province. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Monday's election of the Parti Quebecois here seemed to have a little 
something for everybody. The separatists -- or sovereigntists, as they prefer 
to be called -- won a strong majority of 77 seats in the 125-member provincial 
Parliament. Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau will be sworn in as premier 
later this month and has said he will immediately begin working toward a 
provincial referendum on independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canadian federalists were encouraged by the extremely close popular vote 
-- 44.7% for the PQ to 44.3% for the anti-separatist Liberals -- and by the 
fact that Parizeau's party failed to win a majority of the votes cast. (Each 
district is decided on a winner-take-all basis.) 
</P>
<P>
 They also cite polls that show only about 40% of Quebeckers would vote for 
independence today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PQ won a victory, it's in power, but certainly not the victory the polls 
predicted and the victory they wanted," said Maurice Pinard, a sociology 
professor at McGill University in Montreal who has written extensively on the 
Quebec political situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't win an election with more than 45% of the vote, how can they 
win a referendum? It seems to me they're in real trouble on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears from the statistical analysis that this was (a vote) for a change 
of government but not for separatism. I only wish we could have the referendum 
tomorrow so we could put it behind us," Stanley Plotnick, a Montreal 
businessman and community activist, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Charest, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and an expected 
leader in the campaign against a separatist referendum, warned that the Parti 
Quebecois will have powerful tools to advance its agenda and that defeat of the 
referendum should not be taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parizeau now controls the levers of government, and he knows how to use them 
and he will use them," Charest said from his office in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 One PQ insider predicted privately that Parizeau will seek to provoke the 
federal government and Prime Minister Jean Chretien in an effort to make the 
central government appear obstructionist. This, in turn, would be used in the 
campaign for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucien Bouchard, the separatist leader in the federal Parliament, predicted 
conflict with Chretien in an interview after the votes were counted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parti Quebecois was able to run up a large parliamentary majority despite 
the close popular vote because of the sharp division of the electorate along 
linguistic lines. The Liberals, led by outgoing Premier Daniel Johnson, ran up 
large majorities in their English-speaking stronghold districts in Montreal. 
The Parti Quebecois won most of the French-speaking districts, but not by the 
large margins expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-election polls had projected that the Parti Quebecois would win more than 
80 seats -- some suggested as many as 90 -- and a popular vote in the 49% 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 The poorer-than-expected showing will bring pressure on Parizeau to give the 
most prominent role in the referendum campaign to Bouchard, who is considered 
far more popular and dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key to the separatist strategy will be to portray the choice for 
Quebeckers as a stark one of the status quo versus independence. This is aimed 
at the large middle ground of French-speaking voters who are wary of 
independence but would like Canada to cede more control over government 
programs and institutions to the provincial government. 
</P>
<P>
 Many French speakers here believe fundamental reforms are necessary to 
preserve the Quebec language and culture, surrounded as it is by 
English-speaking North Americans. But the rest of Canada often interprets such 
moves as special treatment for Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Charest said he is preparing proposals that could meet Quebec's concerns 
without offending other Canadians and that he will disclose them as part of the 
referendum campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien said Tuesday that he is not interested in undertaking constitutional 
initiatives aimed at Quebec. He said he will press forward with planned 
economic and social reforms regardless of their impact on a referendum 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the results of yesterday, short of the victory of Mr. Johnson, (were) 
the best I could hope for," Chretien said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were sighs of relief in many English-speaking neighborhoods of 
Quebec. During the first Parti Quebecois government, in 1976-84, an estimated 
140,000 English speakers and hundreds of businesses left the province, feeling 
unwanted and without a future. No similar exodus is expected now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard of anybody preparing to take off, whereas the last time you 
could see all the (for-sale) signs going up," said Joan Winser, an 
English-speaking political activist in Montreal who was Canada's consul general 
in Los Angeles for five years in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the village of North Hatley southeast of Montreal, Jackie Donnachie, 46, 
also was feeling more serene. Two weeks ago, standing behind the counter of the 
North Hatley Emporium where she works, Donnachie was anticipating a Parti 
Quebecois landslide and contemplating her family's future. Her husband, Dave, 
51, had an American mother and recently applied for U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by telephone Tuesday, Donnachie said her reading of the results was 
that there was little sentiment for separation. 
</P>
<P>
 But her husband is not withdrawing his citizenship application. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to burn any bridges. It's good to know you have 
options if we need them down the road," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat resolved the thorny issue of development aid for the 
Palestinian territories Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After an afternoon of talks in Oslo, where both men came to mark the one-year 
anniversary of the Mideast peace accord, Israeli negotiators said that Arafat 
had agreed to drop the demand to address Jerusalem's status as part of an aid 
package, according to a preliminary draft of their final statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres and Arafat were meeting privately and with Norwegian and U.N. officials 
to discuss, among other things, $2.3 billion in development aid for the 
Palestinian territories.

POLITICS; AS ELECTIONS DRAW NEAR, CLINTON IS SHAPING UP AS THE GOP'S BEST 
FRIEND; REPUBLICANS EVOKE THE PRESIDENT AT EVERY CHANCE; DEMOCRATS COUNTER BY 
STRESSING LOCAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When New York Rep. Louise M. Slaughter's Republican challenger assails her as 
a tax-and-spend liberal, she changes the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of discussing national issues, the hard-pressed Rochester, N.Y., 
Democrat points to the rewards she has helped her town win from Washington: an 
airport expansion, a new high-tech research facility and harbor improvements to 
protect against the ravages of Lake Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest between Slaughter and GOP challenger Renee Davison illustrates the 
head-on collision between the overall political strategies being pursued by the 
two major parties in the November election, in which nearly 500 House and 
Senate seats are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the widespread voter discontent over national issues, Republicans 
are trying to make this campaign a referendum on the party in power. Democrats, 
putting their faith in the old axiom that all politics is local, are striving 
to define each race in terms of what it means for each individual political 
battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally there's an anti-incumbent mood, and a mood against President 
Clinton," says Slaughter's media consultant, Joe Trippi. "If you get enmeshed 
in that, you lose. But if you can get voters to focus on what you as a member 
of Congress have done for local people, you have a good chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the two approaches reflects the sharply contrasting 
outlooks for each party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very bullish," says Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour. "We have 
not only had a strong wind at our backs for more than a year, but in the last 
few weeks that wind has actually picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, his party's condition reminds Philadelphia-based 
consultant Saul Shorr of the after-the-battle scene from "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I'm in the middle of Atlanta with all those bodies, and all I hear 
is moaning," says Shorr, who advises 22 candidates around the country. "When I 
get on conference calls with people I haven't talked to for a while, I ask, 
'What do you see out there?' They say, 'Disaster.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid debacle, many Democratic candidates are trying to distance themselves 
from Clinton and his sagging polls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans have no intention of allowing that to happen. GOP candidates 
will find ways to "attach the local incumbent to President Clinton," predicts 
pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm counsels about 60 GOP House and Senate 
candidates. "Republicans will say, 'These Democrats are not independent. Every 
time their votes were needed they voted for the President.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic strategists contend that the Republicans are exaggerating 
Clinton's impact on the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this election is about the President per se, " says pollster 
Mark Mellman, who counsels 18 candidates around the country. "Clinton is only 
part of the background for the campaign. In the foreground are the individual 
candidates, and the results will depend on how people evaluate them against 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 For Democratic incumbents, one key to reelection is to demonstrate how they 
use their power and status in Washington for the sake of their constituents. 
"It could be a hospital or a road," says pollster Alan Secrest, who advises 
about 30 House candidates. "But often, it's something more compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a primary challenge last June, Rep. Mike Parker (D-Miss.) used a 
commercial that focused on his successful battle against the Social Security 
bureaucracy on behalf of an elderly constituent. Secrest expects the effort 
will help Parker in the general election, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is to make plain the fact that your stewardship makes a difference 
in the day-to-day lives of your voters," Secrest says. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challengers, as well as incumbents, also are relying heavily on 
local issues and concerns. In Iowa's 2nd District, former Rep. Dave Nagle's 
aides say he is trying to win back the seat he lost to Republican Jim Nussle in 
1992 by contending that Nussle's vote against a farm aid bill would have cost 
his constituents about $19 million in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nagle doesn't often mention Clinton in his campaign, he does attack 
Nussle for voting against the federal crime bill that Clinton helped push 
through the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you are going to run into problems if you pretend you don't know the 
man (Clinton)," Nagle said. "I think the proper thing to say is: 'I'm going to 
work with the President when I agree with him.' But you're better off talking 
about your solutions to problems than his solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of their office, it is more difficult for Democratic 
Senate candidates to separate themselves from the national party and national 
issues than House candidates -- but most try. 
</P>
<P>
 In commercials for 15 Democratic Senate candidates provided by the Democratic 
Senate campaign committee, the federal government was generally depicted, even 
by incumbents, as a force that needed to be wrestled to the ground, and the 
stress on local roots and loyalties was pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see me fighting for Utah," pledges Pat Shea, Democratic challenger in 
Utah. "Working hard for Virginia," is the way incumbent Democrat Charles S. 
Robb described himself to Old Dominion voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing up for New Mexico," is the way incumbent Jeff Bingaman depicts 
himself. In Montana, challenger Jack Mudd claimed as a prime credential the 
fact that he "is not a politician" and he "has never held office." 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 50 Democratic commercials in those 15 races, Clinton's name was 
mentioned only once. Although the ads frequently referred to welfare reform and 
crime legislation, there was no mention that both issues have been high on 
Clinton's domestic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Senate challengers show no such reluctance about using the 
President's name. In New Mexico, an ad for Colin McMillan, the GOP candidate 
against Bingaman, depicts Clinton promising during the campaign not to raise 
taxes on the middle class, a pledge McMillan claims he has broken. The ad also 
charges that Clinton is counting on Bingaman to help pass his "liberal agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tennessee, Republican challenger Bill First is airing a commercial that 
shows an imaginary Mt. Rushmore featuring the visages of three-term incumbent 
Sen. Jim Sasser, Clinton, Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and indicted 
Illinois Democratic Rep. Dan Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, Republican Oliver L. North's commercial claims that Robb votes 
with Clinton 95% of the time, and "voted to help Bill Clinton raise your 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans claim that their efforts to nationalize the election are not all 
negative. Later this month, House Republican incumbents and candidates will 
unite behind their leadership to present a 10-part legislative package, 
including measures to cut taxes, balance the budget and reform the welfare 
system. Senate Republican incumbents and challengers plan a similar 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming forward in a high-profile way and saying, 'Look, this is exactly 
what we are for,' " says Barbour. "Our real strength is issues. We've got 
better ideas than Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever tactics the two parties use, both sides agree that the Democrats 
already face a handicap when it comes to voter enthusiasm and anticipated 
turnout. As a result of the national sense of frustration with politics in 
general, and with Clinton's performance in particular, Democrats seem likely to 
face a harder job getting their supporters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP pollster McInturff says that anti-Clinton citizens are more energized than 
Clinton backers. Of those who disapprove of the job Clinton is doing, 55% say 
they are interested in the election, according to McInturff's surveys, while of 
those who approve of the President's performance, only 40% are interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the problem, House Democratic Campaign Chairman Rep. Vic Fazio 
of Sacramento says Democrats need to work harder at making the electorate aware 
of their accomplishments, such as deficit reduction and the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't effectively told our story, and we need to do that."

RWANDAN GOVERNMENT OUTRAGED OVER SLUGGISH PACE OF INQUIRY INTO GENOCIDE; 
AFRICA: OFFICIAL SAYS DELAYS IN BRINGING PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE WILL PUSH 
THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES TO SEEK REVENGE. U.N. DENIES THE PROBE IS BEING 
'SABOTAGED.'

<P>
 The government lashed out Tuesday at the United Nations for not doing more to 
investigate Rwanda's genocidal massacres and identify the perpetrators, saying 
such inaction could turn frustrated Rwandans into vigilantes bent on seeking 
revenge themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United Nations is sending commission after commission to investigate a 
genocide that took place before the cameras of the world," complained Maj. 
Wilson Rutayisire, a government spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated half a million people, and perhaps many more, were slain in 
Rwanda in April and May as the former government of hard-line Hutus organized 
pogroms of its political opponents and the Tutsi ethnic minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's current Rwandan Patriotic Front leadership, which took control in 
July after a rapid and savage civil war with the old government, has called for 
the trial of at least 30,000 people it says are implicated in the massacres. 
Rutayisire said failure to put them on trial quickly will undermine support for 
the new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the people are not tried, the people (Rwandans) will not see the 
international community," he said. "They will see (only) the government here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, foreign aid organizations and the International Committee of the Red 
Cross have reported increased arrests by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front army and disappearances by the hundreds. Rutayisire accused the foreign 
press of being hypersensitive to such accusations and asserted that any abuses 
by the front's soldiers are investigated and punishment meted out to those 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern city of Butare, he said, a soldier was shot in front of his 
unit for murdering a civilian. In Gitarama, he said, a major and four soldiers 
were placed under arrest for atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community fails to realize the connection with any incident 
that occurs today with the failure to try those responsible for genocide," he 
added, explaining why delays in trying the killers would push Rwandans who lost 
loved ones in the spring to seek vengeance themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments by the spokesman showed to what degree the government has become 
exasperated by the snail-like pace of U.N. efforts to formally rule on whether 
genocide took place, as a preliminary step toward the possible convocation of 
an international tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a U.N. special envoy concluded that "planned and systematic" killing 
occurred in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice delayed is justice denied," Rutayisire said. "If we can try them now, 
why should we wait?" He voiced the possibility that his government might 
organize its own prosecutions, but he then backed away, saying, "Maybe we will 
have to wait as long as it takes" so Western countries, whose aid Rwanda now 
badly needs, do not conclude that today's leaders are bent on avenging the 
bloodshed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a separate press briefing, Pierre Mehu, a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda, flatly denied a comment by Rutayisire that somebody seemed 
to be "sabotaging the U.N. probe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we understand the impatience of the government, but there are steps 
we have to follow," Mehu said. "You just cannot take people and put them in 
front of a tribunal. . . . There are rules that have to be followed." 
</P>
<P>
 Three jurists from French-speaking West Africa have been charged by the U.N. 
Security Council with reporting on whether, in terms of international law, what 
took place in Rwanda was genocide. They have promised to make a report by the 
end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and other members of the U.N. Security Council will then 
decide what action, if any, to take. Only the council is empowered to create an 
international court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwandan authorities are frustrated because the U.N. high commissioner for 
human rights has had an office in Kigali for the past three months, without 
achieving many apparent results. In fact, U.N. sources say, the four employees 
responsible for carrying out the legwork and interviews on the genocide issue 
have been exasperated at what they see as lack of backing elsewhere in the 
United Nations' bureaucracy, plus their inability to obtain cars, computers and 
other resources to gather testimony and other data. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the office's director, Irish human rights lawyer Karen Kenny, 
allowed her contract to lapse. In a press release, the Geneva-based U.N. Human 
Rights Commission strongly denied she had resigned, saying she had been the 
head of the "first team" investigating the blood bath and that she was leaving 
because her contract was due to lapse Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 William Clarence, a British lawyer and retired U.N. civil servant who last 
served as the representative of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in the former Soviet Union, arrived last weekend to assume the post of 
chief of the United Nations' human rights operation in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expected his staff of three human rights monitors to swell soon to 
26 short-term contract employees. In 12 days, Clarence said, his office should 
forward its findings to the three African jurists who in turn will report to 
the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tremendously important for the world community to condemn genocide," 
Clarence said. "Perhaps the procedures have been slow, but there's total 
determination to bring people to justice within the U.N. system."

 After an agonizing two months of study, the government of Prime Minister 
Tomiichi Murayama on Tuesday finally approved sending Japanese troops to 
provide humanitarian assistance to Rwandan refugees in Zaire.

<P>
 The dispatch will mark the fourth time since the end of World War II that 
Japan has sent troops overseas, underscoring a new -- although fumbling -- 
commitment to involve its people in foreign trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japan gave $13 billion in support of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, it 
sent no personnel to the Mideast during the fighting. Only after being stung by 
foreign criticism of its "checkbook diplomacy" did the country enact a 
peacekeeping-operations law to systematize dispatches of noncombat troops to 
join U.N.-sponsored missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatch of troops to Zaire will be the first under Murayama, chairman of 
the Socialist Party, which just two years ago virulently opposed passage of the 
peacekeeping-operations law. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan announced July 25 that it would provide $32.3 million in aid for Rwandan 
refugees, but three different missions, one after another, were sent to inspect 
refugee camps, delaying for seven weeks the decision to send troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's Cabinet decided to assign 380 soldiers, airmen and military doctors 
and nurses to transport medicine and relief goods, dig wells and provide 
24-hour medical assistance mainly at refugee camps in and around Goma, Zaire. 
An additional 100 troops in Japan will be assigned to support the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. troops have left the region and French troops are withdrawing, 
about 800,000 refugees remain in the camps near Goma where tens of thousands 
have died since fleeing Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 An advance party will leave Saturday, with the main body of troops departing 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Worries that the troops might inadvertently get involved in fighting remained 
so pervasive that the Cabinet spelled out precisely the weapons the troops 
would be permitted to take with them: 79 pistols, 163 rifles and one machine 
gun to be mounted on an armored command-and-communications vehicle. It also 
forbade the troops from entering Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Japan, whose postwar constitution bans the use of force in settling 
international disputes, dispatched a mine-sweeping mission to the Persian Gulf 
after U.S.-led troops swept Iranians out of Kuwait -- its first post-World War 
II overseas involvement. Twice since Parliament passed the peacekeeping law, 
Japan has sent small bands of troops abroad -- to Cambodia and Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Japanese were killed while 600 Japanese soldiers built and repaired roads 
for one year in Cambodia.

U.S. POPULATION TEAM HAS CHANGED JERSEYS IN LAST DECADE; GROWTH: AT '84 
CONFERENCE, THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION SAID EXPANDING NUMBERS HAD NO BEARING ON 
DEVELOPMENT. NOW WASHINGTON HAS LED THE WAY TO ADOPTION OF STRATEGIES FOR 
CURBING BOOM.

<P>
 Ten years ago, the United States abruptly reversed decades of population 
policy and announced that the human species' spiraling numbers were not 
necessarily the problem everybody thought they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Population, the U.S. delegation told a 1984 international conference in Mexico 
City, was "neutral as a variable" in global development. The team said free 
enterprise and privatization could promote enough development to allow 
countries to support their expanding numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Administration team helped draft language specifically 
excluding abortion as a family-planning tool and announced that the United 
States was pulling its funding out of the International Planned Parenthood 
Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities because some 
of their clinics conducted abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Blink 10 years, and it's the 1994 International Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo. And nothing is the same. The U.S. team changed jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after taking office, President Clinton announced that he was 
restoring money for Planned Parenthood and the U.N. fund, and Washington has 
boosted financing for population aid programs by about $100 million a year over 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation went into preparatory meetings for the conference with a 
decided abortion rights agenda, and during this week's conference in Cairo has 
led the way toward adoption of a comprehensive package of strategies for 
curbing population growth, including issues such as empowerment of women, full 
reproductive rights, adolescent access to sex education and contraceptives with 
respect for "confidentiality," and unsafe abortion as a health care issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A department of population has now been created at the State Department, and 
the United States went to this year's conference after a major public meeting 
in Washington and nearly a dozen town hall meetings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy E. Wirth, undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of the 
U.S. delegation, remembers when he attended his first U.N. meeting last year to 
discuss the Clinton Administration's new population strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their response was overwhelming," he recalls. "There was a sense of 
electricity and excitement on the floor. Dozens of delegates came over and 
said, 'Welcome back to humanity; welcome back to the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative groups have criticized the Administration for pushing a strong 
abortion rights agenda and continuing to force contraception programs on 
developing countries as part of U.S. aid packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very hard-hitting at PrepCom (the preparatory U.N. meeting held 
last spring), but that was mostly behind closed doors," said Cecilia Acevedo 
Royals, president of the Washington-based National Institute of Womanhood, 
which is critical of the program adopted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Wirth was boasting that they were going to get universal access to 
abortion; they were saying there was going to be an international right to 
abortion. But behind closed doors is one thing. Now that the world is beginning 
to listen to the issues, they have the luxury to bring (Vice President) Al Gore 
in and say practically that their goals are the same as the Vatican's. They're 
soft-pedaling it now," Royals said. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the U.S. population team in Cairo insist they have long had a 
single policy of making abortion "safe, legal and rare" and are committed to 
developing a wide range of family planning and reproductive health programs, 
including tried-and-true contraceptive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have stated time and again that we believe abortion should be rare, but 
what we are saying explicitly at this point is that the availability of family 
planning services makes abortion even more rare," Brian Atwood, administrator 
of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood conceded a "significant shift" in U.S. population policy but said it is 
directed primarily at significant funding increases and a new philosophical 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've adopted an integrated approach to development which will enable us to 
take a much broader approach to the population growth problem," he said. "It 
isn't just family-planning services. It's also a lot of programs that affect 
women's lives, that should have an impact on population growth. It's an 
emphasis on girls' education. It's an emphasis on maternal health care. It's an 
emphasis on child survival. It's an emphasis on micro-enterprise, wherein poor 
women are given an opportunity to have a job with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $585 million a year the Administration has earmarked 
directly for family-planning programs around the world, an additional $600 
million goes to these auxiliary programs, which have emerged as the key focus 
of the new U.N. document adopted in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth said the United States has taken an important leadership role in 
drafting these issues into the document and acting as a broker to help mediate 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we go away from this meeting with the U.S. viewed very, very 
differently by many other countries, not only because we changed dramatically 
our policy on population, but because of the way in which we've done it, the 
understanding that we've shown, the partnerships that we've created. . . . This 
is something that is very new, at least in recent memory, for the United 
States," Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, analysts say, the Reagan and George Bush administrations, and 
now the Clinton team, were playing to different constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a close nexus between domestic politics and the American position on 
population, and it's vividly contrasted by looking at Mexico City and the 
present conference in Cairo," said Jason Finkle, a specialist in population 
planning and politics at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reagan benefited significantly from the pro-life movement, from the 
fundamentalist support, and Clinton has really had the support of the 
pro-choice lobby and the feminists. So each in a way had a constituency that 
they felt loyalty to, and I think ideologically they were in agreement with."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 186; STUDY IN KEY JOURNAL PRAISES 
SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM; ARTICLE WRITTEN BY BACKERS OF THE INITIATIVE HIGHLIGHTS 
DISAGREEMENTS AMONG PHYSICIANS OVER THE MEASURE, WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH SUCH A 
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Physicians backing Proposition 186, the universal health insurance initiative 
on the Nov. 8 ballot, say in a study published today that a single-payer system 
would improve many defects in the nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The article in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., co-authored and 
researched by a number of Proposition 186 supporters, points up the deep 
divisions among physicians over the sweeping initiative, which would establish 
a single-payer system in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors who wrote the article are among the 6,000 members of Physicians 
for a National Health Program, which endorses the measure. The 38,000-member 
California Medical Assn., the established medical group in the state, remains 
squarely opposed to Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 The article in the prestigious medical journal does not mention Proposition 
186, but supporters of the initiative jumped on it as if it were their own, 
releasing it at news conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steve Tarzynski, a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in Inglewood who 
was part of the working group that drafted the study, said Tuesday that "both 
liberals and conservatives say you can't have increased health benefits, at a 
decreased cost, and maintain quality. We say that's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also say that if you want increased quality, you have to pay more. We 
also say that is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The article argues that the nation's health care system clearly does not offer 
"the best medical services in the world," as proponents of the status quo 
insist. To support their arguments, the authors cite what they call examples of 
failure in the present system, including denial of care to the uninsured, 
disparities in quality of care by geography and economic status, lack of 
primary care, and inadequate or no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing nearly 100 references, most of them scholarly studies published in 
academic publications, the authors say that the medically uninsured are far 
more likely to die of serious illnesses, but also argue that those who have 
good insurance are likely to be subjected to expensive but only marginally 
effective or even harmful treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The study criticizes the health reform plan put forward by President Clinton, 
which now appears dead, because it called for phasing in universal coverage 
over a period of years, would have maintained the role of health insurance 
companies in the health care system and would have maintained a system with 
different tiers, depending on how much money a person could afford to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 On each count, the article argues that a single-payer system would be a better 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the authors, Dr. Andrew B. Bindman, a San Francisco internist, said one 
of the aims of the article was to try to turn the debate on health care reform 
from non-health-related issues to quality-of-care issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole discussion has been sabotaged terribly," Bindman said, referring to 
the debate over Clinton's ill-fated package of health care reforms. "For weeks, 
all we heard was what big businesses and small businesses had to say about 
health care reform, whether they should have to pay or not, whether health 
reform would make one more competitive with the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the article argue that it is possible to measure quality in a 
health system and put forward a list of principles that they say should be used 
as measurements. Among them, the physicians argue that any quality health 
system should provide universal coverage, treat all patients the same, 
establish continuity of care, create standardized medical records and emphasize 
preventive medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was silent on one of the main criticisms that the California Medical 
Assn. has of Proposition 186 -- that it would create an elected office of 
health commissioner to manage the proposed state-run insurance system. The 
Proposition 186 system would cover all 31 million Californians, offer a uniform 
system of benefits and be financed through major increases in personal income 
and payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our members favor universal coverage and some kind of a single-payer 
system, but we don't think Proposition 186 is the way to get there," said CMA 
spokeswoman Danielle Walters. "We have had extensive experience with elective 
officeholders who control segments of our health care system, and we don't 
think they have been successful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we don't think the CMA speaks for all physicians in California," 
said Steve Hopcraft, a spokesman for Californians for Health Security, the 
sponsors of Proposition 186. "The article speaks for itself. We win on access, 
we win on cost containment, we win on quality of care."

BOY WHO STARVED WAS RETURNED TO PARENTS BY RELUCTANT JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5-year-old boy who died of starvation under his parents' care had been 
reluctantly returned home after a social worker said the child's grandparents 
would protect him, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County Judge Jeffrey Horner said he did not want to release Jory 
Daniels from court custody because the father, accused of beating the boy, 
shared the same Fremont home the child lived in with his grandparents, who were 
appointed his legal guardians, according to court records viewed by the San 
Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have parents that aren't doing their counseling. They live with the 
guardians," Horner said, according to hearing transcripts. "The injuries are 
serious. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jory was found dead on the floor of his parents' Milpitas apartment in April. 
He weighed 19 pounds. The parents, Sonya and Brian Daniels, have been charged 
with murder and felony child endangerment. The maternal grandparents, Robert 
and Maxine Hicks, have been charged with felony child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jory was first taken from his parents in January, 1989, after he was brought 
to a Fremont hospital with a fractured skull at the age of 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Through counseling and parenting classes, the Danielses made progress after 
that, according to 1990 court documents. But then a foster mother, Bonnie 
Williams, reported changes in Jory's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them not to send him back, because I felt that it was a dysfunctional 
situation and that he was going to end up dead," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the judge returned Jory to his guardians, the grandparents, in 
May, 1991.

3 1/2 TONS OF MARIJUANA SEIZED ON BEACH NEAR SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and local authorities have seized more than $51 million worth of 
Colombian marijuana and arrested seven suspects after they transferred 3 1/2 
tons of the drug from a sailboat to a Santa Barbara County beach, officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce H. Throckmorton, 41, of Ventura, whom federal agents believe to be the 
ringleader, was arrested after he used a shortwave radio early Sunday morning 
to direct the unloading from a hill overlooking the 52-foot sailboat north of 
Refugio State Beach, the authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The marijuana seizure, at 7,242 pounds the largest in Santa Barbara County 
history, came after the smugglers had loaded 129 bales into inflatable boats 
and hauled them ashore with a rope to be transferred to rented trucks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After launching flares to light the beach, about 50 officers took the men into 
custody, said Special Agent Ralph Lochridge of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.

FOES' SUIT URGES FURTHER TOLLWAY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A skeptical U.S. appeals court heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit by 
environmentalists seeking to force a key federal agency to further study a 
4.7-mile section of tollway that would cut through Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard Joel R. 
Reynolds, attorney for Laguna Greenbelt Inc., criticize an environmental study 
of the roadway and offer several alternatives to having the toll road cleave 
the environmentally sensitive canyon. But the concept was questioned by one of 
the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If alternatives are proposed, is there anything in the law that says they 
have to be considered?" Justice Alex Kozinski asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court is expected to issue a ruling later this year in the suit, 
which charges that a key federal agency performed an inadequate environmental 
study of the project before giving its approval to the current route, which 
runs 17 miles from San Juan Capistrano to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the disputed stretch in the canyon has been stalled for a year. A 
federal judge issued an injunction on construction in the canyon last September 
so both sides could argue the issue in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency and the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, which want to build the disputed link between 
Newport Coast Drive and El Toro Road, countered the environmentalists' charges, 
saying many alternatives were considered by the agency and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attorney John L. Flynn said much of the greenbelt surrounding the 
proposed road through Laguna Canyon would be targeted for development today had 
it not been created as part of the controversial tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of acres of this greenbelt would not be committed to open space" 
were it not for the toll road, Flynn said. Reynolds did not dispute that 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the Federal Highway Administration, the agency of the 
Transportation Department that approved the tollway, did not study the use of 
bridges, viaducts and tunnels as alternatives to leveling hills and filling in 
ravines in the canyon. However, Flynn said the tollway agency plans to build 78 
structures, including bridges and animal crossings, in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have offered to compromise if the tollway agency agrees to 
reduce the number of lanes cutting through the canyon from six to four. That 
would reduce environmental damage, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redesigning the project as a downsized facility would be beneficial, but 
there was never any discussion of it," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 But eliminating two lanes would defeat the purpose of the tollway, Flynn said. 
"That's simply not going to accommodate the volume of traffic required by (the 
project)."

PROBERS DOUBT THRUST REVERSERS CAUSED JET CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evidence recovered from the wreck of USAir Flight 427 cast doubt Tuesday on 
the theory that the jet crashed because its right engine was thrown into 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators determined the devices that engage an engine's thrust 
reversers were not deployed on the right side of the Boeing 737-300, suggesting 
the engine was operating normally. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices, called locking actuators, determine the position of other 
actuators that control the thrust reversers, a braking mechanism. The other 
actuators, found in the deployed position, now are believed to have shifted on 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Three possible scenarios leading to the crash will be tried out via computer: 
that the right engine reversed, it came loose, or spoilers -- wing flaps that 
act as air brakes -- were unevenly deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Haueter said the right engine's rear mount also was recovered and appeared to 
have been dislodged by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said investigators haven't 
ruled out any possible cause yet for Thursday's crash, which killed all 132 
aboard.

PART SUSPECTED IN USAIR CRASH HAD RAISED CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a year, the federal government has considered requiring airlines to 
install an additional safeguard on an engine part under suspicion in the crash 
of USAir Flight 427. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation Safety Board investigators suspect the thrust reverser 
on the Boeing 737's right engine may have been activated during Thursday's 
flight, throwing the plane into a dive and killing all 132 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators on Tuesday found a key engine mount piece among the wreckage 
near Pittsburgh, but the discovery didn't immediately rule out a theory that 
the crash might have been caused by an engine coming loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are looking at whether the plane's spoilers, used to 
control direction and slow a plane in flight, worked unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB is trying to mimic all three scenarios on computers. 
</P>

 Information from a data recorder indicated that both engines worked with equal 
thrust as the jet banked to the left and nose-dived into a ravine, said Carl 
Vogt, a NTSB member. Reversers would not affect the amount of power an engine 
is producing, only the direction.

EX-PRESIDENT OF UNITED WAY, 2 OTHERS FACE FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>

<P>
 The government charged the former president of United Way of America and two 
fellow executives with conspiracy, mail and tax fraud Tuesday, accusing them of 
lavishly spending the charity's money on vacations, real estate and air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The 71-count federal indictment named William Aramony, 67, president of United 
Way from 1970 until 1992; Stephen J. Paulachak, 49, a United Way executive from 
1971 to 1988; and Thomas J. Merlo, 63, chief financial officer of the charity 
from 1990 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversion of funds caused a shake-up at the national charity organization 
and depressed contributions to local United Way organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment said more than $1.5 million was diverted, with some of the 
money spent for purchase of a New York City apartment, a Coral Gables, Fla., 
condominium, a vacation to London and Egypt and a lifetime pass on American 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money went to Aramony's girlfriend, who was not named in the 
indictment, which was handed down by a federal grand jury and announced by the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment charged Aramony, Paulachak, Merlo and a spinoff company, 
Partnership Umbrella Inc., with conspiracy to defraud United Way, mail fraud, 
wire fraud, interstate transportation of fraudulently acquired property and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Aramony, Paulachak and Merlo were accused of filing false tax returns and 
Merlo was charged with perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter J. Bonner, Paulachak's lawyer, said: "Partnership Umbrella Inc. and Mr. 
Paulachak entertain no doubt, whatsoever, that following a trial . . . they 
will be found innocent . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hume, Merlo's lawyer, said his client "was a victim of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Aramony's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

PILOT HAD TRIED TO TALK FRIEND INTO JOINING HIM; CRASH: WOMAN DECLINED OFFER OF 
PLANE RIDE AFTER WATCHING HIM SPEND DAY DRINKING BEER. SHE SAYS HE ALSO WAS 
SMOKING CRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The evening before he crashed a light plane into the White House, Frank Corder 
sat in the doorway of a cheap motel room, trying to talk a new friend into 
going flying with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever been up in a plane?" Cindy Jianniney, 38, said he asked her. "I 
think I'm going to take my plane out tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Jianniney, a short, chubby woman with wings tattooed on her cleavage, rejected 
the offer. "The lord built my ass low to the ground and I think I'm going to 
keep it there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jianniney had spent the day shooting the breeze at Keyser's Motel here with 
Corder and watching as he drank beer after beer and disappeared several times 
into his room to smoke crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of times, she recalled Tuesday, he walked away from the dreary motel, 
saying that he was going to the store. She said that she suspected he was 
probably buying more crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, Corder called relatives to say, "I'm checking out for 
good," Jianniney said she was told by an investigator she spoke to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Corder stole a small plane from an airfield seven miles away and 
began the flight that ended in the crash that killed him at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 During Corder's last days, Jianniney and others recalled, he was depressed and 
desperate for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was stressed out," Jianniney said. "He did not have any more money. He 
needed more money for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 When she told him she was leaving about 7 p.m. Sunday, he begged her to spend 
the night, just to keep him company because he was so lonely. But she told him 
that if she did so, her boyfriend would never believe they were just friends. 
She promised to stop by later, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until Monday evening, when Secret Service agents knocked on the 
door of her apartment, that she learned what happened to Corder. Jianniney said 
Corder had suggested during the week that suicide was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had thought about killing himself but he didn't want to die alone 
in a hotel room," she said. "He wanted to be remembered. That's why he went out 
with such a bang." 
</P>
<P>
 Other people who were at the motel Sunday evening confirmed that Corder had 
appeared high on drugs and frequently went into his room, sometimes alone and 
sometimes with someone they said was a drug supplier, to smoke what they all 
thought was crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man who spent part of Sunday with Corder was Dave Wachter, who said 
Tuesday that he had biked from another motel three-quarters of a mile away to 
sell Corder marijuana on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachter, 24, said that he watched Corder smoking marijuana and crack cocaine. 
Corder wanted more drugs than he had money to pay for, Wachter said, so as 
collateral Corder gave him the keys to his Cadillac, his wallet and a 
television set that belonged to the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 A loner who withdrew from his family during binges with alcohol and drugs, 
Corder apparently spent most of his time during his last days depressed about 
his failed marriage and his bankrupt business. 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife asked him to leave their home three weeks earlier, he lived in 
his yellow Cadillac until he met Jianniney's boyfriend on Labor Day weekend. 
Jianniney and the boyfriend opened their home to him, and he spent several 
nights and days in their one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday she asked her employer and landlord, a woman whose holdings include 
Keyser's Motel, if she could give Corder a room. "He was very depressed," said 
owner Jackie Keyser. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder settled into a $500-a-month, 10-foot by 10-foot efficiency apartment, 
but paid Keyser just $25. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, Jianniney said, Corder was so desperate for drugs that he 
agreed to drive another woman -- a drug dealer and friend of his -- to 
Baltimore so he could get more crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend told Jianniney that she and Corder argued because she refused to 
let him smoke the crack until after he dropped her off in Aberdeen. He kicked 
her out of the car and she had to hitchhike home. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Corder's Cadillac broke down in Joppatowne, Md., about 15 miles 
from his motel, and he left the car there and hitchhiked home.

AS RAFT FLEET SHRINKS, U.S. AIMS AT CASTRO'S WEAKNESSES; CUBA: WASHINGTON URGES 
INCREASED CONTACTS. PROPOSAL COULD UNLEASH A WAVE OF CIVILIANS TO INFLUENCE 
PUBLIC OPINION AND FORCE POLICY CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Cubans switched their attention Tuesday from rafts to visas in ongoing bids 
to flee to the United States, the Clinton Administration deliberated new 
policies to undermine the flagging regime of President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an agreement with Washington, Havana belatedly moved Tuesday to 
prevent Cubans from taking to makeshift rafts for the treacherous 90-mile 
journey to Florida. For the first time, police patrolled the beaches to prevent 
rafters from taking off and to prevent potential migrants from bringing 
raft-making materials to the shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaches were bare and no arrests were reported, signaling that the crisis may 
be over, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 After intercepting 1,000 more Cubans on Sunday and 283 Monday, the U.S. Coast 
Guard reported picking up 134 rafters by Tuesday evening. Instead, hundreds 
pressing to leave Cuba for the United States flooded the U.S. Interests Section 
in Havana, drawn by the U.S.-Cuban agreement last week to increase American 
visas for Cubans to about 20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To heighten pressure on Cuba, the Administration wants to increase contacts 
and exchanges between the United States and the Cuban people, primarily by 
making it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba for educational, cultural, 
humanitarian or religious purposes, according to senior U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the proposal could end up doing to Castro what he tried to do to 
the United States -- unleash a wave of civilians to influence public opinion 
and force policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of reporters might visit Cuban journalists to discuss freedom of the 
press, for example, while religious organizations might visit their 
counterparts and other non-governmental charities could travel to Cuba to 
provide humanitarian goods or services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal seeks to use a section of the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act that 
imposes an economic embargo on the Cuban government but also encourages 
humanitarian assistance and exchange of information and ideas with Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 All Americans traveling to Cuba are required to get a license from the 
Treasury Department or face a penalty of up to $50,000. Defining who and what 
missions qualify for a Treasury license is at the top of a list of ideas and 
options to encourage stronger American contacts and exchanges with Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Cuban Democracy Act was passed, Washington has licensed $50-million 
worth of humanitarian goods provided by American groups directly to the Cuban 
people, according to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under consideration is allowing a Cuban press office to open in New York 
in exchange for the opening of a U.S. news operation in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacts between Cubans and Americans are likely to increase with an expected 
agreement on direct telephone links. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, expressing confidence that Cuba has now entered a 
final, transitional phase, said that they do not plan any major changes in 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration intends to hang particularly tough on any Cuban overtures 
to open talks on the embargo or on a return to normal relations, Administration 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is not to change the Aug. 20 sanctions or the embargo unless and 
until there are significant and irreversible changes in the area of democracy 
and respect for human rights. Then we can talk and take carefully calibrated 
actions," said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael Skol, who was the 
chief U.S. negotiator at the talks last week. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton ended commercial flights to Cuba and barred Cuban Americans 
from sending any money to relatives in Cuba on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. experts on Cuba said that the current worst-case scenario is that the 
chronic deterioration of life in Cuba will cause simmering tension on the 
island to erupt into violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have the big bang theory: after a change (of leadership in Cuba), 
we'll have relations. But the challenge is to avert a long, violent 
transition,' said Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs in the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should now be laying out a specific path for Cuba to overcome its crisis 
by creating real incentives for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. incentives should include a willingness to eventually withdraw from 
Guantanamo Bay, engage in confidence-building measures to reassure the Cuban 
military of U.S. intentions, gradually relax the U.S. economic embargo and, 
finally, ease Cuba's entry into the North America Free Trade Agreement.

ALL-OUT EFFORT URGED TO TURN YOUTHS AWAY FROM TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a report that will almost certainly bolster the growing momentum to 
regulate tobacco, the Institute of Medicine called Tuesday for an aggressive 
crackdown on cigarettes to keep the nation's young people from starting to 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, part of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, 
recommended a series of tough measures, including curbing tar and nicotine 
levels in cigarette content, increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes to 
$2, and changing the way tobacco products are packaged and promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, more than 1 million youths become regular smokers. They're taking 
an average of 15 years off their lives, and committing our health care system 
to at least $8.2 billion in extra medical costs over their lifetimes," said Dr. 
Paul R. Torrens, professor of health services administration at UCLA and 
chairman of the committee that wrote the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Academy of Sciences is an independent policy research 
organization established by Congress to advise the federal government on 
science, health and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The report immediately was praised by anti-smoking and public health groups 
and dismissed by the tobacco industry as a maneuver to help smoking foes in 
Congress and the Food and Drug Administration further their agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel called on Congress and the states to take action to eliminate 
advertising that encourages tobacco use among the young and urged parents to 
"clearly and unequivocally" express disapproval of tobacco use by their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also recommended banning tobacco vending machines and self-service 
displays, banning the distribution of free tobacco products in public places or 
through the mail and requiring merchants to obtain a state license to sell 
tobacco products.

D.C. EX-MAYOR BARRY IN STUNNING VICTORY; PRIMARIES: CANDIDATE OVERCOMES COCAINE 
CONVICTION TO WIN DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. VOTE SPLITS CAPITAL ALONG RACIAL, 
ECONOMIC LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a startling political comeback that could have national repercussions, 
Marion Barry on Tuesday overcame a highly publicized conviction and 
imprisonment for smoking crack cocaine to win the Democratic nomination for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, who mobilized younger and poorer black voters around his theme of 
redemption, defeated City Councilman John Ray and the incumbent mayor, Sharon 
Pratt Kelly, in a hard-fought race. 
</P>
<P>
 With 100% of the vote counted, Barry had 48%, Ray had 37% and Kelly trailed 
badly with only 13% of the electorate. Four other candidates accounted for the 
rest of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry recalled the "Amazing Grace" hymn to supporters: "I was lost, but now am 
found." He also said, "We, the people of Washington, D.C., moved many mountains 
. . . . The people of Washington have decided for themselves who they want to 
lead them." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Democratic nomination here traditionally provides an overwhelming 
advantage in the November election, Barry will be opposed in the fall balloting 
by William Lightfoot, an independent member of the City Council who could 
provide a strong challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, badly outnumbered in the district, nominated Carol Schwartz, who 
got 38% of the vote against Barry in a 1986 race. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, who served six months in federal prison after he was convicted of drug 
use in an FBI sting in 1990, was reelected to the City Council two years ago. 
His popularity stemmed from his participation in the civil rights struggles of 
the 1960s and his 12 years as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The election appeared to split the nation's capital along racial and economic 
lines, with the more affluent white and black neighborhoods voting heavily for 
Ray or Kelly while the poorest areas favored Barry by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
 In other elections on the busiest primary day of the season, voters in nine 
states chose candidates for the November election. Highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * New York. Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo easily won renomination, along with 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Republican George Pataki, easily overcoming minor 
opposition, was expected to be a tough Republican opponent for Cuomo, while 
Bernadette Castro won the right to challenge the heavily favored Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhode Island. State Sen. Myrth York defeated Gov. Bruce Sundlun in the 
Democratic gubernatorial primary, while former U.S. Atty. Lincoln Almond won 
the Republican race to oppose her. Patrick Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), easily won the Democratic nomination for a congressional 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maryland. Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) defeated token opposition to win 
renomination in his party primary. Parris Glendenning, a county executive in 
the Washington suburbs, won the nomination for governor and Kathleen Kennedy 
Townsend, a daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, won the Democratic nod for 
the lieutenant governor's post. Conservative Republican Ellen Sauerbray 
apparently upset favored Rep. Helen Bentley (R-Md.) in the GOP gubernatorial 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tough Republican Senate primary, former Tennessee Sen. Bill Brock held a 
slim lead over Ruthann Aron. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minnesota. In a closely watched race, Gov. Arne Carlson easily defeated a 
Christian conservative opponent, Allen Quist, who received the Republican 
Party's endorsement.

EX-D.C. MAYOR NEAR TIE IN PRIMARY RACE; ELECTIONS: MARION BARRY TRAILS LEADER 
BY A MERE 200 VOTES. NEW HAMPSHIRE GOV. STEVE MERRILL HANDILY DEFEATS TWO GOP 
CHALLENGERS.

<P>
 Former Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry, convicted of drug possession four 
years ago, was in a virtual dead heat in his reelection bid in early Democratic 
primary returns, local radio and television stations reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry was a mere 200 votes behind council member John Ray, both with 41% of 
the vote, with incumbent Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly trailing far behind. The 
Democratic nominee is usually assured of election in the heavily Democratic 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday marked the biggest hurdle in Barry's quixotic effort to win back the 
office he left when a 1990 arrest for smoking crack cocaine landed him in 
prison for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Hampshire, Gov. Steve Merrill handily defeated two GOP challengers 
Tuesday, while colleagues in Rhode Island and Minnesota faced stiffer tests in 
the year's busiest primary day. 
</P>
<P>
 There was voting in nine states, plus the nation's capital. For the winners, 
there was little time to celebrate, as Election Day is just eight weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake overall were lineups for eight gubernatorial elections, eight Senate 
races and 73 House seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun, who presided over a banking crisis and 
acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock, topped the list of incumbents at 
risk. State Sen. Myrth York led Sundlun in late polling. Providence television 
stations said their exit polling showed York would win overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among familiar names on the ballot was Patrick Kennedy, the son of the 
Massachusetts senator and favorite for a Democratic House nomination in Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson was favored in a contest that illustrated the 
fissure between Republican moderates like Carlson and Christian conservatives 
who are a growing power in the state. Carlson's opponent was former state 
lawmaker Allen Quist, a fierce opponent of abortion and homosexual rights who 
won the GOP nod over the sitting governor. 
</P>
<P>
 New Hampshire's Merrill will be heavily favored in November against Democratic 
state Sen. Wayne King and the winner of a Libertarian primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seeking a fourth term, had minor primary 
opposition from New Alliance Party leader Lenora Fulani, who ran for President 
in 1992. GOP leaders handpicked state Sen. George Pataki to oppose Cuomo, but 
Pataki first faced Richard Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont's Senate bid, state Sen. Jan Backus and Doug Costle, a former Jimmy 
Carter Administration official, waged a spirited race for the Democratic 
nomination to run against GOP Sen. Jim Jeffords. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns showed former Tennessee Sen. Bill Brock in a tight race with 
developer Ruthann Aron for the GOP Senate nomination in Maryland. Incumbent 
Democrat Paul S. Sarbanes crushed token primary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 As Republicans seek to gain seven seats and a Senate majority, the nine races 
without incumbents are major battles, and the fields for two of those were 
picked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minnesota, Rep. Rod Grams was favored in the Republican primary, while 
Democrats had a spirited two-way race. GOP Sen. David Durenberger is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Arizona, four Democrats sought the nomination for the seat being 
vacated by Sen. Dennis DeConcini. Rep. John Kyl was unopposed on the Republican 
side and favored in November.

 With encouragement from President Clinton, congressional Democratic leaders 
are initiating eleventh-hour discussions with their GOP counterparts to see if 
a modest first step toward health care reform can be salvaged before Congress 
goes home next month, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said. "We are 
going to explore that in both the House and in the Senate, Foley said.He did 
not detail the reforms he has in mind but references to "incremental" measures 
made by Foley generally have meant a series of limited insurance reforms that 
make it easier to buy coverage, especially for those who have some existing 
medical condition. But one influential GOP senator, Phil Gramm of Texas, said, 
"I think it's a bad idea to try to bring this debate back to life."

 A federal appeals court temporarily blocked the Clinton Administration from 
mandating the use of ethanol in gasoline as part of its effort to clean up auto 
emissions.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the 
Environmental Protection Agency may not have made a convincing case when it 
gave preference to ethanol as a gasoline additive in its renewable-fuels 
program. EPA officials said the requirements for cleaner-burning reformulated 
gasoline are still scheduled to go into effect in January, 1995, without the 
ethanol mandate. They said that other additives could be used to make the 
gasoline burn cleaner to improve air quality in line with the 1990 changes in 
the clean-air law.

 A federal judge sentenced former U.S. Treasurer Catalina V. Villalpando to 
four months in prison, rejecting a Justice Department recommendation that she 
be more severely punished for "lying" to get and keep her government position. 
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan also sentenced Villalpando, 54, who was 
treasurer in the George Bush Administration, to serve an additional four months 
under house arrest and to do 200 hours of community service for under-reporting 
her taxable income by $160,000, misleading government officials in the 
confirmation process and obstructing a federal probe to secure the treasurer's 
job.

CONROY WANTS POLL WATCHERS IN 69TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy said Tuesday that he wants "volunteer poll watchers" 
on Election Day at 21 voter precincts in the 69th Assembly District, where 
Republicans are accusing Democrats of committing voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even as the Orange Republican was devising plans to ensure voter 
integrity in the heavily minority Assembly district, Orange County election 
officials said that so far they have found no evidence of fraud among the 
roughly three dozen Democratic voters who were found by Republicans to have 
multiple registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Conroy vowed that the volunteers would not interfere with voters in 
the Nov. 8 election but would simply watch for possible voter fraud, Democrats 
angrily called the plan an attempt to intimidate Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats equated Conroy's plan to the 1988 incident in which Republicans 
posted uniformed security guards at Latino polling sites in what is now the 
69th Assembly District. As a result, Republicans eventually paid $400,000 to 
five Latino plaintiffs to settle a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69th Assembly District seat has been targeted by both Republicans and 
Democrats because it is the only one in Orange County now held by a Democrat. 
The incumbent, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), is vacating the seat to 
run for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Conroy and 10 other GOP legislators sent a letter to Orange County 
Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney, urging that by the end of the month he purge 
the names of those who are illegally registered to vote in the 69th District. 
The Republicans submitted more than three dozen examples of multiple voter 
registrations by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, a preliminary check of voter registrations has found no proof of 
the Republicans' allegation of voter fraud, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not one shred (of evidence) that anyone has ever tried to vote 
twice," Tanney said, emphasizing that his review was continuing and would be 
completed by the end of the week. Multiple voter registration listings have 
been corrected, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Also submitted by the Republicans were the names of dozens of Democratic 
voters who listed homeless shelters in Santa Ana as their residence. Although 
homeless citizens can vote, Republicans suspected that bogus names were 
registered at the shelters. Tanney said his office was just beginning to review 
that facet of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats at first accused the GOP of sour grapes because the Democrats now 
hold a 21-point voter registration lead over Republicans in the 69th District 
-- 55.6% to 34.7%. The district includes parts of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden 
Grove. Republicans, however, believe Democrats are inflating the registration 
numbers to help influence campaign fund-raising efforts in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Morrissey, the GOP candidate in the 69th District, said the Republicans' 
letter to Tanney alleging voter fraud, as well as Conroy's idea to post poll 
watchers, had not been discussed with his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrissey noted that in the past, both parties have routinely used poll 
watchers to keep track of who has voted and adjust their get-out-the-vote 
campaigns. He said that is how his campaign intends to work the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey downplayed the claim by Democrats that poll watchers intimidate 
voters. "I can't see how that could be true," he said. "If you are a legal 
voter, why should you worry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, who is determined to return the seat to Republicans, has taken up the 
voter fraud issue by calling particular attention to the large number of people 
who listed the two Santa Ana homeless shelters as their residence. 
</P>
<P>
 While he admitted that his plan is in the formative stages, he said he wants 
to post poll watchers at 21 out of 125 precincts in the district for a possible 
post-election challenge of the results and also to place county election 
officials on notice to watch for voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman said the presence of his poll watchers would not be a repeat 
of the 1988 poll guard episode, although he called that controversy "blown 
absolutely out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be anything like that at all. We will have true 
volunteers," Conroy said. "You will not even know they are around. There will 
not be anybody with uniforms on, nor will we be asking anybody whether they are 
legal to vote or not." 
</P>
<P>
 What the volunteers will be doing, Conroy said, is watching those who enter 
the polling place to make sure no one tries to vote more than once. Also, 
absentee ballots picked up on Election Day will be challenged to verify that 
the signatures on the ballots match those of the registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney said volunteers are allowed to watch the goings-on at polling places. 
But if a challenge is raised about a person's right to vote, it must be 
submitted in writing to the registrar and cannot be made to the voter or the 
election official at the polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are skeptical about Conroy's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can stand around and watch, but that's not what they did last time," 
said Rich Milner, a spokesman for Mike Metzler, the Democratic candidate in the 
69th District race. He added that Republicans are "inventing a (voter fraud) 
problem that's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's plan also drew an angry response from Orange County Democratic Party 
Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the same thing that happened before and we fought against it, and we 
will fight against it this time," Garcia said. "I don't care if they are in 
uniforms or Republican costumes. . . . It's not (Conroy's) place to direct 
(county election) workers." 
</P>
<P>
 California Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press warned that if there is a 
repeat of the 1988 poll guard incident, "we will sue (Conroy's) Republican 
backside all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's campaign manager, George Urch, said that "because Latinos are 
registered to vote, (Republicans) assume they are not citizens and they are 
trying to cheat the system. . . . You would think they would have learned from 
the poll guard thing, but obviously, they have not."

NEW CHURCH PROTEST LAW BRINGING QUICK DISSENSION; CIVIL RIGHTS: FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH AND WORSHIP CLASH IN LEGISLATION HIKING PENALTIES BACKED BY O.C. REV. 
SHELDON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Lou Sheldon figured he was stepping into the lion's den, but he 
didn't expect this. 
</P>
<P>
 The ubiquitous leader of the Orange County-based Traditional Values Coalition 
was preparing to deliver a talk one evening last September at a Baptist church 
in San Francisco when more than 100 gay rights activists descended on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly got ugly. The protesters, incensed by Sheldon's well-publicized 
attacks on the gay lifestyle, drowned out the service with shouts. A few tried 
to kick in a door. Others taunted parishioners through the windows. Riot police 
were called. Sheldon and the rest had to be ushered through the crowd by the 
armed officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismayed by the confrontation, and aware that similar protests have 
interrupted church services at Santa Ana's Calvary Chapel and other 
conservative Christian enclaves, Sheldon turned to a trusted friend in the 
Legislature for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? A new law authored by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
that doubles the penalty for disrupting a church service, making it punishable 
with up to a year in county jail. Protests at church services, Ferguson said, 
"tear into the very heart of an individual's freedom to worship." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's measure, signed recently by Gov. Pete Wilson, has continued to draw 
the ire of civil libertarians and gay rights supporters who are galled by what 
they consider preferential treatment being given to fundamentalist Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Political protests happen against all sorts of gatherings -- against abortion 
clinics, you name it," said Cathy Dreyfuss, legislative advocate for California 
Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "What Lou Sheldon and his bunch are saying is 
that they should be more protected against a demonstration than any other 
meeting. That's contrary to what America stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also question whether the measure, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will 
have a chilling effect on their freedom to dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of it will hold up in court," said Matthew Sharp, a 
spokesman for ACT-UP Golden Gate, a San Francisco-based gay rights group that 
deals mostly with the AIDS issue. "It's really too much, it's unfair, and it 
violates free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp conceded that some of the activists who protested Sheldon's appearance 
at Hamilton Square Baptist Church "got out of hand," but he said the outburst 
was a reaction to continued rhetorical assaults by the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing things their Scripture tells them not to do," Sharp said. 
"Their interpretation of life is that there's only one way to live. We've had 
to deal with a lack of compassion from these churches and their leaders. After 
a while, you get so frustrated and angry, you have to take it to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon, however, takes the same facts and gives them a decidedly different 
spin. Noting that politicians have been making strides to keep anti-abortion 
protesters from blocking family planning clinics, Sheldon suggests his new law 
is simply fair play in the nation's ongoing cultural war. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the pro-lifers can't block the abortion clinic, then homosexuals can't 
block the church," he said. "It's now a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that the demonstrators who interrupted his visit to San 
Francisco went well beyond First Amendment rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to stand in the street and yell would have been fine," he said. "But 
when they tried to break the doors down, when they smashed church property, 
when they laid down on the sidewalk, they blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon originally hoped for a law allowing prosecutors to charge church 
demonstrators with a felony punishable by several years in state prison. 
Ferguson, however, opted to press a softer approach for fear the bill would be 
killed right out of the chute by the Democrat-dominated Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law keeps church protests -- defined as willfully disturbing a 
religious gathering with profane discourse, rude or indecent behavior or 
unnecessary noise -- a misdemeanor, as it has been in California since 1872. 
But it doubled both the jail time and community service punishment. As an 
option to jail, a judge can order up to 80 hours of community service for a 
first offense and a maximum of 160 hours for a subsequent violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon said he is pleased with the law, although he still hopes the 
Legislature will go further in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take what you can get in this Legislature with (Assembly Speaker) Willie 
Brown and company in charge," Sheldon said. "Whatever you get is considered a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the toughened penalties in Ferguson's bill wouldn't have helped 
Sheldon last year in San Francisco. Despite a scene that Sheldon described as a 
"melee," there was only one reported arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon contends that the new law, along with public pressure, will prompt 
police to make more arrests the next time. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make his point, Sheldon held a demonstration of his own in San 
Francisco last November. Along with more than 400 other ministers, he marched 
from the Hamilton Square Baptist Church to a county Board of Supervisors 
meeting. Along the way, Sheldon and the ministers were confronted by gay rights 
activists, a few outfitted in Speedo swimsuits and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to City Hall, there were about 75 screaming, yelling, half-naked 
homosexuals," Sheldon recalled. "I gave my three minutes before the supervisors 
and the homosexuals went bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during his speech, a gay man strode up to Sheldon and spat on 
him. Sheldon pointed the man out to police and watched as officers dragged the 
assailant away. 
</P>
<P>
 Local news cameras and a video team from the Christian Broadcasting Network 
recorded it all. Supervisor Carole Migden, who is openly gay, later dismissed 
Sheldon's appearance as "a well-orchestrated publicity stunt."

TEACHERS BEGIN VOTING ON 8% PAY RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For new teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District, an 8% pay raise 
sounds generous. For veteran teachers, who suffered a stinging 10% pay cut two 
years ago, the offer is adequate at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, teachers throughout the Los Angeles Unified School 
District began voting Tuesday on whether to accept an 8% pay restoration or to 
strike next week. Union leaders have recommended that teachers accept the 
contract offer, crafted by a state mediator during three days of negotiations 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is walking around in a state of elation -- everyone is still very 
angry because of the pay cuts," said Marty Baer, the teachers union 
representative at Ranchito Avenue Elementary in Panorama City. "But I don't 
think we'd win a strike. It would not be the tactical thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings are similar throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers who took the 10% pay cut say they believe the district could 
afford to restore the full amount but that the current offer is the best they 
could get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do teachers feel we've won?" said Jeanne Spira, the union representative at 
Carson High School. "No, but we've made some progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The 28,000 members of United Teachers-Los Angeles will continue voting today, 
and results will be made public Thursday evening. UTLA leaders said they 
believe the contract will be approved by a substantial margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (union) Board of Directors has recommended that they accept it because 
it's the best possible offer we could get," said John Perez, a UTLA vice 
president. "That doesn't mean that I like it or that I think it's fair and 
just." 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings before most schools opened, UTLA President Helen Bernstein warned 
teachers that they had better be prepared to walk out and stay out if they vote 
to reject the offer. "It is a very difficult strike to win," Bernstein said. 
"We might as well get everything we can without going on strike and losing 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 While a 1989 teachers strike resulted in 8% raises each year for three years, 
Bernstein said she believes times have changed. "A strike is not always the 
answer," Bernstein said. "But the best way to avoid a strike is to prepare for 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 The union set up a "war room" where teachers from all parts of the city began 
strike preparations. In meetings attended by about 840 teachers last weekend, 
union officials said they discussed the possibility of a massive walkout next 
week if teachers reject the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the offer is accepted, however, Bernstein said teachers should be prepared 
to begin contract talks again -- soon. "Don't think I won't be back here 
telling you to get ready for a strike -- I will," she told teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 5,181 teachers whose salaries were not affected by the pay cut, the 
contract offer represents a significant boost in their wages. These teachers, 
along with others who have worked for the district less than a decade, also 
receive salary step advances and pay increases for advanced education units. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very pleasant for the new teachers -- they've never experienced 
having anything taken away from them," said Cliff Harris, the union 
representative at Maclay Middle School in Pacoima. "But for the teachers who 
have been here a long time, they're still working in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Crowell, the union leader at San Fernando High, said he voted to strike 
because he believes the money is available in the school district's 
$4.5-billion budget to repay teachers the full amount. "I think a strike would 
let the community, the district and everyone know that teachers are very, very 
discouraged," Crowell said. "I think most teachers -- me included -- have just 
had it. We're just tired of being last in priority." But district officials and 
Board of Education members say they could not afford to reimburse teachers the 
full 10% cut from their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think . . . this is the best proposal possible under the circumstances," 
said Mark Slavkin, the Board of Education president. "I'm hopeful teachers will 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson agreed. "We are committed to restore fully the salary 
reductions made two years ago, and the 8% restoration represents a significant 
step in that direction," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said he believes the district and the union scrutinized the district's 
finances and both sides agreed that the current offer is the highest possible. 
But Slavkin acknowledged that some teachers still believe more money is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the district has not had the highest credibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer, good for one year, was crafted by a state mediator after three 
weeks of labor talks failed to produce a settlement. The district's first 
offer, presented to teachers nearly a month ago, called for a 7% increase -- 3% 
this year and 4% that would carry over to next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But union leaders, who hired an accounting firm to comb through the district's 
books, rejected that proposal. They said it would be a guaranteed strike and 
that the district was holding back money and promises of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the majority of teachers probably will accept the offer, they certainly 
aren't pleased with it. And some said they simply couldn't afford to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is, 'Let's get on with it,' " said Harris of Maclay Middle 
School. "We'll probably be at this again in another few months."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON JOINED BY BENNETT AT BIG O.C. 
FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, the former education secretary who has been an 
intellectual godfather to Mike Huffington's U.S. Senate campaign, joined the 
Republican candidate Tuesday for a fund-raiser and a panel discussion about 
social values. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's best-selling "Book of Virtues" was the subject of Huffington's first 
television commercial of the campaign and he is a leading advocate in 
Washington for ending government welfare, a proposal Huffington has described 
as the central theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, before attending a fund-raiser in Orange County that was the 
largest in the Huffington campaign so far, Bennett and others joined a seminar 
staged by Huffington that sought to contrast the conservative and liberal 
visions of poverty and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that government welfare has fueled the nation's burgeoning social 
problems and that community volunteers and private groups must assume more 
responsibility for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supporters of the welfare state seem to talk like they have a monopoly on 
compassion," Bennett said. "Well, they don't. The measure of real compassion is 
to make that sacrifice (of time or money). The cynical approach is to write the 
(government) check." 
</P>
<P>
 The event at the Biltmore Hotel was billed as "an attempt to supplement the 
sound bites and TV commercials" that have been the primary vehicle for 
political campaigns, particularly Huffington's generously self-financed effort 
to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 At heart, the panel was more political than academic. Huffington campaign 
crews filmed the event for a future commercial. The supportive audience of 
about 30 people was gleaned largely from Republican groups. 
</P>
<P>
 During the discussion, Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, 
shed little light on some of the questions raised by critics, who doubt that 
private sources are willing to or can afford to support the nation's indigent. 
Much of the discussion also focused more on a description of the problems than 
on how a public-to-private transition might work. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare is "just giving somebody a check and telling them to go home, be quiet 
and don't bother us," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington officials said the panel was the first of three such events -- all 
exploring the welfare theme -- they hope to stage during the campaign. They 
believe the welfare issue is fertile political ground, as evidenced by the 
attention it has received from other politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Both President Clinton and former Vice President Dan Quayle gave major 
speeches recently about moral values and related government policy that 
substantially overlapped the message in Huffington's campaign. All three men 
say a lack of individual responsibility, inattention to values and 
out-of-wedlock births are among the major contributors to America's social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 After the morning seminar, Bennett also helped Huffington by attending a 
fund-raiser in Orange County. With an audience of more than 400, it was the 
largest fund-raiser Huffington has held in a political campaign that he has 
financed almost entirely from his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most candidates, particularly Feinstein, Huffington has spared little 
time in his campaign for private fund-raisers. But he has two other big-name 
Republican events on the schedule, one Friday with former Housing Secretary 
Jack Kemp and another next month with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Huffington campaign funds are still expected to come from 
the candidate. But a spokeswoman said Tuesday the fund-raisers are a needed 
supplement.

MAN STABBED IN O.C. SCHOOL PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified man was stabbed with a screwdriver and critically injured 
Tuesday on the grounds of Western High School in the 500 block of South Western 
Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing took place just before 3 p.m. on a school parking lot, according 
to Sgt. Steve Rodig, while the man sat in a car waiting for friends to get out 
of class. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man approached the car and stabbed the victim and then fled. The 
wounded man, who was not a student or faculty member, left the car and ran a 
short distance before collapsing.

James Carville and Mary Matalin was garbled because of a production error. The

that says, 'Will bicker for food.' "
