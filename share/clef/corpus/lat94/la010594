BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; TRAPPED IN A CRUMBLING WORLD OF PASSION AND BETRAYAL; 
THE CROCODILE BIRD BY RUTH RENDELL , CROWN, $20, 352 PAGES

 "The Crocodile Bird" starts with a beguiling first line -- "The world began to 
fall apart at nine in the evening" -- and, within a dozen pages or so, we are 
drawn into an elaborate labyrinth where seduction and betrayal, rape and murder 
are to be glimpsed in every dark corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guide through the maze is young Liza Beck, not yet 17, whom we first 
encounter as she is thrust out of a fairy-tale setting where she has been 
raised by her mother, Eve. Their home had been the gatehouse of Shrove House, a 
stately old manor in the English countryside, but now her mother is waiting to 
be arrested and Liza is on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "She saw herself lost as she sometimes was in dreams," author Ruth Rendell 
writes of the bewildered Liza. "Those were the kind of dreams she had, of 
wandering abandoned in a strange place, and weren't all places strange to her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only one place is not strange to Liza -- although it strikes us as an 
exceedingly odd and scary place -- and that is Shrove House. In a real sense, 
Shrove is the centerpiece of "The Crocodile Bird," a place "as immovable as the 
landscape in which it rested, as natural and as serene," and yet a place that 
is the scene of heartbreak and horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrove gives up its secrets, one by one, as Liza tells the story of her 
troubled life to an unschooled but gentle young vagabond named Sean. It is Sean 
who rescues her from the crumbling world of Shrove House -- and it is through 
Sean's love affair with Liza that the darker mysteries come into view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know ," Liza tells Sean, "but I don't think there've been many lives 
like mine." 
</P>
<P>
 As Rendell draws us ever deeper into Liza's curious childhood -- and shows us 
the ever stranger things that happen at Shrove House -- we are allowed to see 
how the world appears to a girl who reads the brooding poetry of Matthew Arnold 
at the age of 7 but does without school, playmates, indoor plumbing and a 
telephone or a television. 
</P>
<P>
 We see, too, that Liza is locked in an orbit around Eve, her loving but 
afflicted mother, a guardian who is also a kind of jailer. Eve is pure 
enchantment to her young daughter, and we soon realize that Eve is enchanting 
to rather too many men, and the wrong kind of men, but not enchanting enough to 
the one man who counted, the lord of the manor, Jonathan Tobias. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a bit of a devil, you know, Eve," says Mr. Tobias, "and you know how 
to drive a man." 
</P>
<P>
 And, still more ominously, we understand how Liza experiences the passion that 
flashes and thunders through the adult world, even in a place as isolated and 
idyllic as Shrove. Indeed, Rendell gives us the shocking experience of seeing 
what a failed rape and a successful murder look like through the eyes of a 
precocious but sheltered 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Liza realizes that Shrove matters more to her mother than the love 
of a mere mortal, whether it is Jonathan Tobias or her own daughter. Sean 
speaks aloud what we have already asked ourselves: How can Eve leave young Liza 
locked up alone in the library at Shrove when she goes marketing in the village 
eight miles away? "You might have hurt yourself," says Sean, "or the place 
(might have) caught on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Liza has a chilling answer. She "thought but didn't say that the place burning 
down would have been a bigger tragedy for Eve," Rendell explains. "Shrove on 
fire would be worse than Liza dying in it." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it turns out, Shrove is on fire, at least in a metaphorical sense, 
with Eve's passion, Eve's bitter rage, Eve's madness. The same fire burns in 
Liza, too, and we fear that it will consume her as it consumed her mother. By 
the end of "The Crocodile Bird," the curse has come full circle -- and we are 
not quite sure until the very last page whether Liza, like Eve, will go up in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose "The Crocodile Bird" can be described as a contemporary Gothic 
novel, but it is very much an updated and upscale Gothic. Rendell tells her 
story with such elegance and restraint, with such a literate voice and an 
insightful mind, that her book transcends the mystery genre and achieves 
something almost sublime.

 Goodman Plays Louisiana Legend: "Roseanne" star John Goodman will play Huey 
Long in a TNT cable movie about the populist governor and U.S. senator. The 
film about Long, who was assassinated in 1935, is being written by "Peyton 
Place" producer Paul Monash, who also wrote an Emmy-winning screenplay about 
Josef Stalin. "Huey Long" will air sometime in 1994, TNT said. Filming is 
expected to begin in the Baton Rouge, La., area this spring after production on 
"Roseanne" wraps for the season.

 Corbin to Return in a Cast: A broken foot won't keep Barry Corbin off the set 
of "Northern Exposure." The actor, who plays ex-astronaut Maurice Minnifield in 
the CBS series, plans to return to work in Roslyn, Wash., next week. He was 
injured two weeks ago when a horse fell on him at his ranch and is still 
recovering from surgery to repair a broken foot and ankle. With the actor's leg 
in a cast, Minnifield is "going to be a little bit hampered, a little bit 
physically challenged," Corbin told Seattle's KIRO-TV. But producers haven't 
been specific about changes in his role, he said. ARTS

 American Import Sets French Record: A show of French Impressionist 
masterpieces borrowed from an American foundation has become the most popular 
art exhibition in French history. The national museums agency says that about 
1.5 million people visited Paris' Musee d'Orsay between Sept. 8 and Sunday to 
see 72 paintings from the collection of the late Albert Barnes, who purchased 
the works seven decades ago. Barnes, who died in 1951, set up a private art 
foundation in 1925 and stipulated that his collection never leave its home in 
Merion, Pa. But badly needed renovations forced the foundation to lend the 
paintings to raise $8 million, and the works have been since shown in 
Washington, Philadelphia, Paris and Tokyo. The Barnes exhibition topped the 
previous French record of 1.2 million visitors for the six-month 1967 show of 
ancient Egyptian treasures at the Louvre Museum. POP/ROCK

 No Divisiveness Needed, John Says: Pop singer Elton John responded Tuesday to 
criticism from Los Angeles' AIDS Healthcare Foundation stemming from his 
Atlanta-based Elton John AIDS Foundation's decision to hold a Los Angeles 
fund-raiser on Oscar night, the same night as the Los Angeles group's annual 
fund-raiser. "At this time, the last thing the AIDS community needs is 
divisiveness," said John, who was accused of trying to "steal the thunder" of 
the local group's fund-raising efforts. In a statement, John's foundation noted 
that "instead of detracting from AHF's efforts, we choose to believe that we 
are supplementing their efforts in helping to raise funds and awareness for the 
AIDS crisis." The group also said it "in no way could detract from AHF's 
longtime supporters" since its exclusive party is limited to 150 invited 
guests.

 Pickett Starts His Jail Sentence: Soul singer Wilson Pickett is just another 
inmate in New Jersey's Bergen County Jail. "Contrary to his popularity as a 
singer, he's just another number here," said Sheriff Jack Terhune. "He will be 
treated like everyone else." On Monday, Pickett began serving a yearlong 
sentence for drunken driving and assault by an auto for striking a pedestrian 
in 1992. As part of his sentence, he completed an in-patient alcohol 
rehabilitation program before reporting to jail. Pickett, known for such songs 
as "In the Midnight Hour" and "Mustang Sally," has a previous drunken driving 
conviction. MOVIES

TV REVIEW; DENNEHY POWERS THE DRAMA IN 'BIRDLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hardly news when a TV series emphasizes character over plot. It is 
unusual when that character is someone with whom you welcome spending an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with Brian Dennehy's maverick shrink in "Birdland," which 
premieres at 10 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).  
</P>
<P>
 Constantly exasperated, psychiatrist Brian McKenzie grouses about the 
bureaucracy at the Oakland hospital where he works, devising creative ways to 
circumvent it. His activities are nothing if not varied. He spends his coffee 
breaks at the racetrack, many of his evenings in bed with a fellow doctor 
(Lindsay Frost) and much of his work time being a sort of healer-detective. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere's mystery centers on a disturbed 16-year-old boy's possible 
involvement in the death of a teen-age girl. In a curious way, the divorced 
McKenzie finds communication with his patient easier than with his own son, a 
street musician. 
</P>
<P>
 More arresting than the story is Dennehy's good work as this life-scarred 
protagonist, an interesting man who appears more adept at mending others than 
himself. Dennehy, who in the past has earned plaudits for playing characters 
ranging from tough to homicidal, is very persuasive here as someone consisting 
of equal parts strength and vulnerability. It's clear that he could use some 
time on the couch himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, "Birdland" lightens his load with humor. This includes an obsessive 
patient who sits transfixed in front of a TV set watching "Regis & Kathie Lee," 
all the while feeding the bubbly co-host questions for her guests as if he were 
in the studio with her. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is whether he was previously psychotic or got this way from 
watching "Regis & Kathie Lee."

PLAN OFFERED TO BOLSTER PARAMEDICS; SERVICES: FIRE CHIEF PROPOSES THAT PRIVATE 
FIRMS BE HIRED TO HANDLE NON-EMERGENCY MEDICAL CALLS. GOALS INCLUDE SAVING 
MONEY AND REDUCING AMBULANCE RESPONSE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To free paramedic units for more urgent needs, Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald 
O. Manning proposed a plan Tuesday to hire private firms -- and perhaps use 
trained volunteers -- to handle non-emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Roger Gillis, the department's community liaison officer, said 
the department estimated it could save $6 million in the first year and about 
$2.8 million in succeeding years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we take away or remove a service, we're not happy about it," Gillis 
said. "The other side of that is that what we're hoping to offer is a 
quicker,better, faster service to calls we know are emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning outlined the proposal Tuesday to the Board of Fire Commissioners, 
Gillis said. A written proposal will be submitted to the board within 30 days, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was developed at the direction of the office of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, who campaigned on a platform of contracting out some city services to 
private companies to increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings would immediately place 78 firefighters -- now assigned to 
lower-echelon emergency medical service -- back on fire engines and decrease 
response times for the 52 remaining ambulance units staffed by qualified 
paramedics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60,000 of the department's 317,000 calls last year were for 
non-emergency complaints such as "stubbed toes, stomachaches, even broken 
limbs," which could be handled by private ambulance companies, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is adopted, paramedics or firefighters with emergency 
medical-technician training would be dispatched whenever the nature of the 
injuries is unclear, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the average response time for a Fire Department emergency medical 
vehicle is 4 1/2 to 6 minutes, Gillis said, acknowledging that service to 
mountainous or outlying areas takes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been informal discussions among department administrators of 
training resident volunteers in large apartment complexes to assist in 
non-emergency calls, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, based on a pilot program using private ambulance companies, was 
tested in the San Fernando Valley between January and August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the concerns raised by Gillis is identifying private ambulance 
companies that could promise response times comparable to those required by the 
Fire Department. Another sticking point may be that private companies may not 
be eager to service poor areas of the city, where bills for emergency services 
often are not paid, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is made necessary by dwindling department resources since the passage 
of Proposition 13 in 1979, which cut property tax revenue to municipalities 
across the state, Gillis said. Since then, fire calls have doubled but the 
number of firefighters has increased only 17.8%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's comments were made at a regular meeting of the five-member Board of 
Fire Commissioners. David W. Fleming, vice president of the commission, said he 
favors exploring the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the mayor wants to raise both police and fire salaries next year, and 
that would free up some dollars to do that," Fleming said.

NEW HOPE FOR GERONIMO PRATT; LEGAL SYSTEM: THE FORMER BLACK PANTHER HAS SPENT 
22 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A MURDER HE SAYS HE DIDN'T COMMIT. NOW A CRUSADING LAY 
MINISTER HAS PERSUADED PROSECUTORS TO RE-EXAMINE THE CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 He has tried for parole 12 times -- and been denied. Amnesty International has 
tried to win him a new trial. Political luminaries and even one of the jurors 
who convicted him say he deserves another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt's best hope for freedom may have finally arrived in 
the person of a crusading clergyman who specializes in exonerating the 
"convicted innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lay minister Jim McCloskey is behind this week's decision by the Los Angeles 
County district attorney to re-examine a case against the former Black Panther 
Party leader, who has been imprisoned 22 years for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey, whose New Jersey-based Centurion Ministries acts as a private 
detective service in selected death penalty and life sentence cases, has 
conducted his own investigation into the case against Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detailed report turned over to Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, McCloskey said 
he became convinced that Pratt had nothing whatsoever to do with killing 
Carolyn Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court and wounding her husband in 1968 
during an $18 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, 46, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, is serving a life sentence for the 
slaying, but has always maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Garcetti's office confirmed that the Pratt case is under review as 
a result of new evidence, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to McCloskey, Garcetti has been urged in recent months to review 
the case by one of the jurors who convicted Pratt, as well as by U.S. Reps. 
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), Don Edwards (D-San Jose) and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, other individuals and organizations, including the human 
rights group Amnesty International, have called for a new trial for Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been little response from authorities until McCloskey entered the 
picture with his 13-year-old Centurion Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry gained national attention in 1992, when McCloskey's work freed 
Clarence Chance and Benny Powell, two Los Angeles men who were wrongfully 
convicted of the murder of a sheriff's deputy and spent 17 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey also is credited with freeing 10 other convicted people around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 He told The Times last week that he recently met with Los Angeles prosecutors 
about the Pratt case, which has been in and out of the court system for nearly 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals have been consistently denied and attempts to get the case reopened on 
the grounds that key evidence was not presented at Pratt's trial have been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, who spent his first eight years in prison in solitary confinement -- 
illegally, a jury later determined -- was denied parole for the 12th time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Hanlon, a San Francisco lawyer who has represented Pratt for 15 years 
and who contacted McCloskey after learning of the Chance and Powell case, said 
McCloskey's findings are significant given other evidence that has been 
unearthed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new evidence, he said, further discredits the prosecution's main witness 
and provides other suspects for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon said he is heartened by the new review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt arrived in Los Angeles from his native Louisiana three months before the 
Olsen shooting. At the time, he was a 21-year-old recruit in the Los Angeles 
branch of the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, when he was arrested in the Olsen slaying, he had moved up the party 
ranks and was an official of a faction headed by Eldridge Cleaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt has insisted for years that he was a victim of COINTELPRO, a 
controversial FBI program that was designed to covertly disrupt and create 
dissension within politically radical groups of the 1960s and '70s, such as the 
Black Panthers. Critics of the program also have also accused it of using 
unethical tactics to undermine the credibility of prominent radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt maintains that he was in Oakland at the time of the Santa Monica 
shooting, which McCloskey and Hanlon say is confirmed by lawyers who say they 
have seen FBI wiretap transcripts of a call Pratt made from Oakland three hours 
before Olsen was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prominent former Black Panthers, including Bobby Seale and David 
Hilliard, have recently signed affidavits saying Pratt was in Oakland at the 
time of the murder. Seale and Hilliard were feuding with Pratt in 1972 and 
would not testify on his behalf at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hanlon, the most significant pieces of new evidence uncovered by 
McCloskey are affidavits from four people who say two other men, now dead, 
confessed to them that they had killed Olsen and wounded her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey's report also includes FBI memos saying the key witness against 
Pratt, a former sheriff's deputy turned Panther named Julius Butler, was 
providing information to the agency before he accused Pratt of the Olsen 
killing. That was withheld from Pratt's defense lawyer and the jury in the 
case, McCloskey contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is currently an official of the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church in Los Angeles and did not return several calls to his church office. 
During Pratt's trial, Butler strongly denied cooperating with the FBI, but 
documents made public by the agency in the early 1980s indicate that he 
provided information. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey also obtained statements from two former police officers who say 
Butler had contact with the FBI for months before he accused Pratt of the Olsen 
killing. "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the jury would never 
have convicted Mr. Pratt had we known any of these facts," Hamilton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard Kalustian, who as a deputy district attorney was 
Pratt's chief prosecutor, would not comment Tuesday, saying he had no facts 
upon which to base a statement.

$1.2 MILLION FOR MAN NOT TOLD OF DANGER; LAWSUITS: COUNCIL PANEL URGES 
SETTLEMENT AWARD FOR A FORMER THEATER MANAGER WHO WAS A WITNESS IN A ROBBERY 
CASE. THE MAN WAS SHOT AFTER POLICE FAILED TO WARN HIM OF A DEATH THREAT. 
</P>

<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee recommended a $1.2-million award Tuesday 
for a North Hollywood theater manager who was shot after police learned about 
threats against the man but failed to alert him to the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Budget and Finance Committee voted unanimously to award the 
settlement to George Carpenter, 45, who now lives in Ohio and is recovering 
from four gunshot wounds that left him with facial nerve damage and other 
physical and psychological injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a horrendous story and a horrendous case," Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the city's Budget and Finance Committee, said after 
voting for the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter witnessed a robbery at his theater in 1984 and was expected to 
testify against the suspect. Police had assured Carpenter that he was in no 
danger, but they later learned that the suspect had tried to solicit a contract 
hit on him. However, police did not relay that information to Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Second District Court of Appeals found the city liable for 
Carpenter's injuries and in the process gave police officials more 
responsibility for warning witnesses about threats they face for testifying in 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the vote on Carpenter's settlement, Yaroslavsky instructed the Los 
Angeles Police Department to draft a report within 60 days outlining the steps 
the department takes to notify potential witnesses about such threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky also expressed concern that six months remain in the fiscal year 
and nearly 80% of the city's $37-million liability fund has been spent. Only $8 
million remains. "This is modestly alarming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's troubles began in October, 1984, when Daniel S. Jenkins robbed him 
at gunpoint at the United Artists movie theater that he managed. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, 1985, Carpenter was shot in the face, stomach and legs as he sat in 
a bar next to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, on Halloween night, Los Angeles Police Detective Thomas C. 
Williams was shot and killed in an ambush outside a Canoga Park church school 
just a few hours after testifying against Jenkins in his robbery and assault 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Jenkins was convicted of the shooting death of Williams and the 
attempted murder of Carpenter and is on death row. 
</P>
<P>
 A police investigation into Williams' murder determined that three months 
before Carpenter was shot, two officers had interviewed an informant in the Los 
Angeles County Jail who told them that Jenkins had been soliciting a contract 
hit on Carpenter, according to a city attorney's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators passed the information on to an officer in the LAPD's North 
Hollywood Division, the report said, but the warning was never passed on to 
Williams or Carpenter. The North Hollywood officer has denied receiving the 
warning, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court found that the Police Department had a special obligation 
to notify Carpenter of the contract hit because Williams had previously told 
Carpenter that he was in no danger from Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We conclude that a witness in a criminal prosecution, who had been assured 
that the defendant posed no real danger to him, enjoyed a special relationship 
with the city through its police department, such that the city owed the 
appellant a duty of care," according to the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Assistant City Atty. Thomas C. Hokinson said that the court ruling and 
the budget committee's recommendation to award Carpenter the settlement do not 
mean that police officers are now always obligated to notify witnesses of 
perceived threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police assure a criminal witness that there is no danger and then 
learn of a threat, Hokinson said, they must relay that threat to the witness.

SAMSONS IN THEIR 70S; HEALTH: AGE DOESN'T STOP A WORKOUT-LOVING GROUP OF SENIOR 
CITIZENS. 'WE WANT TO BE ROLE MODELS,' ONE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A lean woman in a purple bra top and black spandex shorts studied her body in 
a mirrored wall as she walked across the gym floor, too busy admiring her own 
reflection to notice the slight man with thick black-rimmed glasses sitting on 
a weight bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this chrome-and-carpeted mecca of buns of steel and bulging biceps, 
Bill Reale is a standout. He is not, to borrow from gym lingo, buff. And he 
probably would be a bit awkward in a hip-hop aerobics class. But when it comes 
to lifting 40-pound barbells with his teeth, Bill Reale is your man. Even if he 
is 97 and only a third of those teeth are really his. 
</P>
<P>
 Reale is the oldest member of an iron-pumping, treadmill-pounding group that 
calls itself the Samson Seventies Strongmen. The fitness enthusiasts, a few 
dozen men and one woman from the San Fernando and Antelope valleys, consider 
themselves walking billboards for the benefits of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the group came when Theo Hasapes' daughters urged him years ago 
to start the samson Sixties Strongmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many strong people in their 60s. I'll wait till I'm 70," Hasapes, 
now 73, told them. "That's when you separate the men from the boys. It's like 
putting 200,000 miles on your car. Some part is going to break down." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, the Strongmen have become more than just a 
weightlifting club. They take a weightlifting vaudeville act to nursing homes, 
county fairs, even high schools to show that exercise can mean the difference 
between, for instance, spending their golden years on a couch watching "I Love 
Lucy" reruns and having the energy to take up a sport or start a second career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be role models," Hasapes said. "Most adults -- seniors -- are 
couch potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this gang. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Chris Christiansen, 70, who became the first female Strongman. The 
Woodland Hills resident plays tennis every day and golfs when she can fit it 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can stand on my head if I have to and I jump rope. I do all sports," she 
said, with the accent she brought with her when she emigrated from Austria in 
the 1940s. "There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger. Maybe I can become a Chris 
Christiansenegger." 
</P>
<P>
 As Christiansen spoke, Tom Gumpper, an aspiring actor who will turn 74 in 
March, grimaced a bit as he squeezed the last few crunches in a set of 100 
sit-ups, one of five sets he does every other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Douglas works out for 2 1/2 hours every day in the sprawling Racquetworld 
gym in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise, as far as I'm concerned, is a physical and psychological way of 
living," said the 74-year-old. "It's not just lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to be able to come here and stack that machine," he said, motioning to 
a machine with a set of weights totaling 250 pounds, "it gives me a 
psychological uplift. It makes me feel good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 It also intimidates some of the relative youngsters around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many young fellows don't like to work out with me," he said shyly. 
</P>
<P>
 For 79-year-old Ben Stone of Sherman Oaks, exercise has been a lifelong 
commitment. Stone, who tried out for the Olympic diving team in 1934, swims 
laps and lifts weights three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired seven years ago. "Usually, when people retire in their 70s, they 
sit around," he said. "They get old in no time. You've got to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more physical activity that people get, the lower their mortality rates, 
particularly from coronary heart disease," said Dr. Jerome Fleg, senior 
investigator with the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleg, whose research focuses primarily on aged but highly trained endurance 
athletes, said many of the Samson members probably can thank genetics in part 
for their abilities. "They are the pinnacle of what can be achieved at an older 
age," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been a growing emphasis nationwide on weight training for older 
people to increase their strength and ensure their mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current gospel is that older people can benefit at least as much as young 
people, maybe more, because they are less strong and less aerobically 
conditioned to start with, so there's more room for improvement," said Dr. 
David H. Solomon, director of the UCLA Center on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Hasapes' gospel when the troupe hits the nursing home circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a physically unfit nation, seniors especially -- they rely on 
medication and so forth," he said. "If you don't move your blood, circulate 
that blood, you're going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dick Sondel travels with the group, his isn't a tale of staying young, 
it's of staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, Sondel is a "junior affiliate member" of the Strongmen whose doctor 
told him 16 years ago, "Get your house in order" because he had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be dead statistically," the Calabasas resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondel believes lifting weights and playing full-court basketball has given 
him the physical strength to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being mean helps too," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BOY'S 
LAWYER SEEKS PHOTOS OF MICHAEL JACKSON'S BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney representing a 13-year-old boy who claims he was molested by 
Michael Jackson filed court documents Tuesday in an effort to obtain 
photographs of the entertainer's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Jackson submitted to a body search by investigators seeking 
evidence to corroborate the boy's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the fact that my client can establish what Mr. Jackson looks 
like naked is very substantial evidence of Mr. Jackson's guilt," said Larry 
Feldman, the boy's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he filed a motion in court that is a "multiple choice" request: 
Jackson may provide copies of the police photographs, submit to a second 
search, or the court may bar the photographs from the civil trial as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he has asked Jackson's attorneys and the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office for copies, but they refused.

 40 hoofs: We hated to see 1993 end with an unsolved mystery on our hands -- 
the meaning of a 10 COWS license plate spotted on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been solved by Stu Perom of Westlake Village, who bought the plate 
for his wife, Nadine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perom says the phrase refers to an old tale of a rich man who, seeking a wife, 
chooses a farmer's most plain daughter -- and even offers 10 cows for her when 
the going rate for beautiful maidens is just two bovines. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the happy couple returns to the village and everyone gathers, 
Perom says, "to see what a 10-cow wife looks like." And everyone agrees what a 
"beautiful and charming woman" she is. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral, Perom says, is that, "If you treat your wife like she is a 10-cow 
wife, she surely will become one." He added: "Luckily, my wife started out as a 
10-cow wife." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 12 negligees: Jay Olins, the reader who told us about that 10 COW plate, 
suggested that this column begin a contest in which readers try to guess the 
origins of unusual plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Inasmuch as Olins guessed that the 10-cow phrase referred to the price of a 
bride, we have plucked a prize for him from our Cave of Wonders -- the 1994 
Frederick's of Hollywood calendar, which features several multi-cow models. 
It's our way of thanking Olins. Besides, Mrs. Only In L.A. won't let us bring 
it home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One more question: And now, up pops another mystery. Howard Cohen of North 
Hills isn't sure what the Prudential Insurance Co. had in mind when it sent the 
letter shown at right to his father, who is not Chinese. We could understand 
the error if his father's name was Genghis Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 '93 matters: Sports Illustrated, citing "93 things that went right in '93," 
listed as No. 4 the fact that "The Three Thousand Stooges, also known as 
British soccer hooligans, will not be making an appearance in the U.S." this 
summer. England has been eliminated from the World Cup, whose finals will be 
held in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, we wonder if SI will hear from the same fellow we did when we 
used the phrase "British soccer hooligans" a while back. The thugs are 
"English," noted the caller, who was a Scot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers ranked No. 29 on the magazine's list, for not "being content at 
having deserted Brooklyn baseball fans after the '57 season, (they) brazenly 
sued the Brooklyn Dodger Sports Bar and Restaurant for trademark infringement." 
A federal judge ruled in favor of Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still a bunch of bums," the magazine said of the Dodgers. But that's better 
than being called hooligans. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two bits: Roxane Winkler of Sherman Oaks doesn't begrudge would-be actors and 
actresses the chance to make a little money between jobs by waiting on tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after "another experience at a cafe where the waiter served up lots of 
attitude but little else (no water, no coffee refill, no bread, etc.)," Winkler 
wonders why the star-to-be can't put on an Academy Award performance and "act 
like a waiter." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Some eateries try to lure customers with their decor, but not Tommy's Original 
World Famous Hamburgers, which opened its first stand nearly half a century ago 
on Beverly Boulevard. The slogan of Tommy's is: "Look for the shack."

ELECTED CITY OFFICIALS WILL WAIVE 5% PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All 18 elected officials in the city of Los Angeles declared before a Tuesday 
deadline that they will waive a 5% pay increase scheduled to begin in the New 
Year, or else donate the money to charity or other causes.

 Thirteen City Council members joined Mayor Richard Riordan, City Atty.James K. 
Hahn and City Controller Rick Tuttle in waiving the raises. Council members 
would have received hikes from $90,680 to $95,214. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Hal Bernson and Nate Holden said they will give their raises 
to aid the community. Bernson said his will go to the Devonshire and Foothill 
police divisions; Holden will give his to the American Youth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said that during a time of economic hardship they were 
uncomfortable taking the raises -- which were tied to those of Municipal Court 
judges by a 1990 law. The city will save nearly $70,000 because of the waivers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; IMPACT OF 
COUNSELING ON SKINHEADS SEEN AS 'POSITIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An evaluation of an ambitious, three-day counseling program aimed at members 
of the Fourth Reich Skinheads has concluded that the program "had a positive 
impact on many of the participants" and might form the basis for future 
counseling of other youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was prepared by Donna Siers, a litigation consultant who monitored 
last week's sessions directed at members of a skinhead group, some of whom had 
used pipe bombs, plotted to assassinate prominent blacks and Jews, and drafted 
plans to attack the First African Methodist Episcopal Church.Siers made 14 
recommendations for any future counseling programs, ranging from how adult 
counselors should behave to the need for the media to be excluded from all 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The skinheads, two of whom have pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other federal 
charges, participated in the counseling last week. Among other activities, they 
met with a federal judge, toured a jail, discussed issues with other young 
people and heard from two Holocaust survivors. Their evaluations, which are 
attached to Siers' report, include a number of criticisms but some endorsements 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had been through a program like this three years ago," one of the 
skinheads wrote. "My life would be a lot different today."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WISCONSIN 
CONGRESSMAN TO OFFER BILL ON TICKET SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Wisconsin congressman wants to make sure that if the Badgers ever make it 
back to the Rose Bowl, fans traveling West for the game will take in more than 
the sights. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Scott L. Klug, a Republican who represents the Madison area, said 
Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation to force charter operators to 
have tickets on hand before advertising package deals to sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of University of Wisconsin fans who bought tour packages for this 
year's Rose Bowl were told upon arrival that because of heavier-than-expected 
demand, their tour operators had failed to secure game tickets that were 
supposed to be a part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these fans paid scalpers' rates -- several hundred dollars a ticket in 
some cases -- to see the game anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which Klug has dubbed the "Badger Fan Protection Act," would put the 
U.S. Department of Transportation in charge of ensuring that charter operators' 
promises of tickets are legitimate.

MAN'S ROLE IN FINDING LOST BOYS IS UNDER INVESTIGATION; CHILDREN: POLICE ARE 
SKEPTICAL THAT RECOVERY OF TWO YOUNGSTERS BY SAME PERSON IS A COINCIDENCE. 
FRIENDS SAY DAY LABORER HAD EXPECTED TO GET MORE CASH AFTER BEING HAILED AS A 
HERO IN THE FIRST INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As police sought to unravel a day laborer's involvement in the recovery of two 
children who were reported missing in the last month, investigators were 
skeptical Tuesday that the cases were mere coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Palma Lopez, 31, called authorities Monday and said he had found 
3-year-old Andrew Rodriguez, who had disappeared Christmas Day from a Downtown 
video arcade. In early December, Lopez found Matthew Vera, 4, who had vanished 
40 hours earlier from the Downtown Greyhound bus station. 
</P>
<P>
 Police questioned Lopez for 10 hours Monday about the two cases, but he was 
released because there was not enough evidence to charge him, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detectives are trying to place either child with Lopez before either call he 
made to police saying he had found them," Los Angeles Police Detective Yvette 
Eggleston said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $25,000 reward was offered for information leading to the return of the 
Rodriguez boy -- a reward that Lopez said in a television interview he is 
entitled to -- but Eggleston said Tuesday that no reward will be paid until the 
police investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's friends said Tuesday that they were shocked when they heard that he 
had come forward with a second child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it true?" fellow day laborer Javier Contrero said after hearing that Lopez 
had found the Rodriguez child. "We can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrero said that for the last week he had not seen Lopez at Pico Boulevard 
and Mullen Avenue, where the men usually wait for work as laborers. Lopez told 
him, Contrero said, that he had moved in with a San Fernando couple who wrote 
to him after hearing that he found Matthew wandering alone Downtown on Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Lopez's friends told The Times two weeks ago that he would 
sometimes sleep on buses at the Greyhound station, where Matthew disappeared 
Dec. 4 -- an assertion Lopez denied. Before Andrew was reunited with his 
family, he had been seen at the bus station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lopez showed up with Matthew last month, officers helped the homeless 
man set up a post office box where donations could be sent. Like many other 
people, several officers believed Lopez was a hero. He had told police that he 
spent his last few dollars buying a hamburger and milk for the hungry boy. 
</P>
<P>
 As one officer put it: "I thought it had to be publicly said that Mr. Lopez 
did an exceptional thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the box was set up, however, Lopez and officers gave conflicting accounts 
about donations he received. Lopez said he received several letters offering 
help, but few of those letters offered money, work or a place to live -- the 
three things Lopez wanted most, his friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he first told friends he had received no money, he later admitted 
that several hundred dollars had been sent to the post office box. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's friends also said he was especially disappointed when he did not 
receive more cash from people who wished him well. A former street vendor in 
Mexico, Lopez had hoped to receive enough money to start a business on the 
streets of Los Angeles. He suggested that if people did not have money to send 
him, he would accept merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he complained that the relatives of the first child had not done 
anything to reward him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His parents said they would help," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Lopez also felt exploited by the media. He has consistently 
monitored how his story has been played on television and in newspapers, and he 
carried several reporters' business cards. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was released from custody Monday, he called his own news conference, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier interview, he repeatedly asked that his post office box number 
be included in the story and boasted that his story had appeared on the front 
page of several newspapers and was the lead story on most local broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought I would get a job because of this," he said. "I got a lot of 
Christmas cards." 
</P>
<P>
 However, his friends said that it was Lopez who was being used by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reporters came to interview him, they talked to him on all the TV channels, 
police talked to him, and the calls started coming in (offering him jobs and 
aid)," said Andres Cabrales, a fellow day laborer. "He was in my house. The 
promises never happened."

TRIAL TO BEGIN ON LAPD UNIT'S ROLE IN STAKEOUT; COURTS: LAWSUIT SAYS OFFICERS 
PUT RESTAURANT MANAGER'S LIFE AT RISK BY FAILING TO PREVENT MEN FROM ROBBING A 
MCDONALD'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial Los Angeles police squad is set to defend itself in court 
again today, this time against allegations that it allowed robbers to hold up a 
McDonald's and jeopardize a restaurant manager's life so it could build a case 
against the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbin L. Cox, a former manager at a McDonald's in Sunland, has sued the LAPD 
and the city of Los Angeles for unspecified damages, saying that officers in 
the Special Investigations Section had been staking out the robbers for hours, 
including the moments before they committed the late-night robbery Feb. 11, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox alleges that the officers recklessly allowed the robbers to terrorize her 
at gunpoint while they monitored the scene from undercover cars parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had an overwhelming amount of manpower there. They could have easily 
stopped the whole thing," her lawyer, Christopher Hiddleson, said. "But they 
chose to allow the robbery to go forward and be completed. . . . She is 
fortunate she wasn't shot or raped or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, 26, and her lawyer say that the investigative unit's officers were 
negligent because they told patrol officers not to respond to a 911 call she 
made as the robbers broke in at closing time. Cox said she has suffered 
emotional trauma that led to longtime unemployment, and that the robbery has 
ruined her chances of continuing a promising career at the fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who was unavailable for comment, said when she filed the suit in 1990 
that she wants at least $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is set to start today, and testimony could start the same day, 
including questioning of former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police had no comment Tuesday on the trial, one of many cases 
against the special unit, which is designed to monitor and catch dangerous 
career criminals. The squad has become controversial in recent years because of 
its high number of shootings and incidents in which officers allowed crimes to 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit has already lost one suit in the widely publicized McDonald's case, 
when a federal jury found that the officers used excessive force in killing 
three of the robbers and wounding a fourth as they fled the restaurant. The 
jury awarded $44,000 in damages to the families of the dead men and the lone 
survivor, Alfredo Olivas, who later pleaded guilty to 10 counts of robbery and 
is serving a 17-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found that Gates, a key witness in the federal case, fostered 
and condoned the use of excessive force in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current case, in Glendale Superior Court, the city has argued that the 
officers acted in the best interests of everyone concerned, including Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a tactical decision, based on sound police work," said Deputy City 
Atty. Don Vincent, supervising attorney for the city's police litigation unit. 
"I don't think it's negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said that police had orders to apprehend the four men before they 
entered the McDonald's if they were together, but that the robbers fanned out 
around the building and entered from a side that the officers could not see. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, legal experts said, will raise issues of how police must balance 
protecting the public with the need to gather evidence against dangerous 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Eule, an associate dean at the UCLA Law School and an expert in 
constitutional law, said jurors may have to delve into the complicated issue of 
whether the U.S. Constitution mandates that police have an ironclad obligation 
to protect citizens from harm. Most successful lawsuits against police focus on 
the opposite -- cases in which they actively did something they should not 
have, such as invade someone's privacy or violate their civil rights, Eule 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cox has received $95,000 in workers' compensation benefits from the state for 
emotional distress, the same problem alleged in her suit.

BLACKS, LATINOS BRAWL AGAIN IN COURT CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second brawl in two days between black and Latino inmates in the lockup of 
the Criminal Courts Building Downtown resulted in injuries to 11 inmates, 
including three black prisoners stabbed in the neck with a six-inch homemade 
knife, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty inmates were involved in the five-minute melee that erupted at 7:45 a.m. 
in a holding cell on the 14th floor of the building at 210 Temple St., said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra. Deputies were able to break up 
the brawl without using force, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inmates responded to verbal commands" from deputies, Becerra said, adding 
that a "six-inch shank" was found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Four inmates were transferred to the jail ward at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center, including the three black prisoners who were stabbed and one 
Latino prisoner who suffered a head injury. All were listed in satisfactory 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven others involved in Tuesday's fight were treated for minor injuries by 
paramedics at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities did not disclose the exact cause of the fight, they said 
it was prompted by racial tension between black and Latino inmates. Sheriff's 
Deputy Rich Erikson said the inmates involved were not gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight between black and Latino inmates occurred at the courts building early 
Monday and resulted in minor injuries to three inmates. That incident lasted 
about four minutes and involved 20 of 47 inmates held in a 10th floor cell, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured inmates suffered minor cuts and scrapes and were also taken to the 
jail ward at County-USC Medical Center. Two of the inmates were released 
Tuesday and the third remained in the hospital in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the back-to-back fights, Erikson said that no additional security 
measures are planned at the courts building, where hundreds of inmates awaiting 
trial are held each day. He also said there are no plans to separate black and 
Latino inmates. Only inmates with a history of fighting will be held in 
separate cells in the courts building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fights between black and Latino prisoners have escalated in the 
increasingly crowded Los Angeles County jail system, said Cmdr. Ken Bayless of 
the sheriff's custody division. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Jail system includes nine facilities that handle about 20,000 
inmates a day. Latinos make up about 47% of the jail population and blacks 
about 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic has been the site of numerous 
fights between black and Latino inmates. In 1993, there were 53 brawls, some of 
which involved as many as 800 inmates, at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything in our power to try to prevent this kind of thing, 
short of segregating inmates," Bayless said. "And, frankly, we've thought of 
that. But we don't know if we're ready to take that step at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bayless said that some jail fights carry over from friction between black and 
Latino gang members on Los Angeles' streets. He said deputies from the 
sheriff's gang unit work closely with the county's court services personnel to 
try to prevent potential fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens on the street and what happens in jail are certainly related," 
Bayless said. "Tensions are so high along black and brown lines that the 
slightest incident between two inmates often escalates into something more and 
both sides feel obligated to jump into the fray."

SAN FERNANDO PARKS CHIEF FIRED; INQUIRY: ALLEGATIONS THAT HE MISUSED CITY FUNDS 
PROMPT COUNCIL TO OUST GRASS-ROOTS LATINO LEADER. HE DENIES WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of speculation and rumor, the San Fernando City Council has fired 
parks director Jess Margarito, a popular figure in grass-roots Latino politics 
and a former mayor who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged 
misuse of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard-looking council members announced their 4-1 decision at 11:30 p.m. 
Monday night, after a 3 1/2-hour closed session in which the council reviewed 
allegations that Margarito falsified time cards for convicts sentenced by 
courts to work in the city's parks. A nine-count confidential report by the San 
Fernando Police Department also alleges that Margarito caused the city to pay 
false invoices amounting to more than $2,000 for tasks that were not done. 
</P>
<P>
 Those allegations remain the focus of a separate criminal investigation by the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Investigators last week seized 
Margarito's work computer and some documents, as well as personal bank records. 
</P>
<P>
 An affidavit submitted to a court in the request for the warrant to seize bank 
records indicates that investigators are looking into $4,000 Margarito 
allegedly received in 1987 from the nonprofit Immigration Services of Santa 
Rosa while serving on its board, a violation of its bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members remained mum about their deliberations Tuesday, not even 
saying who voted against the firing. Council members said the city attorney 
advised them not to reveal details, in part because Margarito has a 
fair-employment complaint pending against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in September, accuses officials of racial discrimination 
and harassment in their inquiry into his three-year tenure as director of the 
Recreation and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito received a final paycheck Tuesday morning, then tearfully emptied 
his desk at San Fernando Recreation Park under escort by a police officer. He 
vowed to fight the council, possibly through a lawsuit, saying it never gave 
him a chance to answer the allegations before firing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some mistakes, but I never benefited one cent" Margarito said. "In 
hindsight I wish I was wiser. In hindsight, I wish I was more responsive to the 
administrative process." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the months of investigation, beginning with the district attorney's 
inquiry in April and concluding with the city's action Monday night, Margarito 
has maintained that he may have bent rules to help destitute friends and 
workers, but never profited. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito's activist supporters were outraged Tuesday. Margarito, they said, 
always represented a disenfranchised Latino fringe that has struggled to obtain 
power in the small city of 23,500 in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. Some 
said Margarito was the victim of political motives with racial overtones.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't doubt that there is a good degree of that," said Andres Torres, a 
Mission College professor and longtime Margarito friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five members of the council that fired him, however, are Latinos, 
as is 83% of the city's population.

OMBUDSMAN FOR CITY CONTRACT BIDS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that the influence of lobbyists at Los Angeles City Hall must be 
checked, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on Tuesday proposed the hiring of an 
ombudsman to guide bidders through the city's complex contracting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he hopes such a bid adviser would allow outside contractors 
to do business with the city without the necessity of hiring lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal came in response to a Times story about a businesswoman who had 
the low bid for a $25-million contract to manufacture garbage cans. Catherine 
Bump's company, Plastopan, also planned to build a plant to make the cans in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bump resisted hiring a lobbyist and eventually her bid was disqualified 
for procedural oversights spotted by a rival's lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just adds to the perception and, more than that, the reality that it's 
not what you know but who you know at City Hall," Yaroslavsky said. "This is 
not unique. Unfortunately, it is more common than any of us would like to 
admit." 
</P>
<P>
 Bump said she had hoped that Councilwoman Rita Walters' office would help her 
navigate City Hall because the factory would be built in Walters' district. But 
Walters' staff told Bump it would not lobby the city bureaucracy on her behalf, 
and instead put her in touch with a professional lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said Tuesday that contractors are commonly told by city officials 
that they need to hire one or more advocates to win a competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should someone have to hire someone just to get through the process?" 
Yaroslavsky asked. "It's just not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Voluminous and complex bidding requirements sometimes create obstacles for 
responsible companies, particularly those that have not done business with the 
city before, according to Yaroslavsky's written motion. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved, an administrator in the Department of Public 
Works would help verify that companies have met minimum specifications. 
Yaroslavsky's motion will be forwarded to committee for discussion.

<P>
 The fate of the $25-million garbage can contract, meanwhile, is yet to be 
determined by the city's Board of Public Works. The original proposals were 
thrown out because of disputes that arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastopan is still in the running to get the job. But in the rebidding, the 
firm filed its proposal 15 minutes late, an error that has been cited by a 
rival bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said that he has not had time to study the garbage can bidding, 
but that he is concerned that technicalities often are used to block qualified 
bidders. The Plastopan proposal is particularly admirable because it proposes 
manufacturing the trash cans locally, Yaroslavsky said, and would bring 37 new 
jobs to an impoverished community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city may be the loser in this case," Yaroslavsky said, "by putting every 
barrier in front of this company to come in and bring jobs with it."

TOUGH ON GUNS, TOUGH ON CRIME; A CHEER FOR PROPOSAL TO REVAMP GUN LICENSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's move to tighten the appallingly lax and under-enforced 
federal firearm licensing laws might actually help reduce gun violence and 
crime. It could help reduce gun violence because it could directly and 
immediately affect the number of firearms sold and thus in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's latest proposals, credited to Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, involve sharply hiking gun dealer license fees in an effort to 
dramatically reduce dealer ranks. Those ranks should be severely thinned. Of 
the more than 284,000 federally licensed gun dealers nationwide, officials 
estimate that only 20% are genuinely engaged in firearms trade as a business. 
The rest buy licenses only to obtain weapons for their own use at lower costs; 
they have no intention of selling guns as retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 A bargain-basement licensing fee has constituted an incentive for applying for 
dealer status. (The recently passed Brady bill increased the three-year license 
fee to $200 from the $30 that had been charged since 1968.) So many hold dealer 
status, in fact, that it's ludicrous to expect the 240 inspectors of the 
Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to monitor the 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Bentsen propose to hike the licensing fee to $600 yearly. They 
also want to boost the ATF's enforcement capability and to improve agency 
cooperation with state and local authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Tightening firearm regulations at the federal level is one way to confront the 
growing crisis of crime. In California, at the state level, there is increasing 
support for life sentences for those convicted of a third violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Such calls are sure to be heard often and loudly at the crime summit that Gov. 
Pete Wilson will open this month in Los Angeles. The notion is all but 
irresistible: Life imprisonment would take convicted violent offenders off the 
streets. So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals for ever-tougher prison sentences are nothing new, of course. 
Although California ranks 17th in the nation in terms of its rate of 
incarceration, it already houses more prisoners than any other state: 120,000. 
Our prisons are bursting, yet the carnage in our streets and schools and even 
in our homes continues. That's the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why addressing the gun-supply side of the crime equation is at 
least as promising as addressing the prison-supply side. Let's prevent the 
violence in the first place by curbing the supply of guns. That means much 
tighter state and local restrictions on private gun ownership and much stronger 
enforcement of existing laws on possession. Yes, let's get tough on crime -- no 
quarrel there. But let's get a lot tougher on guns.

VIETNAM TRADE: TIME FOR THE LEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's approach to Asia-Pacific foreign policy -- indeed 
to much of its foreign policy -- is to emphasize trade. That being the case, it 
is only logical and consistent for Washington to now ease the trade embargo 
against Vietnam, in place since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, President Clinton took two preliminary, incremental steps in that 
direction last year. Now it is time to take the great leap forward. The United 
States, after all, stands alone in its trading ban against Hanoi. Meanwhile, 
other nations are rushing in to do business with this Southeast Asian country, 
which is trying to get itself on a fast track toward economic development and 
modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and 
Pacific affairs, completed his second 1993 trip to Hanoi. He is the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to have participated in ceremonies marking the 
transfer of what are believed to be the remains of eight U.S. servicemen 
declared missing in action in the Vietnam War. The remains of more than 500 
servicemen have now been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has moved carefully in acting on the trade embargo out of 
respect for the families of missing U.S. military personnel. It was right to 
ask the Vietnamese -- who have not fully cooperated until recently -- to do 
more to address the unanswered questions in the MIA-POW issue. Lord needs to 
give Americans an assessment of progress. (On Thursday the United States will 
launch its biggest search ever in Vietnam for Americans missing in action.) Yet 
the MIA-POW problem may never be resolved completely, especially for the 
families of the more 2,000 still unaccounted for in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing these interests against U.S. commercial interests is a delicate 
matter. In July, the Administration dropped its opposition to loans to Vietnam 
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A month later, it 
eased restrictions on allowing U.S. firms to take part in Vietnamese projects 
financed by these institutions. Then, two weeks ago, Mobil Corp. became part of 
a consortium that was awarded offshore drilling rights by Vietnam. But there's 
a hitch: The embargo limits Mobil's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Resuming trade with Hanoi does not require restoring full diplomatic ties. The 
latter depends on continued cooperation on the MIA-POW issue. The former 
requires only common sense and an understanding of our economic interest.

COYOTE WATCH; POLICY TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to know which is worse: the decision last summer by a Los 
Angeles city board to end coyote trapping after 25 years or the 
misunderstandings about the effort to control these animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Examples: One reason cited by the board, which oversees the Animal Regulation 
Department, was the city's need to avoid being sued by homeowners alleging that 
trapping had been bungled.However, the city attorney's office later said that 
the city could not be held liable in the issue of coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials pointed out that Los Angeles County currently traps 
coyotes. That's true, but only in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal lovers believed the city could move the coyotes elsewhere. Wrong; 
doing so would violate state law. 
</P>
<P>
 It was thought that homeowners could easily protect pets and small children 
from coyote attacks by covering garbage cans and fencing their yards. But it's 
more complicated than that. Coyotes weigh 30 to 50 pounds, can run at 35 
m.p.h., can burrow under fences and can scale barriers up to six feet high. To 
deter one, animal regulation officials now say, you need an eight-foot fence, 
tilted outward at 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, coyotes are being spotted in more and more back yards, mostly 
in the San Fernando Valley, and are being blamed for increasing numbers of 
attacks on pets. In two recent instances, coyotes are believed to have stalked 
small children. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee, the county will trap coyotes that have become a danger. The city 
should consider the same policy.

MANZANAR HISTORIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Plans to Honor Manzanar Create Divided Camps," Dec. 23: 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing plans for making Manzanar a national historic site, Bill Michael, 
administrator for the Eastern California Museum in Independence, is quoted as 
saying, "For some of these people, it's very hard to separate the soldiers in 
the Japanese Imperial Army from Japanese Americans . . . they don't think any 
big deal should be made over the camp." Also, it was reported that the local 
VFW, in the 1980s, passed a resolution opposing the development of a proposed 
historic area at Manzanar. 
</P>
<P>
 I am saddened and angered that after 50 years, some people still don't get it. 
It was because our government failed to distinguish between the Japanese enemy 
and loyal Japanese Americans that we were banished to camps like Manzanar. 
Volunteers from the camps into the 442nd Regimental Combat Team provided a 
"demonstration in blood" on the European front, and it was estimated that the 
work accomplished by Nisei serving in military intelligence in the Pacific 
shortened the war by two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The suffering and humiliation of the camps were not endured by men, women, 
children and babies who were the enemy, but rather they were endured by fellow 
American citizens, ostensibly possessing full constitutional guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose the fact that there are those who still don't get it only indicates 
the need for the historical site. A bill, signed by President Reagan in 1988, 
has provided an apology and token financial redress to practically all of the 
surviving internees. What remains is a means to tell our story so as to salvage 
some semblance of meaning to this American tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 We probably can't change the minds of those folks around Independence, and 
others who we have not succeeded in convincing, but a national historic site 
would surely help to instruct the uninformed, and it could serve to enlighten 
future generations.

BETTER TO BE EARLY -- AND SAFER; IT TOOK TWO FATAL AIR CRASHES TO PROMPT FAA TO 
MOVE ON 757 WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isn't it always better to err on the side of safety in warning pilots about 
potential hazards on approach to busy airfields? Common sense suggests so. 
</P>
<P>
 However, documents obtained by The Times show that the Federal Aviation 
Administration was formally warned twice since 1991 about problems associated 
with wake turbulence -- mini-tornadoes springing from the wingtips of Boeing 
757 jetliners that can raise havoc with planes following too closely behind. In 
addition, anecdotal evidence of the problem was gathered from pilots by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and brought to the FAA's 
attention twice last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the FAA issued no warning until last month -- after a tragic crash Dec. 
15. A twin-engine jet carrying two executives of the In-N-Out hamburger chain 
and three other persons went down as it approached John Wayne Airport; all in 
the corporate craft, which had been about two miles behind a 757, were killed. 
Preliminary reports link both that crash and an eight-fatality crash in Montana 
in late 1992 to wake turbulence from 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 What took so long? The answer isn't very convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA says that there was nothing "alarming" about the data. Even now, in 
acknowledging it might have acted sooner, Tony Broderick, an FAA associate 
administrator, says that a Dec. 22 FAA bulletin on 757 wake turbulence was 
issued "out of an abundance of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA statements notwithstanding, there appears to have been ample reason for an 
earlier warning. A 1991 study conducted for the FAA found that 757s caused more 
wake turbulence than any other plane ever tested; it recommended that smaller 
planes be kept four miles behind 757s. The same year, a British study presented 
at an FAA-sponsored symposium recommended that the 757 problem be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be, as the FAA asserts, that the pilots' adherence to the rules of 
airmanship was also at issue in the two crashes. But there wouldn't have been 
any harm in an earlier statement about a potentially serious problem.

UNEMPLOYED IN AEROSPACE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was an Southland aerospace engineer for 30 years, beginning in 1958. The 
Times' series on the plight of ex-aerospace workers (Dec. 19-21) should lead us 
to reflect seriously on the excesses of the Cold War period and hopefully learn 
from the experience. We were warned by Dwight Eisenhower to little avail in the 
1950s of the dangers of unbridled militaristic power unleashed during World War 
II. In the ensuing decades, this military/industrial complex cultivated and 
nurtured a public hysteria against the "Red Menace" and reaped the benefits of 
exotic technical weapons development deemed imperative to defeat the Evil 
Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The fringe benefits for many of us were an inflated standard of living, for 
which we now suffer. More tragic is the legacy left to our children by the 
so-called golden years of the Cold War: an astronomical national debt, 
multimillion-dollar obsolete bombers and silos now drawing dust, and reeking 
nuclear arsenals and production facilities requiring decades of cleanup effort 
as they contaminate our environment.

 * When told that we were about to lose our aerospace industry, our politicians 
said that they would take no action, because this was only 8% of California's 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have the state universities trying to get in on the gravy. You have to 
realize that these schools are a publicly funded industry that gets paid 
without a market for its product. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article stated that for the first time, universities were getting in on 
retraining. Not so! In 1970, UC Irvine started a master's in environmental 
engineering.  
</P>
<P>
 A second government-funded program accepted 100 of us and the government paid 
$80,000 for our 16 weeks of retraining as environmental engineers. There was a 
$20,000 incentive if a majority of us found employment after retraining. Two 
people found jobs. We all got our GS ratings from the government, but were told 
that the EPA would not hire us. 
</P>
<P>
 My alma mater, Long Beach State, had mailed offers of employment assistance, 
so I went to the placement office. There were no jobs for engineers, but there 
were lots of papers offering federal financial aid for teaching applicants. 
This was at a time when Ph.D.s in education were driving taxis. I sensed that 
something was amiss and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear the government platitudes about education being the answer to all 
problems. We engineers can't even get jobs teaching math and science to 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorry if I sound bitter, but government isn't the answer, it's the problem.

 * I have the utmost sympathy for out-of-work aerospace engineers, but feel 
that The Times, Rep. Jane Harman and others ignore the problems that many 
others face. 
</P>
<P>
 When aerospace engineers lost their jobs, so did the word processors, 
secretaries, human resources and financial personnel who supported these 
engineers. Like the engineers, many of these people have depleted their 
unemployment benefits, reduced their lifestyle and borrowed money; however, I 
don't see the media bringing these problems to public attention. Highly 
educated aerospace engineers are having a tough time; so are others who need 
the same support.

MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Psychologist Thomas Hersh's contention (Commentary, Dec. 24) that the Menendez 
brothers' murder of their parents somehow might parallel the placemement of 
elderly parents in retirement homes reaches a bit far. First, while bringinbg 
up Freud's "primal horde" theory that sons banded together in ancient times to 
kill their fathers, he neglected to mention that sons seldom kill their 
mothers, also Freudian theory.He refers to the unconscious nature of wanting to 
be rid of our parents. As Freud surmised, it is difficult to argue against the 
unconscious mind and its concurrent behavior. It surely might (and probably 
does) exist. But can we ascribe all behavior to it, and does that in itself 
excuse that behavior? The bottom line in the Menendez trial remains: Why didn't 
the brothers, having been abused and fearful for their safety, simply flee the 
scene?

 How much has the Menendez trial cost the taxpayers of Los Angeles County? And

this trial? Your headline "A Circus of Disorder in the Court" (Dec. 17) is an 
apt description of the trial!

 Re "Blue Shield Says It Will Drop Health Exclusions," Dec. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield's decision to offer benefits for specificme medical problems and 
to end waiting periods for pre-existing conditions will be of tremendoubs help 
to its policyholders. Unfortunately it doesn't go far enough because under 
thisle policy Blue Shield can, and most likely will, refuse some applicants 
with major health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 An act of kindness, this is not. Consumers have long called for this very 
reform and health insurers have said they couldn't do business this way. It's 
only now with health care reform being debated in Congress that the 
billion-dollar insurance industry is attempting to prove that voluntary 
initiatives can cure the problems of our inefficient system of health care.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, believes the country's answer 
to real health care reform is the McDermott-Wellstone-Conyers bill (S. 491 and 
H.R. 1200) before Congress. It hasn't received the attention it deserves 
because it's considered politically unfeasible -- instituting a national 
single-payer system that eliminates insurance companies. However, it remains 
the best way to provide universal, quality care for the country at an 
affordable cost, with revenues collected fairly through taxes and distributed 
fairly to all areas based on need and population size.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mikhail Gorbachev would like to absolve himself from blame for any of the 
turbulence and calamities besetting the former Soviet Union, as he attemempts 
to do in his article in the New Perspectives Quarterly (Commentary, Dec. 20).  
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev castigates Vladimir V. Zhirinovskyle for his far-right views, and 
blames the current Yeltsin government for not producing "a smooth development 
of reforms . . . turning us into paupers, leaving us to the mercy of corrupted 
profiteers, Mafia and criminals."Nowhere does he reprove his own culpability in 
this sordid process.  
</P>
<P>
 Innocently, stated without reproach he writes, "Do not get me wrong . . . I 
consider myself a part of the democratic fold. I stand for maintaining the 
reforms and going forward with them." Standing above the fray, Gorbachev 
ignores his role in introducing perestroika and glasnost, the supposed panacea 
for removing the Soviet Union from its socialist base into the "democratic 
fold," namely a free market economy. As a prime architect for the new free 
enterprise building, he ignores the blueprint he helped design, which is now an 
edifice, crumbling and buckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev should seriously look deeply into his own flawed behavior that 
preceded and led up to the Yeltsin takeover of the government.  
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev's failure to enjoin the people when he was chairman of the Communist 
Party to use the office to challenge Yeltsin's free market forces by rallying 
the unions, the party and those ready to struggle for maintaining socialism 
will course through his veins, until he comes to grips with his own complicity 
in the "crazy dissolution of the Soviet Union."

PERSPECTIVE ON CHIAPAS; THE OTHER MEXICO REVEALS ITSELF; THE ZAPATISTA ERUPTION 
SHOWS HOW ALIENATED THE PEASANTS ARE BY A SYSTEM THAT BOTH MANIPULATES AND 
IGNORES THEM.

By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda's latest book, Utopia Unarmed: The 
Latin American Left After the Cold War, has just been published by Alfred A.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the facts are all available, assorted explanations, most of them wrong, 
will be offered for the appearance of Mexico's first guerrilla movement since 
the 1970s. The Chiapas indigenous peasant uprising will be blamed on 
Guatemalans, priests, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the CIA, poverty, ethnic resentment 
and what not. It will be explained away as short-lived, localized, eccentric 
and exceptional. Some of the motivations will make sense -- poverty, 
discrimination against indigenous peoples -- but have been true for centuries 
without provoking an armed explosion. The others will simply be self-serving, 
seeking to dodge the hard question that Mexico must answer: How is it that a 
nation theoretically propelled into the First World by NAFTA, free-market 
technocrats and English-speaking yuppies has suddenly been rocked by Indians -- 
Tzeltzals, Tzotziales, Tojolavaes, Choles -- fighting a modern army with 
machetes and sticks and stones as well as automatic weapons? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, lies not in the motivations and origins of the Chiapas 
revolt, but in the mistaken nature of the initial assessment: Mexico has not 
been, nor will it be anytime soon, the modern, lily-white, middle-class and 
democratic society its rulers and their friends in Washington want it 
desperately to be. Or, more correctly, Mexico is at least two nations: the one 
present at the NAFTA coming-out parties in Washington, and the one that reared 
its head in San Cristobal de las Casas on New Year's Day. To confuse one for 
the other is major mistake; to believe that the first Mexico is more relevant 
to the future than the second is understandable but equally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Four points are worth making about the events in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 * This is not, strictly speaking, an armed peasant jacquerie, but a 
well-organized, partly well-armed guerrilla movement. It has at least a 
thousand recruits -- the news photos and video footage testify to that -- some 
of whom are uniformed and carry modern weapons, some who do not. It has a 
centralized command, substantial communications and logistics capability, a 
coherent (if archaic) political philosophy and a sophisticated sense of public 
relations. It is doubtful that it can stand up to the Mexican army for long, or 
hold any towns or territory, but it is certainly not a spontaneous, outraged 
"Indian revolt." 
</P>
<P>
 * It remains a mystery how a thousand peasants could organize, train and equip 
themselves, plan and coordinate such a major military operation without the 
Mexican government doing anything about it. It's not as if the so-called 
Zapatistas were a secret. As recently as last August, the weekly Proceso ran a 
long story on the guerrilla movement; earlier, the daily La Jornada had 
reported on the first skirmishes in the town of Ocosingo. The Mexican security 
machinery, corrupt and brutal as it may be, has a well-deserved reputation for 
efficiency. Why was nothing done to forestall the inevitable and predictable 
guerrilla offensive? Was the omission deliberate, and if so, who should be 
blamed for the hundreds of lives now lost? Or was it unintentional, an 
oversight, and if so, what is going on inside the federal government? 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis in Chiapas is not by any means exclusively of an economic nature. 
The southern state is one of Mexico's poorest, and the discrimination against 
its destitute indigenous peoples is dramatic, but these facts alone do not 
account for what happened. Indeed, Chiapas was something of a showcase for 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's much-touted Solidarity anti-poverty 
program: More money from the Salinas government and the World Bank was funneled 
into Chiapas than to any other state. The problem is that the authoritarian, 
corrupt, oligarchical structures that have characterized Chiapas for decades 
were left untouched -- or even were strengthened. The local authorities and the 
army worked with the cattle grazers in dispossessing the Indians of their 
communal lands. The ranchers got the land; the army and the police beat up, 
harassed and intimidated the indigenous landholders. It was no coincidence that 
the former governor of the state of Chiapas, Patrocinio Gonzalez, famed for the 
human-rights violations and corruption that took place on his watch, was named 
Salinas' interior minister a year ago. The Salinas regime threw money (in fact, 
not all that much) at the local problems but left the underlying causes intact. 
In fact, the main problem in Chiapas is not economic but political. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico cannot go on being governed this way; this is the true lesson of the 
Chiapas insurrection. In principle, if all or at least most of the country's 
ancestral injustices and inequalities, oppression and violence, human-rights 
violations and poverty could be redressed overnight or even soon, there would 
be less of a need for political change. Conversely, if there were adequate 
channels of political expression for discontent and ensuing demands, the 
urgency for addressing the nation's myriad economic and social ills would be 
less grave. But neither is the case, which means that political change must 
occur, and soon, or more incidents such as those of the past few days will 
occur. Not necessarily the same way, nor right away: As Chiapas shows, 
predicting events in Mexico is a lousy way to make a living. But it makes no 
sense to make a career of pretense, just to keep a party and its bosses in 
power.

THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATNESS REMAINS; LOS ANGELES: THE UTTER PESSIMISM OF TODAY 
IS AS OFF-KILTER AS THE BOOM-TOWN OPTIMISM WAS IN 1988. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JANE G. PISANO, Jane G. Pisano is the vice president for external relations 
at USC and dean of its School of Public Administration. She was president of LA 
2000. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1988, a blue-ribbon group of citizen planners delivered its final report, 
"LA 2000: A City for the Future." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had, then, a sense of being the right place at the right time. 
Culturally it had come of age. Gone permanently were the old jibes about 
"Double Dubuque." It was clear to everyone, even to the city's fiercest 
critics, even to New Yorkers, that the place dismissed as "the Coast" had 
outgrown its provincialism and become in every sense a world city, a major 
contributor in the global exchange of ideas, capital, innovation and style; a 
place where trends started; a place where young people came -- not just from 
all over the United States, but from all over the world -- to try themselves 
against the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Our study proudly checked off what the Los Angeles area had in its favor: 
excellent transportation connections, outstanding colleges and universities, 
the world's largest concentration of high-tech industry and a highly trained, 
highly motivated work force, "drawing on the energy and ingenuity of one of the 
most diverse populations in the world." Property values were growing, fueling 
the optimism.  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles had problems in 1988. Our study was in fact an effort to 
identify the ones most likely to interfere with the city's further development 
and to recommend steps to solve them. We singled out public safety, 
transportation, affordable housing, education, the widening of the gap between 
rich and poor, environmental protection and other areas where improvements were 
crucial. We made our recommendations, some of which have since been instituted, 
at a time when our economy was booming, in an atmosphere in which everything 
seemed possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, five years after our report was published, the psychological climate is 
so different that the aspirations of that time seem almost dreamlike. 
Magazines, newspapers and broadcasters carry a procession of obituaries for 
California, and for Los Angeles in particular. Any bad news is seen as a 
portent of doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, for example, is a grave problem in Los Angeles, as it is in every major 
city in the United States; but the impact on crime of the economic downturn 
here has actually been less than might have been predicted from the drop in 
jobs, notwithstanding the horror stories on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
 The same pattern is apparent across the board. Yes, our schools still 
desperately need help and new ideas. Yes, our freeways are still congested. 
Yes, we must build community in a society that is diverse and fragmented. Yes, 
above all, new jobs have to develop here. But these are continuing basic needs, 
not signs of a fundamental change in Southern California's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, having recently hosted an Olympics without the financial fiascoes 
typical of other cities, Los Angeles could boastfully claim to be the urban 
solution that worked. The future of Los Angeles was limitless. The city was on 
its way to becoming the capital of the 21st Century. In hindsight, we can 
realize our civic willingness to embrace the upside and minimize the downside. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the feeling was that the city was sick unto death, that its time had 
come and gone, and that its future was inevitable decline. Unwarranted optimism 
has turned to unwarranted pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles today, the immediate economic outlook may be flat, but the city 
is fighting back, not passively waiting for something to turn up. Mayor Riordan 
is building a consensus on ways to put more police on the street. We are 
developing new economic underpinnings in biomedical engineering, in 
entertainment and communications technology, and in advanced transportation 
systems. Universities, government and corporations are cooperating as never 
before, in partnerships like Cal-Start (developing the clean auto engine of the 
future) and Project California (developing new transportation and 
telecommunication systems); private philanthropy is stepping in to help. Civic 
coalitions like LEARN are changing the process of education and the concept of 
community. RLA and Community Build are taking on the difficult task of bringing 
economic resources to the inner city and in the process they are building 
community in the most ethnically and culturally diverse city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the potential is still there, waiting to be tapped by citizens 
committed to the future of this city.

CLINTON HAS TO SHED HIS ANTI-MILITARY BIAS; LEADERSHIP: THE CHIEF CAN'T COMMAND 
UNTIL SERVICE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR WELL-BEING IS A PRIORITY FOR THIS 
ADMINISTRATION.

By JOHN WHEELER, John Wheeler, a Vietnam vet, chaired the fund that built the

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nagging task for President Clinton in 1994 is repair of his credibility as a 
commander respected by veterans and the military; otherwise, how will he manage 
armed confrontations in Korea, Eastern Europe or other trouble spots? A 
President whose decisions show that he, his wife and other closer advisers 
still loathe the military is not in the best position to order young Americans 
into combat.  
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as secretary of defense is a good step as 
far as it goes, but it does not face the crisis of depressed military morale, 
nor will it change the negative attitudes and enormous power of the Clinton 
inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of a number of concerned people who believe that matters are grave 
enough to require a presidential commission. This commission would assure 
coordinated, top-level attention to the 100,000 families that are being ushered 
out of military life as the armed forces are downsized and restructured; it 
would open communication with Clinton advisers who were anti-war activists in 
the 1960s and '70s and set a positive tone for civil-vet-military relations in 
the post-Cold War world. Such a commission would show strong presidential 
character in facing and healing these divisions head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the people supportive of this idea are Vietnam veterans, like former 
Beirut hostage Terry Anderson and Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiographer Lewis 
Puller Jr., both of whom campaigned for Clinton; military-sociology expert 
Charles Moskos of Northwestern University, who advised the Administration on 
military relations during 1993, and parents of servicemen, like Larry and Gail 
Joyce and James and Carolyn Smith, whose Army Ranger sons were killed in 
Mogadishu. Larry and James are both Vietnam vets.  
</P>
<P>
 Our recommendation is based on interviews we and others conducted with 
active-duty military personnel worldwide, including in Somalia and at all 
levels of rank in the Pentagon, and with veterans and members of the Clinton 
Administration. Especially in the enlisted ranks, troops feel that no political 
leaders are looking out for them. The President is criticized for not really 
caring about the soldier or the soldier's family, for pushing leadership 
responsibility off onto subordinates, and for putting soldiers' lives in the 
hands of White House appointees who lack military experience.  
</P>
<P>
 The true measure of the President's attitude toward military service -- the 
number of vets he appoints to top, Senate-confirmed positions in his 
Administration -- supports the troops' perceptions. Of approximately 350 men 
confirmed so far, 33 are vets; two women appointees are vets also. If we set 
aside the 16 vets named to posts in the Defense Department and Veterans 
Administration, that leaves 17 spread among all other Cabinet-level agencies. 
Put another way, vets hold 5% of the top non-military-related posts, yet 
constitute about one-third of the generation that came of age during the 
Vietnam era -- the President's generation. What these figures add up to is 
discrimination against veterans. Most noteworthy, no one with combat experience 
heads the departments of the Navy, Air Force or Army. Retired Adm. Inman is the 
only vet among the seven most powerful Pentagon appointees.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the President has met with the father of Polly Klaas and other 
victims of tragedy, he has ignored the request to meet with families of Rangers 
killed in Mogadishu. He has not addressed concerns that soldiers are endangered 
because White House amateurs call the military shots, or anger that a President 
and aides who opposed intervention in Vietnam now want interventions to 
"enlarge democracy."  
</P>
<P>
 The sum of these factors is that active-duty military and vets are again 
treated as second-class citizens, just like in the 1970s. The cure is one of 
caring, not expenditure: Form a commission, meet with some of the grieving and 
worried families and affirm that the number of vets in the Administration -- 
including women -- should roughly reflect the proportion of vets in America.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has constitutional authority to send troops to battle, and, 
thanks to their respect for the office, he can count on them absolutely. But he 
must act soon if he is to claim moral authority to send them to battle.

 January. The feasting is over. Time to return to the gym. Recently, there have 
been stories in the news that made me think I needn't go to my aerobics class, 
but I soon saw the errors in my reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a UCLA researcher reported that a special skin cream seemed to 
reduce the size of women's thighs -- in only five weeks. At first I thought, 
why exercise any more? I'll just munch caramel corn and wait for the product to 
be available. But then I realized if there were a fat-dissolving cream that 
worked, every woman would use it. All women's thighs would shrink 
proportionally, and I would be no better off than before. There would simply be 
a new, stricter, standard of thigh size. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the tabloids ran secretly snapped photos of Princess Diana 
working out at a London fitness club. Though she looked pretty good, the 
postures Her Royal Thighness was caught in were not designed to accentuate a 
woman's best features. Here was another reason to avoid the gym. Someone might 
take sneak shots of my grubby sneakers, crop shots of my cropped top. Unlike 
Di, I do not pump iron in full makeup with perfectly arranged hair and sporting 
Gilda Marx's latest creation. I went to class, but I was wary and didn't wear 
my thong leotard. As we lay on our mats doing abdominal lifts, I anxiously 
searched the ceiling for hidden cameras. For a moment I thought I spied a lens; 
it turned out to be a cola can a kid had tossed into the rafters. One more 
excuse gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in December, studies published in medical journals confirmed that 
sudden vigorous exercise can be dangerous to inactive people. According to one 
study, exercising less often than once a week means you're 107 times more 
likely to have a heart attack during exertion than at rest. If you exercise 
five or more times a week, you're only twice as likely to suffer an attack 
during strenuous activity. Statistics such as these make some people frightened 
of getting physical. How do you collect your courage to go to the gym for the 
first time so that you can work up to the still perilous five times a week? 
What these articles don't emphasize enough is that even with its risks, 
exercise reduces your overall chance of cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the dream cream. Forget Thigh-Di. Don't dwell on alarming reports about 
risk. Seek out a regimen you like and start slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 It took me awhile to find the right program. Jogging was out because I'm 
afraid of dogs. Jazzercise was out because I'm afraid of perkiness. A personal 
trainer was out because I'm afraid of poverty. I discovered that I didn't like 
exercise machines when I had no success with devices hawked on TV by Hollywood 
hard-bodies. Dust is collecting on Suzanne Somers' Thighmaster ($19.95), Cheryl 
Ladd's Body Slide ($49.95) and Vanna White's Easy Glider ($59.95, unassembled). 
I won't be rushing out to purchase the Cybex Leg Press ($6,999.95) used by the 
princess. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I'm no good with gadgets, I don't own a VCR and thus couldn't sample any 
exercise videos. I did take a crack at several workout plans I tore out of 
magazines but was confused by the directions: "Make sure your thighs don't pass 
below your knees which shouldn't go out farther than your feet to the side." 
Makes the Kama Sutra sound simple. 
</P>
<P>
 After my home attempts failed, I decided on classes. I figured the routines 
would be easy and wouldn't require special knowledge. But at one health spa, 
the teacher yelled, "Let's do the linebacker shuffle . . . let's try 50 
slam-dunk squats." Heck, if I knew how to play baseball, I wouldn't need to 
take the class. 
</P>
<P>
 I eventually found the perfect program for me at my local YMCA. The class 
meets every weekday morning for an hour or so. There are no mirrors. The 
instructors are inspiring and their workouts are safe, thorough, effective and 
varied. One day we do low-impact aerobics, the next day a step routine. 
Sometimes we use weights or resistance bands. Occasionally we go for a walk. 
Now and then we have breakfast together and consume more calories than we've 
just burned. But we stick with it, making up in consistency what we lack in 
intensity. We work at different paces but we all work, and our joint efforts 
have created new friendships. Both the suffering and the laughter forge a sense 
of community. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy to find an enjoyable fitness program that's right for your age, 
your body, your personality. But it's worth the effort for a healthier, happier 
1994.

tankers they suspected had been used to smuggle drugs or contraband across the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, officials said Southern Pacific Railroad faces a $221,000 fine 
for taking the cars north after border inspectors ordered them held as 
suspicious.The railroad has 30 days to challenge the civil penalties, said U.S. 
Customs spokesman Mike Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 The search at a Colton rail yard Tuesday culminated an unusual case that began 
last Thursday when inspectors at the Calexico border crossing decided the two 
tankers were suspicious: One weighed 5,200 pounds more than the weight 
stenciled by the manufacturer on the side of the train; the other was 3,200 
pounds overweight and appeared to have been recently painted. Drug cartels have 
used propane tanker trucks for smuggling in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors then entered instructions into a computer that the cars remain for 
further inspection, but -- for unknown reasons -- railroad workers attached the 
cars to a Southern Pacific train that left the border checkpoint before 
inspectors reported to work Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing custody of the two tanker cars for about 22 hours -- before 
they were located in Colton -- customs officials said they were confident 
neither car was tampered with or otherwise unloaded of possible contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 After propane fumes were emptied from the tankers, agents inspected the 
interior and checked for hidden compartments Tuesday. They attributed the 
additional weight of the cars to normal modifications made after they were 
manufactured, officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: TERM LIMITS FOR THOSE OTHER POLITICIANS; GOVERNMENT: 
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE CIRCUMVENTING PROPS. 140 AND 164 BY RUNNING FOR OTHER 
OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE WHITING, Catherine Whiting is a UC Irvine staff member and former 
political consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rhetoric surrounding Proposition 140, and later Proposition 164, presented 
the measures as simple but drastic solutions to a serious problem. Incumbents 
had too much power and were simply being reelected year after year, thus 
ensuring a continuation of all that was wrong in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits were thought to be the only way to curb the runaway arrogance of 
career politicians and to make government work again. However, the increasingly 
apparent hypocrisy of both politicians and voters who support term limits 
should be disturbing to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 140 allows for no more than three terms in the state Assembly (six 
years), and two terms in the state Senate (eight years). Proposition 164 limits 
congressional terms to four (eight years). At a time when the reelection rate 
hovers around 98%, mandated turnover seemed like a good idea to the voters of 
California. And in Orange County, both measures passed by a strong majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly enough, many politicians favored the idea. Even politicians who 
had served many more years than would be allowed under either proposition. Even 
those such as President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and Gov. Pete Wilson, 
who really have had no other careers outside of politics, endorsed the idea of 
term limits. Politicians around the state and throughout the country endorsed 
the idea of term limits. And here in Orange County, virtually all of the 
elected officials at the time endorsed Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward a few years. State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), a 
public officeholder since 1978, has announced that she will run for county 
supervisor, a seat not subject to term limits. And Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), a member of the Assembly since 1984, has indicated that he, 
in turn, is interested in running for Bergeson's Senate seat. Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a career politician since 1976 and a firm supporter of 
term limits, is considering a run for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 If they really do support term limits, if they really don't think government 
is best run by career politicians, why do they continue to seek public office? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, what they meant was that career politicians were OK, they just had 
to keep moving from office to office. Or perhaps what they meant by term limits 
is to limit someone else's term, not their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The support for term limits comes almost exclusively from Republicans, who 
just happen to be the legislative minority both in California and in Congress, 
and who seem to think that term limits are the only way to unseat gainfully 
elected Democrats. Maybe that's what they meant, but that's not exactly what 
they said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But is that what the voters meant? Must be, because the same voters who voted 
for Propositions 140 and 164 returned almost every incumbent back to office. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, there has been a strange silence from those same voters as they watch 
the career politicians scurry to save their jobs. What did the voters want? 
Obviously, here in Orange County they didn't really want to reform government 
and make it work, since they seem content to keep recycling the same old faces. 
They, too, must simply have wanted to limit other voter's choices, not their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the real problem with term limits: They work best only when applied to 
the other guys, those elected in other districts who do things "we" don't like. 
What seems to have been forgotten in all the rhetoric is the simple fact that 
the potential for term limits exists at every election: All the voters need do 
is vote for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But that means two things. First, they have to vote. Term limits takes away 
even the "throw the bums out" incentive to vote. Just wait a few years and the 
bums are automatically thrown out. And second, it means that in highly partisan 
areas, like Orange County, it would mean voting against the entrenched 
majority. Apparently for many Republicans, that just isn't an option. So term 
limits for them simply means keeping the same old career politicians around, 
just in different offices. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters really want term limits, then they should vote against politicians 
who have been around too long. If politicians really want term limits, they 
shouldn't keep running for office. It's that simple.

WORTHY HELPS THE LAKERS ESCAPE NUGGETS, 119-118 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without fanfare and certainly without warning, he returned, if only for a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Game James. 
</P>
<P>
 His Laker nickname has worn thin this season, but Tuesday night was a time for 
redemption for James Worthy, the player who hasn't been making much of a 
contribution, and for the team that two nights earlier lost in the final 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy, who had made only 19 of 54 shots the previous four games and was at 
40% for the season, made 11 of 15 shots, including both three-point attempts, 
and scored a team-high 27 points as the Lakers beat the Denver Nuggets, 
119-118, at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers will remember it as a night they dodged what could have been a 
disastrous finish because of Worthy's performance, Sedale Threatt's 24 points 
on 10-of-16 shooting and James Edwards' 14 points, all off of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets will remember it as the night they got ripped off -- and rightly 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bryant Stith stole Worthy's entry pass at midcourt after a Laker timeout 
and knocked it ahead to LaPhonso Ellis, the Lakers were a layup away from 
blowing a game in which they had a one-point lead and the ball with 3.2 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ellis' soft dunk attempt hit the heel of the rim and officials ruled that 
Brian Williams' tip-in came after the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Lakers charged toward the locker room after ending a four-game losing 
streak, the Nuggets argued with officials. Some thought the basket by Williams 
should have counted. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as Coach Dan Issel, who followed officials down the hallway 
for some post-game berating, were angry about the non-call when Anthony Peeler 
grabbed Ellis' arm a few steps from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got him good," Peeler said later, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of getting two shots in a one-point game, the Nuggets got a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if I was fouled," Ellis said. "I've made plenty of dunks 
with contact." 
</P>
<P>
 It also preserved Worthy's status as a hero, after a play on which even he 
acknowledged that a timeout probably would have been a better move than forcing 
the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark was there from the start, when he entered in the second quarter and 
made seven of 11 shots and scored 16 points in eight minutes before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 That keyed the Lakers' 26-7 run, which took them from 13 points behind to six 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while," Worthy said. "Maybe once or twice last year." 
</P>
<P>
 He had seven points in the third quarter and, of his four points in the 
fourth, three came on a shot with 3:50 remaining that gave the Lakers the lead 
for good, 112-111. Threatt got 11 of his points in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Score one for the old guys," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Score one for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Bowie will undergo arthroscopic surgery today as the Lakers try to 
determine the exact cause of the problems with his left knee, which could mean 
a stint on the injured list and the return of Kurt Rambis. No timetable for 
Bowie's return will be known until after the operation, but the procedure 
itself, even if nothing is repaired, usually means about a week on the 
sidelines. The backup center and power forward has already sat out five games 
and returned to Los Angeles on Tuesday after failing to respond to treatment. 
The Lakers have spoken to Rambis about rejoining the team and received an 
encouraging response, even though he was upset about coming back late in the 
summer only to be cut Dec. 14 after only 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they came to Kurt, he'd probably listen," agent Lon Rosen said. "But 
nothing has been offered." Rambis is scheduled to leave for Argentina on Sunday 
as part of Magic Johnson's all-star tour. . . . Reggie Williams had 27 points 
for the Nuggets. . . . The 63 points by the Lakers were the most they have 
scored in a first half this season.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEY ALL KNUCKLED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nominations for Knucklehead of '93 are now closed. Below we list the 
finalists. You get to vote for the winners. Remember, decision of the judge is 
final. And please -- this is very important -- absolutely no voting for the 
judge as Knucklehead of '93. (Void in sections of Nebraska and Wisconsin. Some 
restrictions may apply.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gunter Parche and Judge Elke Bosse. One day last April, Parche, a 
38-year-old, unemployed lathe operator who lives with his aunt, took a 
nine-inch, curved, jagged boning knife, ran onto a tennis court and stabbed 
Monica Seles so that his heroine, Steffi Graf, could regain her standing as the 
top player in tennis. As punishment, Judge Bosse handed down a stern, 
no-nonsense, almost cruel . . . suspended sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The Houston Oilers. While his wife was giving birth, Oiler lineman David 
Williams was pestered repeatedly in the delivery room to leave in time to catch 
a plane for a game the next day against the New England Patriots. For staying 
behind with his wife, Williams was docked $111,111 in pay and made to feel as 
though he had let down the people most important to him . . . the team.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Belichick. On Nov. 8, midway through the season and without warning, 
the coach of the Cleveland Browns cut the town's most popular athlete, Bernie 
Kosar, deciding instead to proceed at quarterback with Vinnie Testaverde, who 
had talent, charisma . . . and a separated shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 -- "Fan Man." Jim something -- his name doesn't deserve to be in the paper -- 
interrupted the Nov. 6 heavyweight championship fight between Riddick Bowe and 
Evander Holyfield for 21 minutes by parachuting into the ring. Bowe's expectant 
wife, Judy, fainted and his senior-citizen trainer, Eddie Futch, had heart 
palpitations; both were hospitalized overnight. And "Fan Man" was hauled away 
by police, who forced him . . . to pay $200 bail.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Zhang Baifa. Deputy mayor of Beijing and head of China's bid committee for 
the 2000 Summer Olympics, Zhang threatened a boycott of the 1996 Olympics at 
Atlanta should politicians from the U.S. sway a vote in another city's favor. 
Zhang's comments irritated many voters, and Beijing lost on the final ballot to 
Sydney, Australia . . . by two votes.  
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bell. Choosing the beginning of the American League playoffs to 
voice his opinion that Manager Gene Lamont of the Chicago White Sox was not 
much of a manager, Bell's contribution to a six-game series against the Toronto 
Blue Jays was . . . to watch all six games from the bench.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Sky View High football team. In suburban Salt Lake City, players stripped a 
teammate, bound him with tape and paraded classmates of both sexes past him, 
just for fun. After school officials canceled the season, parents were highly 
critical . . . of the victimized boy, for blabbing and whining about such a 
little prank.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Rafael Palmeiro. After asking the Texas Rangers for $40 million for six 
years, Palmeiro responded to their decision to sign Will Clark instead for five 
years and $30 million by calling Clark a "lowlife" and a "mediocre" player with 
"no class." Oh, and Raffy forgot to mention what Will also was . . . his 
college teammate.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Nike. On Sept. 11-12, the "Fab 40 Shootout" sponsored by Nike lured many of 
America's top high school basketball stars to an exhibition with plane fare, 
lodging, gift certificates and shoes. As a reward, most of these players were . 
. . disciplined or suspended for violating National Federation of State High 
School Assns . rules.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pepsi. Seven-foot one-inch client Shaquille O'Neal was advised not to be 
part of the basketball "Dream Team" proudly representing the United State in 
the next Olympics because . . . one of the Olympics' sponsors is Coke.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Pierce. Father of Mary, who is 18 and one of the top players in women's 
tennis, Jim, 57, had to be banned from the pro circuit after persistent 
harassment of his daughter that included a statement, as sworn to in his wife's 
domestic-violence complaint, that: "If you think there was a nut in Waco, Tex., 
you haven't seen anything yet." Since the ban, the effect on Mary's career has 
been . . . her steady rise in the world rankings.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Bridgman High football team. Ten of the 17 players at Bridgman, Mich., 
population 2,140, quit in midseason after two sophomore teammates, twins Chris 
and Corey Reimers, berated their efforts. Chris Reimers Sr. then told the local 
newspaper: "My kids were the best kids on the team. The rest are a bunch of 
spoiled little wusses." Cheerleaders for the Bridgman Bees did their part for 
school spirit after the walkout . . . by ripping the "Go, Bees!" posters from 
the hallways.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Dale Christensen. Football coach at a high school in the Chicago suburb of 
Libertyville, he took a gun, loaded it with blanks and staged his own 
make-believe shooting, complete with fake blood, in the school cafeteria. 
Christensen took this action . . . to fire up his team for a big state playoff 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Dale Hunter. To acknowledge a game-winning goal by Pierre Turgeon of the 
New York Islanders that eliminated the Washington Capitals from the NHL 
playoffs, Hunter skated up to Turgeon, who was celebrating with his arms raised 
in victory, and blindsided him, eliminating Turgeon from the next series. 
Hunter drew a 21-game suspension . . . which he referred to as "extreme."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Tom Werner. A man who purchased and then systematically dismantled a major 
league baseball team, resulting in the San Diego Padres agreeing to trade the 
National League batting champion and National League home run champion . . . to 
San Diego's rivals in the National League.  
</P>
<P>
 Those are the top 15 knucklers. Dishonorable mention goes to: 
</P>
<P>
 Vince (Boom Boom) Coleman and Bret (Bleach Bum) Saberhagen of the New York 
Mets; the three stooges who judged the Chavez-Whitaker fight; playbook-losing 
Malik Sealy of the Indiana Pacers; insulted-by-$69-million Derrick Coleman of 
the New Jersey Nets; head-butting, butt-headed John Starks of the New York 
Knicks; iron-headed, rubber-armed Jose Canseco of the Texas Rangers; 
legend-whipped Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox; PGA golfer-quitter John 
Daly; week-by-week identity changer Michael Jackson-Dyson-Jackson of the 
Cleveland Browns; the California Angels, for unloading a 100% sound Bryan 
Harvey and procuring a 0% sound Kelly Gruber; World Cup soccer promoters, for 
waylaying Pele; timeout-calling Chris Webber of the University of Michigan; 
Manager Don Baylor of the Colorado Rockies, who after the deliberate injuring 
of Dodger infielder Jody Reed advised anyone who didn't like it to "put on a 
dress," and wealthy young retiree Michael Jordan, who scolded "you guys" 28 
times in a room crammed with people who for 10 years had publicly praised and 
adored him. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and America's goat, Leon Lett, who made two runs at the knucklehead top 
15, but forgot to look where he was going.

KINGS BACK IN THE HABIT OF WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were looking frustrated on the ice. You wondered if they were ever going 
to score another power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings? 
</P>
<P>
 No, those were the Kings of two or three weeks ago. The new-look Kings 
defeated Quebec, 5-1, on Tuesday before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum 
and the Nordiques were looking an awful lot like the old Kings, disorganized 
and discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Kings (16-20-3) climbed back into a playoff spot, moving 
into an eighth-place tie with Winnipeg in the Western Conference and three 
points behind seventh-place Vancouver. They are unbeaten in their last five 
games (4-0-1) and are 5-1-1 in their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' penalty killing was flawless as they killed off nine minors and by 
the third period, the Nordiques were yapping at each other. On six of the power 
plays, the Nordiques could not even manage a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky had a hand in four of the five Kings' goals with four assists, 
including three on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing a very physical game on many levels," King Coach Barry Melrose 
said. "We're making teams think before they come out to play us." 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Luc Robitaille scored twice for his 19th and 20th goals of the 
season. Rob Blake scored once and added an assist.  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Granato, who had been out with an inflamed disk in his lower back, played 
in his first game since Dec. 13. He had missed 10 games in all, including nine 
consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really good, my legs got a little tired later," Granato said. "That's 
as good as I've felt all year. I wanted to make sure I played as hard as I 
could physically, to put it out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gretzky: "Tony's been playing injured all year. You could see by his play 
tonight he was playing hard and taking the man and disrupting things. He played 
his best game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Granato hit everything in sight in the first period and assisted on Blake's 
goal at 7:39.  
</P>
<P>
 The prettiest goal of the night was the Kings' final one, by forward Gary 
Shuchuk, who scored unassisted at 16:38 of the third. Shuchuk used a burst of 
speed to get around Alexei Gusarov on the right side and flipped a backhander 
between the pads of goaltender Stephane Fiset.  
</P>
<P>
 Even a bit of controversy didn't seem to bother the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened late in the first period at 15:46 when a shot by Quebec defenseman 
Adam Foote crawled along the goal line behind goaltender Kelly Hrudey and 
Hrudey trapped it at the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal light never went on and none of the replays showed that the puck went 
completely over the line. But referee Richard Trottier requested that the play 
be reviewed and video goal judge Jon Wenkleman almost immediately ruled that it 
was a goal, having taken a look at the overhead replay. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL supervisor Jim Christison was not pleased with the decision, and of 
course, neither was King General Manager Nick Beverley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't comfortable in the decision that the video goal judge made," 
Christison said. "At no point could I see it 100% (over the line).  
</P>
<P>
 "He swears it was in. I guess that's a human error factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Beverley: "It becomes a moot point. There was no mechanism where he 
(Christison) can say anything. In this instance, they're not sitting together. 
Even if they are linked (by phone), this guy (Wenkleman) has the final say." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Gary Shuchuk could have easily become an ex-King or a Phoenix 
Roadrunner when the Kings put him through waivers late last month near the end 
of their tumultuous trip through Canada. He went through waivers unclaimed and 
was not sent to the Kings' minor league team in Phoenix. "At that point in 
time, it didn't look like he was fitting in," King General Manager Nick 
Beverley said. "It wasn't an awful lot different than looking to make a trade. 
But no one took him." Shuchuk has prospered since moving to center. He was one 
of the better players in the Kings' 3-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks on Dec. 
26 and scored the game-winner in a 6-5 victory against Vancouver on Dec. 28. . 
. . Right wing Dave Taylor suffered a blow to the head in a collision with 
Warren Rychel in the second period and did not return.

 I can't decide which is more depressing: new strip malls designed without soul 
or vision from the get-go, primed for faceless dry cleaners and yogurt shops, 
or old '50s and '60s strip malls from which the hope has slowly been leeched by 
years of declining business.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was small, these then-new little centers abounded with as much life, 
mystery and stuff as a kid with 75 cents in his pocket could hope to explore. 
Like so many other things built in the rocket exhaust of the space age, the 
design of the centers seemed to lean optimistically into the future, and, being 
a California innovation, they had a casual, if parking-lot ugly, charm. Now, 
though, these centers don't so much lean as they do teeter on the brink of 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 There is such a center at Springdale Street and Edinger Avenue in Huntington 
Beach, and time has not been kind. The buildings that once were the center's 
"anchors" -- a Toy City and Bank of America -- now sit vacant, leaving the 
small independent businesses remaining to fend for themselves against the 
super-stores and mega-malls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this center sits the Springdale Country Drugstore, which 
clearly hasn't caught on yet that it's supposed to be miserable.  
</P>
<P>
 Remember the Twilight Zone episode where a progress-plagued modern man gets 
off the train at a stop called Willoughby, and he is suddenly transported to an 
idyllic, innocent turn-of-the-century small town?  
</P>
<P>
 This drugstore is more than a little like that: Its shelves and counters are 
all warm wood antiques. Much of the rent-paying display space isn't even taken 
up with items for sale, but with eye-tickling nostrums and remedies from 
another age, such as an ancient bottle labeled "Dr. J.H. McLean's Volcanic Oil 
Liniment."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even with its actual for-sale stock depleted by the Christmas and 
post-Christmas rush, there is still a miraculous clutter to the place, 
abounding with items from pricey hand-painted Limoges boxes to hand-dipped 
chocolate truffles. Everywhere you look, there is a beguiling attention to 
design and detail. And everyone there is so darned nice . The druggist knows 
most of his customers by name, and on this particular day -- the last of the 
old year -- some of them were coming by apparently just to wish him a happy new 
year and shake his hand. "You really feel like you're home here. They put out 
such an effort," says customer Patricia Bandy, who has been coming to the 
drugstore for years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed the oldest drugstore in Huntington Beach, which only dates it 
back 32 years. It didn't start looking really old until 11 years ago when it 
was bought by Harold Marcus and his wife, Karen. Marcus had been the store's 
pharmacist for a dozen years then, and says he and his wife "thought we should 
make a statement. But instead of upgrading it to look more modern, we 
downgraded it to the antique look. I think in our hearts we'd like to go back 
to the old concept of a country store and be the center of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus prefers the term druggist over pharmacist. "There's no distinction 
between them, except in my mind. I've got the doctorate in pharmacy, but when 
people ask I say I'm a druggist, because it's old-fashioned," he says. At 50, 
he looks a bit like a settled-down version of Peter Gabriel, and speaks like he 
lives in a Frank Capra movie, where business people are driven by a vision 
instead of the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in East Los Angeles, Marcus' first high school job in the 1950s was 
at a neighborhood drugstore. It was his goal to be a teacher. "But my employer 
encouraged me to enter an essay contest on why I wanted to become a pharmacist. 
I did it more or less to please him, but I won the contest. That gave me a 
scholarship for my first year at USC and determined where my education was 
going.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never regretted it. This has become a very difficult business, but as 
long as it deals with people and the community, I feel real good about it and 
I'll stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus and his wife -- they were junior high sweethearts and have been married 
for 27 years -- started the redesign with 1800s English apothecary fixtures 
they purchased at auction. Every year since, they've made changes in the decor 
and merchandise to keep it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 When they travel, it's not unusual for them to hit 30 or 40 antique shops in a 
day. Each January the Marcuses go to a huge gift show in Atlanta to scare up 
the "niche market" and cottage industry items in which they specialize. In the 
past couple of years, they've begun carrying country-style clothing and 
diabetic candies. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said, "Most of the typical things people now find in markets, we've 
done away with. We are catering to stepping back in time, like maybe it was 50 
to 100 years ago. I know we could sell more merchandise if we had it there in 
place of all this, but my wife keeps us on track, setting the ambience. Instead 
of having motor oil or canned peanuts stacked in 12 deep, we'd rather create an 
atmosphere. We try to present a traditional feeling to the community. We even 
screen our greeting cards to make sure there's no off-color ones." 
</P>
<P>
 They would love to expand the store to include a soda fountain and other items 
they've had in storage for two years, but might have to find a new location to 
have room for it all.  
</P>
<P>
 They also would prefer to have an older building to match the contents, but 
aren't willing to look very far afield. "This community has been so good to us 
that we don't want to stray out of it," Marcus said.  
</P>
<P>
 For a person who lives in Southern California, he certainly uses the term 
community a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're serious about wanting to be a center to the community. We're committed 
to the community; it isn't that we're just here to make a buck. We're active in 
the high school across the street (a call to Marina High School's Carolyn 
Shirley did indeed yield a gushing list of the Marcuses' good works) and have 
hired some 200 of their students over the years. Local churches come to us for 
support. We're well known in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult time economically, and it's a challenge to not change our 
concept of business, that of giving back to the community what they give you. 
But I believe we have returned to us what we give." 
</P>
<P>
 Though hardly common coin in today's business world, Marcus feels treating 
people well has to be good for business. Moreover, he says, "This is the way 
it's supposed to be. My wife and I were on a buying trip once in an Amish 
community in Indiana. I was buying some antiques in a hardware store, and this 
Amish lady helped me to package the things, and I was so impressed with her 
willingness to help. I told her how taken I was by that, and she just said, 
'Well that's what we're here on Earth for.' That's stuck in my mind for the 
last 10 years, that what we're here for is to help others." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no trouble finding help in the store. Along with Marcus children who 
have worked in the store -- their eldest, Trent, is manager -- they have some 
28 full- or part-time employees. One, Linda Taylor, started as a customer when 
she found she could get her prescription for $10 less there than at a chain 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 "Harold started teasing me that I'd have to get a job because I could never 
leave the store without buying something else up front. It was kind of a joke 
between us, and then one day I asked if they needed help and they did. I've 
worked for them for three years now, and they're as nice to their employees as 
they are to their customers and to each other," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude has netted the store a loyal customer base, which continues 
shopping there even with few other attractions to bring them to the area. There 
even are customers who have moved out of the state who will stop in to visit 
and buy a few items when they are in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus is not certain that will be enough to carry the store through what he 
perceives to be a difficult time ahead for the small pharmacy business. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurance companies and health-maintenance organizations, presumably to 
cut down on paperwork, require their customers to fill their prescriptions at 
large chain stores, even when independents are willing to match the price. 
Marcus was appalled to find that the federal laws against such restraint of 
trade don't apply to health insurers and was more appalled when the local 
school district he's supported for years recently signed a contract with an 
insurer that excludes businesses such as his.  
</P>
<P>
 He called the district, he said, and asked them, "Are you aware that you've 
excluded a business that just yesterday put on a breakfast for all your 
volunteer help?" He was able to persuade them to include him. "That takes care 
of me," he said, "but what about the other people who serve the community?"  
</P>
<P>
 While he sees a very tough time ahead for independents, Marcus says he also 
has sympathy for those working at the chain drugstores, saying he knows of one 
large pharmacy where on a recent day three employees filled 700 prescriptions. 
"They're under the gun all the time and don't have any time to talk to the 
people or know them," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 In his business he knows the name of nearly all of his customers, and more.  
</P>
<P>
 "In knowing about their health issues, you know about their children, their 
hobbies, you know them . And I'm not just here to give medicine; I'm here as a 
person," he said. Marcus says he considers a personal involvement to be 
important, "because fear is a tough thing to give a pill for, and a pill 
doesn't replace understanding. A caring opinion can go a long way. Oft times 
it's ministering to the care-giver: If someone has died, you give comfort. A 
doctor can prescribe a sleeping pill or nerve pill, but that doesn't deal with 
the grief.  
</P>
<P>
 "When someone comes in after finding they have cancer and need to talk to 
someone about it, we have an old church pew here and sometimes I'll pray with 
them. It goes beyond the medicine in the bottle. My wife bought me a sign that 
hangs over the pharmacist's that says 'Faithful Dispensing,' and I'd like it to 
be perceived that way."

 TARGETING DEALERS: Judging by the Yellow Pages, Ventura County has fewer than 
two dozen gun shops. So why do 610 county residents have federal gun-dealer 
licenses? . . . Most sell guns out of their homes or use the license to buy 
weapons wholesale for personal use, federal officials say. That number may drop 
dramatically if a tenfold increase in the license fee is approved (A10). . . . 
At Sportsmen's Exchange in Oxnard, Tony Montemorra opposes the increase -- as 
punitive, even though it could drive low-rent competitors out of business. . . 
. His plan to reduce the number of gun-sellers: "Turn their names over to the 
Franchise Tax Board. Let's see if they're paying taxes on those gun sales." 
</P>
<P>
 CHUMASH RITES: Descendants of the Chumash Indians are upset about road work at 
what may have been a Chumash cemetery near Camarillo (B1). But disturbing 
graves didn't bother their ancestors, said Jan Timbrook, anthropologist at the 
Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. . . . "When it came time to bury 
someone, they would dig up an old grave," she said. "There wasn't much concern 
about previous burials.". . . When someone died, the Chumash believed the soul 
lingered a few days, then journeyed west to Point Conception for purification 
before crossing the ocean to the land of the dead. . . . Remnants of Chumash 
culture crop up often in Ventura County and the surrounding area. About 20,000 
Chumash lived here when Europeans arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 HOMEWARD BOUND: He was born in Da Nang but grew up in Minnesota and Arizona. 
His only images of Vietnam come from the movies. So Cal Lutheran student Micah 
Reitan will soon head to Hanoi to get a taste of his native land (B4). . . . 
More than 2,300 Ventura County residents claim Vietnamese heritage, and nearly 
1,800 speak Vietnamese at home. 
</P>
<P>
 DREAM TEAM: For Newbury Park's football team, a dream season continues with 
the selection of three players to the All-Southern Section team -- more than 
any other school (C6). . . . Westlake and Buena each had one player on the 
team, chosen by a panel of sportswriters.

CHUMASH GROUP THREATENS TO BLOCK ROADWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Native American organization warned the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday that its members would physically block the county from resuming 
work on a Santa Rosa Road improvement project to protect what they believe to 
be an ancient Chumash Indian burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Thousand Oaks-based California Indian Council/Chumash 
organization told the board that they are also preparing to file a lawsuit 
against the county if necessary to stop further work at the site east of 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council leadership, members and other members of the Native American 
community are prepared to stand in front of any type of construction equipment 
that has the intent to destroy this significant Chumash site," said Reginald S. 
Pagaling, spokesman for the council. Legal action is also being considered "to 
protect our ancestors' rights and remains," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County crews discovered a tooth and bone fragments Dec. 22 during grading 
operations on the two-lane road. A county coroner's deputy examined the site 
recently and said the remains may be human, halting both the roadwork and 
archeological excavations. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state law, county officials and the California Native 
American Heritage Commission arranged for the site to be inspected by a woman 
whom commission officials consider most likely to be related to the dead 
person. The woman is expected to recommend soon what to do with the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagaling said the council approached the board Tuesday after becoming 
increasingly frustrated with the way the county's Public Works Department 
handled the discovery. He said county officials have resisted complying with 
the recommendations of council archeologists, who say that under state and 
federal law, the site must be further studied for possible historical and 
religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
 But W. Butch Britt, the county's deputy director of public works in charge of 
the project, said a previous archeological study found inconclusive evidence of 
human remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intention of running anyone over at the construction site," Britt 
said. "We are trying to be as sensitive to this as we can be, and we are trying 
to keep an open mind. Still, we have yet to see any compelling evidence 
indicating the presence of human remains there." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee C. Fraser, a Simi Valley-based archeologist who works for the council, 
said a more thorough study is needed before construction resumes. Fraser said 
she and other archeologists found five separate locations at the site that bore 
evidence of possible human remains. 
</P>
<P>
 She said such a study is mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act 
and the National Historic Preservation Act because the site could be an ancient 
Chumash burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt, however, said that with no hard evidence of human remains at the site, 
such a study could cost more than $1,000 a day and could take as long as a 
month to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a road that carries about 10,000 cars a day," Britt said. "I just 
don't personally see the need for such a study at this time. If further 
evidence is found, then I'll be happy to reassess the situation then." 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's meeting, Supervisor Vicky Howard asked staff members to 
compile a status report on the site. After the meeting, Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee, whose 3rd District encompasses the site, said the council's message was 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "These folks were obviously upset and wanted us to be aware of their concerns. 
They did that," Kildee said. "If the site is found to be significant, then we 
will deal with it. My position is that if we need to do a more detailed study 
of the area, then we will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn echoed Kildee's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their main goal was to get our attention and they did that," Flynn 
said.

REPORT ON EXPANSION PLAN FOR HOSPITAL OKD; SUPERVISORS: APPROVAL OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR VENTURA COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER PROJECT COMES WITH 
LITTLE PUBLIC OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving forward with plans to renovate and expand the Ventura County Medical 
Center, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved the project's 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted 5 to 0 to approve the plan, which calls for building a 
mental health hospital, general outpatient clinic, new medical examiner's 
office, morgue and parking garage at the hospital complex on Loma Vista Road in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the hospital had earlier lobbied against the expansion, saying 
it would create pollution and mar their ocean view. But the county apparently 
mollified the opposition by scaling down the garage and moving it away from 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the half-dozen speakers who addressed the board Tuesday 
supported the $47-million project, which county officials say could be financed 
mostly through state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't exactly an accident that there were very few people here against 
the project," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey told the board. "We've gone a long way 
toward making them happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion plan first came before the board in April. But after heated 
objections from residents on Agnus Drive, supervisors delayed action until the 
county conducted an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet said that by moving the parking 
structure away from Agnus Drive, the complex would pose few problems to 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a project that is sorely needed," Goulet said. "The facility is going to 
be beneficial to the entire community for a long time to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will now apply to the state to pay for the outpatient unit and 
garage, which together will cost nearly $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About $9 million in state and county money has already been approved for the 
medical examiner's office and the mental health hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillipp K. Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency, said he 
hopes to start construction of the medical examiner's office within a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the old buildings used for outpatient care behind the county hospital 
have become so dilapidated that portions have been abandoned, he said. The 
structures will be torn down to make room for the new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medical examiner's office is literally in a tin building," Wessels said. 
"The family practice doctors see patients in a structure that is over 50 years 
old. We need simply to replace these buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 A completed building plan is scheduled to go back to the board for approval by 
June. If the county obtains the state funding as planned, the outpatient center 
and parking garage will be completed within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels said that expanding the outpatient facility could help the hospital 
provide more care to Medi-Cal recipients, who make up 70% of patients. It could 
also save money by decreasing overnight stays of indigent patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of health care is going to be in the outpatient arena," Wessels 
said. "It is going to be very important for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Thayer, a nurse at the medical center, told the supervisors that the 
county must improve its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just say rip the place down and rebuild it," Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanyard Dial, a hospital physician, added: "It's cramped, and it's falling 
down around us. The necessity of this building is without a doubt."

PANEL BACKS DROPPING PORT HUENEME BEACH TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens advisory group has recommended that Port Hueneme drop its 
controversial beach maintenance district and instead make property owners 
across the city help maintain public beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of a citywide assessment district could help mend a rift between the 
city and beachfront residents who charge that the maintenance fees amount to a 
view tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can now start the healing of the wounds that were created when 
the city formed the beach maintenance district," said Dorothy Blake, who sued 
the city over the beach district and served on the advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to be presented tonight to the Port Hueneme City Council, the Blue 
Ribbon Task Force will urge the city to merge the beach and park assessment 
districts and spread three-fourths of the cost across all the city's 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would lower taxes of residents within the beach district by as 
much as $150 a year but increase taxes on other residents by roughly $18 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consensus was that a single citywide district would be more equitable," 
said Councilman Dorill B. Wright, chairman of the seven-member advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the proposed district, each of the city's 7,100 residential 
properties would be assessed an annual tax of $54.77. Owners of property near 
four parks and the beach would be charged an additional tax ranging from $9.40 
for neighbors of Bubbling Springs Park to $47.33 for residents near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With a combined base rate and proximity fee, the new district would closely 
resemble the existing park district that was approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme property owners now pay an annual tax of $36.78 to maintain the 
city's parks, and an additional fee of between $9.28 and $13.66 depending on 
their proximity to the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city raised $300,000 from residents in the park district. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the council approved the beach maintenance district in 1991, coast-area 
owners have paid between $79 and $207 a year, depending on how close they live 
to the beach. Last year, the city raised $157,000 in revenues from beach 
district property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Total revenue from the new district is designed to match the $457,500 the city 
now collects from the two separate districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force, who were chosen to represent five neighborhoods in 
Port Hueneme, differed in their views of the city's two assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that the maintenance of a public beach that is an asset to the 
whole community should somehow be paid for by people living across the street 
is unfair," Blake said. She and eight other beach residents have sued the city 
over creation of the beach district. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake's viewpoint contrasts sharply with that of Penny Bohannon, a task force 
member who lives north of Channel Islands Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't benefit that much from the beach," said Bohannon, who added that her 
neighbors must pay a $4 parking fee when they visit the Port Hueneme beach. "We 
thought the Beach Maintenance Assessment District was fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridging the two viewpoints was important, if not easy, participants agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not total agreement, but we all agreed that what we proposed we 
could all support," said Councilwoman Toni Young, a critic of the beach 
assessment district who served on the task force. Young described the proposed 
district as "an 8 on a fairness scale from 1 to 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said the task force strived to reach a fair settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, a 75-25 split is the best we could hope for," Blake said. "In a 
democracy, compromise is what it's all about."

ENFORCED COURTESY; SCHOOLS SAY NEW STATE LAW HAS CUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON 
CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, 16-year-old Andi Baehne sometimes could not make it through a day 
at Camarillo High School without hearing one of her male classmates comment on 
her looks. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, she has noticed a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep their mouths closed more this year than before," she said. "They're 
being a lot more courteous." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference? Andi and some Camarillo High staff point to a new state law 
that allows schools to suspend or even expel students who sexually harass their 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the law, which took effect in 1993, school districts around the 
county began in the fall to train teachers and educate students in fourth 
through eighth grades about what sexual harassment is and why it is harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway into this school year, some school officials say they are still 
skeptical that the new law is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But many students, teachers and administrators say the law is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state law, every school district has formed its own policy on sexual 
harassment, setting up procedures for students to follow when making 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy on sexual harassment gives students a new term to identify an old 
problem, encouraging them to complain about offensive behavior or comments that 
they previously may have let pass, some school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a title for a problem that didn't have a title before," said Kathy 
Greaves, assistant principal at Camarillo High School. "We've had more kids 
come in and verbalize it and put a label on it. We gave them an avenue to deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Camarillo High established its sexual harassment policy in the fall, it 
has handled about six cases of reported harassment, all for verbal rather than 
physical offenses, Greaves said. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, she said, school officials don't punish the youths accused of 
harassment but instead talk to them to try to make them more aware of their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some school officials and students are concerned that the policy 
could open the door to unfair accusations or disciplinary action against young 
people who did not intend their behavior or comments to be rude. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve W. Stocks, a trustee of the Oxnard Union High School District board that 
oversees Camarillo High and four other high schools, voiced skepticism about 
whether sexual harassment is a significant enough problem on campuses to 
warrant its own policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A former high school principal in Oxnard, Stocks said he is particularly 
concerned that the state law defines "leering" as a form of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Leer' is going to be a tough one to substantiate," Stocks said. "What if 
you were a guy that had a kind of a sneer on your lips that was permanent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys at Camarillo High said they have still not figured out when their 
behavior toward girls may fall under the definition of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say anything to a girl, and they can say 'sexual harassment,' " 
16-year-old Steve Littlefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow student John Caligiuri agreed: "It's really stressful because you 
wonder if you're sexually harassing someone or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Greaves agreed that a comment could be perceived as sexual harassment by one 
student and a compliment by another. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to defining whether behavior constitutes sexual harassment, Greaves 
said, is to decide how the it was received: "The key word is unwanted ." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials at elementary and middle schools around the county are also 
using sexual harassment policies to make students more sensitive to how their 
classmates interpret each others' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura, Principal Kris Bergstrom said she has 
disciplined some students this year for sexual harassment, including sending 
one boy to the school counselor for guidance on distinguishing inappropriate 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergstrom said she has noticed some improvement in how the sixth- through 
eighth-grade boys and girls at the school act toward each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest success so far of the school's new teaching on the policy is 
that it has bolstered the courage of students who feel offended by another 
child's comments or actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are so sensitized that they're real quick to say 'Hey, back off. I don't 
want you to do that to me,' " Bergstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that school districts address the problem of sexual 
harassment down through the fourth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley has extended its instruction about appropriate and 
inappropriate behavior to all elementary school students, even those in first 
grade, said Susan Parks, assistant superintendent of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activities that have been common on elementary school playgrounds for 
many years, such as boys flipping up girls' dresses, fall under the category of 
sexual harassment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District has already suspended at least two 
elementary school students under the new policy, she said, in addition to a few 
middle and high school students. The suspended elementary children were 
fourth-grade boys who had played "pantsy" by running by a group of girls and 
trying to yank down the girls' pants. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all elementary school officials consider some of the games between 
young children as sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 At Montalvo School in Ventura, Principal Marie Atmore said all of her teachers 
have been trained to keep an eye out for sexual harassment among their 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atmore said elementary schoolchildren are generally too young to engage in 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there's not any girl-boy relationship yet," she said. "Their 
biggest tease is to say something nasty about somebody's mother. That's the 
biggest put-down they can do right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although girls sometimes complain about boys pushing open the door to the 
girls' bathroom, Atmore said she treats the problem as the boys being 
mischievous rather than as sexually harassing the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done that since the beginning of time," Atmore said. "They're still 
children and that's refreshing."

BACKERS SEEK TO REINSTATE CLERK'S RAISE; OXNARD: DANIEL MARTINEZ'S SUPPORTERS 
SAY HE IS A VICTIM OF PETTY POLITICS. THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS ITS AIM WAS 
FAIRNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rankled by the suspension of an automatic pay raise for Oxnard City Clerk 
Daniel Martinez, his supporters have embarked on a campaign they say is aimed 
at reversing that decision and restoring full independence to his elected 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members contend that the effort is misguided, saying all they 
are trying to do is bring Martinez's pay raise in line with those of other top 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, supporters say they have collected hundreds of signatures from 
residents angered by a City Council vote in November to rescind the city 
clerk's pay hike for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Martinez said this week that he will sue the city if his client 
does not receive the 5% pay increase by Jan. 12, the day after the City Council 
is expected to consider the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez supporters vow to attend that meeting and demand that Martinez be 
treated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that he is being attacked without good cause," said Oxnard business 
owner Tila Estrada, who helped circulate the petition in support of Martinez. 
"It's petty politics. They are questioning his ability to do his job, and 
that's a decision that should be left to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members say their vote to suspend the automatic salary increase 
is not an attack against the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and all other top managers are being converted to a "pay for 
performance" system of securing pay raises, council members said. They say the 
issue isn't whether Martinez deserves a raise, but whether his raise should be 
automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that we had to stay consistent with our pay raises," said 
Councilman Tom Holden, noting that the top raise given to other city employees 
was 3.5%. "There is no way I could justify a 5% pay increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his election in November, 1992 -- when he unseated Mabi Covarrubias 
Plisky, longtime city clerk and wife of Councilman Michael Plisky -- Martinez 
has been involved in a series of City Hall flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 He was openly critical of the city's decision to hire Mabi Plisky to work in 
the Police Department's crime prevention unit after her failed reelection bid. 
She was eventually removed from the position amid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he came under fire from residents for failing to submit minutes of 
City Council meetings in a timely manner. Late last year, to fulfill a campaign 
promise, Martinez donated $2,750 of his $46,840 base salary to local charities, 
an unprecedented move for an Oxnard official. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Martinez pledges to donate his raise -- which would amount to more 
than $2,300 -- to charity. The issue isn't money, he said, but the integrity of 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the independence of my office is being threatened," said 
Martinez, noting that the city clerk's position as advertised during the 
election included an automatic pay hike. "I want them to respect the vote of 
the voters who elected me into office." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, a week before they were scheduled to take effect, the Oxnard City 
Council voted 4 to 1 to temporarily rescind automatic raises for the city clerk 
and city treasurer, pending evaluations of the two positions that have yet to 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision only affects Martinez because City Treasurer Dale Belcher is 
already at the top of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Plisky -- who has clashed with Martinez on a number of issues, 
including the criticism of his wife when she was hired by the Police Department 
-- said no one is trying to undermine the independence of the city clerk's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky added that it is only fair that Martinez's pay raise be tied in to his 
job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shouldn't be any problem if his performance is adequate," Plisky said. 
"Maybe the fact that he is putting up such a fuss means his performance is 
questionable and maybe that's a good reason for doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez was the only councilman in favor of retaining the automatic 
pay raises, saying that anything less could jeopardize the independence of the 
elected positions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city clerk and treasurer were given automatic raises to free them 
from the political pressure of either the City Council or the city manager's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez also questions whether council members can suspend an ordinance, the 
highest form of law in city government, without amending it or adopting a new 
one. The ordinance laying out the pay guidelines was suspended by a simple 
council vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot undo an ordinance with a motion," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is also what attorney Mitchel B. Kahn believes. Hired by Martinez to 
battle City Hall, Kahn contends that the city's vote was improper and that it 
undermines the independence of the elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are playing around with the city clerk's job," Kahn said. "All 
we want them to do is play by their rules." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gary Gillig has advised council members that the ordinance is 
written in such a way that it can be suspended or rescinded by council vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate what Mr. Kahn is trying to do, but I think the case for his 
client is extremely thin," Gillig said. "I would expect a court not to be very 
sympathetic to his position." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino Coalition for Fair Representation, a Ventura County group formed in 
1991 to lend support to Latino officeholders, has been reviewing the matter but 
decided Monday not to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Hernandez, co-chairman of the coalition and a member of the Rio Elementary 
School District board of trustees, said members of the group were concerned 
that Martinez's office was being weakened by the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that Danny has his legal representation and that there's no 
point in getting involved," Hernandez said. "I really believe all of the things 
are in place for everything to be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said that is his hope as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get this thing settled; that's still my main goal," he said. "I'm 
just asking the City Council to do what's right."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; GENERAL PLAN TO BE DISCUSSED AT 
HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing on the city of Port Hueneme's first revision of its General 
Plan since 1977 will be held at 7:30 p.m. tonight at the Port Hueneme City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because only 53 acres remain undeveloped within the boundaries of Port 
Hueneme, the new plan calls for few changes in land use, according to Tom Figg, 
the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The updated General Plan is more a refinement of existing policy than it is a 
statement of new direction," Figg said in a report that was submitted to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which spells out the future of development in the city through the 
2015, identifies 18 blighted properties totaling 61 acres that could be 
redeveloped in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan calls for a slight reduction in the city's total acreage reserved 
for residential development, but creates a new land-use designation of 
mixed-use development for 20 acres. Overall, the proposed plan revision allows 
the addition of 1,067 more dwelling units in the city, 390 units less than the 
previous plan allows. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed plan, 250,000 square feet of new commercial building could 
be built in Port Hueneme, 419,000 square feet of light industrial facilities 
and 97,000 square feet of port-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plan's proposed changes are a ban on the use of billboards, new 
regulations governing second-story residential additions and permit 
streamlining for the Oxnard Harbor District. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was prepared with the assistance of a General Plan Advisory Committee 
comprised of 26 residents, which met 16 times since March,1992. PATRICK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CITY TO PROCEED WITH WORK ON FREEWAY 
BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction on a long-awaited project to replace a congested Camarillo 
freeway overpass will begin this year despite a lack of funding from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo will spend $3.5 million in developer fees and federal 
highway money to replace a 30-year-old, two-lane overpass at Carmen Drive with 
a four-lane road. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-month project, scheduled to begin in September, is part of an 
$11-million plan by Camarillo and the California Department of Transportation 
to ease congestion near the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo has agreed to pay about $6.5 million, but so far has only the $3.5 
million in its budget. Caltrans has agreed to spend $4.5 million, but has no 
money in its 1993-94 budget for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the rest of the project, which includes realigning Ventura 
Boulevard, was not included in Caltrans' list of projects for 1994, which was 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Caltrans-funded project is planned for Ventura County -- $565,000 to 
widen a half-mile stretch of Moorpark Avenue from High Street to Casey Road in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, city officials decided to begin a portion of the project in 
response to complaints about traffic backups, even though Caltrans has not come 
up with its share of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem now and it's not going to get any better," City Manager 
William Little said. "We might as well go ahead and get it done to make it 
workable." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city would hire Caltrans workers to construct the bridge and 
install two traffic signals. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TRUSTEES TO WEIGH NAMING SCHOOL, GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's school trustees will attempt to sort out the politically charged 
process of naming schools and buildings in their district tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider names for the gymnasium at the soon-to-be-opened 
Robert J. Frank Intermediate School and for a new school planned in northeast 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees have proposed forming a committee of Oxnard School District 
representatives and community members to consider names for both the building 
and the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the largely Latino district have approached the board during recent 
meetings to express interest in the naming process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make sure this board is not stacked against us," said Carlos 
Aguilera, president of La Colonia Neighborhood Council. "Given the population 
of the district, a lot of people feel strongly that schools or buildings here 
should have a Hispanic name." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither facility will likely be named soon, Supt. Norman Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the board needs to take time to consider these decisions," Brekke 
said. "Of course, with the naming of the school, this is very early to get 
started. We haven't even purchased the land yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The northeast Oxnard school is scheduled to open in 1997, and the Frank school 
will open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Suter, president of the trustees, said the board would try to establish 
the committees at the regular 7:30 p.m. meeting so they can begin the naming 
process right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll probably have a lot of options to consider," Suter said. "Whatever 
names they end up using, I'm sure people will be happy with what's decided."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; STREET STILL CLOSED AMID OIL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic remained blocked along Harbor Boulevard in Oxnard on Tuesday while 
crews hired by Bush Oil Co. continued to clean up as much of the 84,000 gallons 
of heavy crude oil as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late Tuesday, workers had made no measurable progress on the cleanup, 
reporting instead that the number of gallons recovered to date is stalled at 
about 61,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers dressed in protective clothing cleared away wide patches of brush on 
the west side of Harbor Boulevard, while crews on the opposite side of the 
street prepared to remove the aging pipeline from under the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, the number of birds killed from the county's worst pipeline 
spill in decades increased by 25. Officials said 163 shore birds have died so 
far, with another 27 reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Tuesday that corrosion inside the pipe may have caused an 
18-inch split along a seam in the section dug up earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Samo of the State Fire Marshal's Office said the split likely was not 
caused by currents from nearby pipelines' electric safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interference causes corrosion outside the pipe wall," Samo said. "No one 
reported to me that they saw any external corrosion on the pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that 59% of pipeline leaks are caused by external 
corrosion. But officials said they do not suspect that to be the case in the 
Bush Oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top two (causes) on the list obviously are structural failure or internal 
corrosion," said Bill Guerard of the state division of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Taft-based Berry Petroleum, which owns Bush Oil and is 
responsible for the costs of cleaning up the spill, declined to comment Tuesday 
on what may have led to the pipe's corrosion.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; FED-UP NEIGHBORS FORM CITIZENS PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with crime encroaching on their homes, six Santa Paula neighbors have 
formed a citizens patrol to work in concert with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe you can complain about a problem and then not do anything," 
said Huguette Johnson, who with her husband, David, started the patrol. "We 
supposedly lived in the best part of town, but the amount of graffiti and 
burglaries here shocked me." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she and her husband were pushed into action after confronting two 
young men who were trying to break into their house. They went to the police 
and the City Council asking for a bigger police presence in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw the debate over the budget, we knew there wasn't money for more 
patrols," Johnson said, "so we decided to form our own." 
</P>
<P>
 The group modeled its program after similar patrols throughout Ventura County. 
These citizen patrols take the idea of a Neighborhood Watch one step further, 
actually becoming incorporated into the Police Department and taking orders 
from a watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers in Santa Paula will receive police training, radios and 
cellular phones. The city and Police Department in turn will assume a certain 
amount of liability if a volunteer is injured on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Chief Walt Adair said proper training and limiting the 
duties of the volunteers will reduce the city's potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will avoid both physical and verbal contact with suspects and 
primarily report any strange activity on their watch. That alone, Adair said, 
would help his department fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an effort by a group of people who recognized the limits of the 
department to handle all the demands placed on it," Adair said Monday at a City 
Council meeting, before the council voted unanimously to approve formation of 
the group. "This shows that volunteerism is not part of the past." SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; BOY, 16, TO BE TRIED AS ADULT IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ruled Tuesday that a 16-year-old boy charged in the fatal stabbing of 
a Fillmore man Dec. 11 should be tried as an adult in connection with the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Murillo of Fillmore will be arraigned Jan. 13 in Ventura County 
Superior Court.The youth is being held in juvenile detention in lieu of 
$250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Molina Mora, 27, was stabbed during an altercation in the 700 block of 
Blaine Street in Fillmore about 3:40 a.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Public Defender Steve Lipson had asked Judge Steven Z. Perren 
to delay his decision on whether to try Murillo as an adult until after hearing 
witnesses testify. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perren denied the attorney's request. The judge made the ruling after 
hearing arguments from attorneys and reading a probation report on the 
defendant's background. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley argued that Murillo could not be 
rehabilitated in the state's juvenile system. He cited an extensive juvenile 
record by the defendant and what he called aggravating circumstances 
surrounding Mora's death. DWAYNE BRAY

TOM ELY'S LEGAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That Tom Ely's life was ended prematurely by a terrible, disfiguring cancer 
was very sad. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of a tragic turn of events, the facts of Ely's troubles should not be 
altered.There is an apparent attempt by some to transfer blame for Ely's 
troubles to someone else. This is reflected in the quotation attributed to 
Ely's wife, Ingrid: ". . . There was never any problem until Michael Bradbury 
decided he didn't want Tom to be a supervisor and tried to cut his throat," and 
in the statement of Patrick Hughes: ". . . the scandal that consumed Ely's 
final years was orchestrated for political reasons to thwart his bid for the 
supervisor's seat." 
</P>
<P>
 As your article correctly stated, Ely had his day in court. The verdict was 
that Dist. Atty. Bradbury was correct in bringing the charges against Ely, who 
was tried and convicted on charges of embezzlement and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 History should reflect that Ely was not a strong contender for a seat on the 
Board of Supervisors. It should also reflect that Bradbury was carrying out the 
mandate of his office in bringing the charges against Ely. If there had been no 
substance to the charges or if the court had felt that they were unfounded, 
they would have been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely's misuse of Ventura County Community College District funds, when funding 
for the educational programs of the colleges was very tight, was egregious and 
deserved the attention that it received in the newspapers and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife states that "Tom never felt that he did anything wrong. . . ." A 
careful reading of the reports of his trial would convince any impartial person 
that he did do wrong. The district attorney should not be blamed for Tom Ely's 
troubles because Tom Ely brought them upon himself.

A SURFER'S HEROISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, Jeff Maxwell proved himself to be a local hero. My husband, Jack, 
was surfing at a spot called the Pipes in Ventura.He and Jeff were paddling 
back out to get more waves when Jack was run into by another surfer. He was hit 
in the neck, knocked unconscious and was beneath the surface of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff, the surfer who hit Jack came to help, but Jeff reached him 
first. Jeff pulled Jack out of the water, got him onto a larger board and then 
both surfers helped him to the shore. Realizing that Jack was disoriented, Jeff 
stayed with him, helped him to his car, helped him change and called me. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived, Jack was still in a state of shock and confusion, not even 
knowing what day or month it was. We went to the emergency room for X-rays and 
medical attention. He has a fracture in one cervical vertebrae and a very sore, 
stiff and bruised neck, but so far seems to be recovering well. 
</P>
<P>
 When we called Jeff to thank him for saving Jack's life, he humbly answered, 
"Just another day at the beach." Thanks to Jeff, Jack is still here to have 
some more days at the beach.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BRADBURY TO SEEK 5TH TERM AS D. A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said Tuesday that he will seek 
a fifth term this year as the county's top prosecutor, adding that he would 
like to finish the job he started in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1990s will be increasingly difficult times," Bradbury said. "The trend 
toward violent crime is rising at an alarming rate, and I want to continue to 
send the strong message that criminal activity will not be tolerated in Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he wanted to make the announcement early so that supporters 
would know his intentions. Thousand Oaks attorney Charles W. Chen and Oxnard 
developer Martin V. Smith will serve as co-chairmen of Bradbury's reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican who is widely viewed as one of the toughest district attorneys in 
California, Bradbury said he is unsure whether he will be opposed for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Starr, chairman of the Democratic Central Committee, said no one in his 
party has come forward to challenge Bradbury in the nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura defense attorney Louis B. (Chuck) Samonsky, a former prosecutor, said 
he had thought about opposing Bradbury, but has ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Samonsky said he decided against running because his 17-year-old son 
will be going to college in the fall. He said he wants to spend more time at 
home with his son this year instead of on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he did not think that the recent controversy with Los Angeles 
County Sheriff Sherman Block would adversely impact his reelection chances. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been criticized by Block and state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren for a March 
report in which Bradbury criticized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's ill-fated drug raid of a Ventura County ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's report concluded that Sheriff's Deputy Gary Spencer shot 
gun-wielding rancher Donald P. Scott in self-defense during the raid, but also 
found that the deputy should not have been on Scott's ranch in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure it was the most popular decision, making the most powerful 
Republican sheriff in the country unhappy," Bradbury said of Block. But he said 
he has gotten a lot of positive feedback from Ventura County residents over his 
stance. DWAYNE BRAY

GILL NET BAN DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reading the Dec. 26 article titled "Local Gill Netters Hope Court Will 
Rescue Industry," it appears that your reporter is extremely gullible, in 
addition to having an abysmal lack of knowledge about oceanography and fishing. 
He states that "although gill netting will be permitted outside the three-mile 
limit, most of the boats are too small to safely operate that far from shore 
during harsh weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Has he ever seen a gill-netting boat? Most of these are no smaller than 40 
feet in length and capable of handling most seas found in our offshore waters. 
In addition, the waters within the three-mile limit are traditionally more 
turbulent because of a phenomenon called "wave reflection." This occurs where 
the swells are reflected off the beach and cross the incoming swells. Does he 
realize that the gill netters set their nets and then go home to sleep while 
the storms are raging? They don't have to go out in "harsh weather," and the 
Ventura coast is not the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill netters are unhappy because they are about to be barred from the inshore 
spawning grounds and fish nurseries. For decades, they have depleted the 
spawning stock of bass, white sea bass, barracuda and halibut that swim into 
the shallows to mate and lay their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reporter is correct in one observation: Gill nets are "walls of death" in 
which any species caught is killed. Some of these nets are more than five miles 
long and extend from the surface of the ocean to the bottom. The gill netters 
have refused conservationist alternatives as "too expensive" and continue to 
catch and kill undersized and otherwise illegal fish. They do not realize that 
the fish will disappear if you indiscriminately kill the spawning stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, gill netters are entitled to earn a living, but not in the spawning 
grounds. They are not being put out of business but are just going to have to 
stop "shooting fish in a barrel" within shooting range of the beach. Let's face 
it, three miles out is not even one-eighth of the way to Anacapa and Santa Cruz 
islands, where most commercial fishing boats go, but it is out of the spawning 
grounds where they can set their death nets and catch everything 
indiscriminately.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Thousand Oaks woman was sexually assaulted and robbed at 
knifepoint in a midday attack at a Ventura County beach, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was sunbathing at La Conchita Beach along the Ventura Freeway at 
noon Monday when she was approached by a man.He first tried to engage the woman 
in conversation and then left the area, said Sgt. John Fitzgerald of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department major crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were other sunbathers on the beach, no one noticed when the man 
returned an hour later with a knife and forced the woman to move into a 
drainage tunnel at the edge of the beach, Fitzgerald said. The man forced her 
to disrobe and then sexually assaulted her, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant stole the woman's money and credit cards, then told her to count 
to 100 before she left the tunnel or he would kill her, the Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was treated at Ventura County Medical Center and released, 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department described the suspect as a white male 36 to 40 years 
old, with short brown hair and a thick mustache. He was wearing a white T-shirt 
and baggy blue jeans. The department is encouraging anyone with information to 
contact the major crimes unit at 654-2331 or 654-2311. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 In a change of command for the new year, Ventura County Supervisor Vicky 
Howard on Tuesday was named chairwoman of the board for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who served as the board's assistant chairwoman last year, will replace 
Susan K. Lacey in the leadership position. 
</P>
<P>
 Every January, the supervisors rotate one of their colleagues into the slot. 
Howard will be responsible for making sure that the meetings are conducted in 
an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I will enjoy it," said Howard, who has served on the board since 
1990. "I always enjoy challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk was named assistant chairwoman and 
will fill in for Howard when she is absent. 
</P>

LINES AT POST OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My fellow workers and I at the Thousand Oaks Post Office were very upset to 
find your front page caption, "Long Lines, Big Boxes: No Holiday at the Post 
Office." 
</P>
<P>
 I would like your readers to know that this caption is anything but correct.At 
the Thousand Oaks Post Office, we are proud to be an office that is dedicated 
to providing window services in five minutes or less, even during the holiday 
season. This goal is a new directive for the Postal Service thanks to our 
Postmaster General Marvin Runyon, as well as local Postmaster Douglas Leeds, 
who is very customer service-oriented. During the photographer's visit, our 
line averaged between three to eight people -- not what most patrons would 
consider a long line, especially with five to seven clerks working behind the 
counter and not to mention our busiest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 This improved service is a result of several new measures now in place at our 
Thousand Oaks Main Office. One of those is the lobby director program, designed 
to answer questions, help customers with various forms and provide mailing 
supplies during peak hours. Through this program, our customers' transactions 
are prepared before they reach the counter, and this dramatically speeds up any 
wait in line. We have received very favorable comments since the inception of 
this program. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that the Los Angeles Times chooses to continue with the same 
old stereotype about the U. S. Postal Service instead of reporting the true 
story: "Short Lines, Improved Service: Happy Holidays From Your Post Office."

DRUNK DRIVING'S TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An open letter to a drunk driver: 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Dec. 22, 1993, three days before Christmas, you killed a friend 
and employee of ours. She was only 26 years old, lovely, vibrant and alive, and 
you ended her life while escaping unscathed yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 You not only deprived her mother of her beloved daughter, and her friends and 
co-workers of a well-loved friend, you deprived the world of a wonderful 
person. She wanted to be a veterinarian, and you deprived the world of a 
bright, intelligent and compassionate lover of animals. She was kind and 
caring, funny and wonderful, and you destroyed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever legal ramifications arise form this tragic incident, whatever 
punishment is inflicted on you, legally and spiritually, it can never make up 
for what you did, for the agony you have caused and the lives you have 
destroyed. Whether you spend years in prison, or get the proverbial slap on the 
wrist, you will never atone for the destruction that resulted from your 
decision to ignore the fact that you were obviously too impaired to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing this letter because I am very, very angry. But more important, 
perhaps you, and others like you, will stop and think about the pain and misery 
you may be causing by your carelessness and your selfishness. Perhaps you will 
remember what you did to this lovely woman on Dec. 22, 1993, three days before 
Christmas.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY OKS PLANS FOR PLAZA GRAND 
OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to celebrate a $64-million building in style, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council on Tuesday approved plans for a glitzy grand opening weekend at the 
Civic Arts Plaza later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The $317,500 budget calls for a variety of events for all ages and income 
levels, from a performance featuring local talent to a black-tie gathering 
after a splashy inaugural show. 
</P>
<P>
 The party -- which also celebrates Thousand Oaks' 30th birthday -- will take 
place the weekend of Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza will technically open in September when the City Council 
and Planning Commission meet in the 400-seat theater. Tentative plans call for 
a local company to present "Man of La Mancha" in the theater in September as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gala affair will wait until the 1,800-seat auditorium opens in October 
with performances by a big-name pop singer, as yet unsigned, and the Conejo 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this type of grand opening in order to build awareness throughout 
Southern California about what we have here in Thousand Oaks," said Larry 
Sparrow, a member of the Civic Theaters Commission.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY REDUCES MIDDAY FARES ON BUS ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost ridership and cut down on smog, the city of Simi Valley has 
cut midday fares back to 1989 rates on its four fixed bus routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this week, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., regular fares have been 
reduced from 75 cents to 50 cents.The fare for senior citizens and disabled 
riders will drop from 25 cents to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction will remain in place at least until May, when the City Council 
will decide whether to keep the midday special in place, Simi Valley Transit 
Administrator Ray Turpin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership has increased steadily over the past five years, Turpin said. In 
fiscal year 1991-92, the most recent year for which figures are available, 
riders took about 360,000 trips on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ridership has improved each year," Turpin said. "We're just looking to 
further stimulate the process and bring on some new riders." 
</P>
<P>
 Fares on the 22-year-old system have never been cut, Turpin said. Fares were 
last increased five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, which operates from about 5 a.m. to 8 p.m., runs throughout the 
city and to Chatsworth. SARA CATANIA

BANK TAKES OVER SIMI GOLF COURSE; FORECLOSURE: WELLS FARGO HIRES A TEAM TO 
EVALUATE THE WOOD RANCH CLUB. THE DECISION ENDS THE IMMEDIATE DANGER OF A 
SHUTDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wells Fargo Bank on Tuesday took over an exclusive Simi Valley golf club, 
eliminating the immediate threat of the club's demise more than a year after 
its developer defaulted on a $15.2-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton called the foreclosure on the 8-year-old Wood 
Ranch Golf Club a welcome resolution to one of a series of financial failures 
by Wood Ranch developer Olympia/Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been better if the company didn't go bankrupt in the first 
place," Stratton said. "But I think they did work out a very equitable 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, a management team hired by Wells Fargo will begin conducting 
an evaluation of the club and its 74 employees, said John Nicholson, an 
attorney for Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson said he was not aware of any other golf clubs owned by the bank. "We 
realize this kind of asset is unique," Nicholson said. "We've hired people who 
specialize in this area to get a handle on the club's operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Crown Golf Management President Scott Flynn said that under terms of the 
foreclosure, he will fire and then probably immediately rehire most of the 
club's employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we're in the process of evaluating, we'd like to keep things running as 
smoothly as possible," Flynn said. His Chicago-based company manages the golf 
club at the Ojai Valley Inn and other private golf clubs in California, 
Colorado, Chicago and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's director of operations, Angus MacKenzie, said he has been meeting 
with Crown officials for a month, devising a plan to keep the private 18-hole, 
200-acre golf course operating without a glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The members will not notice any change," MacKenzie said. "A member that plays 
until dark tonight can come in tomorrow at dawn's early light and take it up 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie said Crown may be stepping up marketing efforts to try to bring new 
applicants to the 500-member club. In the past six months, no one has applied 
for membership, which ranges from $10,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in membership applications "probably has something to do with all the 
publicity" about the financial problems, MacKenzie said. "No one was quite sure 
what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The developer initially ran into trouble after its parent company, Olympia & 
York Developments Ltd., the world's largest real estate company, filed for 
court protection under Canadian bankruptcy laws in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympia/Roberts then began seeking agreements with Wells Fargo, the city of 
Simi Valley and the school district to resolve its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosure on the golf course was postponed repeatedly until agreements could 
be reached with the city and school district, Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the Simi Valley City Council granted Olympia/Roberts up to five 
years to repay a $250,000 debt. The agreement also allows Olympia/Roberts in 
the next 14 years to build an additional 1,500 homes already approved by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the developer gave the city a 65-acre portion of the Wood Ranch 
property and agreed to pay the city $6,000 each for most of the units it 
builds. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympia/Roberts also gave the Simi Valley Unified School District 1,800 acres 
of undeveloped residential land in lieu of a $6.5-million elementary school 
that the developer had promised to build at Wood Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, located on 3,000 acres southeast of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, now consists of about 2,000 houses and condominiums, a 
partly completed community park, a small shopping center and a fire station.

DIRECTOR OF PANTRY LIKES THE WORK; ASSISTANCE: WILLA DOBBS, WHO HELPED FOUND 
PROGRAM 24 YEARS AGO, RUNS A SERVICE THAT PROVIDES MORE THAN 250,000 MEALS A 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Willa Dobbs, happiness is working in a room the size of a large walk-in 
closet crammed with day-old bread, creamed corn and peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As director of Care and Share in Simi Valley, the 55-year-old Dobbs has doled 
out food and understanding since she helped found the food pantry 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 From its beginnings as a word-of-mouth program Dobbs operated out of her 
garage, the pantry has grown into a citywide service that provides more than 
250,000 meals a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Willa does is inestimable," said Diane Davis-Crompton, director of Simi 
Valley's environmental services department. 
</P>
<P>
 Care and Share, which operates on a budget of about $24,000 a year, receives 
no government funding, relying entirely on donations for its sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the pantry will move from its cramped building at the Church of 
the Nazarene on Royal Avenue in Simi Valley to a 1,500-square-foot mobile home 
parked on an empty lot at the church. After searching for larger rent-free 
space for three years, Dobbs persuaded the Salvation Army to donate the 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the community give generously to Care and Share, in large part 
because of their deep respect for Willa," Davis-Crompton said. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Jewel Pedi, executive director of Food Share, the countywide food bank, 
praised Dobbs for her work in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know she's doing a great job," Pedi said. "It really helps to have Care and 
Share in the east county because the folks there need it just as desperately as 
they do in the west county." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs shrugged off the compliments, saying she runs Care and Share because she 
likes the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling to help people," she said. "There's no feeling like it; 
everybody knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, half a dozen needy residents found their way to the tiny 
building the food pantry shares with the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 As the food recipients entered the office, Dobbs waved them past a large sign 
proclaiming "Emergency Food Bank -- Not Grocery Store!!" and welcomed each one 
with a broad, dimpled smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly LaSalle, a tiny woman with bright blue eyes, made her way down the 
cluttered pantry aisle, filling a yellow plastic wagon with soup, beans, pasta 
and toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on disability and I couldn't make it without it," LaSalle, 58, said of 
the pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Camino and Dylan Thompson brought their 7-month-old son, Cody, to 
the pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Camino, 28, selected a range of baby food and canned goods, Dobbs nodded 
sympathetically as Thompson, 34, bounced Cody on his knee and outlined the 
difficulties of finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real tough," Thompson said. "I'm really getting frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Camino said she was grateful for the assistance the pantry offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real help," Camino said. "It's all stuff that's healthy and easy to 
cook up, so you don't have to worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Steve Pollastrini, 44, said he comes to the pantry when 
his work as a cabinet-refacing salesman drops off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the economy is putting a real crimp in my business," the father of 
five said as he selected a large can of spaghetti sauce. "Sometimes I run into 
these tough times and coming here helps get me through." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs said her own experiences growing up poor make her especially sensitive 
to the plight of the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of four children raised by a single mother, Dobbs and her family 
moved to California from Oklahoma in the 1950s seeking work picking fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet, her mother ended up working several jobs simultaneously, in 
a shipping yard and as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 But she refused to accept donations of food or any other sort of assistance. 
"It was pride," Dobbs said. "She saw it as something bad. It was almost as if 
she would rather die than accept help." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs said part of her goal at Care and Share is to remove the stigma from 
seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make it easier on people when they come here," Dobbs said. "Often, 
people are very upset, and we welcome them and make them feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs said she is particularly concerned about the elderly. "Many of them live 
on a fixed income," she said. "They make a meal out of graham crackers and 
tea." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program established by Dobbs several years ago, elderly residents are 
given a special allotment of groceries once a month, including canned goods and 
special items that Dobbs sets aside, such as coffee, tea, honey and crackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone likes to feel like there (is) someone looking out for them," Dobbs 
said. "For some of these people, we're the only ones."

UCLA'S MILLER TO ENTER DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In November, Jamir Miller was certain. "I'm going to stay in school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, he was less certain. "Things change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, he was certain again, saying that he would leave UCLA and enter the 
NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, an outside linebacker coming off his junior season with the Bruins, 
has been their leading sacker the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Rose Bowl, Miller, 20, said that he had submitted a letter to an 
NFL Advisory Committee, which was established to give collegians an idea of 
their prospects before they decided to forgo their final season of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Miller said that the committee had indicated he probably 
would be drafted between the third and seventh rounds in April, apparently 
enough to send him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials were surprised that Miller had not told them of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think the head coach knows," said Mark Dellins, school sports 
information director, who added that Coach Terry Donahue was out of town on a 
recruiting mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had 12 1/2 sacks this season -- 4 1/2 in the Bruins' 68-14 victory over 
Brigham Young.

ISIAH THOMAS REPORTEDLY TO OWN A PIECE OF PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detroit Piston star Isiah Thomas will run the team and become a part-owner 
once he retires as a player as part of a $55-million deal, the Detroit Free 
Press reported today.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 32, probably will retire after this season and assume a management 
position, the newspaper said. It quoted unidentified sources as saying he would 
be put in charge of its basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons declined to comment on the arrangement Tuesday, saying details 
will be disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Press did not say what share of the team Thomas would own or how the 
$55 million would be divided between stock and salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit New reported that the agreement calls for Thomas to receive a 
one-year contract extension with a balloon payment estimated to be somewhere 
between $7 to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon payment will be on Thomas' player contract, so the money will 
count against the Pistons' salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the News source, Thomas also will receive 10% of Piston owner 
William Davidson's sports empire, which includes the Pistons, The Palace, and 
the Pine Knob Music Theater. The team is worth an estimated $132 million, 
according to Financial World magazine. Davidson could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday, the Free Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team announced Tuesday that Thomas will remain in a Piston uniform until 
he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 That came after reports Sunday that he was about to be traded to the New York 
Knicks for Tony Campbell and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased we've finalized the whole controversy," Coach Don Chaney 
said from Chicago after the Pistons lost, 97-91, to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very distracting thing. Now the decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas did not play Tuesday, the sixth game in a row he has sat out because of 
foot and toe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take my hat off to him," Chicago's Scottie Pippen said. "He's being repaid 
for what he did for the franchise. It would be a shame if he didn't end his 
career in a Pistons uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a 12-time All-Star, is averaging 14.3 points and nine assists a game 
for the struggling Pistons.

GLANVILLE, PETITBON FIRED BY FALCONS AND REDSKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Glanville was fired by the Atlanta Falcons and Richie Petitbon was 
released by the Washington Redskins on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One man emerged as the favorite for both vacancies -- offensive coordinator 
Norv Turner of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitbon, 55, whose success as defensive coordinator helped the Redskins to 
three Super Bowls, was fired a year after he succeeded Joe Gibbs as 
Washington's coach. The team went 4-12, its worst record in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I would have liked more time, but that's not my call," Petitbon 
said. "When you get into this business, as a player, you have to be prepared to 
be cut. As a coach, you have to be prepared to be fired. It's not an easy 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Glanville, 6-10 this season and 28-38 in four seasons with the Falcons, had 
been an NFL head coach since 1985, when he took over the Houston Oilers from 
Hugh Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Glanville, 52, said in an interview with the Greenville (S.C.) News that he 
thought a comment he made Monday during a meeting with team management may have 
led to his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them yesterday that if I didn't have the right to cut a player or keep 
a player, then I didn't want to be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's 27-10 loss to the Phoenix Cardinals, Glanville was blunt about 
the season. "I think you judge yourself by whether you're in the playoffs or 
not," he said. "If you're not in the playoffs, you've had a bad year." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who has been credited with the success of the offense that helped the 
Cowboys win the Super Bowl last season and put them on track for another, has 
already been given permission to speak to the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with June Jones, Atlanta's offensive coordinator, he also is expected to 
be a candidate for the Falcons' job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has called yet," Turner said Tuesday. "If there is something to 
consider, it would be good to have it this off-week. We don't want any 
distractions next week when we get hard at work for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what happened last season, when Cowboy defensive coordinator Dave 
Wannstedt agreed to coach the Chicago Bears even before the Super Bowl, Atlanta 
might have the inside track on Turner: 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wannstedt was apparently heading for the New York Giants. Dallas 
Coach Jimmy Johnson later said he steered Wannstedt toward Chicago because he 
wanted to remain close friends with him, and couldn't do so if he was a rival 
in the NFC East. The Redskins are in the NFC East, the Falcons in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, Tom Benson, owner of the New Orleans Saints, said he will not 
hire a general manager, but will give Coach Jim Mora more authority in player 
selection.

TRIBUTE TO ELMORE; CLIPPERS' SPENCER HAS GONE THROUGH TOUGH TIMES AND COME 
THROUGH IMPRESSIVELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Who was that masked man?" Clipper Coach Bob Weiss asked after watching 7-foot 
center Elmore Spencer dunk over Phoenix center Oliver Miller en route to 
scoring a career-high 18 points in a recent loss to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging only 2.4 points and 1.4 rebounds in 44 games as a rookie last 
season, Spencer has blossomed since replacing Stanley Roberts, who suffered a 
season-ending Achilles' tendon injury on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, the Clippers' third-string center behind Roberts and Bob Martin when 
the season opened, has averaged 9.2 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots 
in 13 games as a starter after averaging only 2.9 points and 2.9 rebounds in 
the first 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a tremendously pleasant surprise," Weiss said. "He's done a 
terrific job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest thing that I was impressed with was the way he kept up 
his hustle and kept ready when he wasn't playing. I always tell the guys at the 
beginning of the year that the 10th, 11th and 12th men have the toughest job in 
the league because they've got to keep their mind and body ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I was happy that he stayed ready, but the surprise was the level 
of efficiency that he's playing with right now. He's worked hard on his 
individual moves and now he's to the point where I feel comfortable calling a 
post-up play for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th player picked in the 1992 NBA draft, from Nevada Las Vegas, Spencer 
was ready when he got his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who has scored in double figures in six of the last nine games, has 
exceeded expectations and the Clippers, who considered trying to acquire 
another center when Roberts was injured, aren't actively pursuing a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking around," Weiss said after Spencer had grabbed a then 
career-high 11 rebounds in a victory at Sacramento in December. "But nothing is 
imminent. Elmore has shown he can block shots and rebound at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who didn't play in six of the Clippers' first 11 games, played well 
against Orlando Magic center Shaquille O'Neal in their only meeting, a 110-109 
Clipper victory. Spencer scored 16 points and had a career-high 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to O'Neal, Spencer played an inspired game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played aggressive," O'Neal said. "But any time someone plays against Shaq, 
they play way above their head." 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Neal scored 31 points and had 14 rebounds, Spencer neutralized him 
in the second half as the Clippers overcame a 14-point deficit. O'Neal, who had 
19 points and 12 rebounds in the first half as the Magic took a 55-52 lead, had 
12 points and two rebounds in the second. O'Neal missed eight of 14 shots in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer also had his best college game against O'Neal in UNLV's 76-55 victory 
over LSU in 1991, getting 20 points and 12 rebounds, to O'Neal's 28 points and 
seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer has taken his recent success in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been different if it were my first start," he says of his game 
against the Magic, "but it was my fifth start and it was expected of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My thought process is different now that I'm a starter. Things like that 
should be expected of a pivot man." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's play hasn't surprised his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know he can play," forward Danny Manning said. "We've known that all 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, though, when Spencer's life took a turn into darkness. 
Spencer spent 36 days in the psychiatric ward of an Atlanta hospital in 1987 
when he was 18 and was put on lithium after displaying symptoms of manic 
depression, which he said was triggered by the death of his mother, Marsha. She 
suffered a stroke during a phone conversation with a recruiter in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer became an insomniac after his mother's death and was arrested for 
reckless driving after leading police on a wild pre-dawn chase through the 
streets of downtown Atlanta. During the escapade, he drove by the Atlanta 
Constitution and Journal office and screamed about the coverage the paper had 
given him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was a nervous breakdown," Spencer, 24, said of his 
depression. "I will say this: Anybody who doesn't suffer mood swings or 
depression with the loss of loved one, especially one like your mother, is 
going to have problems unless they're an especially strong person or a person 
who's out of touch with society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happened that my criminal behavior and my social behavior became 
intertwined. It's real easy to be caught up in something when you're 
incarcerated or committed to a hospital. That wasn't the first time I had 
run-ins with the police. They figured there might be something more to this and 
they turned me over to someone who could deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the only positive about the hospital was rest. I wasn't fully diagnosed 
with manic depression, but readers, especially speed readers, only read the key 
words in a sentence or in a paragraph and I might have been stigmatized. 
</P>
<P>
 "And being young and stigmatized, you're so apt to try to prove people wrong, 
so I felt like I was slighted. If I was diagnosed (as being a manic 
depressive), then I might feel bad or might accept it, but since I had symptoms 
and the treatment was only there and not as an outpatient, I just chalked it up 
as an experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't call it a mistake on their part or mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the scars of his mother's death remain and have helped to shape his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life changed 800-fold after my mother died," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw how she slaved and put in extra hours just so we could have trivial 
things, so we wouldn't be (laughed at) in school. I thought maybe if she didn't 
work so hard, maybe she'd still be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her death put a lot of things in perspective. After her death, I sat down and 
came up with a way that I was going to live and from that point on, I started 
to live that way." 
</P>
<P>
 His economy van, which doesn't have hubcaps, looks out of place among the 
luxury vehicles in the players' parking lot. Spencer prefers baggy jeans and 
sport shirts to the designer suits and custom leather coats his teammates wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his teammates wear a new pair of shoes every game, but Spencer has 
used only two pairs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of his teammates, who hang out in trendy clubs, Spencer prefers to 
spend time with his wife, Gwendolyn, and his 12-year-old stepdaughter, 
Sheritta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, though, accept Spencer as a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is normal?" Manning asked. "Who defines normal? Everybody is unique in 
his or her own way. There's nothing wrong with being unique. It shouldn't be a 
factor. Dennis Rodman is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people don't know Mo and assume. And Mo's not even worried about it. 
He's a very nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just different," Weiss said. "He's just a different individual. He's 
very humorous. You never know what he's thinking about. He'll just come off the 
wall with something. He's really fun to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who was a practical joker throughout high school, no longer desires 
to be the center of attention. "Since becoming a pro I've mellowed a little," 
he said. "I've tried to focus more on being an adult. But it seems that the 
higher the level, the sillier it gets. But I don't joke around as much as I 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've evolved into a person at peace with himself. . . . Generally, when a 
person has a lot of troubling experiences in life and comes through them OK, 
they're generally a person who can make good decisions and handle things 
right."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; WILL OWNERS, UNION PLAY BALL ON 3 MAJOR PROBLEMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's owners have begun the new year burdened with many of the problems 
of the old -- and the year before that: 
</P>
<P>
 No commissioner. No revenue-sharing formula to take to the players' union. No 
agreement with the union on how the players will be paid during the proposed 
extended playoffs, leaving realignment and the 1994 schedule in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 The next negotiating session on playoff pay is Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the owners will meet again in Chicago on Thursday for what 
might be the showdown debate on revenue sharing, and will meet again Jan. 17-19 
in Florida, where the agenda might finally include the unveiling of a 
commissioner nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Two names still on a list that might now include only two: Harvey Schiller, 
executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Arnold Weber, a noted 
economist who recently resigned as president of Northwestern University and is 
a director of the Chicago Tribune Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look: REVENUE SHARING 
</P>
<P>
 The owners voted in December of 1992 to reopen collective bargaining with the 
players' union a year before the contract expired. That would have given them 
an extra year of negotiating time in an attempt to avoid the 11th-hour sessions 
that had led to bitter relations and work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owners have wasted that extra year, having failed to make even one 
proposal to the union because they can't agree on a revenue-sharing formula 
among themselves. That formula figures to be the foundation for a salary-cap 
system they eventually hope to sell to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collective agreement expired on Dec. 31, the industry is now 
operating without a labor contract, although the owners have pledged in writing 
neither to unilaterally change the terms of the old contract nor to call a 
lockout before or during the 1994 season. The union, in turn, has pledged not 
to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Those promises leave some breathing room, but it is still not clear when 
collective talks will start, since it is still not clear when the owners will 
agree on a formula for sharing revenue. Could it happen in Chicago this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Could, said one owner. "But as far as I know, we're still about three votes 
short." 
</P>
<P>
 The reference was to the 21 votes needed to approve a formula and the 18-10 
stalemate during an August meeting in Wisconsin, the 10 being smaller-revenue 
clubs that have since threatened their more lucrative brethren by suggesting 
they will not allow those clubs to make non-network telecasts from their parks 
unless they get a satisfactory cut of a revenue-sharing formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger President Peter O'Malley said there has been progress since the 
Wisconsin meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major-market clubs are willing to double the amount of money they now 
share, which is a pretty good sign," he said. "However, if the small-market 
clubs want it tripled, we may not get there." 
</P>
<P>
 The amount to be shared is the bottom line on a possible agreement, but 
O'Malley said he would not support any plan that did not also provide a 
timetable for ending revenue sharing, was not based on the sharing of all 
revenue from all sources and failed to ensure that all clubs would be managed 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, critical previously of the San Diego Padres' management, said it 
would be crazy to support a system that was tantamount to a dole, with the 
smaller-revenue clubs simply living off the money they received from the bigger 
clubs without trying to be aggressive and competitive on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all got to be disappointed that more progress hasn't been made, but 
it's the most complicated agenda item we've ever faced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, president of the owners' Player Relations Committee, has been 
rumored to be so frustrated with his inability to get the owners to agree on a 
formula that he has considered resigning. Ravitch has not returned recent phone 
messages, but both O'Malley and interim commissioner Bud Selig said they have 
received no indication from Ravitch that he will quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch participated in two conference calls with the 28 clubs Monday in a 
continuing effort to iron out differences and prepare for a possible vote in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're close to a time where we have to embrace the new concept or 
look for alternatives," O'Malley said. COMMISSIONER 
</P>
<P>
 Fay Vincent has been out of office since September of 1992. Both Schiller and 
Weber, sources say, have support among the owners, but whether it is enough to 
get the required 21 votes is uncertain. Schiller is a close friend of New York 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, and there is a theory that Steinbrenner will 
throw his big-market support behind revenue sharing if the other owners support 
Schiller. 
</P>
<P>
 A small coalition also continues to believe that Selig should remain in an 
interim role until a new collective bargaining agreement is negotiated, but the 
Milwaukee Brewers' owner has been firm in his opposition and spent part of the 
holidays interviewing candidates Schiller and Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from a Congress motivated by Vincent's forced resignation and 
considering possible withdrawal of baseball's antitrust exemption, the industry 
might finally feel compelled to select a successor. "Florida is the target," an 
owner said of the mid-January meeting, aware that more than one target has been 
missed during the protracted process. EXTENDED PLAYOFFS 
</P>
<P>
 The owners gave late-season approval to 1994 realignment of the American and 
National leagues into three divisions each, with a five-game playoff preceding 
the league championship series and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, whose approval is required, agreed to negotiate it apart from other 
collective bargaining issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd have a deal by now, but I've become much less optimistic," 
said Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: The union contends that since the new television contract 
provides for baseball to be compensated on a per-game basis in postseason play, 
the players should be paid on that basis as well. The clubs, however, have 
offered the same terms as in the past: 60% of the first three games of the new 
playoff and 60% of the first four games of each the league championship series 
and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners also contend that to pay the players on a per-game basis raises an 
integrity issue, suggesting the players might choose to stretch out a 
postseason series for a bigger pay day. This, of course, has infuriated the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 If the union does not approve the package, it would kill realignment and the 
extended playoff in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Orza said, "the leagues have gotten along nicely with two divisions 
and a two-tiered playoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy New Year.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS PARTICULAR HOLE IN ONE WAS DEFINITELY A DESERT CLASSIC 
</P>

<P>
 Ninety-year-old Bob Hope struck another blow for agelessness last week when he 
shot a hole in one on the 140-yard eighth hole at the Canyon Country Club's 
south course in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the perfect shot, Hope used a four-wood that carried over water to the 
green. The ball landed about 12 feet short of the hole and rolled into the cup. 
It was said to be Hope's eighth ace. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually glib comedian was speechless, a companion said, adding, "He was 
singing 'Thanks for the Memory' as he walked to the next tee." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Before Auburn, 11-0 last season, what was the last undefeated and 
untied major college team not to win at least a share of the national 
championship? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nothing new: Head-to-head competition is not always the determining factor in 
declaring a national college football champion in the final polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, USC defeated Alabama, 24-14, and each team finished the season with 
one loss. Alabama was declared the national champion in the final Associated 
Press poll, and USC was No. 1 in the UPI poll. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Makes you hungry: The Amateur Athletic Foundation SportsLetter came up with 
the following all-food team from NCAA Division I basketball rosters: 
</P>
<P>
 James Bacon and Marcell Capers, both of Arizona State; Darvin Ham of Texas 
Tech, Craig Berry of Massachusetts, Clarence Ceasar of Louisiana State, DeJuan 
Wheat of Louisville, Stephen Gruhl of Pennsylvania, Rap Curry of St. Joseph's 
and William Rice of Temple. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add food: According to David Letterman, on John Madden's last day announcing 
football for CBS, Madden will use his telestrator to write: "Will work for 
food."

</P>
<P>
 One big family: There were 17 players named Williams on the NFL ballot for the 
Pro Bowl game. Fans should get bonus points for knowing their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two A's, a B, a C, three D's, an E, a G, an H, a K, five J's and a 
J.L.

 How many can you name?

 Top of the world: Spanish cycling star Miguel Indurain, the Tour de France 
winner, was picked as the best world athlete of 1993 in a survey by Gazzetta 
dello Sport of Milan, Italy's largest sports daily.

</P>
<P>
 Speed it up: Some critics of major league baseball think batters spend too 
much time backing out of the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
 College baseball is doing something about it. A rule change this year requires 
that the hitter keep at least one foot in the box during each time at bat. 
Should he leave the box, the umpire will call a strike.

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; ARIZONA DUO BEST IN CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to guards, the Pacific 10 Conference doesn't concede a thing to 
any conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with California sophomore Jason Kidd, just about everyone's 
preseason All-American, the Pac-10 boasts an abundance of talented backcourt 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, going into the start of conference play Thursday night as the only 
unbeaten team in the Pac-10, has a powerful pair in Tyus Edney and Shon Tarver. 
In most areas, they would be rated the top tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone has at least one good guard and the better teams have a pair. 
Among the best are Dion Cross and freshman Brevin Knight of Stanford, Tony 
Harris and Eddie Hill of Washington State, Brent Barry of Oregon State and 
Hedake Smith of Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outstanding pair of guards in the Pac-10 -- and possibly as good as 
any in the country -- is Arizona's Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves. Utah 
Coach Rick Majerus and ESPN analyst Dick Vitale have already proclaimed the 
pair the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of Pac-10 player of the year Chris Mills and 7-foot center Ed 
Stokes, it was expected the Wildcats would stumble after winning or sharing 
five of the previous six conference titles. Three of the five, including last 
year's team, posted 17-1 records. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Lute Olson built his team around Mills. This year, the leaders 
are Reeves, a 6-foot-2 senior from New York, and Stoudamire, a 5-11 junior from 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats open conference play tonight at home against Arizona State with a 
10-1 record. The only loss came by one point on a tipin at the buzzer against 
No. 4-ranked Kentucky in the Maui Classic. Among their victories was a 
surprisingly easy decision at home against then seventh-ranked Michigan, 
119-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves and Stoudamire have taken charge. Between them, they are averaging 43 
points, eight rebounds, nine assists and four steals per game. They have 
accounted for 65% of the Arizona offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire runs the offense and Reeves is the shooting star, leading the 
Pac-10 in scoring with an average of 25.1 points. Moreover, his shooting has 
picked up each week. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair has been one reason Olson has changed his offense. The Wildcats have 
changed to a three-guard setup. Sophomore Reggie Geary and senior Dylan Rigdon 
share the third guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been as big a change in a year in Khalid Reeves as any player I've 
ever had, " Olson said. "It has helped that he has become a full-time player, 
but the change has been entirely for the better." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Wildcats ended Utah's 17-game home winning streak, 88-81, last 
month, Majerus said: "They are the best backcourt in the country and this is a 
Final Four team."  
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who scored a career-high 40 points in the rout of Michigan, scored 27 
against Utah. Stoudamire scored 19.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although they have been a bit of a disappointment, the California Bears are 
still among the favorites to win the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure to get a major test in their opener Thursday night at Berkeley 
against Kelvin Sampson's strong Washington State team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, led by 6-9 sophomore Mark Hendrickson, are 10-2. One of the 
losses was at Indiana, the other at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries slowed the Bears at the start of the season and they lost two of 
their first four games. But K.J. Roberts, Kidd's backcourt partner, has come 
back strong from an injury. Alfred Grigsby, injured before the season, will sit 
out the Cougar game. He was the Bears' No. 4 scorer last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like our team, although we don't have a lot of experience," Sampson said of 
the Cougars. "We make considerable use of four freshmen and a sophomore. I 
thought we were real good until I saw Arizona and UCLA. Then I realized we will 
be in a league with two great teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The early season surprise has been Stanford. The Cardinal, beset by injuries, 
won only seven of 30 games last season. The only victory in the last 17 games 
was an upset of USC in late February. After that, Stanford lost its last six. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Montgomery's team won its first six this season, including an overtime 
victory over Santa Clara, one of the teams that beat Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Cardinal lost at Wisconsin and Seton Hall, the games were 
close and Montgomery said he was pleased with the progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brevin Knight is just a freshman, but he is already a key to our success," 
Montgomery said. "The kids play hard and we're improving. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't mean anything until we win some conference games." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In his 40-point game against Michigan, Khalid Reeves of Arizona made 13 of 14 
shots and 11 of 12 free throws. . . . Stanford freshman Brevin Knight set a 
conference record when he had 10 steals against McNeese State on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 For a change, Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder will welcome back a player this 
week, instead of losing another. Mario Bennett, a 6-foot-9 sophomore who sat 
out last season because of a knee injury, is back. "I don't think any team has 
lost more starters in the last two years than the seven we lost," Frieder said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA will enter the Pacific 10 Conference basketball race unbeaten for the 
first time since, well, 1992. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They were more experienced and better offensively," Coach Jim Harrick said of 
the Bruins, who featured Don MacLean and Tracy Murray, won the conference title 
and were eliminated by Indiana in the NCAA West Regional final. "This team is 
better balanced, better defensively and better on the boards." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 These Bruins, who are playing some of the most entertaining basketball at 
Pauley Pavilion since John Wooden retired, also seem to get along better and 
have a lot more fun. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, two-fifths of the starters, brothers Ed and Charles O'Bannon, are 
related. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a great relationship," Harrick said. "In practice, there is an 
intense, sibling rivalry between them. In the games, Ed always knows where 
Charles is, Charles always knows where Ed is, and they have a sixth sense about 
what to do." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 First up for the sixth-ranked Bruins in Pac-10 play is Oregon Thursday night 
at Pauley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA is what I call a world-class team," Oregon Coach Jerry Green said. 
"They're capable of beating any team in America on any night, any place." . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick believes the conference is as strong as it has been in years and that 
as many as six teams will make the NCAA tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think we'll be a factor in the race," USC's George Raveling 
said. "But you could probably say the same thing about six or seven other 
teams." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling on the 11 a.m. starting time Saturday against Oregon: "That's a 
reward when you practice at 6 every morning." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The early start was necessitated by the Clipper-Miami game Saturday night at 
the Sports Arena. The good thing is that the Trojans will be able to honor 
former All-American Harold Miner, the Heat guard who has made generous 
financial contributions to his alma mater, in ceremonies before the Oregon 
game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling was encouraged by the work habits of slow-starting freshman center 
Avondre Jones at practice the other day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Are you trying to send me a message?" Raveling asked Jones. "Yes, and I hope 
you're getting it," Jones said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most underrated Trojan is senior forward Mark Boyd, who is leading the team in 
scoring and rarely makes mental errors. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling on being selected the 64th most powerful person in sports by the 
Sporting News: "That threw the whole damn credibility of the poll out." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, 7-2 after finishing 7-23 last season, is among the most pleasant 
surprises in the conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're far and away the quickest we've ever been," said Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson, whose Wildcats (10-1) have been getting some of the finest guard play in 
the nation from Khalid Reeves and Damon Stoudamire. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Point guard is the strongest position in the conference. The three best, in 
probable order, are Jason Kidd of California, Tyus Edney of UCLA, and 
Stoudamire. And it might have been even more formidable if Jacque Vaughn from 
Muir High in Pasadena hadn't gone to Kansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal has the best talent," Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder says. "They're not 
quite there yet, but they might blossom now that the conference race is 
starting." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Scott led Long Beach State to the NCAA volleyball championship Dec. 
18, went home to Baton Rouge, La., for the Christmas break the next day, 
started basketball practice Dec. 26 and scored a career-high 30 points against 
Western Michigan the next night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people, including me, had forgotten that Auburn was the only major 
college team to finish the football season unbeaten. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How would you like to have been Richie Petitbon, sitting there and trying to 
explain the Washington Redskins' 4-12 record to Jack Kent Cooke?

NHL ROUNDUP; ISLANDERS GET MAD, BUT NOT EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Islanders' frustration was evident Tuesday at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury-plagued Islanders are 15-19-3 less than a year after making it to 
the Stanley Cup semifinals, and they showed their consternation with 
unsportsmanlike penalties after each of two late goals by New Jersey and lost 
to the Devils, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 New York also got in two melees in the final 30 seconds in losing its fourth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't worry about it, you're not very intelligent," Islander center 
Ray Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, St. Louis 4 -- Brendan Shanahan capped a Blues' comeback from a 
four-goal deficit when he scored on a rebound with 4:18 to play in regulation 
at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 2, Dallas 1 -- Dirk Graham's goal with 1:14 to play in overtime was 
the winner at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 1, Toronto 0 -- Pat Elynuik scored the game's only goal at Hamilton, 
Ontario, where Toronto's winless streak reached seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 2, San Jose 2 -- Stephan Lebeau's wraparound goal with 6:07 gone in 
the third period pulled the Canadiens into a tie at San Jose.

BOITANO, KERRIGAN HEAD TRIALS; FIGURE SKATING: THE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM WILL BE 
CHOSEN AFTER THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With memories of Kristi Yamaguchi's gold medal and Paul Wylie's silver from 
the 1992 Winter Olympics still fresh in their minds, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. has gathered at Joe Louis Arena this week to choose the team for the 1994 
Winter Olympics in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a look at the national championships, which began Tuesday night 
with compulsory ice dances and ends Saturday with the women's freestyle 
programs: MEN 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the nationals after five years as a professional, Brian Boitano 
of Sunnyvale, Calif., is expected to become the first five-time champion since 
Dick Button. Boitano, 30, has a decided edge in experience and maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging as the No. 1 contender for the second Olympic berth is defending 
champion Scott Davis, 21, of Great Falls, Mont., who does not appear 
intimidated by competition, even from the 1988 Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the year for Mark Mitchell, 23, of Camden, Conn., to 
come to the forefront, but he was disappointed with last winter's results -- 
second in the nationals, fourth in the worlds -- and left his longtime coach 
for Carlo Fassi.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mark has a lot of new things to contend with," Wylie said. "I had Carlo Fassi 
for nine years as a coach. He wasn't exactly the most calming influence." WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the triple flip. Nancy Kerrigan can do a triple flop and still win. It 
has happened before, last year for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1992 bronze medalist is back with a new, aggressive attitude, perhaps 
because of sessions with a sports psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., consider herself the favorite, 
she proclaims herself the favorite in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely the most complete skater," Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for contenders for the other Olympic berth, former national champion Tonya 
Harding, 23, is the most accomplished. But something seems to always be going 
on in her life other than skating.  
</P>
<P>
 It could be time for Nicole Bobek, 16, of Colorado Springs, Colo., to step 
forward. Some believe she would have been good enough last year if she had even 
one ounce of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the judges were telling Nicole, 'Bear down and shape up. There is a 
higher standard of behavior expected of you,' " Wylie said of her fifth-place 
finish at nationals. "It was the PGA Tour-to-John Daly message." PAIRS 
</P>
<P>
 Calla Urbanski, Rocky Marval, Jenni Meno, Scott Wendland, Natasha Kuchiki and 
Todd Sand represented the United States in the Olympics two years ago. All are 
trying to earn return trips with new partners, except Wendland, who retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see if we can get this straight. Meno is with Sand, Kuchiki is with 
Marval, and Urbanski is with Joe Mero, who used to be with Katy Keeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Together for all of 1 1/2 years, Meno and Sand, of Costa Mesa, are the the 
most accomplished, finishing second in the nation and fifth in the world last 
year. They are expected to fill one of three Olympic berths 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other two, it's anybody's guess. Urbanski and Mero are the most 
interesting. After the waitress split with Marval, the truck driver, she 
tracked Mero down by fax in Italy. DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 This competition is like pairs, except with more international intrigue. 
Gorsha Sur defected from Russia three years ago in an escapade that could have 
been written by John LeCarre, met Renee Roca and formed the best U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 They won at nationals last year and are favored to repeat, but they cannot go 
to the Olympics because Sur is not a U.S. citizen. Another contender for the 
one Olympic dance berth in Norway, Rachel Mayer and Peter Breen, quit because 
they felt the coach they shared with Roca and Sur in Colorado Springs was 
favoring their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves newlyweds Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swalow, local favorites 
from Bloomfield, Mich., as the leading contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 They are tied for first after the compulsories with Roca and Sur.

OUTDOOR NOTES / /PETE THOMAS: LAKES UPSET ABOUT LOSING TROUT PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's announcement this week that it is restructuring its trout-stocking 
program for 1994 might not have much of an effect on trout fishermen, but it 
has striped-bass fishermen and operators of the Southland's two premier striper 
fisheries up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing in part an anticipated reduction in the allotment of trout statewide 
for '94, the Department of Fish and Game announced several changes in the 
program, the most controversial of which is the elimination of Los Angeles 
County's Pyramid Lake and San Bernardino County's Silverwood Lake as stocking 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Haynie, supervisor of DFG hatchery operations for Southern California, 
said sizable striped-bass populations in both reservoirs are the key factors in 
dropping the two lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Striper predation (on planted trout) has reached a level that impacts trout 
harvest at both lakes to a point where further catchable trout plants are no 
longer advisable," Haynie said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no arguing that striped bass take a heavy toll on trout. They go into 
a feeding frenzy each time a DFG truck dumps a load of trout into the water, 
and striper fishermen are always there with their lines in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG says it raises trout to give anglers an opportunity to catch the fish, 
not to feed the stripers.  
</P>
<P>
 Striper fishermen argue that they buy their fishing licenses -- and pay an 
extra $3.50 a year -- so they can fish for striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators at both reservoirs, meanwhile, say they will not only lose customers 
who might come to fish for trout, but that their fisheries will be affected 
because the stripers will no longer have the trout to feed on and will 
eventually affect such species as largemouth bass, crappie and bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our opinion that the program of stocking trout is designed so people 
catch fish," said Chet Roberts, president of Pyramid Enterprises, Inc., which 
operates Pyramid Lake. "People who come here spend money on licenses and pay an 
additional $3.50 (for a striper stamp) and we sell thousands of dollars of 
those every year. Trout are being eaten, but the bottom line is that fish are 
being caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and Andy Silva, marina manager at Silverwood, say they will take steps 
to get trout put back into both lakes, and striper fishermen say they will join 
in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all upset, and if there's anything we can do to force them to plant 
trout again we'll do it," said Tim Wilson, 74, who says he has fished for 
stripers at Pyramid every week since it opened in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Southland fishermen are hauling in listless bottom fish this winter, 
thinking of what spring might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 A large school of yellowtail seems to have forgone migration and found refuge 
in Redondo Beach's King Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Augustus and Lars Wiproe, using live squid for bait, caught five in 
the last week, the largest a 22-pounder by Augustus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hooked up 20 yellowtail last Thursday," said Augustus, 47, who lives 
aboard the Orient Express in Portofino Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't land any on 20-pound test, so I tried 30-pound test and caught the 
22-pounder . . . right off the dock. By the time word spread, there were 20 
people in there fishing where you aren't really supposed to be. (Fishing in the 
harbor is legal, but fishing around the docks is not)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Bowden, 9, discovered the wayward yellowtail nearly two weeks ago 
while returning to his father's boat to retrieve the keys he had forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had come back from a fishing trip and were ready to leave when Rick 
Bowden realized his keys were still on the boat in the slip. He sent Brandon 
back and the youngster noticed the fish swimming beneath the bait tank, which 
was filled with live squid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked down and there were two 15-pound 'tails looking at the squid," said 
Rick Bowden, 36, of El Segundo. "I hooked up to one on 20-pound test and it 
sawed me off (on a nearby prop or piling) and then, with 30-pound test, I 
hooked up to one that went 15 (pounds) plus, and it popped off on a piling." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- A helicopter on contract to the Arizona Game and Fish Department 
to conduct wildlife surveys crashed near Coolidge Dam on Tuesday, killing one 
person and injuring three others. Fatally injured was wildlife manager Estevan 
Escobedo, who had been with the department for nine years. The crash is being 
investigated. . . . The California Fish and Game Commission approved a rule 
requiring anglers to wear their fishing licenses while fishing California 
waters. It will take effect March 1. . . . The Anaheim Sports, Vacation and RV 
Show will open Saturday and run through Jan. 16 at the Anaheim Convention 
Center.

FISHING REPORT: NIGHTCRAWLERS STILL BEST WHEN ANGLING FOR BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plastic worms have nothing on the real thing. Nightcrawlers remain the top 
bass-catchers and bass fishermen have been doing plenty of catching during the 
past week at the Los Angeles County reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve and Phil Arklin of Sand Canyon, with guide Bob Crupi, used the 
earthworms to catch several bass, the largest a 15-pounder; Chris Poffenberger 
of Sylmar used a worm to entice a 14-pound 8-ounce bass; Randy Leech of Castaic 
used one to land a 13-4 largemouth, and Ron Kubes Jr. of Castaic used one to 
hook a 9-9 bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Several smaller bass were taken on plastic worms and other lures.

UNREQUITED LOVE; AT THE FALCONRY ACADEMY, BIRDS OF PREY CAN BE TAUGHT TO SOAR, 
BUT NOT TO ADORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing a student learns at the Falconry Academy is that you always 
fly a bird on an empty stomach -- its, not yours. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the birds are trained by a system of reward only," Duane Zobrist II 
explained. "A system of punishment doesn't work. All they know is that when 
they come back to you, they're going to get food or you're going to flush game 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 And if they aren't hungry, it's bye-bye birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Zobrist is a son of the academy's owners, Duane and Sharon Zobrist of 
Pasadena. It opened in October on a plot of land 30 miles west of Lancaster 
where California 138 crosses the Los Angeles Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only falconry school in the country. If that's surprising, consider 
the difficulties of getting into the sport and the dedication required to 
pursue it properly. In California, as in most states, an apprentice must be 14, 
pass a hunter's safety course and a falconer's examination, may own only one of 
two birds -- a first-year redtail hawk or a kestrel -- and before he may fly 
birds on his own must study for a minimum of two years under a sponsor who is a 
licensed falconer. 
</P>
<P>
 General class licensees, who must be 18, may own two birds. It takes seven 
years to become a master falconer, who may own three birds, which must be cared 
for like babies. For all of that, they win neither loyalty nor devotion from 
the creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the best ones will become tame and you can mistakenly believe they're 
like a pet," said Stuart Russell, the school's director. "But you take them out 
two or three ounces overweight and you'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said the school's peregrine falcon, Rocky, has an optimum flying 
weight of 1 pound 8 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weigh the birds every day," he said. "If he's 1 pound 9 ounces, I won't 
fly him because he'll probably fly away. If he's 1 pound 7 ounces he'll 
probably be too keen and lack energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said he has lost three birds in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A kestrel I lost was a quarter-ounce overweight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, the birds do get to know their handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, because we feed them every day. (But) they don't get to like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell arrived from England in March and plans to remain in the U.S., 
teaching falconry. He is engaged to an American, who also is a falconer, which 
should make their marriage easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard many stories of 'either the birds go or I go,' " he said. 
"Falconers are so dedicated they'll stay with the birds." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent night the younger Duane was out until midnight tracking a wayward 
bird. His wife, Darlene -- also a falconer -- wasn't concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "She figured, 'Well, his bird flew away,' " Zobrist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds are really not very bright," Russell said. "If they knew what was out 
there, they'd stay in captivity. In the wild, 75% of the birds die before 
they're a year old. In captivity, it's about 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Zobrists met Russell in Scotland, where for the previous six years he had 
been chief falconer at the British School of Falconry, perhaps the highest 
regarded of 36 such schools in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 Falconry was the first sport of kings, before horse racing. It is still 
practiced with a passion in Arab countries. Russell said its history in England 
has been traced to the late Ninth Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think it started in China or possibly up in the Russian steppes and then 
spread down to China, and then westward with the Crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, what falconry was for was to provide food. The goshawk is known 
in French as the cook's hawk. Probably what happened is some nomad saw a hawk 
kill something, chased it off its kill and had the meal for himself. After 
seeing that once or twice, he thought, 'Maybe I can teach it to do that for me' 
-- exactly as we're doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport hasn't changed much, but the principles have been refined. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were flying some of the same species we're flying now -- peregrines, 
goshawks, saker falcons," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if we catch anything," Duane II said. "It's the flight 
that's important, to bring the best out of the birds." 
</P>
<P>
 The most practical applications might have been in World War II, when an 
English falconer, Ronald Stevens, spent most of the war on the south coast, 
flying peregrines to intercept homing pigeons sent by German spies from England 
to the European continent. Also, for the first time, trained falcons and hawks 
were used to keep runways clear of flocks of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's purely for sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, Russell said, that "you don't see many young people coming 
into it because there's no place for them to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Zobrist, a lawyer, got hooked on the sport, he said, when he was a 
Boy Scout and somebody walked into a meeting with a falcon on his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from his 25th-floor office in downtown L.A., he watches a peregrine 
family that has been roosting on the Union Bank building for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in falconry is thrilled with the Zobrists' endeavor. Last July, 
Russell received a letter from Williston Shor, editor of Hawk Chalk, the 
newsletter of the North American Falconers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Shor wrote: "I do not believe the existence of a falconry school in the U.S. 
is necessarily good for falconry here, nor do I think it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanking Shor for his thoughtful advice, the Zobrists decided to go ahead 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell believes the Falconry Academy might provide a boost to what he sees as 
the second golden age of falconry, the first having been in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic course is five days and costs $350, with a maximum of six students. 
For someone who only wants to see how it's done, a "Hawking Day" is $75, 
including lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The school has 18 birds, in three categories: high-soaring "longwings," such 
as peregrine and prairie falcons that usually take prey in flight; 
"broadwings," such as redtail and Harris hawks that soar in the wild seeking 
ground mammals but are trained to hunt from the handler's fist or a perch, and 
"shortwings," such as goshawks, that fly from the fist and take small birds or 
mammals in short, direct flights in forests where the soaring birds won't fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Three birds, wearing leather hoods to keep them calm, are taken a few miles 
away to open fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Mika, a Lanner falcon, will fly first. Her hood removed, she flies off low to 
the ground, chasing sparrows, then returns as Russell swings a bird-like lure 
on a line. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds of prey generally have eyesight eight times as sharp as a human's, but 
handlers also use whistles to call them back. If they wander too far, they 
might be tracked by a tiny radio transmitter on one leg or the bells they wear 
on their talons. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell puts a box in the field. The box contains a pigeon -- Rocky's target 
for today. Rocky, the peregrine, uses thermal updrafts to soar to about 400 
feet and "waits on" in circles for a minute until the lid opens by remote 
control, releasing the pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky banks into a dive, or "stoop," that for peregrines has been measured at 
almost 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pigeon darts up, down, left and right, Rocky, with his vastly superior 
speed, maneuvers to keep his quarry upwind, giving himself the tactical 
advantage. Every time the pigeon tries to turn downwind, Rocky cuts him off. 
Finally, he makes two passes at the pigeon but -- luckily for the pigeon -- 
scores only a pair of near-misses. Russell calls him back. 
</P>
<P>
 As small as it is, a peregrine also preys on much larger birds, including 
pheasants and ducks. It could probably take down large mammals, including a 
man, if it chose to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good ones will hit (prey) in the head," Russell said. "Imagine that you 
were running along as fast as you could go and a pound-and-a-half object hit 
you on the side of the face at 100 m.p.h. You're not going to get up from that. 
Then it'll come straight back, bite you on the neck and sever your vertebra." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no kill, but the falconers are delighted with Rocky's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The usual hunting success is about 30%," Duane II said. "But that's secondary 
to the flight. Rocky was tremendous."

SANTA ANA VALLEY ROLLS PAST NO. 10 MAGNOLIA, 68-28

<P>
 The showdown between two of Orange County's best teams turned into a blowout 
Tuesday as third-ranked Santa Ana Valley forced 27 turnovers and posted a 68-28 
victory over 10th-ranked Magnolia in a nonleague boys' basketball game at Santa 
Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia shot 22% (11 of 51) from the field against a tenacious Santa Ana 
Valley defense.The Falcons (14-2) held Magnolia to 10 points in the second and 
third quarters combined to take a 53-20 lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Henderson, the Sentinels' top scorer who is averaging 17 points, missed 
all seven shots he took and did not play in the second half. Magnolia also 
played without starting center Brandon Hearvey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect a 40-point game tonight," Santa Ana Valley Coach Rich 
Prospero said. "It was a little ragged, but I accept that from this team. When 
you press and want to play up-tempo with a young point guard, that's how it 
gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore point guard Olujimi Mann finished with 11 points, seven rebounds, 
four assists, four steals and five turnovers. Mann and most of the starters did 
not play in the fourth quarter for Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Riggins scored a team-high 13 points and Darnell Adamson added 10 
points and nine rebounds for the Falcons, who had 11 players score. 
</P>
<P>
 La Shawn Neal had eight points and Todd Callahan had 11 rebounds for Magnolia 
(10-5). MICHAEL ITAGAKI

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; YOUNG TRABUCO HILLS LEARNS LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Trabuco Hills basketball team has only one senior in the starting lineup, 
and its inexperience showed last week when the fifth-ranked Mustangs played 
sloppy and uninspired in an unexpected loss to Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Rainer Wulf's youth movement atoned for its sins with an 81-71 
nonleague victory over fourth-ranked Capistrano Valley Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major win for us," Wulf said. "We can play with anyone when they 
play the way it's taught. We have a young team. They're still learning. Last 
week, they thought they could just show up." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were neck and neck until Trabuco Hills (12-4) started to pull away 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Capistrano Valley's Keith Carson hit from three-point range to tie it, 
68-68, with three minutes left, sophomore Nick Punto scored on a fast break and 
teammate Ryan Karnoff made a three-pointer to give the Mustangs a 73-69 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (11-4) started to foul Trabuco Hills, and the Mustangs made 
six of eight free throws in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Mustangs' strategies was to stop Dinari Bates from scoring inside. 
They were successful; Bates was held to 10 points, and only contributed two 
free throws in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We self-destructed," said Cougar Coach Mark Thornton. "They outplayed us in 
every facet of the game. We gave them too many uncontested open shots, and they 
hit their free throws down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Karnoff scored a game-high 27 points and teammate Rob Warnick added 25. For 
the Cougars, Brandon Puffer scored 20 points and four teammates were in double 
figures. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

PREP ROUNDUP; MARINA'S UNBEATEN STREAK IN SOCCER AT 24 
</P>

<P>
 Marina, the top-ranked girls' soccer team in Orange County and the Southern 
Section Division I, took a step toward proving it is the best team in the 
Sunset League by defeating Ocean View, 3-0, Tuesday at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (9-5-1, 0-1 in league), ranked fifth in Orange County, made a game 
of it early, but Marina (14-0, 1-0) had too many weapons and extended its 
unbeaten streak to 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Vikings finished their league season with five victories 
after losing a second league game -- to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we don't want to lose a game in league," Marina Coach Bobby Bruch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven minutes into the game Tuesday, midfielder Cassie Campbell gave the 
Vikings the lead with a goal off a rebound of her own shot. It was Campbell's 
17th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute later, Ocean View nearly tied the score when Marina goalkeeper 
Jennifer Simmons slipped in the mud near the goal, leaving an open net, but the 
Seahawks were not able to get a shot on goal. Simmons made a nice save of a 
header by Shannon Donegan with about 12 minutes left in the half. Then with 
five minutes left, Simmons slipped again but Marina defenders were able to 
protect the open net. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina scored twice in the first 21 minutes of the second half. Jenny Benson 
made a crossing pass that somehow found the corner of the goal and Rhiannon 
Tanaka beat Ocean View goalkeeper Lynn Brown to the ball near the endline and 
made a perfect crossing pass to Megan Orach in front of an empty goal. MARTIN 
BECK

<P>
 A fine line marks the difference between a very good team and a champion. 
Tuesday night at Ocean View High, that difference was two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-ranked Marina, which has won or shared three consecutive Sunset League 
titles, scored a 47-45 victory over sixth-ranked Ocean View, one of four Sunset 
teams among the county's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the girls realize how tough it is to win championships and how hard 
you have to go after it," Seahawk Coach Ollie Martin said. "They know how to 
play pretty well and they understand the game, but it's understanding the 
nature of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the edge Marina (8-4, 1-0) held as it bolted from a 32-32 tie opening 
the fourth quarter to take a nine-point lead with 4 minutes 2 seconds left. It 
was part of an 11-point run against an Ocean View team (9-3, 0-1) that 
committed 22 turnovers and got off only eight shots in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest shot of the night, Shandy Robbins' three-pointer as time on the 
shot clock expired, made it 37-32 with 5:01 to go. "The most important 
(three-pointer) I've ever made," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins had a huge game under adverse conditions. She picked up her third foul 
with 3:04 left in the second quarter, but was around to block Alison Juroe's 
shot from two feet with four seconds left to prevent overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hoping they wouldn't call a foul," Robbins said. "I don't even 
know why I went up for that block -- I guess it was instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins finished with 13 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-point basket by Jennifer Tuiolosega (seven points) and a three-point 
play by Farrah Magee (seven points) helped Ocean View cut a six-point deficit 
to two in the final 1:42. 
</P>
<P>
 Martita Emde had 16 points for the Vikings, and Sonya Bryant had 12 points and 
six steals. MARTIN HENDERSON

RYAN ON THE DEFENSIVE IN 'APOLOGY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan apologized for the distraction he created by punching Kevin 
Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient, however, was not Ryan's counterpart -- the Houston Oilers' 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said he was sorry during a meeting with his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's bad because our defense played so great the past two weeks," Ryan 
said. "I apologized to my players. I told them, 'It takes away from the glory 
you guys should be getting for the past two weeks.' They've done a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Would he consider apologizing to Gilbride? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who has feuded all season with Gilbride, punched him on the left cheek 
shortly before halftime of Sunday night's 24-0 victory over the New York Jets 
in an apparent disagreement over Gilbride's play-calling.

LEWIS TOPS HOLYFIELD'S WISH LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the surprise of almost no one, Evander Holyfield announced Tuesday that he 
will attempt to reunify the heavyweight championship titles in 1994 before 
reconsidering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. 
champion, says his preference would be to fight World Boxing Council 
titleholder Lennox Lewis this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if the IBF continues to insist that he fight No. 1 contender Michael 
Moorer or lose his IBF belt, Holyfield said he will comply and fight Moorer. 
The winner would be lined up to fight Lewis for the undisputed title in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in his 1994 plans: former champion Riddick Bowe, who last week offered 
Holyfield $20 million for a third matchup. Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva, said 
Holyfield probably would receive $15 million to fight Moorer, $20 million for 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come back in just for money," Holyfield said. "I came back in for 
titles. I've got one belt hanging out there, and I've got to reel it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be only one heavyweight champ of the world. I came back to be 
the champ. Not one of the champs." TIM KAWAKAMI

NEWSWIRE: FRESNO STATE'S DILFER SAYS HE WILL TRY NFL  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trent Dilfer, who set an NCAA record with 318 consecutive passes without an 
interception, said Tuesday he will give up his final year of eligibility at 
Fresno State and make himself available for the NFL draft. 
</P>

 "They did a great job boxing me out," said O'Neal, averaging 12.8 rebounds.

MCGRATH IS EXPECTED TO GET RACING POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian McGrath, a sports executive with no background in racing, is expected to 
be named commissioner of the Thoroughbred Racing Assns. tracks later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's appointment comes several months after the TRA, a trade group of 
about 50 tracks in the United States and Canada, created the job, which 
reportedly will pay more than $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two industry sources confirmed that McGrath has been chosen for the job, but 
TRA President David Vance would neither confirm nor deny the McGrath 
appointment. He said that an announcement would be made on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, McGrath has been chief executive officer of International Sports 
and Leisure Marketing, which has offices in New York and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the TRA board created the commissioner's post and changed the 
president's position to chairman of the board, effective in 1995. 
Traditionally, the TRA president has been an executive from one of the trade 
group's tracks, working without pay in his TRA capacity. McGrath, whose office 
will be in New York, will answer to the board of directors. Among his 
objectives is the expansion of the TRA's role in television, marketing and 
merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance, a vice president of the DeBartolo Corp., which owns three tracks, is in 
the middle of a two-year term as TRA president. "Our needs as an organization 
have changed," he said. "The TRA has recognized the need to commit greater 
resources to a stronger, more centralized national effort to turn around the 
racing industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Racing has hit upon hard times. It currently brings in only 5% of the national 
gambling dollar, compared to 28% in 1974. The sport is fragmented by a myriad 
of organizations that frequently disagree.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * A late round of computer-driven program buying pushed stocks broadly higher 
Tuesday, encouraged in part by falling interest rates. Smaller company stocks 
also rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields fell for the first time in six trading days, pushing 
prices briskly higher on a perception that investors had overreacted to recent 
news of economic strength. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks skipped higher in the morning, languished later in the session, then 
rose sharply in the last minutes of trading, roughly following the bond 
market's trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at its high for the day, rising 27.30 
to 3,783.90 on Big Board volume totaling 326.6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller-company shares bounced back after the previous session's declines, 
buoying the Nasdaq composite index, which rose 3.52 to 774.28. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks took their cue from the strong bond market," said Ricky Harrington, 
senior vice president at Interstate/Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors like to see bond prices rise because that makes share prices 
more appealing and cuts the cost of money to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington also attributed the late activity to the so-called January effect. 
The seasonal trend is the result of market players buying back losing stocks 
sold off at the end of the year to offset gains on winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts pointed out that early January is typically the strongest 
period of the year for the influx of new capital to money managers, who then 
must turn around and invest. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaders on the NYSE were economically sensitive, or cyclical, shares such as 
International Paper, up 1 5/8 to 69 5/8; General Motors, up 1 1/8 to 56 1/2, 
and Caterpillar, up 1 5/8 to 91. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among individual stocks, drug company Bristol-Myers Squibb became the latest 
firm to announce job cuts, saying it will slash its work force by 5,000 
worldwide in a restructuring. Its shares closed up 1 3/8 to 58 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the technology group, Intel rose 2 1/2 to 63 3/4 and Apple Computer 
gained 1 5/8 to 31 1/2. * Still, MCI Communications which led the Nasdaq 
most-active list, lost 1 7/8 to 26 5/8. The company said that, along with 
partners, it plans to invest more than $20 billion to create new services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner fell 2 1/4 to 41 7/8. Alex. Brown downgraded the stock to "buy" 
from "strong buy," citing a larger than expected slowdown in the media giant's 
cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended lower abroad. Mexican stocks rebounded in late trading to close 
up sharply on reports that civil unrest in the southern state of Chiapas 
appeared to be easing, traders said. The Bolsa was up 56.66 points at 2,558.89. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average edged 47.50 points lower to 17,369.74. 
London shares fell on profit taking. The Financial Times 100-share average 
ended down 9.9 points at 3,408.5. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average closed 
down 14.4 points at 2,253.58. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The bond market strength came in extremely volatile trading, and the outlook 
remained generally bearish ahead of Friday's report on December employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly jobs report is expected to add to recent signs that the economy 
grew vigorously in the last quarter of 1993, raising the prospect of higher 
demand for goods and services, which could accelerate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond receded to 6.34% from 6.42% on 
Monday. The long bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped 
31/32 point, or $9.69 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond strategists traced the rebound to a perception that the weakness Monday 
was an overreaction that created bargains in the market. Enticed by Monday's 
price decline, many traders had set up "short-selling" strategies that allowed 
them to profit from further price declines. 
</P>
<P>
 In short selling, traders borrow bonds, then sell them immediately, 
anticipating that the value will decline. If it does, the traders buy contracts 
at the lower price, then repay the loan and pocket the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of these traders bailed out by buying bonds when prices began rising 
Tuesday, generating what is known as a short-covering rally. 
</P>
<P>
 However, prices fell sharply around early afternoon as the market's recent 
bearish sentiment crept back in. Then, in yet another turnaround, prices 
reversed course in a last-minute rally that some analysts traced to fresh 
indications of economic weakness. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against most major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold for current delivery closed at $394.10 an ounce, up 40 cents 
on the New York Comex. Silver closed at $5.20 an ounce, off 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, light, sweet crude for February delivery rose 11 cents to $14.67 a 
barrel on the New York Merc.

 I needed to fly from Los Angeles to Panama recently -- a brief visit to attend 
a series of functions to launch a book I had co-authored on U.S.-Panamanian 
relations. My travel agent booked me and asked me to sit down before she told 
me that the fare would be $1,400 for an economy seat. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't believe the price, especially in light of the fact that people 
sitting on either side of me -- occupying the same space, eating the same 
meals, getting the same service -- probably paid half what I was being asked to 
pay. Two days before the flight, I decided to call London to speak with a 
travel wholesaler we know, to see if they could do any better. The wholesaler 
faxed back that they could ticket me on the same flight for $890 plus tax. I 
relayed this to my travel agent, who appealed to her Continental Airlines 
representative. Miracle of miracles! The rep then found a fare for $839.45. 
</P>
<P>
 I took that and learned something in the process. I had unwittingly forced one 
Continental rep to bid against another, not another airline against Continental 
or another mode of transportation against an air carrier.  
</P>
<P>
 The lesson for everyone is clear: You never know what your persistence can 
produce until you push as hard as you can on the forces that are seemingly 
denying you what you want for illogical reasons.

 RAWHIDE COMIN': Costa Mesa is urban territory, so the City Council is 
apprehensive about permitting a cattle drive there on July 15 -- to kick off 
the County Fair. "I'm your basic child of suburbia," explains Mayor Sandra L. 
Genis. "Are cows noisy at night?". . . Council members approved it this week, 
after fairgrounds officials assured them the 250 cows -- to be housed for the 
night in a field at Costa Mesa High School, three blocks away -- will be 
well-behaved. Says a fair official: "We are choosing these cattle very 
carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 SOMETHING FISHY? Beginning March 1, you'd better make sure the game warden can 
see your license when you're fishing. The state Fish and Game Commission made 
that decision Tuesday. And a lot of Orange County anglers aren't happy about 
it. . . . A survey of local bait shops shows many fishermen see it as an 
infringement. Especially those who don't have a license. But, says Dale 
Hightower of a Fullerton tackle shop: "It's a good way to keep everyone 
honest."

 REUNION TIME: Richard Nixon will be at his presidential library in Yorba Linda 
on Jan. 20. That's the 25th anniversary of his first inauguration, back when 
Watergate was only known as a hotel/business complex. So Nixon's bringing a 
host of people who served with him. . . . Included: former President Gerald R. 
Ford, above, Henry A. Kissinger, and a dozen members from his cabinet. . . . 
Nixon, who will be 81 on Sunday, is expected to announce plans for a new policy 
center at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY NIXON: A mountain of Nixon pre-presidential papers will be unveiled at 
the library in March, dwarfing the collection now open to the public at the 
National Archives. . . . Although the archives in Laguna Beach have 845 boxes 
of documents and correspondence from the Nixon vice-presidential era, the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace will make 2,161 boxes and 19,000 photos 
available for inspection. Included will be campaign materials and 
correspondence with other world leaders.

 CAMPESINOS' STRUGGLE OVER LAND RIGHTS IS WIDESPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Indian rebels who staged the New Year's uprising in Mexico's Chiapas state 
are far from the only group seeking redress in the country's impoverished and 
conflict-ridden south. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in the vast rain forest known as the Chimalapas, between Chiapas and 
Oaxaca states, a protracted and sometimes violent battle over land rights has 
spawned a vigorous, mostly Indian peasant movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the movement here has no direct link to the current rebellion farther 
east, the underlying causes of discontent -- notably the regionwide inequity of 
land distribution -- are similar to those cited by guerrillas of Chiapas' 
so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, peasant leaders are pushing a unique, nonviolent remedy: the creation of 
a Campesino (Peasant) Ecological Reserve to protect the area from Chiapas-based 
timber-cutters, ranchers, drug traffickers and others who have already ravaged 
much of the Chimalapas and other Mexican forests. Peasant settlers claim 
ownership of the entire zone, based on a Zoque Indian purchase from the Spanish 
crown in 1687 -- a sale recognized by several Mexican presidents, most recently 
in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have shown that we, as campesinos , know how to manage and preserve our 
forest," said Roque Antonio Guillen, a Chimalapas peasant leader. "This is our 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the 15,000 or so peasants residing in the area seek formal 
recognition of their ownership. They have also requested military assistance to 
expel wood-cutters, ranchers and the drug traffickers who have cleared 
stretches of forest to sow marijuana plants and opium poppies, moving their 
dope via clandestine airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have strongly backed the novel reserve concept, which has 
achieved a following among conservationists, human rights activists and artists 
in a nation still coming to grips with its plundered natural heritage. Many 
believe that the forest conceals extensive ruins of a civilization linked to 
the Mayas, in addition to its greatly varied flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peasants who live in the forest have a real interest in preserving their 
land," said Homero Aridjis, a poet who heads the Group of 100, an environmental 
group in Mexico City. "Too much has been lost already." 
</P>
<P>
 But timber, ranching and other powerful interests based in Chiapas are 
vehemently opposed to peasant control of the rich region, Mexico's largest 
remaining rain forest, encompassing about 1.5 million acres (more than the 
state of Delaware). About 1,100 species of animals and plants are found here -- 
more than in most nations -- including the jaguar (the Americas' largest cat), 
the monkey-devouring harpy eagle (the world's most powerful), and the garishly 
plumed quetzal bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Development, backed by powerful and sometimes violent interests, threatens the 
remaining stretches of rain forest here in the heart of the Isthmus of 
Tehuantepec, which slices between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. 
Settlers say pistoleros, or hired gunmen, have killed and kidnaped peasants, 
burned their homes and otherwise tried to force them out and discourage 
grass-roots organization and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in fear here," said Constantino Garcia, a 34-year-old Chinateco 
Indian who is mayor of this jungle clearing. "But we're not giving in." 
</P>
<P>
 The heated dispute is illustrative of the bitter conflicts that have long 
pitted mostly rural Indian inhabitants of southern Mexico against wealthy 
landed interests of predominantly European and mixed-race origins. Violent land 
clashes and forced expulsions of peasants are entwined in the region's dense 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, human rights activists say, it is as though the bloody Mexican 
Revolution -- fought largely to guarantee land and equal rights for 
dispossessed campesinos -- never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Land conflicts are particularly chronic in Chiapas state, which is often said 
to be more akin to neighboring Guatemala -- with its huge indigenous population 
and stark concentration of wealth among a mostly white elite -- than to 
industrialized northern and central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone visiting Chiapas must feel as though they've traveled back in time," 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the activist Roman Catholic prelate of San Cristobal de las 
Casas, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition to the peasant-reserve effort is Chiapas' most powerful 
son: Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the former Chiapas governor who now 
sits as Cabinet-level secretary of government, in charge of the nation's 
internal security. 
</P>
<P>
 The former governor dismisses the peasant plan as a land-grab by Oaxacans. (In 
a long-running dispute, Oaxaca and Chiapas officials both claim the 
southeastern third of the Chimalapas region.) Gonzalez is equally suspicious of 
the communal land claims, questioning the validity of the Indians' colonial-era 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics call Gonzalez a guardian for loggers and ranchers, he describes 
himself as a rain forest champion. He takes credit for halting the destruction 
of the Lacandon rain forest farther south, now officially protected but already 
largely denuded by development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot allow to occur in the Chimalapas what happened in Amazonia, what 
happened in the Lacandon," Gonzalez said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez favors a conventional protective scheme: the creation of a Chimalapas 
ecological reserve, operated by the federal government. "Authorities cannot 
abdicate their responsibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservationists and peasants point out that the plunder of Mexico's 
natural resources has seldom abated because of officially protected status. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the peasant reserve notion only surfaced two years ago, grass-roots 
activism here dates back more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in 1986 villagers detained the brother of the then-governor of 
Chiapas, who was accused of illegally cutting wood and growing coffee on 
communal land. (Over the weekend, the Chiapas rebels reportedly seized the 
former governor himself, Absalon Castellanos, a former army general, from his 
ranch.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here in San Francisco la Paz, a quiet riverside hamlet of 400 named after a 
saint of peace, an incongruous aura of fear hovers above the tidy village of 
thatched-roof huts at the edge of the towering forest canopy. Villagers say 
hired gunmen from neighboring Chiapas often threaten inhabitants, who 
overwhelmingly back the peasant reserve plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to force us all out and be free to cut down the forest," said 
Angela Mendez, a beleaguered mother of seven. Her late husband founded the 
settlement in 1960 after walking eight days through the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her sons, Sigilfredo Escobedo, 39, says he narrowly survived an attack 
by a knife-wielding intruder who broke into his home on a recent evening. 
Another son, Baldemar Escobedo, a 33-year-old father of three, was kidnaped and 
"disappeared" along a forest path last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the rushing Rio Uxpanapa, in the settlement of San Pedro Buena Vista, 
Andres Gomez Castellano says his wife and two young children disappeared in 
July, 1992, while walking along a jungle path. Searchers found their bodies two 
days later; they had been beaten to death, he said. He suspects that the 
slayings, to date unsolved, were acts of retribution for inhabitants' support 
of the reserve plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Gomez and about 40 other Tzotzil Indian families came to the 
jungle four years ago seeking a respite after being evicted from their 
ancestral homes in the village of San Juan Chamula, in the cool pine forests of 
southern Chiapas. Like thousands of others, they were expelled in a religious 
dispute after converting to a Protestant sect from their Catholic faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came looking for land and a place where we wouldn't be persecuted," Gomez 
said. "But now our new village is stained by blood."

U.S. SCRAMBLES TO DEFEND NATO PLAN; EUROPE: WHITE HOUSE WON'T COMMIT TO QUICK 
ACCEPTANCE INTO ALLIANCE SOUGHT BY EX-WARSAW PACT NATIONS. DISPUTE COULD MAR 
CLINTON'S TRIP TO CONTINENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four days before President Clinton leaves for his first European summit 
meeting, the White House scrambled Tuesday to defend its new blueprint for 
East-West security and to mute East European criticism that threatens to mar 
the coming week's events before they begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing eleventh-hour complaints from Polish President Lech Walesa and others, 
the White House mobilized Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John M. Shalikashvili 
and other senior officials to elaborate on details of the "Partnership for 
Peace" plan for gradually expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to 
accept some former antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials insisted that the plan, which sets no timetable and few specific 
conditions for membership, is the best way to integrate Warsaw Pact countries 
into Europe without provoking an aggressive reaction from nationalist elements 
in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Swifter acceptance -- preferred by Hungarian, Czech and Polish officials -- 
would redivide Europe, heighten tensions and "could become a self-fulfilling 
prophecy of pessimism about Russia," Anthony Lake, Clinton's national security 
adviser, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking to reporters, said he will stop in the Czech capital of 
Prague after the NATO meeting in Brussels to dispel misunderstandings. "We're 
going to work hard to make everybody feel good about this approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-hour White House blitz underscored the fact that many issues remain 
still unresolved days before a trip that could be crucial for the President's 
foreign policy. With this long-delayed debut European visit, Clinton must 
overcome European leaders' doubts about his commitment to their continent and 
his vision of how to ensure its stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other unsettled issues is whether Clinton will meet with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow and which members of the newly elected 
Russian Parliament he can see without straining his relationship with Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin. There were indications Tuesday that a meeting with 
Kravchuk may take place. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most urgent question remains how to avoid a lukewarm East European 
endorsement of the NATO plan, which could begin Clinton's nine-day outing with 
embarrassment. Coming at a moment when Clinton needs to demonstrate leadership, 
"that could be a very big problem," said Benjamin C. Schwarz, an analyst at the 
Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House marketing for the plan also includes pre-summit trips to 
Eastern Europe by Shalikashvili, U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and 
National Security Council aide Charles Gati. The officials will meet with their 
counterparts in the capitals of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and 
Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 East Europeans' complaints about the plan have grown after Russian elections 
last month showed the strength of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist 
politician who has vowed to restore Soviet superpower status to Russia and has 
made belligerent remarks about European nations and leaders. The Germans have 
also argued for extension of security guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic reaction came this week from Walesa, who called the NATO 
plan "short-sighted and irresponsible" and urged the West to give security 
guarantees to the East European countries in six months. In an interview with 
the Washington Post, the Polish president said the plan, by permitting 
instability, could lead to "another Yugoslavia" in Europe or a repeat of the 
expansionism of 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 President Michal Kovac of Slovakia voiced similar sentiments Tuesday. He 
proposed that NATO accept his country and Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic as "political members," and provide immediate security guarantees, 
according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials argued that only with a plan that avoids 
dividing allies from adversaries could the West encourage economic and 
political integration in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot simply move the Berlin Wall a few hundred miles eastward," said 
Shalikashvili. "It is important that we are very clear that . . . we are not 
building a system that is against someone, because otherwise . . . we would 
just be fueling the paranoia that might exist." 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO plan is careful not to set any timetables for admissions. Officials 
refer to it as an "evolutionary process." It does not specify conditions for 
entry that might identify likely members from others. To become a member, a 
country would need to show a commitment to democracy, peaceful settlement of 
disputes, civilian control of the military, defense budgets open to public 
scrutiny and development of military forces that could operate alongside NATO 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such applicants would have only weak claims for asking NATO countries to 
defend them in case of attack. In such circumstances, the country would have "a 
formal promise that they are not alone, that they can consult with NATO as an 
alliance about that threat," as one official put it. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries would join military exercises with NATO, including search and 
rescue, humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations. An official said that 
such consultations would "enable the new democracies to develop the habits of 
cooperation, the routines of consultation and the kind of operating procedures 
that would prepare them for membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, U.S. diplomats have been telling the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and 
Slovaks that -- if they take part in the plan -- they could begin building 
military ties that could scare off potential aggressors, even if they would not 
have automatic call on NATO military aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, some senior U.S. officials supported the East European 
desire for quick integration. But Yeltsin raised objections, probably because 
he believed this step might increase frictions with his military officers, who 
believe the Russian president has not done enough to prevent erosion of Russian 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials developed the "Partnership for Peace" plan, and released it in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official predicted that the complaints from Eastern 
Europeans could work in Clinton's favor. By the time of the summit, he 
forecast, they would agree to the plan and their support would seem a 
turnaround victory for the United States. "This sets up a major Clinton 
foreign-policy victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, U.S. officials acknowledged that there is growing likelihood 
Kravchuk will be invited to talks in Russia because of progress in joint 
U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear 
arsenal. Still under discussion are how much the Ukrainians will receive in 
compensation from the West for dismantling their warheads and what steps still 
need be taken.

GUN EXCHANGES CATCH ON -- BUT ARE THEY EFFECTIVE?; WEAPONS: NEW YORK'S 
FIREARMS-FOR-MERCHANDISE PLAN WILL BE TRIED IN L.A. SKEPTICS DOUBT IT WILL CUT 
CRIME.

 Guns were good for concert tickets last month. In the near future they might 
be exchangeable for sneakers, boots, toys, jeans and even cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid mounting frustration with the urban arms race, a new gun control 
technique has emerged in Los Angeles and nationwide that sidesteps the 
legislative process and plucks guns off the streets one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun exchanges are rounding up firearms by the hundreds -- 412 over a 
five-day period in Los Angeles last month, 68 in one day in Oakland and more 
than 1,000 so far in a guns-for-toys program in the gritty 34th Precinct of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
joined top Los Angeles officials Tuesday in announcing that New York City's 
version, which started with $100 gift certificates for toys and has grown to 
include other merchandise, will be expanding to Los Angeles in the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are killing other kids for things they need," said Fernando Mateo, a 
carpet store owner who spearheaded the New York program. "We need people who 
have weapons to look at that weapon and say, 'I'm going to exchange this for 
something I need.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that Toys R Us and Foot Locker have already agreed to join the 
proposed "guns-for-goods" project. During a news conference Tuesday, they 
sought to persuade other companies, from McDonald's to the Gap, to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun swaps come as Washington is also grappling with the gun issue. The 
White House proposed a huge increase in licensing fees for gun dealers Tuesday 
and Congress recently imposed a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. 
Some congressional leaders are also pressing for a ban on assault weapons and 
stiffer sentences for criminals who use guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts who study violence describe the gun exchanges as one small step 
in the right direction, while others dismiss the swaps as little more than 
publicity stunts in a county where one in five people owns a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is better than nothing," said Ronald K. Barrett, a professor at 
Loyola Marymount University who studies homicidal violence. "In a small way it 
will contribute something to moving us in the direction we should be going. But 
it's not going to solve the problem completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett likened the exchanges to other peripheral efforts to reduce violence 
-- such as the announcements by radio stations that they will not play violent 
rap songs and efforts to reduce the amount of violence on television and in the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchanges attract huge amounts of attention to the issue of guns -- there 
were 15 television cameras at Tuesday's news conference in City Hall -- and 
that helps the fight against violence, other observers said. "Is this the best 
way to approach the problem? Of course not," said Malcolm W. Klein, director of 
the USC Center for Research on Crime and Social Control. "But is this a step? 
Yes. It's making a statement. It's saying that getting guns off the streets 
matters to us." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pueblo del Rio Housing Project, which Mateo and others toured to gauge 
community sentiment, many residents expressed skepticism. Shortly before the 
officials arrived, a mail carrier had been robbed by a man armed with a 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a gun around here," said Lamont Gooden, 35, who keeps a .357 
magnum for protection. "The criminals aren't going to turn in their guns. 
They'd be thrilled if all of us innocent people weren't armed." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden said there is no way he would turn in his gun for tickets, jeans or 
toys. He said he might consider surrendering the weapon for a full refund of 
his $200 purchase price. Then, he said, he would go out and buy another. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Brown, one of the tenant leaders at Pueblo del Rio, said he doubts 
there will be an outpouring of guns among those in the projects who rely on 
guns for safety and know the value of their guns on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to guarantee these people's safety," Brown told Mateo and Benjamin 
F. Chavis, executive director of the NAACP. "If they are going to give up their 
protection, what are you going to give them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gun exchanges are not new, although the idea has received a burst of renewed 
interest in recent months. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan have all embraced the concept in the past 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, numerous police departments across the country have held 
brief amnesty programs to round up guns from those who might otherwise be 
reluctant to surrender them. Small monetary incentives were sometimes included. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Los Angeles mayor's race in 1989, Councilman Nate Holden pledged to 
buy back military-style assault weapons for $300 apiece. A radio station then 
offered a $1,000 reward to the first person to surrender such a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, even though more than 100 Uzis and AK-47s would be eventually 
collected, some dismissed the buyback as a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's spitballs at battleships," said then-Mayor Tom Bradley's spokeswoman, 
Dee Dee Myers, who dismissed the plan as a "distraction (from) the real 
solution." Myers is now President Clinton's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's guns-for-tickets swap in Los Angeles -- which brought in 110 
rifles, 251 handguns, two assault rifles and 49 shotguns -- was declared a 
success by top police officials. Williams is reviewing the results before 
deciding whether to sponsor a similar effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But some officers grumbled that it was primarily law-abiding citizens with 
extra weapons lying around who turned them in. The criminal element stayed 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York program began when Mateo's 14-year-old son told his father that 
he would give up his Christmas gifts if he could get someone to surrender a 
single gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Mateo bought up $5,000 worth of Toys R Us gift certificates but then the 
concept caught on and numerous other benefactors came aboard. New York Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani even kicked in $5,000 of his campaign money for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, gun donors get their choice of a $100 gift certificate from Kaybee Toys, 
Foot Locker, Dial-a-Mattress or Toys R Us. After the program expands citywide, 
organizers in New York hope to increase the incentive still further by raffling 
off a car to donors.

AIRCRAFT STRAFE, BOMB FLEEING MEXICAN REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Indian guerrillas continued to withdraw from this town and nearby villages 
Tuesday, they came under bomb attacks by government aircraft in hilly 
southeastern Chiapas state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late afternoon, at least one warplane backed by helicopters targeted 
rebel positions on the southern outskirts of the regional tourist center, San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 As the military appeared to gain the upper hand in the five-day uprising, 
government planes continued to circle the area Tuesday night and strafe the 
zone with machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group of reporters to enter Ocosingo since the fighting began New 
Year's Day in Chiapas found evidence of the fiercest confrontation to date 
between the army and the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 25 bodies, mainly of guerrillas but also including that of a baby, 
were strewn in the streets and buildings, particularly in the village market, 
where five bodies showed signs of execution, lying face down in a row with 
their hands behind their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides 11 bodies, the market contained numerous guerrilla weapons: sticks 
carved in the shape of guns, some with knives or corrugated metal strapped to 
the barrel like bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople, emerging after three days of confinement in their homes, said 
they believe that there are more corpses in the undergrowth surrounding the 
village, where vultures gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 A soldier, who would identify himself only as Juan, said four soldiers and 
four police officers were killed in the fighting. Soldiers appeared nervous as 
they watched the streets from doorways and the town's few second-story windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors carried two women, found injured in their homes, to the heavily 
guarded town medical clinic. They debated what to do about a shirtless young 
man in fatigue pants and combat boots whom they found, wounded and unable to 
speak, near the edge of town where the Zapatistas pulled out Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers in Huixtla, Oxchuc and Altamirano said the rebels left their towns 
at dawn Tuesday. The rebels had captured a total of eight communities, 
including San Cristobal, but have seemingly disappeared back into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers still patrolled the main square of San Cristobal on Tuesday but began 
allowing pedestrians to walk on the sidewalks bordering the plaza, although not 
through the square itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Ruiz, the controversial bishop of San Cristobal and the state's leading 
human rights activist, condemned the bombing at a news conference at that 
town's Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center. He cited reports that 
captured Indian guerrillas were executed in Ocosingo, calling executions and 
the bombings "excessive measures" and violations of international rules of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz called for an investigation by international human rights groups, 
including Amnesty International and Americas Watch, which he said have been 
contacted and urged to provide observers during the fighting and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government spokesman for the Chiapas conflict, Eloy Cantu, made a 
brief statement late Tuesday in which he addressed none of those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fighting died down, the exchanges of blame for the conflict rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate cause for the invasion of Ocosingo, people here said, was 
that the guerrillas believed some of their comrades were being held in the 
local jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan, the soldier, said residents had told him that the local priest has been 
inciting them to arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest, who identified himself as Father Pablo, denied that accusation. "I 
have encouraged respect for human rights, but always following the legal path," 
he said. "I have never promoted armed struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 One villager, a middle-age woman who like many of those interviewed asked not 
to be identified, said the roots of the fighting go far deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that the rich ranchers here are unjust," she said. When 
Indians organized a demonstration three months ago in the town square over a 
land dispute with local ranchers, they were attacked and jailed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the guerrillas looted a rental house she owns near the square, she 
said, "I understand them. All they want are schools, medical clinics and a 
decent way to live." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that much of the money the federal government sends for programs 
never gets to the people it was intended to help. Federal spending in Chiapas 
totaled $750 million last year, according to government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas, for their part, left little more information about themselves 
in retreat than was known when they declared war on the Mexican army last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Interior Ministry officials said the guerrillas' apparent training and 
skill indicated they had help from foreign leftist groups, probably from 
Guatemalan rebels who for decades have been locked in a war against neighboring 
Guatemala's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the Chiapas towns said some of the guerrillas' accents were 
Central American and reported that the group included at least one white man. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas denied foreign influence, insisting theirs was a purely 
home-grown movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The border region formed by Mexico's Chiapas state with Guatemala has long 
been home to Guatemalan rebels, tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence 
and Mexico's Mayan poor. It is a fluid region, where people traditionally have 
crossed back and forth with little regard for strict boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Enriquez, in San Salvador to discuss 
regional security issues -- including recent reports that former Salvadoran 
guerrillas may have helped arm the Guatemalan rebels -- said the Guatemalan 
army was investigating whether the guerrillas participated in the Mexican 
uprising but that he could not yet draw a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guatemalan guerrillas denied any involvement in the week's bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts in Mexico City said the government may be trying to blame 
foreign influence as a way to deflect attention from the root causes of the 
uprising -- centuries of impoverishment and discrimination that have 
debilitated an entire culture.

VENDORS CHEER AS LEGALIZATION WINS FINAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 More than 300 street vendors cheered a Los Angeles City Council vote Tuesday 
to legalize their trade and immediately began laying plans to win the approval 
and acceptance of shop owners and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 10-4 vote gave final approval to a trial program to permit 
vending in eight special districts. But the vending zones will not be 
established until the pushcart entrepreneurs have completed a rigorous permit 
procedure that requires approval from neighbors and business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has national significance," said lawyer Madeline Janis-Aparicio, who 
helped organize the campaign to legalize street vending. "This is a very 
disempowered group of people who are completely outside the mainstream and who 
are subject to a lot of scapegoating. But they persevered for five years to 
change the law." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials predict that it will take at least six months for the first 
vending districts to win approval from the Board of Public Works and the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A gantlet of obstacles could still stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a group of African American and Korean American merchants has said it 
may launch a ballot measure to overturn the ordinance. The business people say 
that street vendors represent unfair competition because they do not have to 
pay the rents, fees and other overhead costs that fixed businesses do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to the existing businesses," said Greg Smith, a spokesman for 
the merchants. "To make it legitimate is like a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said members of the Korean-American Grocers Assn. of California and an 
African American shop owners group are considering whether to spend the $15,000 
or more it could cost to gather the signatures needed to place the question 
before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the City Council has required that a comprehensive enforcement plan 
be in place before it approves a single vendor. City officials have indicated 
that they want a combined effort of parking enforcement officers, building and 
safety inspectors, police officers and street-use inspectors to patrol the 
legal vending districts and to shut down illegal vendors. But council members 
thus far have struggled to agree on how much the city should spend, and how far 
steps should go, to eliminate several thousand illegal vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it will be up to the vendors themselves to win approval from their 
neighbors. They will have to initiate their applications by collecting 
signatures from 20% of the business people and residents in the commercial 
zones where they want to work. Then they will have to draw a plan -- including 
the locations of carts and the items to be sold -- that wins the approval of a 
neighborhood committee of business people, city officials and police. Permanent 
business owners will have the power to veto the presence of pushcarts in front 
of their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the vendors and neighborhood committees have drafted a formal proposal, 
it must be submitted to the Board of Public Works and City Council for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lengthy process. It is very involved," said Robert Valdez, the city's 
new sidewalk vending administrator. "It has protections for the merchants and 
the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Selling goods on streets or sidewalks will remain a misdemeanor in most of the 
city. Violators will be subject to up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest street vending group, the 500-member Street Vendors Assn., has 
said it intends to submit petitions for districts in Pico-Union and Westlake 
west of Downtown and in Hollywood and the Eastside. Other community groups that 
said they intend to sponsor districts include the Dunbar Economic Development 
Corp. for about 50 vendors in South-Central Los Angeles, the African-American 
Marketplace for 100 vendors in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Southwest Los 
Angeles, Build Plus in Watts for 50 vendors, and Los Angeles Mission College 
for 50 vendors in the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The vending districts will be established as a two-year pilot program, to be 
extended and expanded to other neighborhoods if the City Council deems them a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden was the most outspoken critic of the vending proposal 
-- predicting that vendors would interpret the council action as a legalization 
of all street vending. "It's going to be completely out of control," Holden 
said. "But my bleeding heart friends are going to vote for it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alarcon, who sponsored the ordinance, said it was the 
best hope for controlling a practice that had not been reduced by a strict 
prohibition. "These men and women are only interested in making a better life 
for their families," Alarcon said. "They are not interested in being dependent 
on government." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting against the ordinance were council members Holden, Joel Wachs, Hal 
Bernson and Rudy Svorinich Jr. Councilwoman Rita Walters was absent.

ECONOMY SLOWS VOTERS' BALLOT MEASURES TO A CRAWL; POLITICS: PAY-AT-PUMP 
INSURANCE PROPOSAL IS SCRAPPED. JUNE AND NOVEMBER ELECTIONS MAY HAVE ONLY ONE 
INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With initiative donors strapped for cash, officials and consultants say 
California voters this year could face the fewest citizen-generated measures in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, supporters of a pay-at-the-pump auto insurance proposal said they 
have scrapped a statewide ballot initiative intended for the November ballot. 
And former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum said he has received 
only tepid support for a proposed initiative aimed at illegal immigrants. 
Meanwhile, plans for another school voucher measure, similar to one defeated in 
November, have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bleak year," said Mike Arno of American Petition Consultants, which 
specializes in paid signature-gathering efforts to qualify initiatives for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno and others who have made big money in the past blame the troubled economy 
for persuading many potential donors to avoid initiative fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offhand, I'd say it's the recession," said Jack McDowell, one of the most 
successful initiative consultants, explaining the lack of initiative business 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proponents of direct democracy are still gathering signatures for 20 
potential initiatives, virtually all of them appear to lack significant 
political and financial support. Unless an initiative has extraordinary 
volunteer support, it typically costs $500,000 to $1 million to collect enough 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one citizen-generated measure, dealing with buying parkland, has already 
qualified for the June ballot, and there may be only one initiative in the 
November general election -- the proposal to sentence criminals to life terms 
for the third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 If that turns out to be true, Californians would face the fewest 
citizen-sponsored initiatives in a general election since 1974, when there was 
one each on the June and November ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno is working to qualify a single measure for the November ballot -- one to 
imprison for life criminals convicted of a third felony and significantly 
increase sentences of people convicted of a second serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, called "three strikes and you're out," gained momentum in the 
wake of the abduction and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma. 
However, proponents ran short of cash last month and were forced to temporarily 
halt the paid signature-gathering campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, legislators are rushing to introduce bills mimicking some 
aspects of the "three strikes" proposition, raising questions about the need 
for such an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Kimball, of Kimball & Associates, the other major firm engaged in paid 
signature gathering, said he expects to have no contracts in California in 
1994, and has sent many of his employees to other states where the initiative 
and referendum business is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline has passed for qualifying initiatives for the June ballot, but 
some measures still could qualify for November. The signatures -- 385,000 to 
change a law or 615,000 to change the state Constitution -- must be submitted 
to the secretary of state by April to be verified by a June deadline for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly are a lot (of proposed initiatives) in circulation, but most 
are not ones that have much substance," said Tony Miller, chief deputy 
secretary of state. "It does seem a light year in terms of substantive and 
weighty measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he believes potential initiative backers are hoping the 
Legislature does its job by responding to various problems in the state. 
Additionally, he said, donors have seen several heavily funded initiatives go 
down to defeat in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are much more skeptical," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one citizen-generated initiative certain to be on the June ballot is 
sponsored by the Planning and Conservation League. The proposition calls on 
voters to approve nearly $2 billion in bonds to buy parkland and renovate and 
buy urban recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning and Conservation League, which has promoted several successful 
initiatives focusing on the environment, is also attempting to obtain 385,000 
signatures of registered voters to qualify a measure for the November ballot. 
The second measure seeks to add a 4-cent tax on gasoline to pay for rail and 
other transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The downturn in the initiative business follows several years in which the 
industry boomed. In 1988, for example, 18 measures made it onto the ballot. In 
1992, there were none on the June ballot, but seven on the general election 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiatives were so numerous that several legislators, academics and others 
clamored for reforms making it more difficult to place them on the ballot. A 
commission's report on the issue, which took two years to prepare, is scheduled 
to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures still seeking support for the November ballot are proposals 
to eliminate affirmative action in hiring for state jobs, authorize gambling on 
an experimental basis in the city of Adelanto and remove the authority of local 
governments to regulate mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials Harold Ezell and Alan 
Nelson continue to push a measure seeking to expel illegal immigrants from 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said he has not sought or received large donations, but added that he 
believes his measure will make it onto the ballot with a strictly volunteer 
signature-gathering effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have volunteers been able to gather the huge number of signatures 
needed to qualify measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schabarum is sponsoring a more limited measure aimed at illegal immigrants, 
but said he has encountered questionable enthusiasm for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, he said the chance of it making it onto the 
November ballot was 50-50. Schabarum said he had raised less than $70,000 of 
the $500,000 he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several consultants were in line to make large sums from the political war 
that would have erupted if the pay-at-the-pump initiative had made it onto the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine columnist Andrew Tobias, the chief backer, had said late in 
December that he was prepared to personally foot the estimated $700,000 it 
would have cost to get the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But after making a final round of telephone calls to potential supporters, he 
said he was persuaded that he should postpone the effort until the 1996 
election while building a broader base of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had organized a powerful coalition under the name Californians to 
Save Our Economy, and hired one of the most successful initiative consultants, 
the Burlingame firm of Woodward & McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the coalition we put together," McDowell said, explaining the reason 
Tobias withdrew it. "They never expected that kind of opposition." ECONOMY

MCI VOWS TO FIGHT FOR LOCAL PHONE BUSINESS; INDUSTRY: COMPANY TO SPEND $2 
BILLION TO BUILD BIG-CITY NETWORKS TO VIE WITH BELL FIRMS. BATTLE COULD LAST 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 MCI Communications Corp., the feisty upstart that ended AT&T's monopoly in 
long-distance telephone service, announced Tuesday a multibillion-dollar plan 
to bring competition to the local telephone business. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI said it would spend $2 billion over the next several years building local 
telephone networks in major cities, including Los Angeles, as part of a 
seven-year, $20-billion investment program that will also include major 
upgrades to the MCI long-distance network and new wireless communications 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the earlier struggle over long-distance service, the battle over local 
telephone competition promises to be a long and tangled affair, involving a 
host of complex technical and regulatory issues. It will likely be at least 
five years -- and possibly much longer -- before most telephone customers can 
choose among local phone companies, though large businesses should benefit from 
competition much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the last time around, though, MCI is now a powerhouse, and it has some 
very potent allies on its side: part-owner British Telecom, the cable 
television industry, and even onetime nemesis AT&T. All are eager to take a 
piece of the $90-billion-a-year local phone business that's now controlled by 
massive regional Bell operating companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of competitive pressures, the regional Bell operating 
companies have not lived up to their responsibilities to provide local access 
at reasonable prices," said MCI Chairman Bert Roberts. "This is an historic 
assault on the local exchange monopolies." 
</P>
<P>
 The regional Bell companies, including San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, 
greeted MCI's announcement with derision, declaring that they would be happy to 
have competition in the local phone business just as soon as they are allowed 
to compete in the long-distance business. The Regional Bell Operating 
Companies, "RBOCs" in industry argot, are barred from long distance by the 
court order governing the break-up of the old Bell system. 
</P>
<P>
 "MCI today announced that it is in favor of competition in every market but 
its own," Bell Atlantic President James G. Cullen said in a statement. "MCI/BT 
insists that even while it offers local telephone services, companies like ours 
should not be permitted to enter the long-distance oligopoly controlled by 
MCI/BT, AT&T and Sprint." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Bell Atlantic, like many other companies in the increasingly incestuous 
high-tech world, has countervailing interests as well. Following its 
acquisition of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., it likely will compete 
with other regional Bell companies in providing local phone services. 
</P>
<P>
 "MCI is the first one out of the starting block, but others will follow," says 
California Public Utilities Commissioner Norman Shumway. More than 100 
companies have already expressed an interest in offering phone services in 
California, Shumway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, local phone service is regulated by state public utilities 
commissions, and only New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington permit 
competition for most local services. Some regulators and consumer activists 
fear that open competition would result in big price breaks for large business 
customers but would ultimately raise costs for residential phone users. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states, including California, are moving toward a more liberal regime. 
The California PUC recently took a major step in opening up the market for toll 
calls within local calling areas -- so-called "local long-distance" -- and 
hopes to have the local phone business completely liberalized within three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation now pending on Capitol Hill might speed the process even further, 
overriding the state rules and opening up competition in both local and 
long-distance telephone and cable television markets across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving force behind MCI's local service strategy is not merely a desire 
to carry calls between neighbors. Rather, MCI and other long-distance companies 
are looking for ways to drastically reduce the fees they must pay the local 
phone companies to handle the local portion of long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of the price of a long-distance call currently goes to cover these 
costs, known as "access charges." Further, the long distance firms see the 
RBOCs as competitors on a variety of fronts over the long run, and they don't 
want to be dependent on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (long-distance) carriers absolutely, positively must get off the RBOC 
networks as quickly as they can," said Robert C. Atkinson, senior vice 
president for Teleport Communications Group Inc. Teleport, controlled by a 
group of cable operators, including Tele-Communications Inc., is the largest of 
an expanding group of companies that is pioneering local service competition in 
major cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Teleport, MFS Communications and other local service competitors currently 
offer a way for large corporate customers to connect directly to long-distance 
carriers. Such services can cut long-distance charges and reduce dependence on 
the local phone network, but they are only economic for large locations and 
they cannot in most cases provide local calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, MCI will focus mainly on access services for corporate customers, 
running cables into office buildings via a massive network of ducts that it 
acquired from telegraph operator Western Union. Eventually, though, MCI and the 
other access providers aim to provide full-blown local services as well. And 
MCI will likely link up with other communications companies to offer many of 
these new services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is raising the ante in the local exchange market. For the first time now 
the regional (Bell) companies will face serious competition," said Fritz 
Ringling, partner at Network Dynamics Assn., a New York consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
 But regulatory issues, such as whether you will be able to keep your phone 
number if you switch local carriers, remain. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, shares in the RBOCs fell Tuesday as the prospect of increased 
competition loomed. Of Pacific Telesis' $9.9 billion in revenues, $2.25 billion 
comes from charges to long-distance carriers for use of local lines. 
</P>
<P>
 As long-distance carriers install their own lines, Pactel's earnings from this 
business could fall substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI shares also fell Tuesday -- closing down $1.875, to $26.625 a share on the 
NASDAQ -- as investors worried about the cost of the new investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake Bath, an analyst at the Sanford C. Bernstein investment bank, noted that 
about half of the $20-billion announced investment by MCI eventually would have 
been spent anyway. In addition to the $2 billion in local networks, he expects 
MCI to spend up to an additional $4 billion on a new type of wireless phone 
system. MCI will also spend billions upgrading its long-distance network to 
offer more high-capacity data and video services.

NEW AIDS ADS EXPLICITLY URGE USE OF CONDOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials unveiled a new and potentially controversial 
television and radio AIDS-education campaign Tuesday that for the first time 
explicitly promotes condom use to reduce the risk of AIDS transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service announcements, aimed at young people from 18 to 25, are 
much franker than previous government-sponsored ads, which have only hinted at 
condom use and were widely ridiculed as naive and simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dozen years since the epidemic began, an intense national debate has 
arisen over how best to educate the public about ways to prevent transmission 
of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the issues is whether information must be graphic to be effective 
and whether recommending the use of condoms would send an implicit message 
sanctioning sexual activity, especially among young people. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS-policy and grass-roots service organizations have long argued that only 
explicit material could get the critical information across. Conservative 
groups and the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush 
believed, however, that the government should only sponsor messages stressing 
sexual abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have lacked until now is the political will, because we have been too 
timid to talk openly about the prevention tools at our disposal," said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who introduced the campaign at a 
press conference with Kristine M. Gebbie, the Administration's AIDS policy 
coordinator, and Dr. David Satcher, director of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 One TV ad, for example, shows the silhouette of a couple about to engage in 
sex. The camera pulls away from the bed to a chest of drawers where a condom 
suddenly emerges. It jumps to the floor, moves across the room and scurries up 
the side of the bed. A voice then says: "It would be nice if latex condoms were 
automatic. But since they're not, using them should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Another features a man and woman kissing and giggling. She asks: "Did you 
bring it?" He replies: "Uh-oh. I forgot it." She responds: "Then, forget it." A 
voice says: "Next time don't forget it, and every time make it part of the 
relationship. A latex condom, used consistently and correctly, prevents the 
spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and may save your life." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ads do not actually show how to use a condom, they go further than 
earlier federally sponsored spots -- among them one ad that met with widespread 
derision for suggesting condom use by showing a young man carefully pulling a 
sock over his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone beyond the sock," Gebbie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said that the major broadcast and cable networks had pledged to air 
the ads. ABC-TV had been scheduled to show one of them Tuesday night in prime 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 A department official said that the broadcast time was donated -- the spots 
are public service announcements -- and the ads cost "less than $1 million" to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Although conservative groups have expressed some concern about the ads, the 
campaign has generally been praised by most AIDS organizations and medical 
groups, including the mainstream American Medical Assn., religious and 
community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explicit messages, including advice on condom use, are appropriate in 
prevention material," said Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, the AMA's senior vice president 
for medical education and science. "The AMA encourages broadcasters and health 
educators to embrace this campaign and those who are sexually active to heed 
its message." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Bross, executive director of AIDS Action Council, called the ads "a 
significant break from the past" and said that he hopes the campaign marks a 
"fresh start" for the federally sponsored AIDS prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary Bauer, a White House domestic policy aide during the Reagan 
Administration and now head of the conservative Family Research Council, 
questioned the Administration's motives for pushing the new approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there an American who tunes into prime-time TV who hasn't already gotten 
the message about condoms?" he said. "I think there is another political agenda 
here. I think it is more about pushing the envelope on explicitness of sexual 
matters during prime-time TV than concern about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would urge the CDC to have the courage to be creative in telling Americans 
that abstinence outside of marriage is the best way to prevent transmission." 
</P>
<P>
 The general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops/U.S. 
Catholic Conference decried the ad campaign as "promoting a dangerous myth." 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertisements promote promiscuity and a false sense of security, which 
put at risk the very lives of those most likely to be influenced by them," 
Msgr. Robert N. Lynch said in a statement. "It is irresponsible to present 
condoms as the answer to the AIDS threat or to suggest that they are a sure 
safeguard against HIV transmission. . . . Neither is true." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said that the public would best be served "by a campaign promoting a 
responsible attitude toward sexuality as the most serious of human 
interactions, not a casual recreation." 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the ads do urge young people to abstain from sex, they also 
recommend that those who are sexually active use latex condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people need to know that the surest way to prevent AIDS is to refrain 
from having sex, but we also need to be realistic," Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited CDC figures showing that 86% of young men and 77% of young women 
reported having engaged in sexual intercourse by the time they reached 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, of the 12 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases 
annually, two-thirds occur in people younger than 25, said CDC Director 
Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers cause great concern because the behaviors that put people at 
risk for (sexually transmitted diseases) are the same behaviors that put them 
at risk for HIV," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James W. Curran, CDC's associate director for HIV/AIDS, said that a recent 
study of couples where one partner was infected and the other was not showed 
not a single case of infection after two years among 123 couples "who used 
latex condoms correctly and consistently."

 Yukio Tatsumi wanders down Tuna Street, a deserted lane that dead-ends at a 
moldering harbor. "This used to be the Takeuchi Pool Hall," he says. "This was 
the Mio Restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 He points to an expanse of asphalt piled with steel cargo containers. "That 
was our school. This was the Shinto shrine. And this," he says, staring at a 
yard of high-voltage lines, "was my house." 
</P>
<P>
 To most people, Terminal Island means a slab of landfill in Los Angeles Harbor 
stinking of fish and diesel oil, a forbidding landscape of towering cranes, 
warships, canneries and a federal penitentiary -- the last place anyone would 
want to call home. 
</P>
<P>
 But to a group of Angelenos in their 60s to 80s, it's a paradise lost, the 
location of a vanished Japanese American fishing village with a bustling main 
street and rows of tiny bungalows decorated with bonsai trees -- the air filled 
with the shouts of children running barefoot through sandy alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for 3 1/2 decades starting in 1906, a village of about 2,500 people 
flourished and then disappeared, as ephemeral as the shifting sandbars of the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It was destroyed in just 48 hours in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 25 of that year, all people of Japanese descent, including American 
citizens, were evicted from the island at gunpoint. Japan and the United States 
were at war, and the village known as Fish Harbor was rumored to be a spy 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
 While the residents were imprisoned in internment camps for the next four 
years, their homes were picked clean, then bulldozed. Their fishing boats were 
repossessed or stolen. The nets rotted. The village was never rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish Harbor is not the only Los Angeles enclave of its day that has 
disappeared. If the Japanese immigrants had Terminal Island in the 1920s, 
Iowans had Long Beach. European expatriates were creating a world of their own 
in a rural outpost called Hollywood. Black Los Angeles blossomed on Central 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But those communities have faded away, absorbed and largely forgotten by the 
sprawl. In recent years the Iowans, who once drew tens of thousands to their 
reunions, have barely been able to attract a handful of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the Terminal Islanders. Half a century after their village disappeared, 
there are still 778 paying members of the Terminal Islanders Club. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, they are preparing for their annual New Year's party, scheduled for 
Sunday, when several hundred people are expected to gather in Lakewood. Then 
there are the golf and fishing tournaments, the trips to Las Vegas and the 
tours of Japan. There's even a championship basketball team made up of 
third-generation island descendants. Although they were born long after their 
parents' community was destroyed, they call their team the Terminal Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many older Fish Harbor natives still live in a village of sorts. They remain 
best friends with the people they played with in kindergarten and they live 
around the corner from each other -- not on the island, itself, but in a 
neighborhood of Long Beach marked by the neat bonsai bushes in their front 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And they still go back to visit the island. "Every now and then I go over just 
to smell that smell," says Oihe Charlie Hamasaki, a retired auto mechanic and 
fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call Terminal Island my enchanted island." 
</P>
<P>
 It started out as a sand spit in San Pedro Bay called Rattlesnake Island. 
After the construction of a bridge and a rail line, it was re-christened 
Terminal Island and a fashionable resort named Brighton Beach flourished there 
in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1910s, dredging and landfill projects ruined the beaches and scared off 
the tourists. They were replaced by immigrants who became pioneers of America's 
new tuna-canning industry. Some, from Yugoslavia and Italy, settled in San 
Pedro. The Japanese gathered on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsui Murakami arrived in 1918, when she was 10. "I thought, this is America?" 
she recalls of her first glimpse of her new country: primitive shacks on a 
sandy coast. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1930s, the sand spit was a busy industrial zone that included at least 
eight canneries, commercial and naval shipyards, oil tanks, steamship berths 
and a tile-roofed rail station. There was regular ferry service to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the newcomers came from Wakayama prefecture, a poor, remote coastal 
region in western Japan. As relatives followed, Fish Harbor came to resemble a 
Wakayama village transplanted to the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fishermen summoned "picture brides" from Japan. The women, 
arriving to marry husbands they'd never met, often found that the men didn't 
live up to the photos they had exchanged. "They were old, and not so handsome," 
says Murakami. "Some women ran away to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who stayed had to do without their men for weeks at a time as the 
fishing boats followed the tuna from Puget Sound to Peru. They'd chum the water 
until the sea boiled with fish, then heave 300-pound tuna onto the decks with 
bamboo poles, three men and three poles to one fish. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boats came in, the women rushed to work in the canneries, welcoming 
the fish home before their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whistle would blow at 2 or 3 in the morning," Murakami says. "Each 
cannery had a different number of whistles, so you'd lie in bed listening for 
your own. We'd take a bucket, a knife, apron and gloves, and go." 
</P>
<P>
 When the fishermen came home, they'd drink and gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 When they didn't come home, the wives held a funeral with a photo in place of 
a body. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fathers at sea and the mothers at work, the children practically 
raised themselves. For them, the island was a small haven where nobody locked 
their doors, every adult was an "auntie" or "uncle" and every child a 
co-conspirator in adventure among the sand dunes and boatyards. They'd swim 
across the channel to San Pedro. They'd swipe wood crates from the canneries 
and attach them to roller skates to make primitive skateboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baptist church sponsored kiddie sumo tournaments. The Buddhist temple 
sponsored the Boy Scouts. They'd play cowboys and Indians -- and samurai 
warriors, using sticks for swords to imitate the silent Japanese movies shown 
in the fishermen's hall with live narration. 
</P>
<P>
 The children went to public school during the day and Japanese school 
afterward. The parents built a Japanese garden for the public school, and so 
revered its first principal, Mildred O. Walizer, that they raised money to send 
her on a trip to Japan and asked that the school be named after her. 
</P>
<P>
 Only at New Year's did the island routines come to a halt. Nobody worked for 
three days, everyone feasted, and the children received toshidama -- New Year's 
money -- and went to the Long Beach Pike amusement park. The fishing crews 
would visits their captains' houses for toasts with sake. "You'd walk down the 
street," Murakami recalls, "and hear their songs coming from the houses." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was, in late 1941, that the village was preparing for the New Year, 
stocking up on rice to pound into mochi cakes and starting the ritual year-end 
housecleaning. But there would be no celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The islanders heard it on the radio. "Was it around noontime?" Murakami muses. 
"They said it was war." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing poker," says Tatsumi. "We all said, 'Pearl Harbor? Where's 
Pearl Harbor?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For months, rumors had been circulating on the mainland that the Japanese 
village on Terminal Island was a spy colony. The cottages, the reports said, 
had tall antennas to send information to Japan. The fishermen had detailed maps 
of the coast. Their muscular physiques showed they were being trained by the 
Japanese military. The boats had torpedoes. They were planning to sabotage the 
naval shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the antennas were poles for drying fish. The maps were 
navigational charts they had bought in marine supply stores. There were, it 
turned out, no torpedoes. After the war, the U.S. government said no cases of 
sabotage or spying by the fishermen had ever been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then the village was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 From the afternoon of Dec. 7 to the early hours of Feb. 8, the community's 
leaders were spirited from their homes by FBI agents. On Feb. 9, they took away 
every Japanese native with a fishing license. The village became a huddle of 
frightened women and children surrounded by soldiers with bayonets. Many 
believed their men had been executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Families burned or tried to hide everything they thought might cause suspicion 
or be misinterpreted. Kanshi Stanley Yamashita set a match to his precious 
boyhood collection of magazines on Japanese and American warships. Under the 
asphalt of today's cargo container yards an archeologist might find pictures of 
Emperor Hirohito, guns, kimonos, photos, record albums, tea sets, dolls and the 
other artifacts of Japanese life that the village literally buried. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 25, the remaining population was given 48 hours to evacuate. 
Profiteers descended to buy stoves and radios for next to nothing. The 
islanders stored or sold what goods they could, but much of the village -- 
boats, nets, furniture, china -- was deserted where it was, as if the people 
might return in time for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, much of the village re-established itself behind barbed wire in 
its own corner of the internment camp at Manzanar, in the windy desert of 
Northern California. Most families were fatherless -- the older men were 
detained in separate camps. For many Terminal Islanders, it was their first 
chance to spend much time around more assimilated Japanese Americans from all 
over California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those others made fun of the islanders for their rough ways and peculiar 
language -- a crude and colorful mix of English, backcountry Japanese and 
fishermen's slang. Older brothers told their sisters to stay away from those 
Terminal Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called us yogores, " says Tatsumi -- roughnecks, dirt bags, bums. The 
Terminal Islanders fought back. They formed one of the toughest baseball teams 
in the camp, wearing uniforms emblazoned, YOGORES . 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, some Terminal Islanders scattered to places like Chicago and 
New Jersey to find jobs. But most eventually came back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When they stepped from the ferry onto Terminal Island, they saw their 
cannery-owned homes had been razed. The Murakami grocery store had been 
demolished. The few shops left on Tuna Street had been taken over by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Terminal Island had been transformed into a massive military base and a 
much-expanded industrial zone. It had been a force in America's victory over 
Japan and was now an engine of Los Angeles' burgeoning commercial power. The 
village was no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the islanders took up fishing again. No one had the money to buy a 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita's father, the once-proud captain and owner of a 125-foot tuna 
clipper with a crew of 14, became the live-in houseman for a wealthy Bel-Air 
family. His mother worked as their cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita had volunteered in 1944 to serve in the Philippines, once the Army 
began accepting Japanese Americans again. Later, he was struck by the irony of 
his military career when he returned in uniform to see his parents during the 
Korean War -- and was forced to use the servants' door. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding that few landlords would rent to Japanese Americans, many Terminal 
Islanders gravitated to a trailer park in Long Beach that had been built for 
black defense workers. One of the few lines of work available to people of 
Japanese descent was gardening, and the seafaring men of Terminal Island became 
famous for their skills with pruning shears. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1950s and '60s, the Terminal Islanders helped each other find 
jobs and looked after one another. The Baptist church group met in Murakami's 
living room in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 And the islanders would return time and again to the bulldozed spot where 
their homes once were. They often dragged along their new spouses and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to see where the canneries are," recalls one woman, a 
non-islander whose husband took her on a pilgrimage after they were married in 
the 1950s. "To me, it was a bunch of broken down, fishy-smelling buildings. But 
you'd think he was going home to his Georgia plantation." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the islanders began to notice that Issei -- the original 
immigrants -- were dying off. The Nisei, the second generation, began worrying 
that the memories would disappear when they did. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Tatsumi and others formed the Terminal Islanders Club. They were 
shocked at the response. When the group scheduled a picnic, more than 1,000 
people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 So they made it an annual event. Twenty years later, it still draws hundreds, 
bringing the village back to life for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Throngs of toddlers and great-grandmothers roll over the island's bridges onto 
its sole patch of green, a park owned by the same Navy that once helped evict 
them. Koi fish banners fly over children's footraces. Old-fashioned Japanese 
ballads drift over the breakwater and taiko drumming pounds through the air. 
The smell of grilled mackerel competes with the truck exhaust, and 
leather-skinned grandfathers swap tales in the pungent argot of their 
childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they go, the people form a circle, stamping out the bon odori, the 
lighthearted Dance of the Dead in honor of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 The islanders know there's a chance the dance may die with them. So they are 
determined to pass on to their descendants something more concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Terminal Islanders Club put out a call for artifacts -- old 
fishing equipment, photos, a kindergarten handbell -- and began raising money 
for an exhibition at the Japanese American National Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a Downtown museum can't store the evocative stench of fish that the 
islanders drink in deeply whenever they wander back to Fish Harbor -- and its 
remaining tuna cannery. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Tatsumi and some friends -- all in their 70s -- retraced their 
boyhood steps, tooling around the island in a minivan, popping out to sniff the 
air and conjure up their old haunts. Their reminiscences were happy ones, as if 
the terrible end of the village had been forgotten, leaving only the good old 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we'd dig holes in the sand dunes," says Masaharu Tanibata at a 
huge pile of chrome scrap, suddenly remembering one rascally old buddy. 
"Remember 'Soup' used to charge us a nickel to go in his cave? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd steal bananas from open freight cars," says Tanibata, a retired Hughes 
Aircraft engineer. "We were bad!" 
</P>
<P>
 The men stand at the edge of Fish Harbor, where the remnants of Los Angeles' 
once-great fishing fleet now share the water with sunken, rotting boats. "This 
is where I learned to swim," Tatsumi says, "with fishing corks tied around me." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a warehouse, they line up for tacos at a catering van surrounded by 
truck drivers oblivious to the history of this dusty spot. The old Japanese 
Americans pull aside the young Latinos, eager to pass on their tales. "We were 
born here. This used to be our home!" they say. The young men smile briefly at 
the old men, then push forward to grab their meals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghosts of Terminal Island may be forgotten under the feet of the thousands 
who work there today. But they are still visible to those who entered the world 
on its sandy shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita, the son of the tuna clipper captain, found himself somehow drawn 
back to the island. For decades, an army career took him from Europe to Asia. 
But when it came time to retire, he got an apartment on the bluffs of San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita keeps a telescope set up in his living room. It's trained on 
Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, he earned a Ph.D. with a dissertation titled: "Terminal 
Island: Ethnography of an Ethnic Community: Its Dissolution and Reorganization 
to a Non-Spatial Community." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Yamashita says: "We all still stick together." Lost Village 
</P>
<P>
 From 1906 to February, 1942, a Japanese American fishing village flourished at 
Fish Harbor on Terminal Island. The villagers were incarcerated and their 
houses razed during World War II. But the old residents and their families 
gather on the island each year for a picnic.

STATIC FOR A HERO; SCOUT USES CB IN RESCUE, BUT SOME WANT TO PULL HIS PLUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 20-year-old Explorer Scout who helped save six people aboard a boat stranded 
off Dana Point said Tuesday his homeowners association wants to fine him for 
using his citizens band radio in the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of Dec. 28, Richard Wright and two other CB operators answered a 
distress call from an 18-foot pleasure boat. Through questions and 
communication relays, they guided a Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County 
sheriff's patrol boats to the stricken vessel five miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright said his good deed did not impress the homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president of the association called our manager, and he notified my mom 
that they want to fine me $150 for using my CB radio inside the association 
grounds," said Wright, a member of Explorers Post 540. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Meixell, president of the 124-member Moulton Parkway Assn. No. 1, 
confirmed that the group's board will decide at its meeting next week whether 
to fine Wright. Meixell contended that Wright was notified of the possible fine 
when he used the CB a week before the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Meixell said Wright had promised three months ago to stop using his CB radio 
after several condo owners complained that it interfered with their cordless 
telephones and television reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he and his mother are simply using this rescue thing to help them 
out," Meixell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright said he was notified of the possible fine shortly after he used the 
CB to assist in the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is clearly on Wright's side. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the association, a ranking officer called it "ludicrous to fine 
the boy for saving lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for his helping us," Petty Officer Randolph Reid added Tuesday, 
"it could have ended up in serious injury or loss of life to the boater and his 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Wright has won praise for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he was recommended for a certificate of valor from the Orange County 
Fire Department after he kicked open the door of a burning condo and searched 
for people possibly trapped inside. He found no one but broke out a window to 
help a family's dog and hamsters escape. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, he and other Explorers who are part of an emergency services squad 
assisted with emergency vehicles at the Laguna Beach fire. A week later, the 
same post volunteered to help line muddy streets in Laguna Beach with sandbags 
after rainfall caused damage from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest adventure involved two other CB operators, Richard Bianchini, a 
Mission Viejo teen-ager, and another CB user known only as Shorty. 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper, Jose Santana of Anaheim, was aboard the vessel with his wife, two 
children and two other adults without flashlights and only a few blankets, Reid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of questions and communication relays, the three radio 
operators were able to approximate the boat's bearings and forward the 
information to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he kept an open line to the Coast Guard while relaying messages 
through the two CB radio operators. From time to time, the signal was weak, 
Wright said, and one of the three operators would lose or gain the signal 
during the three-hour rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first got the Mayday about 5 o'clock," Wright said. "And it took us about 
an hour to find out where the (boater) was. The whole thing ended like close to 
8 at night."

MCCANDLESS TO RETIRE FROM 44TH DISTRICT SEAT; CONGRESS: THE CONSERVATIVE GOP 
LAWMAKER HAS REPRESENTED PALM SPRINGS AREA FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. ALWAYS LOW 
KEY, HE HAS FOCUSED ON SPENDING AND BANKING ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta) announced Tuesday that he will retire at the 
end of the year to spend more time with his family, ending a congressional 
career of more than a decade in which he quietly represented Palm Springs and 
other Riverside County towns with his sturdily conservative views. 
</P>
<P>
 The former county supervisor, who has developed a reputation as a hard-working 
but obscure Washington legislator, focused on cutting government spending and 
on a range of banking issues that fit well with the Republican tilt of his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless' shun-the-limelight style nearly cost him his seat in 1990. TV 
actor Ralph Waite, well known from his portrayal of the patriarch in "The 
Waltons," pulled in 45% of the vote and limited the incumbent to only 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless rebounded somewhat in 1992, garnering 54% of the vote against a 
poorly financed challenger. But the margin of victory was his second-lowest 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since personal publicity and media exposure were never goals of mine, I have 
been accused of not being a good 'politician,' " McCandless, 66, said in a 
statement, "but I leave a record of service untainted by scandal and unmarked 
by partisan hostilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his sixth term, McCandless sits on the Banking and Government 
Operations committees and is the ranking Republican on two subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless, a former automobile dealer, is a conservative with pro-business 
views. His ardent opposition to federal regulation and strong opinions have 
sometimes affected his role in hammering out legislative compromise. But 
McCandless is proud of his record: 
</P>
<P>
 "Free from rigid, ideological dogma in any camp, I always felt confident in 
voting my conscience -- after doing my homework. . . . Voting for NAFTA did not 
trouble me one whit. I knew I had my facts straight, and time has always borne 
that out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous Congress, McCandless helped block a bill seeking tougher 
federal regulations on credit reporting agencies. He supported efforts to 
enhance privacy provisions and protections against false reports But McCandless 
felt some of the Democrat-supported approaches went too far and complained that 
they would be costly and difficult to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, McCandless opposed a bill that would have authorized a redesign of 
the nation's coins. The familiar tails sides of the penny, nickel, dime, 
quarter and half-dollar would have been replaced with Bill of Rights 
expressions on free speech and due process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing wrong with our coins," McCandless said at the time. "We 
should leave a good thing alone." 
</P>
<P>
 On the environmental front, he fought against desert-protection legislation, 
calling it "anti-economy and anti-equitable use." 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless' seat on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee 
allowed Democratic challenger Waite to tap into the savings-and-loan debacle 
during the surprisingly close 1990 race. Waite never accused McCandless of 
direct ethics violations, but blamed the congressman for not doing enough to 
prevent the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless dismissed the accusations as "a nasty political trick." 
</P>
<P>
 McCandless' seat should attract numerous candidates. Congressional sources on 
Tuesday mentioned as prospective Democratic candidates Waite, former Riverside 
Assemblyman Steve Clute and Julie Bornstein, an assemblywoman from Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Republicans, erstwhile entertainer Sonny Bono, the former mayor of Palm 
Springs, said last May that he was weighing a bid for McCandless' seat but 
recently has said he will seek the lieutenant governor's post. Terry Holbert, 
former Banning city councilman, is another possible contender, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 1980s, McCandless' district was the fastest-growing in the 
country. The 1992 reapportionment essentially divided it in two, giving 
McCandless desert country extending to the Arizona border. His 44th District 
includes Palm Springs and other Coachella Valley communities. It also 
encompasses Moreno Valley, including the region around Hemet and Perris. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, 26 House members and six senators have said they plan to 
retire from Congress.

 With the upper Sacramento River making a strong recovery from a devastating 
1991 toxic spill near Dunsmuir, the state Fish and Game Commission voted 
Tuesday to reopen the river to limited fishing and to stock a six-mile section 
with hatchery fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise plan is designed to boost the economic recovery of the hard-hit 
region without slowing the natural repopulation of fish in the 40-mile stretch 
of river ecosystem that was ravaged when a Southern Pacific train derailed and 
spilled its load of the toxic pesticide metam-sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen will be allowed to take up to five fish a day between April and 
November along an easily accessible stretch of river. Along the rest of the 
upper river, which will not be stocked, fishermen will be required to throw 
back any fish they catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Farley, chief of inland fisheries for the state Department of Fish and 
Game, said the river habitat has recovered more quickly than most people 
expected after the disastrous spill of July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone from zero fish to an average of 1,200 fish per mile in two years," 
he said. "It's a remarkable comeback. At this rate it could be fully recovered 
in two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Insects upon which the fish feed were the first to return and allowed the 
repopulation of the river by trout from tributaries that were unaffected by the 
toxic chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific, which can be held liable for economic losses caused by the 
spill, has been urging the state for months to begin stocking fish in the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad contends that the river habitat has recovered sufficiently to 
support extensive stocking and that the entire stretch of damaged river could 
be reopened to catch-and-keep angling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very, very healthy river, very capable of handling much larger 
numbers of fish than are in it currently or have been proposed by the 
Department of Fish and Game," said Mike Furtney, a Southern Pacific spokesman. 
"We are disappointed there will be less than a full recreational opportunity 
open to people this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the upper Sacramento's reputation as a home for wild trout, the state 
has been stocking a 20-mile section of the river with hatchery fish for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved by the commission at its Sacramento meeting, about 
18,000 half-pound fish will be placed in the six-mile stretch of river during 
the normal fishing season, which runs from April 24 to Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Some angling advocates criticized the plan, fearing that it would slow the 
recovery of the wild trout by introducing competitors into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the commission plan was a compromise designed to revive the 
tourist industry without slowing the natural recovery.

PUT '3 STRIKES' ON JUNE BALLOT, BROWN SAYS; CRIME: MEASURE WOULD RIVAL A VOTER 
INITIATIVE BACKED BY GOV. WILSON. SPEAKER ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING SCHOOLS CHIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday that the Legislature should place 
the proposed "three strikes and you're out" measure on the June ballot and let 
voters decide whether they want to lock up repeat violent offenders for life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Capitol news conference covering several topics, Brown (D-San Francisco) 
raised questions about Gov. Pete Wilson's appointment of Republican corporate 
trouble-shooter Sanford C. Sigoloff of Los Angeles as interim state 
superintendent of public instruction, but promised the Assembly would give the 
nominee a fair evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown left no doubt where he thought public opinion stood on the stiff 
anti-crime proposal. "The majority of both houses of the Legislature and the 
overwhelming majority of the public are in a mind to put people away forever 
for jaywalking, period. That is the mentality that is going to prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 He said for that reason, voters should decide the issue and the Legislature 
should pass a bill to "put it on the June ballot and get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said his suggestion would work against proponents of a similar 
proposal -- a voter-generated initiative intended for the November ballot -- 
who "want to string it out as long as they possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he opposes the initiative, which calls for sending anyone convicted 
of a third violent felony to prison for life, because it is unworkable. But he 
said he favors keeping repeat violent offenders off the streets, and supports 
increased gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said he would not bring pressure to put the "three strikes" issue 
on the June ballot. "I'm just thinking out loud," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds of Fresno, who heads the November initiative effort, said at a 
news conference he will accept no substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to allow politicians to take this life-and-death issue and 
turn it into a political football just because this is an election year and 
they want to get reelected," said Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered last 
year by a habitual criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has endorsed the Reynolds initiative, has called a special 
legislative session on crime to run concurrently with the regular session that 
started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preview of his annual State of the State speech to be given tonight, the 
governor said he will ask for more tax cuts, tougher criminal penalties and 
more help for local law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Wilson's tax cut reference, Brown said he was open to considering 
tax cuts, but questioned if any "would be achievable" this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the governor's appointment of Sigoloff as interim state schools 
chief, the Speaker said an Assembly committee headed by Majority Leader Tom 
Hannigan (D-Benicia) will hold a confirmation hearing sometime later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Brown drew political heat when he said he wanted only a Democrat to 
get the job. Wilson nominated Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) to replace 
Bill Honig, who was convicted on conflict-of-interest charges. Bergeson 
subsequently was rejected by the Assembly after two confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said he would have to be convinced that the interim appointment of 
Sigoloff -- who would serve until the end of this year -- was really necessary. 
He noted that voters will choose a superintendent in this year's elections, and 
congratulated acting Supt. William D. Dawson for doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the declared candidates for the position is Brown ally Assemblywoman 
Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), chair of the Assembly Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be incredibly disruptive to have another change (this year)," Brown 
said. "All of that weighs heavily on my mind. But I have not said I would vote 
against (Sigoloff). I will not suffer as I did with the Bergeson nomination."

34 FIRMS CITED FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN HANDLING ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a statewide crackdown on the asbestos transport industry, state health 
officials announced Tuesday that they have cited 34 California companies for 
violating laws that mandate safe handling of the cancer-causing substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Toxic Substances Control is seeking fines totaling 
$400,000 from the companies, which handled 70%, or more than 333,000 tons, of 
the asbestos that traveled in or through California between June, 1991, and 
July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials say none of the violations posed an immediate danger to 
the public. But they said findings of their investigation were alarming because 
improper transport and storage was widespread within the industry, which 
handles asbestos removed from houses and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inhaling asbestos fibers is a clear danger to public health, and it's 
imperative that companies engaged in the transport and treatment of asbestos 
waste do so properly and safely," said William F. Soo Hoo, director of the 
state's toxics control department. 
</P>
<P>
 The violations were found during a computerized check of hazardous-waste 
shipping records over the 25 months. The investigation was prompted in part by 
complaints by some asbestos companies that many of their competitors were 
violating state laws, said Ron Baker, a spokesman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is seeking the largest fines, just over $25,000 apiece, from 
Certified Environmental Transport of Fontana, which was cited for transporting 
and storing waste without a permit and 112 shipping-record violations, and CST 
Environmental in Anaheim, which was cited for operating without a permit and 
240 record-keeping violations. The companies can contest the violations and 
seek lower fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos -- which can cause lung cancer and other serious respiratory diseases 
when tiny fibers are inhaled -- was widely used as insulation and soundproofing 
until the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the alleged violations involve expired permits, inadequate records 
tracking the asbestos or improper storage. In many cases, the companies were 
storing asbestos for longer than allowed or in excessive quantities.

SHERIFF GATES DISCUSSES FATAL CASE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT 
WILL REVIEW PROCEDURES IN THE WAKE OF OFFICER'S SHOOTING. HE WAS KILLED DURING 
AN IMPROMPTU TRAINING SESSION BEHIND A MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, breaking his virtual silence on the 
Christmas Day shooting death of a veteran deputy, acknowledged for the first 
time Tuesday that internal policies were broken during an impromptu training 
session that led to the fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also vowed that once a criminal inquiry into the shooting is completed, 
sheriff's officials would review training procedures, which have come under 
attack from some community leaders in the wake of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins' 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was shot in the head by another deputy who was using a loaded weapon 
during the training drill, officials said. "I don't know the facts at this 
point, but obviously a shooting took place that doesn't appear to follow 
department policies," Gates said. "There are obviously going to be problems 
once I get the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff, who had been unwilling to discuss issues of department training 
policy since Robins' death, said Tuesday that the shooting and the training 
session appear to conflict with rules for the use of loaded weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't train and utilize loaded weapons. You don't have your finger on the 
trigger," Gates said. "The policy clearly states that. Anyone that deals with 
guns in law enforcement understands that from the day they come into this 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, was killed by fellow Deputy Brian Scanlan just after 2 p.m. on 
Dec. 25 during what was described as an informal training exercise in a lot 
behind a mall movie theater in Lake Forest. The Orange County district 
attorney's office is trying to determine whether Scanlan fired the fatal shot 
in response to seeing Robins reach for a gun from his car's visor during the 
re-enactment of a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating the shooting to determine 
whether criminal charges -- such as involuntary manslaughter or other counts in 
the area of criminal negligence -- should be filed against Scanlan, a former 
Army private. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Scanlan, 32, of Anaheim also could face disciplinary action ranging 
from a letter of reprimand to firing once the department begins an internal 
review of its own. That is likely to take months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the shooting, Gates and his department have come under 
increasing criticism from some community leaders and law enforcement experts 
who question why the deputies were training with a loaded weapon and whether 
they should have used a public mall for a drill during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates has largely refused to discuss the case since the outset, but he agreed 
to an interview with The Times in response to what he considered unfair 
criticism in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue in the case, he said, remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question here for all of us is why was the gun loaded and why were they 
doing a training exercise with a loaded weapon," Gates said. "That is the 
bottom line question we all want answered. Until we are able to get the 
information from the D.A. to complete the factual situation and look at that, 
we won't be able to answer that." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of elected leaders from around the county have questioned whether 
officers should be conducting training exercises at public sites, saying they 
were unaware before the shooting that such practices existed. Gates said his 
department would review the policy once prosecutors complete their 
investigation to determine whether changes will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any situation where something has gone wrong, we sit down and review our 
entire policy," he said. "We review everything in place to make sure that we 
can continue that policy if it is a sound one. If it needs to be adjusted, we 
adjust it. We will do that in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said such informal training sessions "are done frequently in every law 
enforcement agency that I am aware of. . . . We see that they are done safely. 
We try to make sure that they are done in ways that don't endanger the deputies 
or the public."

BOSNIA WARNED THAT U.N. TROOPS WILL LEAVE IF WAR GOES ON; BALKANS: WORLD BODY'S 
MILITARY COMMANDER IN WAR-TORN REPUBLIC HAS QUIT IN FRUSTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 European Union mediator Lord Owen warned at the start of peace talks here 
Tuesday that U.N. troops will be pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the 
bloodletting ceases -- a threat underscored by disclosure that the U.N. 
commander in Bosnia has resigned in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Francis Briquemont asked a month ago to be relieved of his duties, 
the Belgian Defense Ministry said in Brussels on Tuesday in confirming his 
imminent departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Briquemont lambasted the U.N. Security Council for passing grandiose 
resolutions while failing to provide the military muscle to enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
 His complaints echoed those of French Gen. Jean Cot, who is in charge of the 
entire 26,000-strong U.N. Protection Force mired in the Balkans and has been 
increasingly resentful of what many see as Mission Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of Briquemont's decision to leave his post came as Bosnian and 
Croatian leaders met here for the latest attempt at negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic adjourned without any reported breakthrough but were 
expected to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was mediated by Owen and his U.N. partner in the roving peace 
talks, Thorvald Stoltenberg, in hopes of calming one of the two most vicious 
conflicts in Bosnia prior to the Jan. 18 resumption of negotiations in Geneva 
that will tackle the larger offensive, that of the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, continued to suffer an intensive artillery 
pounding by Serbian rebels, with at least nine civilians killed by the shelling 
after 15 fatalities Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In central Bosnia, forces of the Muslim-led government have been engaged in a 
bloody struggle with Bosnian Croats for control of the vital Lasva River 
valley, which both sides want as part of their ministates being carved out of 
shattered Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen was apparently seeking to step up pressure on the Muslims and Croats when 
he threatened during a British radio interview to remove U.N. forces from 
Bosnia deployed to escort lifesaving aid to virtually all of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats from the European Union (formerly the European Community) have 
complained that the humanitarian mission is keeping the battles alive, as well 
as the civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen and Stoltenberg have brought the combatants near to a negotiated 
settlement twice over the past four months, only to see agreement collapse as 
one side or another balked at a last-minute concession. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic and Granic have proclaimed themselves in agreement on basic issues 
after past negotiations, but both have failed to compel some elements of their 
armed forces to abide by calls to resume joint efforts to withstand the Bosnian 
Serb sieges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think we have the right to fail any more," Silajdzic told reporters 
before his talks with Granic. But he conceded that the Croatian and Muslim 
populations are now deeply distrustful of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Both government and Croatian forces are feeling pressured by this week's 
change of EU leadership to agree to the formula for ethnic division endorsed by 
Owen and Stoltenberg. It would grant about half of Bosnia to the Serbs, 
one-third to the government, 17% to the Croats and put Sarajevo under U.N. 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece has assumed the rotating EU presidency, raising fears it will work in 
favor of its closest Balkan allies, the Serbs.DEMOBILIZATION

'MORAL COURAGE' TO END VIOLENCE URGED ON IRA; ULSTER: TOP CATHOLIC POLITICIAN 
SAYS HE REALIZES OUTLAWED GROUP WOULD FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE ACCEPTING 
BRITISH-IRISH PEACE DECLARATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The senior Roman Catholic political leader in Ulster told the Irish Republican 
Army on Tuesday that ending the campaign of violence for a united Ireland would 
be one of the century's "greatest acts of moral courage." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, said he realized 
that Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA, would face an 
enormous challenge in accepting the terms of last month's British-Irish peace 
declaration. The pact offered Sinn Fein a place in peace negotiations if the 
IRA would lay down its arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume, the leading Catholic moderate in Northern Ireland and a member of the 
British House of Commons, in a statement to the IRA declared of possible peace 
talks: "It will require from the republican movement, given the experience that 
its members have been through, one of the greatest acts of moral courage of 
this century." 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the end of the day," Hume added, "it is moral courage that gives real 
leadership and that creates truly historic opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Hume said that it was time to leave the past behind so that the Ireland of the 
next century would not be scarred by the gun and bomb, but instead would 
develop as part of a new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us commit ourselves to spilling our sweat and not our blood," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume's stance as a moderate has won him wide support among middle-roaders in 
Ulster (as Northern Ireland is also known), Ireland and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams laid the groundwork for the 
Downing Street Declaration signed in London on Dec. 15 by British Prime 
Minister John Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume said that both the British and Irish governments should be prepared to 
use methods of communication open to them to give Sinn Fein whatever 
clarification the organization needs on the wording of the peace declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downing Street document specified that talks involving all factions in 
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic -- including Sinn Fein -- could begin 
three months after terrorist activities cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein and the IRA are not expected to respond officially to the call for 
talks until later this month. Their representatives have insisted on the right 
of all people in Ireland to decide the island's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 Major has supported Northern Ireland's Unionists, who want continued British 
rule in the province, by stating that no islandwide agreement could be reached 
without the consent of Ulster's million-strong Protestant community. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Dublin on Tuesday, a letter bomb exploded in offices used by 
Sinn Fein, injuring two Irish army officers trying to disarm it, police and 
army sources said.

PROSECUTOR CHARGES KEVORKIAN WITH ASSISTING SUICIDE OF DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prosecutor who has been one of retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian's most 
vocal critics charged him Tuesday with assisting in the November suicide of a 
bone cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state Court of Appeals is to hear arguments Thursday on the 
legality of Michigan's assisted suicide ban, Oakland County Prosecutor Richard 
Thompson said he saw no reason to delay charging Kevorkian in the Nov. 22 death 
of Dr. Ali Khalili. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continued defiance and disregard of the law passed by the duly elected 
representatives of the people cannot be condoned and must be resisted," 
Thompson said. "I make no apologies for enforcing the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who once pinned a clown nose on a picture 
of Thompson at a news conference, was quick to condemn him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your arrest of Dr. Kevorkian would be even stupider than the stupidest thing 
you have ever done in your life (and, believe me, you have done some 
unbelievably stupid things)," Fieger said in a letter to Thompson before the 
warrant was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was the prosecutor who filed murder charges against Kevorkian in 
three cases before Michigan had an assisted suicide law. Each charge was thrown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said his office was arranging for Kevorkian to be arraigned today in 
the death of Khalili, 61, of Oak Brook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian is already under house arrest for another assisted suicide case in 
Oakland County and wears an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements. 
That case involves Merian Frederick, 72, who had Lou Gehrig's disease and died 
in October in a vacant apartment next to Kevorkian's. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he'll seek "substantial cash bond" in the Khalili case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 65, has witnessed 20 suicides and has admitted supplying carbon 
monoxide gas or other deadly material in some of the cases. Five have come 
since the Legislature outlawed assisted suicide in February, specifically to 
stop Kevorkian. The crime carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and 
a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be released after an 18-day jailhouse hunger strike last month in 
Oakland County, Kevorkian promised to stop assisting suicides until the state 
appeals court acts. He had earlier said he would ignore the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeals is to hear arguments Thursday in two separate 
challenges of the law, which was declared unconstitutional by two judges in 
nearby Wayne County.

GAYS LOOK BACK ON A BUMPY YEAR -- AND AHEAD TO A BUMPY '94; FAVORABLE COURT 
RULINGS MADE UP FOR UNFAVORABLE POLICY DECISIONS. BUT AN ACLU LAWYER SAYS THE

 Last year began with much hoopla about the waxing political strength of gay 
men and lesbians. Instead it turned out to be a time of painful political 
defeat on Capitol Hill -- and of a surprising string of court victories hailed 
by many as a watershed in gay rights law. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, state and federal judges ruled in favor of gays in a 
series of decisions involving marriage, the military, anti-gay rights 
initiatives and custody cases. Although by no means the final word in most of 
the cases, the rulings offered the gay movement its most tangible advances in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the point of view of the gay and lesbian community, the various court 
decisions are a remarkable and miraculous vindication of the positions we have 
held for many years," said J Craig Fong of the Lambda Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, founded 20 years ago to litigate gay rights cases. "These 
rulings provide the rationale for making gay and lesbian simply another 
adjective to describe a person and not a basis for discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
 While Congress and the Pentagon were blocking repeal of the military's ban on 
gays, federal judges were pronouncing the policy unconstitutional and 
irrational in opinions extraordinary for their sharply worded rejection of 
anti-gay discrimination. In five cases last year, courts ordered the military 
to reinstate gay service members or halted their discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hawaii, the state Supreme Court cracked open the door to gay marriage when 
it revived a lawsuit challenging the state prohibition of same-sex marriages. A 
state judge in Colorado struck down an initiative forbidding the adoption of 
gay-rights laws. Pending trial, a federal judge in Ohio blocked enforcement of 
a similar measure approved by Cincinnati voters in November. High courts in 
both Vermont and Massachusetts approved adoptions by gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this year was a turning point for gay law," said William B. 
Rubenstein, a gay-rights attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and 
editor of a recent book on gay law. "Increasingly the courts are becoming a 
haven for constitutional protections from prejudicial public policy-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts describe the judicial gains as not only the product of years of 
groundwork by gay-rights attorneys but also the inevitable seepage of evolving 
public opinion into the courtroom. Even the bruising political fight over the 
military policy worked its way into recent court decisions to gays' advantage, 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we didn't win in Congress, we certainly shifted the debate that was 
going on," said ACLU attorney Jon Davidson. "The issue became reframed as a 
serious issue about equality. . . . What happened in the political arena really 
redefined the terms of the debate legally." 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of gay rights cases also is growing, both because more gays are 
open about their sexual orientation and are willing to press such claims and a 
greater number of major law firms are willing to handle their cases. And cases 
are being taken more seriously by courts than in the past, when lawsuits were 
often tossed out by judges before reaching trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet gay-rights attorneys are hardly trumpeting victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of this comes against a backdrop of years and years of tough 
going, so we're clawing our way to the point of midway," said Rubenstein. "I 
think the road ahead will be bumpy. There will certainly be victory in 1994, 
but defeats as well." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there were defeats in 1993. A Virginia judge declared a woman an 
unfit mother because she was a lesbian. And a federal judge ruled that the 
Georgia attorney general's office could refuse employment to a lesbian attorney 
who took part in a wedding ceremony with her partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming above everything is the question of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has 
only taken up one major gay rights case, Bowers vs. Hardwick in 1986. The court 
then upheld Georgia's criminal sodomy law, concluding that the constitutional 
right to privacy did not protect gay sexual conduct. The Supreme Court has 
never directly ruled on equal protection claims made by gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a Supreme Court ruling one of these days, and I don't 
think the trend of decisions in the lower (court) cases tells you very much" 
about what it will be, said Stanford University law professor William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers decision and the relatively conservative nature of the current 
court make gay-rights proponents nervous about Supreme Court action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can avoid taking cases to the Supreme Court until it gets 
reconfigured some more," said Janet E. Halley, a lesbian legal scholar at 
Stanford. "I don't know what would happen. But I don't want to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if gays do lose another major case before the Supreme Court, advocates 
say the state courts will provide other opportunities. Despite the Bowers 
ruling, for instance, there have been decisions striking down sodomy laws on 
the grounds that they violate state constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases that may well reach the Supreme Court first are the military ones, 
where gays are perhaps on the shakiest ground because of the historic deference 
the court has granted the military in policy and rule making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military cases have been great, but I don't think they're going to hold 
up," warned Matt Coles, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 His pessimism stems partly from the reasons underlying last year's decisions 
favoring gays: that the government failed to prove a "rational basis" for its 
discrimination against gay service members. Coles believes the Supreme Court 
chipped away at that line of argument last year in a case involving commitment 
of the mentally ill, when the justices seemed to grant considerable leeway to 
government entities in meeting the "rational basis" standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, on the other hand, sees encouraging signs in the lower courts' reliance 
on the rationality test. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that it gave the judges a vehicle for declaring discrimination 
against gays unconstitutional without having to find that homosexuals belong to 
what is known in legal jargon as a "suspect classification" -- such as race or 
national origin -- deserving of greater legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice if gays were granted that designation, he says, but the 
judges' willingness to rule in favor of gays without taking that step opens 
other legal avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, last year's decisions followed various legal paths. The Hawaii court 
concluded that the state ban on same-sex marriage amounted to gender 
discrimination. The Colorado decision threw out the anti-gay rights initiative 
on the grounds that the measure interfered with gays' right to participate in 
the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1993 rulings, gay-rights attorneys seem most confident that the 
Colorado decision will be upheld. Not only have courts overturned similar 
measures in recent years, but advocates contend the initiatives blatantly 
target gays. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, gay-rights opponents insist they will ultimately prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at (the decisions) as a real setback at all," said Robert 
Skolrood, executive director of the National Legal Foundation, a conservative 
public interest group that helped draft the language of the anti-gay rights 
initiatives in Colorado and Cincinnati. "I think they're treading on really 
thin ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Skolrood argues that the Colorado ruling "created out of whole cloth a new 
right that federal law or U.S. Supreme Court decisions haven't given anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Heartened by the Colorado court's refusal to declare gays a protected class, 
Skolrood also dismissed any notion that the decisions would slow attempts to 
put initiatives before voters in other states.

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST FACES TRIAL FOR CHEMICAL-ARMS REPORT; RIGHTS: U.S. HAS 
LOBBIED IN VAIN FOR OPEN PROCEEDINGS. CASE WILL TEST MOSCOW'S DEFINITION OF 
FREE SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite protests from U.S. officials and international human rights groups, a 
Russian scientist who publicized an alleged covert chemical-weapons program 
faces trial Thursday on charges of divulging state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed-door trial of Vil S. Mirzayanov, the first dissident of Boris N. 
Yeltsin's presidency, comes just days before President Clinton is scheduled to 
arrive in Moscow for summit talks. The U.S. State Department, which has 
repeatedly expressed concern about the Mirzayanov case, had lobbied for an open 
trial with international observers permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please do not think democratization has succeeded. It hasn't," Mirzayanov 
said in an interview Tuesday after warning visitors that the conversation in 
his Moscow apartment was being wiretapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution of the 59-year-old chemist raises questions about how the new 
Russia will define free speech when the subject is national security -- and 
whether the old Soviet security and legal systems can be reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov was arrested in October, 1992, for publishing a newspaper article 
alleging that Russian scientists were producing a new and highly potent type of 
chemical weapon as late as the spring of 1992 -- that is, more than two years 
after the Soviet Union signed an agreement to halt production of chemical 
weapons, and several months after Yeltsin promised to abide by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov and co-author Lev Fyodorov wrote that chemists at the Government 
All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology had 
concocted a nerve agent more toxic than any previously known. They warned that 
an accident could also endanger Muscovites living near the drab institute on 
the northeastern outskirts of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov was held for 12 days in a former KGB prison and then released, but 
he is not allowed to leave Moscow. He says he spent nearly a year reading and 
copying by hand the five volumes of evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his wife, Nuria, traveled to the United States to accept on her 
husband's behalf a special award for "moral courage" from the Cavallo 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Cambridge, Mass. Nuria Mirzayanov and 
Fyodorov also met with State Department officials to voice their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov said he believes that chemical-weapon research at the plant is "in 
stagnation" but that the research provides "a good foundation" for future 
weaponry should it be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist said he is particularly concerned that the stockpiled toxin, or 
its ingredients, could be exported to such nations as Iraq or Libya. The 
chemicals in question, which he said he could not name, are not on the list of 
substances that Yeltsin has banned from export because they are known 
components for chemical weapons, Mirzayanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov says that evidence against him has been falsified, that the 
commission set up to investigate his "crimes" was packed with KGB employees and 
that he never had access to the classified data he is accused of disclosing. He 
said he doubts he can get a fair trial behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov argues that political reform has been superficial. While former 
dissidents can now freely criticize Cabinet ministers, the "machine" of state 
repression has not been dismantled by the Yeltsin government and continues to 
be used against critics of the still powerful military-industrial complex, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machine is working, and Yeltsin cannot stop it without damage to 
himself," Mirzayanov said. "Yeltsin does not run the machine. Yeltsin can 
influence only some separate parts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression that he is imprisoned by the military, the KGB, the 
Interior Ministry. He does not have a wide range of choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have had little to say about the case. At the time of Mirzayanov's 
arrest, the Security Ministry -- the renamed KGB -- issued a statement saying 
he had impermissibly disclosed information "about developments in the field of 
chemical technology." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Security Ministry officials summoned a Baltimore Sun reporter who 
had interviewed Mirzayanov for a four-hour interrogation at Lefortovo prison. 
The American reporter, as well as two Russian journalists, were among the 
witnesses who were listed to be called by the government to testify at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), one of several U.S. lawmakers who have urged 
the Clinton Administration to pursue the case, said he was "deeply troubled" by 
the news that a closed trial is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuation of closed and secret trials in Russia is very disturbing, 
especially on the eve of the upcoming summit," Conyers said in a statement, 
adding that he would ask Secretary of State Warren Christopher to appeal 
personally for Mirzayanov's release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whistle-blowers on both sides of the now-defunct Iron Curtain deserve 
protection, not prosecution," Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the Mirzayanov case is on the agenda of pre-summit 
meetings in Moscow of U.S. and Russian human rights officials scheduled to 
begin today. The talks, which are to be held periodically, are aimed at 
building a less confrontational working relationship on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian side is expected to use the forum to discuss human rights problems 
of Russian minorities in the newly independent former Soviet republics, the 
officials said.

TAIWAN GIVES HIJACKER A 9-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Taiwan government, seeking to end a spate of hijackings that saw 10 
mainland Chinese airliners commandeered to Taipei last year, Tuesday sentenced 
one hijacker to nine years in prison and recommended 12-year terms for three 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Wenlong, 28, a former Chinese army officer who sought political asylum 
in Taiwan, was sentenced after being convicted of air piracy and violating 
national security laws by the district court in the northern county of Taoyuan. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a switchblade and a toy pistol, he forced a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 
carrying 72 people to fly to Taiwan on June 24 and asked for political asylum. 
Two crew members were slightly injured in a scuffle on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang, who retired from the Chinese army with the rank of lieutenant in 1989, 
told reporters he would appeal the verdict. His case was the second of the 10 
hijackings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those charged Tuesday were Zhang Hai, a chauffeur, and self-proclaimed 
pro-democracy dissidents Li Xiangyu and Han Shuxue. Both of those hijackings 
occurred in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan has so far rejected China's demands for the hijackers to be 
repatriated. But it has said they will be punished severely to deter future 
incidents and then deported from Taiwan after they serve their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen Chinese hijackers involved in last year's incidents, all of them 
asylum-seekers, are now being held in Taiwan. The two men who hijacked the 
first plane have been sentenced to 10-year prison terms.

EAST'S 2ND STORM IN WEEK PILES SNOW 3 FEET DEEP, DISRUPTS POWER 
</P>

<P>
 The second big storm in a week blasted the East from North Carolina to Maine 
on Tuesday, canceling hundreds of airline flights, piling snow nearly three 
feet deep and leaving more than 200,000 people without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a replay of the March blizzard of 1993. We've got problems 
all over the state," said West Virginia National Guard spokesman Capt. Ron 
Garton. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton told thousands of state workers to stay 
home, declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to help 
snow-clearing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 State employees in the eastern third of Kentucky were given the day off. 
Vermont's state government shut down at 2 p.m., and the Legislature adjourned 
on the first day of its 1994 session. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergencies were declared in four east-central Ohio counties and 11 Upstate 
New York counties, and National Guard four-wheel-drive vehicles were sent with 
help. Ohio's House of Representatives canceled a voting session. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools were closed in 16 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people were killed, including a boy who slid into traffic in New 
Hampshire, a man who was hit by a falling tree in West Virginia and four men 
who collapsed while or after shoveling snow. The shoveling victims included two 
men in Rhode Island, one in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports were closed or idled by a lack of flights, Amtrak passengers were 
blocked by ice and downed power lines, and highways were slippery or blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice and snow piled up at a railroad crossing in Summit Township, Pa., causing 
four locomotives of a freight train hauling lumber to derail. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Carolina, the storm halted blood collections in some parts of the 
state. The Red Cross issued an appeal for all available donors to travel to 
collection sites that were still open. 
</P>
<P>
 The heaviest snow was in the central Appalachians and upper Ohio Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In southwestern Pennsylvania, 33 inches fell at Waynesburg, 25 inches piled up 
at North Braddock and 24 inches fell at Uniontown. Downtown Pittsburgh got 20 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Middlebourne, in northern West Virginia, got 28 inches of snow, while 20 
inches fell on West Union, in the north-central part of the state. Twenty-one 
inches fell on Newport, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 20 inches of snow fell on the mountains of North Carolina, and high 
winds and freezing snow were a problem in parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Virginia, emergency shelters were opened for some of the 100,000 to 
150,000 people without power, said state spokeswoman Jill Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 other customers lost power in Maryland, New Jersey, New York 
state, Connecticut, Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio.

BENTSEN URGES TENFOLD RISE IN GUN DEALER LICENSE FEES; FIREARMS: 80% OF SUCH 
SELLERS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY THE INCREASE, SECRETARY SAYS. BUT HE CONCEDES 
THAT TWO-THIRDS OF TRANSACTIONS WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Tuesday called for a nearly tenfold 
increase in gun dealer license fees as a step toward tightening federal 
controls over gun purchases but conceded that the proposal deals with at most a 
third of the nation's weapon sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, a self-described lifetime gun owner and hunter, said hiking license 
fees would weed out as many as 80% of license holders, who Clinton 
Administration officials say acquire the permits solely to take advantage of 
tax breaks and manufacturer's discounts or to ship weapons across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of such licensees has caused serious problems for the 240 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms inspectors responsible for 
policing the industry, said Bentsen, whose department includes the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen acknowledged that the higher fees would have limited effect because 
only one-third of the nation's guns are purchased through the 284,000 licensed 
dealers. He estimated that the other two-thirds come from off-the-street sales, 
from criminals who trade drugs for guns or steal them during burglaries, from 
black markets and flea markets and children who get them from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "No law enforcers -- not 400, not 4,000, not 400,000 -- can stop that," 
Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks to a law enforcement audience at the Treasury Department, Bentsen 
also said he has directed the bureau to try to determine the source of firearms 
in the 10 localities nationwide with the biggest crime problems, which he said 
include Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who is becoming the Clinton Adminstration's point man on gun control, 
noted that he has owned a gun all his life and that he hunted quail only two 
weeks ago. But times have changed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to school, students didn't walk in with fingers on a trigger," he 
said. The former Texas senator said a young adult in his home state "is more 
likely to die from gunfire than from a traffic accident." 
</P>
<P>
 He made clear that steps must be taken now to stop "letting violence endanger 
innocent children. It comes down to one word: guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans own more than 200 million guns, and every 10 seconds another rolls 
off an assembly line and every 11 seconds one is imported, Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that last year's Brady bill, the first major firearms legislation 
enacted by Congress since 1968, raised the federal gun dealer license from $10 
a year to about $66 a year -- $200 for a three-year permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not gone up enough," he said. He proposed that Congress raise the fee to 
$600 a year, which he said is the actual cost to taxpayers of the license. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people get licenses not to sell firearms but to buy them cheap, for 
themselves," he said. "They can plop down $66, call themselves a wholesaler and 
buy direct from the manufacturer. Instead of having to pay, say, $400, they pay 
$250" for a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen cited ATF studies saying that 45% of licensed dealers do not acquire 
any firearms and that another 36% acquire fewer than 10 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't rent retail space to sell 10 guns," he said. "You do that out of 
your kitchen or your car trunk." He contended that the higher license charge 
would drive such people out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. contends that $600 is five times the actual cost of 
the license and that the higher charge would injure legitimate dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also was criticized by gun store owners, including from Bentsen's 
home state, who argued that Congress should consider instead laws that require 
all gun dealers to operate storefronts that can be closely monitored by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sell handguns by the truckloads at gun shows and flea markets with 
little or no regulation," Bill Carter, owner of four Carter's Country gun 
stores in Houston, told Reuter news service.

 Fred Gilliard, owner of a Guns & More in Houston, said the higher fee would 
"stop the guys who buy a few weapons a year, but it does nothing to stop 
criminals."

 In directing ATF to study gun trafficking patterns in the 10 localities, 
Bentsen cited a Justice Department study that found that those areas account 
for 23% of the nation's felonies. Senior Treasury Department officials said the 
study would seek to determine whether guns are being brought into the areas by 
individuals or organizations and where they originate.

U.S. OKS FIRST GRANT FOR FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH SINCE BAN ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government Tuesday approved the first grant for fetal tissue 
research since President Clinton lifted a five-year ban on studies using cells 
from aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is giving $4.5 
million to three institutions to study the effects of implanting fetal tissue 
into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Patricia Grady, head of the federal institute, called the research 
promising. "We are optimistic it will be helpful for at least some of the 
patients," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush banned federal funding for research 
using fetal tissue from elective abortions. But Clinton lifted the ban in one 
of his first official acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some privately funded research continued at the University of Colorado and at 
Yale University throughout the five-year ban, but experts said those studies 
lacked adequate scientific precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson's is a progressive brain disorder whose symptoms include tremors, a 
shuffling walk and a decreased ability to control speech and facial muscles. 
Its precise cause is unknown, but it is connected to the death of brain cells 
that produce dopamine, a chemical key to communication within the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no cure for Parkinson's, but treatment with levodopa, or L-dopa, a 
chemical that partially mimics dopamine, slows the progression in some 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new grant, 40 Parkinson's patients now under treatment at the 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York will be evaluated to determine 
the extent of their disease. They will be videotaped and their movements 
measured by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients also will undergo a brain imaging technique called Positron 
Emission Tomography at the North Shore University Hospital on Long Island. The 
technique measures the function of brain cells that produce dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients then will get fetal tissue transplants at the University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Tissue used in the transplants comes from fetuses aborted after seven to eight 
weeks of gestation, when the fetus is about an inch long. Doctors then remove a 
brain structure about the size of a grain of rice and extract about a half 
million cells to be injected into the patients' brains.

AIR FORCE CITES PILOT ERROR IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Air Force investigator has found that pilot error, and not an aircraft 
malfunction, caused the crash of an F-16 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force investigators attributed the crash to "momentary complacency" on the 
part of the pilot, Joe Bill Dryden, who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this type of accident occurred at all was very surprising to 
all concerned," Col. Edward L. Daniel of Eglin Air Force Base said in a report 
made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About four seconds before the aircraft crashed into a field, Dryden ejected at 
an altitude of 626 feet. The altitude was too low and it was too late to avoid 
a fireball that consumed the aircraft on impact.

BROWN SETS UP EDUCATION HOT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preparation for a statewide education summit next month, Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown has set up a 24-hour toll-free hot line to accept suggestions on 
how to improve California's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Those suggestions will be considered by legislators and educators at the 
summit, to be held on Feb. 15 and 16 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line number is 1-800-773-2594 (1-800-SPEAK-94). Tapes of phoned-in 
suggestions might be played at the summit, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The education summit is aimed at analyzing the condition of California's 
public education system and devising solutions to its problems. In preparation 
for the two-day forum, local summits will be held around the state this month, 
allowing Assembly members, parents, teachers and school board members to focus 
on local issues.

WESTMONT THE LATEST TO FALL TO MASTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times are changing for the better for The Master's College men's basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs added further proof of that Tuesday night with a 69-56 victory 
over Westmont in a nonconference game at The Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mustangs have only won three of 32 meetings with district power 
Westmont, it was their second victory in the last three games. The Master's 
also avenged a 67-64 loss in the second round of last year's NAIA District 3 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Emeka Okenwa had 22 points and 10 rebounds for The Master's (13-3), but 
several players contributed to the Mustangs' stampede at the start of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 27-26, at halftime, Master's scored 18 of the first 22 points after 
intermission to take a 45-30 lead with 12 minutes 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Five players scored during the run, which began on a short jump shot by Okenwa 
and was capped by a pair of three-point shots by Mike Penberthy that hit 
nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they just wore us down in the second half," Westmont Coach John Moore 
said. "Our guys played so hard in the first half, applying as much defensive 
pressure as possible, that it took a lot out of them. . . . You have to be in 
great, great shape to do that for a whole game and we couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give Master's credit, they took it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Oates, first-year coach at Master's, credited his team's defense for the 
victory, the Mustangs' second in a row and ninth in the last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't shoot the ball tonight like we're capable of," Oates said. 
"But we picked up our defensive intensity in the second half and really got 
after them." 
</P>
<P>
 While several Westmont players seemed to be a half-step slow in the second 
half, the 6-foot-7, 230-pound Okenwa appeared to get stronger: He scored 16 
points after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to him a lot in the second half because he was able to get open 
underneath," Oates said. "But this team has proved all year that there's a lot 
more to our offense than just him." 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley added 11 points and Doug Leaman scored 10 for The Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Spears scored 12 points and Matt Gazaway had 11 for Westmont (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Master's led by one at halftime after going on a 11-5 run to close the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley began the run with a layup off an assist from Okenwa, and Okenwa capped 
it with a pair of free throws with 1:11 to play.

CSUN CLIMBS HILL TO END SKID, 90-72; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: HE SINKS CRUCIAL 
THREE-POINTER AS MATADORS DEFEAT BUFFALO, SNAP SIX-GAME LOSING STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hill must be a quick study, and for that Cal State Northridge should be 
thankful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador basketball team may be 2-10 this season, but it is 1-0 this year 
because of some aggressive and heady play during the final minutes of what was 
a 90-72 victory over the University of Buffalo on Tuesday night in a 
nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a sophomore who has occasionally been maligned for lack of floor 
leadership, was at the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust into the heat of a competitive scrap with less than five minutes to go, 
he responded by sinking the shot of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's three-point basket with 3:49 to play sparked a 7-0 Northridge run and 
the Matadors went on to quickly make a rout out of a close game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill entered after Andre Chevalier, Northridge's senior point guard, was 
forced to remove himself after re-injuring his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, originally incurred last Thursday during practice, was aggravated 
with a little more than five minutes left. Chevalier, who scored 13 points and 
handed out seven assists, attempted to shake it off, but found that he could 
not control the ball on the dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, the timing could not have been worse. In the previous eight 
minutes, Buffalo (4-8) had trimmed what had been a 16-point Matador advantage 
to 67-63. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of stalling, Northridge seemed to shift into a higher gear, 
scoring on its next 12 possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to turn it up and we did," said Brooklyn McLinn, who made four of six 
three-point attempts and scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something we haven't been able to do all year." 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn also mused that he might deserve some credit for Hill's clutch 
performance. Over the weekend he loaned the sophomore understudy a book. Its 
title: The Mental Fundamentals of Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to concentrate on the chapters on shooting and momentum," McLinn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there not one on self confidence? Told that Hill said he was "scared" 
taking over for Chevalier, McLinn responded, "I'm glad he didn't say that to 
me. I probably would have told Coach to take him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Yard, a 6-6 low post player, scored eight points in the final four 
minutes 19 seconds and finished with a career-high 30 on 13 of 18 shooting. He 
also had 10 rebounds as Northridge held a 49-31 edge on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy attributed Yard's big game to matchups. 
Buffalo's lineup was not much taller than that of Northridge, yet the Bulls 
decided to play Yard straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a more open-court situation," Cassidy said. "They didn't double and 
triple down on him like a lot of teams do. When you try to guard Chris one on 
one you're asking for trouble, I think. He can beat most people one on one." 
</P>
<P>
 On the boards, Yard got plenty of support from Shawn Stone, who pulled down a 
career-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's play inside was of particular importance because the Matadors were 
without Shane O'Doherty, their 6-11 backup center. O'Doherty has a sprained 
right ankle and is questionable for Saturday's game at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier is questionable as well. Cassidy said his hand will be examined this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 His health is of primary concern because the Irvine game marks the start of 
seven consecutive road games to finish out the month.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: A FEW DEEP BREATHS, THEN BACK TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Melissa Hearlihy, the Alemany High girls' basketball coach, exudes dedication 
to the sport, but she recently stretched even her definition of commitment by 
returning only five days after undergoing a Cesarean section and giving birth 
to her first child. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Joshua, was born Dec. 15. On Dec. 20, Hearlihy coached Alemany in a 
game in the Simi Valley tournament, which the Indians ultimately won. In all, 
she missed only four games because of the pregnancy and birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been a little much," said Hearlihy, who is in her ninth season 
at Alemany. "But I asked my kids to make a commitment this year, so I felt like 
I need to do it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it wasn't a piece of cake. The hardest part was that (Joshua) wasn't 
sleeping. By the championship game (Dec. 23), I was exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy has taken a maternity leave from teaching at Alemany until 
mid-February, but plans to continue coaching throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hearlihy, Alemany won a Southern Section II-A title in 1992 and advanced 
to the III-AA championship game last season. NORTHWEST VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 The Sky's the Limit 
</P>
<P>
 How good can Reseda be? 
</P>
<P>
 Starting guards Trenton Cross and Archie Williams already have said the 
Regents (12-0) can win the City Section 3-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 A rival coach, checking in with a much-more-objective opinion, takes it a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft Coach Jim Woodard said that if Reseda knocks off Chatsworth in a 
much-anticipated conference opener Friday night, the Regents might not lose 
another game. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the 3-A teams can beat them," Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the conference format, Reseda plays the 4-A West Valley League teams -- 
Cleveland, Taft, Kennedy and Chatsworth -- once each. The Regents twice will 
face San Fernando, El Camino Real and Granada Hills -- members of Reseda's 3-A 
North Valley League -- and all have losing records. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard points out that since the City's 3-A champion does not advance to the 
state playoffs, the Regents won't have to face the likes of Crenshaw or Mater 
Dei in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as Taft's chances against Reseda? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bigger than us, quicker, shoot the ball better and handle the ball 
better," Woodard said. "Other than that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the secret to Reseda's blistering start is its success at the 
free-throw line. The Regents (12-0) are shooting 75% from the line -- and 
several key players have bettered that pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Bailey (33 of 37) leads the team at 89.2%, followed by Roderick Jones 
(32 of 39 for 82.1%), Trenton Cross (54 of 68 for 78.3%) and Archie Williams 
(40 of 52 for 76.9%). 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, Cross and Williams often rotate at the point position. In last week's 
Birmingham tournament final against Grant, Reseda committed only seven 
turnovers in a 65-57 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't press 'em and you can't foul 'em," said Woodard, who watched the 
game. "What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Crider turned heads when he was hired at Cleveland four years ago. 
Crider, who formerly coached basketball at L.A. High and still lives in the 
L.A. Basin, often rode his bike to work, a round-trip commute of 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, though, Crider was given a not-so-subtle indication that his 
car was a far safer mode of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 While cycling to school at around 5:30 a.m., Crider says, a group of 
"gangsters" pointed a gun at him from a moving car near Normandie and Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the message," Crider said. "I almost got shot." 
</P>

 Granada Hills is off to a 4-7 start, which may not seem like much, but the 
Highlanders were 3-18 last season and 3-19 the season before. 
</P>
<P>
 Under first-year Coach Lou Cicciari, Granada Hills won three of four games 
heading into conference play this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem is that the seniors on the team over the past couple of 
years have really gotten thrashed," Cicciari said. "They don't know how to win. 
I think they're finally starting to find out." GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Double Threat 
</P>
<P>
 No frills. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Al Lairson liked it during football season and the way he wants 
it for basketball. No trinkets, no baubles, no bells and no whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 "His claim to fame is that he wouldn't tape his ankles and won't wear T-shirts 
under his pads or anything," Palmdale Coach Garry Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
 No tape on the ankles for basketball, either. There is a notable common thread 
between the sports: Lairson might be the best player on either team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he caught a league-high 56 passes for 765 yards and was the team's 
kicker. In basketball, Lairson, an honor student, has posted team-high marks of 
15.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. EAST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Bounds 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be misled by North Hollywood's 6-5 start. The Huskies are still one of 
the premier teams in the City. All of their losses have been to teams from 
outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the defeats: 
</P>
<P>
 1. East Anchorage in the Alaska tournament. North Hollywood lost by 29 points 
to a team ranked No. 1 in the state that features Duke-bound Trajan Langdon. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Science Hill of Tennessee in the Alaska tournament. Trailing by 11 after 
three quarters, the Huskies rallied but lost, 73-70, to a team that finished 
second in the 1993 Tennessee state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Payson (Utah) in the Las Vegas tournament. The Huskies rallied from a 
15-point deficit and reclaimed the lead only to lose on a short jump shot at 
the buzzer. Payson is ranked No. 3 in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Miami Norland in the Las Vegas tournament. North Hollywood lost to the 
third-ranked team in Florida by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Decatur of Washington in the Las Vegas tournament. The state's 
second-ranked team intercepted North Hollywood's inbound pass and converted it 
into a dunk to win, 45-43, as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Coach Steve Miller disappointed with the Huskies' near-.500 start? No, not 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those games down the line are going to help us," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood was 51-3 in its two previous seasons, but winning games is not 
all it's cracked up to be, according to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got us nothing the last two years," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood did not advance past the quarterfinals the past two seasons. 
DEL REY LEAGUE

<P>
 Ho Hum, Another Upset 
</P>
<P>
 It's becoming an annual event.

<P>
 St. John Bosco, one of the Southland's best high school basketball teams, goes 
through its nonleague schedule with one loss, then opens the league season by 
being upset at St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Knights beat the Braves, 59-54, on Monday night, improving to 10-4 
and dropping St. John Bosco to 13-2. Last season, St. Francis won, 64-62, 
despite entering the game with a 5-7 record. After that victory, the Golden 
Knights won 10 of their next 12. The team heated up before the St. John Bosco 
game this year, winning eight of nine after starting 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Braden Weber (6-foot-8, 223 pounds) led St. Francis with 24 points 
against St. John Bosco. Weber had just been named most valuable player in the 
Chaminade tournament, which the Golden Knights won last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jelani Gardner, St. John Bosco's standout forward, scored 30 points, but St. 
Francis held the rest of the team to 24. PACIFIC LEAGUE

<P>
 Glendale got off to a 12-4 start despite having players missing with injuries 
or illness in every game. The Dynamiters have played this season with as few as 
eight players. 
</P>
<P>
 The absences have made five-on-five practices difficult. Coach Bob Davidson 
has been forced to recruit junior varsity players for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't gotten so bad that I've had to suit up, though," Davidson said.

<P>
 May Dishes to Spindt 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Hart has jumped to a 15-1 start with no superstars and a lot of 
teamwork. With point guard Eric Spindt leading a pass-happy half-court offense, 
the Indians average about 15 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one key to Hart's success. The other is defense. And for that, Coach 
Mike May gives an assist to Spindt -- not Eric Spindt but his father, Gary 
Spindt. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Spindt, a teacher at Hart, spent the summer of 1992 teaching 
man-to-man defense to the players while the Hart administration was deciding on 
a new coach. Spindt was a candidate. When May got the job, he asked Spindt to 
be his assistant and to continue his work teaching defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes that's a touchy situation, but it worked," May said. "Our 
philosophies were the same in terms of defense. We were on the same page." 
</P>

 Burbank Coach Jeff Davis is making no excuses for the Bulldogs' 5-8 record but 
he said his players sometime have difficulty concentrating in practice. That's 
because college recruiters -- sometimes head coaches -- have frequented the 
afternoon workouts to see Willie Perryman. 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman, a 6-4, 215-pound tight end and linebacker on the football team who 
plays forward on the basketball team, is being recruited by several Pacific-10 
Conference schools. Davis said Perryman is leaning toward USC, but he hasn't 
decided yet. He received a house call from Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez on 
Monday. MARMONTE LEAGUE

<P>
 What if they organized a tournament and nobody came? 
</P>
<P>
 Royal pulled an unusual no-show at a recent boys' soccer tournament -- the 
first Royal Invitational. Because of a scheduling conflict, the Highlanders -- 
hosts and sponsors of the tournament -- could not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix-up occurred because longtime Simi Valley Coach Andy Silva resigned at 
the end of last season and became a Royal assistant this season. Silva brought 
the tournament he organized -- the Simi Valley Invitational -- with him and 
renamed it the Royal Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem? Royal already had scheduled its quota of matches for 
December and playing in its own tournament would have put it over the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to switch some of our nonleague matches but we couldn't do it," 
Royal Coach Kevin Corley said. "But we'll be in it next year." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Moorpark won. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Royal boys' soccer team won the Don Lugo tournament last week by beating 
four undefeated teams, including powerful Chino. Jeff Smilen, who has five 
goals this season, was the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Butcher (11 goals) and Tim Pederson (six goals) also have had excellent 
seasons for the Highlanders (13-1-1). CAMINO REAL LEAGUE

 Streak Redux? 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Bell-Jeff girls' basketball team lost two games early in the 
season, then won 26 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Bell-Jeff lost three games early, but has currently won six in a 
row. Coach Jim Couch is eyeing a similar strong finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things go well, we can win the next 14 in league," Couch said. "That would 
be a 20-game streak. I'll settle for that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Guards are led by Cathy Flores (16.8 points per game), Christina Ticsay 
(13.1) and Carrie Breedlove (18 rebounds per game). CHANNEL LEAGUE

<P>
 Painful Setback 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura girls' basketball team suffered a blow when standout guard Ember 
Brown suffered an ankle injury Dec. 23 that will sideline her for at least 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors believe Brown, a 5-foot-8 junior, has a hairline fracture of her right 
ankle, said Cougar Coach Glenn Gray, though X-rays were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're taking no chances," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown leads Ventura in scoring, averaging 16.4 points a game. She was a Times 
All-Ventura County pick and an all-state sophomore team selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see what we're made of," Gray said. "Someone has to step up and 
put the ball in the hole. Maybe this will make us a better team down the road."

PEREZ IS BACK, BURROUGHS IS ON TRACK, 2-1 
</P>

 What a difference a year makes -- not. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their Foothill League match Tuesday, the boys' soccer teams from Hart 
and Burroughs highs appeared to be enjoying -- or suffering through -- seasons 
that were polar opposites of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, the league's cellar dweller last season, was undefeated in eight matches 
and won its holiday tournament. Burroughs, two-time defending league champion, 
lost six matches, including its first league defeat since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Burroughs showed Hart why it is still the league favorite with a 2-1 
victory at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they'd be strong," Hart Coach Robert Benavidez said of Burroughs. 
"They've got a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 That team hasn't been all together for awhile, which explained some of 
Burroughs' defeats. Roberto Perez, a center midfielder and preseason 
All-American, and his cousin, forward Jesus Diaz, spent the past two weeks in 
Mexico for a relative's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez returned to action against Hart and made a sudden impact. His centering 
pass led to the match's first goal and his 20-yard blast on a free kick gave 
Burroughs a 2-0 lead late in the first half. In the second half he switched to 
fullback to bolster the defense as Burroughs protected its lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their team really feeds off him," Benavidez said. "He's very smooth, and when 
he runs it looks effortless. He's got the ball and then, boom, he feeds the 
ball to a teammate and it's in the back of the net. He's got great skills, a 
tremendous attitude and has a great future in soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, a 5-foot-6, 130-pound senior, controlled play when he possessed the 
ball. His fluid quickness and precise moves continually set up chances for his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a vision and he understands the game," Burroughs Coach Mike Kodama 
said. "For us, Roberto plays everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere includes in the defense, when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart forward Rafael Verduzco drew a penalty kick in the 29th minute of the 
second half, and forward Oscar Franco converted the shot to cut the lead to 
2-1. But from that point, Perez anchored the Burroughs defense to run out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt pretty good," he said. "Personally, I just wanted to get back with my 
teammates. I'm thinking that we won't lose again."

<P>
 Burroughs High came into Hart's gym with a 1-9 record but was able to give the

third quarter of the Foothill League game Tuesday night before falling, 61-43.

 The Compton Dominguez girls' basketball team might have set a state record for 
playing the most games in a month. The Dons capped a busy December by winning 
the Los Angeles Invitational Division B title last Thursday and running their 
record to 16-1. They opened the season Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody keeps asking me if the girls are tired," said Albert Turner, 
Dominguez's second-year coach. "But it's very hard to tell with girls. I told 
them they could skip practice on New Year's Day, and they got mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
 After several nonleague victories, Dominguez started a busy tournament 
schedule by winning the Las Vegas Holiday Classic. The Dons followed that with 
titles at the Santa Ana Calvary Chapel tournament and L.A. Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 By playing on almost every available day in December, the Dons wound up 
practicing on game days. Turner said his young team needed the time together on 
the court; forward Markisha Woods is the team's only senior. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 17 games in 28 days might have violated Southern Section rules. A team 
cannot play more than six games in a tournament, and the Dons played seven at 
Las Vegas. Dean Crowley, section commissioner, said he is reviewing the team's 
schedule. If a violation is found, he said, the school might have to cancel a 
game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A couple of local boys' basketball teams -- Compton Dominguez and Crenshaw -- 
gained national recognition during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez upset top-seeded Oak Hill Academy of Virginia in the second round of 
the Las Vegas Invitational two weeks ago, 65-48. Oak Hill started the 
tournament as the top-rated team in the country. Dominguez lost the next day, 
however, to Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw replaced Oak Hill as No. 1 team in USA Today's ratings last week 
after winning the Palms Classic tournament in Ft. Meyers, Fla. But the Cougars 
faltered last week at the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C., losing 
twice and finishing fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 After his team lost to Philadelphia Simon Gratz in the semifinals, Crenshaw 
Coach Willie West benched center Kristaan Johnson for disciplinary reasons. 
Without Johnson, the City Section 4-A Division player of the year in 1992-93, 
Crenshaw lost to Richland Northeast of South Carolina in the third-place game, 
74-65. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a coaching decision," West said of benching Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mater Dei replaced Crenshaw as the Southland's top team. The 
Monarchs improved to 14-0 by defeating Long Beach Wilson in the championship 
game of the Orange tournament last Thursday at Chapman University, 82-60. 
</P>
<P>
 An already talented Mater Dei team has been helped by the addition of Schea 
Cotton, a freshman who recently transferred from St. John Bosco in Bellflower. 
Cotton, a 6-foot-5 forward, made his debut with the Monarchs on Dec. 22, coming 
off the bench to score 17 points in a victory over Orange El Modena. He started 
against Wilson and scored 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Another team to watch is Westchester, which has won nine in a row since 
starting the season 4-3. The Comets lost to Mater Dei and Los Alamitos in the 
Tournament of Champions in Huntington Beach in mid-December but won the Las 
Vegas Invitational and the Lakewood Artesia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester defeated East Anchorage of Alaska, 83-81, in double overtime in 
the final of the Los Vegas Invitational two weeks ago, and knocked off 
Inglewood in the Artesia championship game last Thursday, 66-53. 
</P>
<P>
 "We returned four starters and seven players this season, so we expected to be 
good," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Melissa Hearlihy asked her girls' basketball team at Mission Hills Alemany to 
make a big commitment this season to winning a Southern Section championship. 
So Hearlihy was not about to stay home and rest after the birth of her first 
child three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy, in her ninth season with the Indians, had a Cesarean section, giving 
birth to a son, Joshua, on Dec. 15. The next week, she was back on the court, 
directing Alemany to the championship of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely felt a little tired coming back so quick," said Hearlihy, whose 
team started 11-0. "But I couldn't stand not to be on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany did not play in a tournament last week, giving its coach a much-needed 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos Gahr girls' basketball team will have to forfeit its 10 victories 
for using an ineligible player. Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, 
said the player in question is a junior transfer student who started every game 
last month. . . . The Harvard-Westlake boys' team is off to its best start at 
12-0. It upset Glendora for the championship of the Covina tournament last 
Thursday. The Wolverines are led by freshmen Jason and Jarron Collins, 
identical twins. Jason, a 6-8 center, is averaging 17 points, 11 rebounds and 
three blocked shots and was MVP of the Covina tournament. Jarron, a 6-7 
forward, is averaging nine points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots. "It is 
very difficult for our opponents to tell them apart," said Greg Hilliard, 
Harvard-Westlake's coach. "I don't even know who is who half the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roosevelt girls' team withdrew from the L.A. Invitational last week 
because its coach protested a late scheduling change. After the Roughriders 
defeated Dorsey in the quarterfinals, they were supposed to play Santa Monica 
Crossroads in the semifinals. But Jerry Weiner, the tournament director, said 
he made a mistake on the bracket and told Coach Lorenzo Garcia that Roosevelt 
instead would play top-seeded Lynwood in the semifinals. Upset over the 
last-minute change, Garcia pulled his team out of the tournament. . . . 
Brea-Olinda solidified its position as the No. 1 girls' basketball team in the 
Southland by defeating Lake Oswego Lakeridge of Oregon in the championship game 
of the Alaska Invitational in Anchorage last Thursday, 63-54. Guard Nicole 
Erickson scored 38 points in the title game for the Ladycats (11-0).

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; CHAPMAN USES TWO BIG RUNS TO TOP CLAREMONT

 Chapman had little difficulty building a big lead early against Claremont 
College on Tuesday night but holding on to it proved to be much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers finally emerged with an 83-74 victory in Orange to run their 
record to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman took a 15-2 lead on Greg Reynolds' three-point basket with 14:52 left 
in the first half and cruised to a 38-31 halftime lead. In the second half, 
Claremont made a 23-7 run and led 54-44 with 14:29 left in the game as Stag 
forward Chris Fosse scored eight consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went from seven up to 10 down quicker than any team I've ever been 
associated with," said Panther Coach Mike Bokosky. "They're strong inside. 
They're good players." 
</P>
<P>
 With Claremont (3-5) leading 58-57 on Fosse's basket with 9:05 remaining, the 
Panthers went on a 14-3 run for a 71-61 lead with 5:53 left. A pair of 
three-point baskets by Anthony Gonzales and a three-point play by Umahl 
Anderson highlighted the run. Chapman's free-throw shooting down the stretch 
preserved the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Mumaw and Anderson led Chapman with 16 and 14 points. Fosse and former 
Laguna Beach standout Darren Gravley led Claremont with 20 and 18 points. TOM

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ROUND TRIP HAS SOME UPS, DOWNS; WAYLON JENNINGS' FULL-CIRCLE 
PERFORMANCE AT THE CRAZY HORSE FEATURED SOME STILL-RELEVANT SONGS BUT WAS 
TARNISHED A BIT BY AN UNADVENTUROUS ITINERARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waylon Jennings clearly appreciates the cycles of life. Why else would he have 
titled his 1979 album "What Goes Around Comes Around" and his '88 effort "Full 
Circle"? 
</P>
<P>
 His early show Monday at the Crazy Horse -- the first of four Monday and 
Tuesday -- captured the upside and the downside of such cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the circular nature of his recording history, Jennings, 56, cited his 
return to RCA after eight years away, an event marked by the release of a 
double-CD boxed set of 40 of his songs from his previous stint with the label, 
an affiliation that lasted about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he is very pleased with the project, he pulled a handful of songs from 
his RCA years into a medley that gave fair treatment to each, rather than 
quickly hitting a key verse or chorus and moving on. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of the full-circle mood of the evening was how remarkably 
accurate his song "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" remains nearly 20 years 
after he first recorded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, such Texans as Jennings, Willie Nelson and other "outlaws" were 
just getting a boot in the door of the Nashville-dominated country-music 
industry. That song, and the movement it characterized, provided a much-needed 
jolt to a status quo that had left all but a select few musicians artistically 
straitjacketed by slick production and stock sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jennings' song put it: 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar.  
</P>
<P>
 Where do we take it from here?  
</P>
<P>
 Rhinestone suits and big shiny cars.  
</P>
<P>
 It's been the same way for years.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that country is more popular than ever, the same kind of predictability 
has left anybody not willing to conform out in the cold. So his selection of 
that number midway through the 65-minute set served as more than a trip down 
memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, much of his set was afflicted by restricted parameters as he 
hewed closely to the same set list on which he has relied for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, Jennings -- like Johnny Cash and Emmylou Harris -- has 
eschewed the round-up-the-usual-suspects approach to choosing material by other 
writers. That has been evident in his early support of such unsung country 
songsmiths as Billy Joe Shaver and Rodney Crowell as well as his willingness to 
record songs by such rock-world figures as Los Lobos and Neil Young. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, the emphasis was on songs he has done countless times ("Mammas 
Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys," "Good Hearted Woman"), performed 
competently but without inspiration, and to the exclusion of his worthy recent 
material that country radio has bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfect example from his most recent album, 1992's "Too Dumb for New York 
City, Too Ugly for L.A.," is "Just Talkin.' " The song runs counter to the 
love-it-or-leave-it mind-set that still afflicts too many country musicians' 
attitudes toward the good ol' U.S.A. But no doubt it still would have been 
cheered for capturing the frustration of so many average Joes and Janes over 
the way the political process has taken on a life of its own: 
</P>
<P>
 We got a lot of politicians  
</P>
<P>
 Up there on Capitol Hill.  
</P>
<P>
 Ain't it funny how they prosper  
</P>
<P>
 While the country stands still?  
</P>
<P>
 But instead, the only song Jennings drew from the latest album was the 
borderline novelty tune "Smokey on Your Front Door." Hank certainly didn't do 
it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings' rich baritone, of course, is still a thing of wonder, as he 
demonstrated anew with a haunting version of Bob McDill's "Amanda," about a man 
who regrets the things he hasn't been able to give, or be, to the woman he 
loves. Likewise, his signature guitar-driven sound, as instantly definable as 
Cash's, carries him a long way. But there was a time not so long ago when 
Jennings wouldn't have been satisfied to be carried. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His five-man band hemmed him in as often as it helped him soar. Steel 
guitarist Robby Turner was his chief ally, turning in several colorful, 
unpredictable solos that amplified the yearnings or uncertainties Jennings was 
singing about. But drummer Jeff Hale dragged songs down periodically with 
uncomfortably square rhythmic foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings' wife, Jessi (Still Not Lisa After All These Years) Colter, joined 
him late in the show and put far more emotion into the obligatory performance 
of her 1975 hit "I'm Not Lisa" than anyone could have expected her to, given 
that she has sung it at most every Jennings show since Gerald Ford was 
President.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CHEAP TRICK: IT'S NOT AN ADVENTURE, IT'S A JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boy, did I ever used to be a huge Cheap Trick fan, starting back in the 
mid-'70s days when it was just another unknown band playing the Whisky. And 
boy, is it ever embarrassing when a band you tout as one of the greatest rock 
groups ever becomes a success and blows it. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few years the Wisconsin-based quartet certainly seemed to warrant 
touting. While as loud as other hard-rock bands, the group threw out all the 
other conventions, making music that was both gut-level exciting and possessed 
of a sly intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Rick Nielsen played surprising Jeff Beck-inspired solos and invented 
distinctive riffs; drummer Bun E. Carlos pounded out driving rhythms with 
Ringo-worthy fills; bassist Tom Petersson created huge landscapes of sound with 
his 12-string bass; and singer Robin Zander clearly ranked as one of the 
all-time great rock shouters, starting where John Lennon's primal scream left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Their power pop was infectious stuff, to the degree that the small record 
store I ran in the '70s sold several boxes of the live "Cheap Trick at Budokan" 
album, an expensive Japanese import, just by playing it in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 This was months before the group's label wised up and issued the album 
domestically. Once the company did, the rest was history, albeit brief. 
</P>
<P>
 The group became an arena-level success, put out one more pretty good album, 
and then became a leaden bore, cranking out predictable bloated arena-rock with 
no individual stamp. While many bands following such a formula stay on top for 
eons, Cheap Trick justly sank from view. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a change like that happens, usually you can only speculate on what 
happened, like wondering if the industry scooped out the band's brains or 
something. But in Cheap Trick's case, Nielsen pretty well spelled out the cause 
in an interview in Trouser Press magazine at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, he talked about the band's pre-fame days, when they could do anything 
they wanted, including nights when he'd play much of their set on accordion. 
Once they had an audience, he lamented, they had to do what the audience 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Cheap Trick's show Monday at the Coach House, where the 
latter ethic still prevailed. What was once an adventure is now clearly a job. 
</P>
<P>
 They do that job very well, giving fans value for their dollar, but even as 
musical shopkeepers, they should know to rotate their stock more.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some good news and some great news," Nielsen announced during the 
show. "The good news is that we have a new album coming out in a month and a 
half. The great news is that the next song is not from that album." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was only one song less than 15 years old in the 80-minute set, 
and that, "The Flame," was an '80s anthem-rocker the group didn't even write. 
The Cheap Trick of old would have been all over its new material, or anything 
else that would give its show an edge. They at least might have allowed a song 
or two from Zander's respectable 1993 solo album. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be great news, but there is some good in seeing the band. For 
starters, the players all still have their chops, especially Zander, who sings 
with as much fury and control as he did 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't mugging or hurling picks to the crowd like he was feeding 
squirrels, Nielsen picked some Beck-like gonzo solos. The rhythm section is 
still a thunder lizard (and, yes, it was Petersson on bass, not his replacement 
of a few years Jon Brant, as erroneously reported in Monday's Times). 
</P>
<P>
 While the old songs weren't the unexplored territory they once were, neither 
were they a dead end. "He's a Whore" and Terry Reid's "Speak Now or Forever 
Hold Your Peace" were still fine showcases for Zander's overwhelming pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surrender" and "I Want You to Want Me" floated with their gooney pop 
buoyancy, while 1978's "Heaven Tonight" still stood as a harrowing epic of 
cocaine paranoia, not just lyrically, but with music that seemed to spiral 
simultaneously skyward and hell-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 The only ingredients missing were vision and immediacy. The performance wasn't 
much of an indicator that the band will ever grasp those qualities again, but 
it at least showed that they might know what to do with them if they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent opening act Cisco Poison has improved a bit by losing a member and 
becoming a trio. The advantage is this puts the focus even more on front man 
Joe Wood, once of T.S.O.L. Wood is a sufficiently engaging performer that one 
can nearly enjoy his music just by watching him enjoy it. It's certainly easier 
than trying to appreciate the stuff directly, as it is largely a cliched and 
derivative repackaging of '70s hard-rock excess.

 Acting on a mayoral directive to cut costs and privatize some services, Los 
Angeles City Fire Chief Donald O. Manning proposed a plan Tuesday to hire 
private firms -- and perhaps use trained volunteers -- to handle non-emergency 
calls to free paramedic units for more urgent needs.  
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Roger Gillis, the department's community liaison officer, said 
the department estimated it could save $6 million in the first year and roughly 
$2.8 million in succeeding years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we take away or remove a service, we're not happy about it," Gillis 
said. "The other side of that is that what we're hoping to offer is a quicker, 
better, faster service to calls we know are emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said Manning outlined the proposal Tuesday to the Board of Fire 
Commissioners, and a written proposal will be submitted to the board within 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said the proposal was developed at the direction of the office of Mayor 
Richard Riordan, who campaigned on a platform of contracting some city services 
to private companies to increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings would immediately place 78 firefighters -- now assigned to 
lower-echelon emergency medical service -- back on fire engines and decrease 
response times for the 52 remaining ambulance units staffed by fully qualified 
paramedics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two lower-level medical units and 14 paramedic ambulances in the 
Valley, said Brian Humphrey, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60,000 of the department's 317,000 calls last year were for 
non-emergency complaints such as "stubbed toes, stomachaches, even broken 
limbs," which could be handled by private ambulance companies, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is adopted, paramedics or firefighters with emergency medical 
technician training would be dispatched whenever the nature of the injuries was 
unclear, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average response time for a Fire Department emergency medical vehicle is 4 
1/2 to 6 minutes, Gillis said, acknowledging that service to mountainous or 
outlying areas takes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been informal discussions among department administrators of 
training resident volunteers in large apartment complexes to assist in 
non-emergency calls, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is based on a pilot program, with private ambulance companies, 
used in the San Fernando Valley between January and August, 1991. Fire 
officials consider it a success, he said, and hope to duplicate it on a 
citywide basis. But they acknowledge that it will be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the concerns raised by Gillis is identifying private ambulance 
companies that could promise response times comparable to those required by the 
Fire Department. Another sticking point is that private companies may not be 
eager to service poor areas of the city, where bills for emergency services are 
often not paid, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential holdup is the safety of private emergency workers, said 
Gillis, noting that there were 68 assaults on firefighters in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is made necessary by dwindling department resources since the 1978 
passage of Proposition 13, which cut property tax revenue to municipalities 
across the state, Gillis said. Since that time, fire calls have doubled while 
the number of firefighters has failed to keep pace, rising by 17.8%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's comments were made at a regular meeting of the five-member Board of 
Fire Commissioners. David W. Fleming, vice president of the commission, said he 
favors exploring the idea as "a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the mayor wants to raise both police and fire salaries next year, and 
that would free up some dollars to do that," Fleming added.

HEARING REVISIONS PROTESTED; HOMEOWNERS: THE COUNCIL PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE THE 
NUMBER OF RESIDENTS NOTIFIED ABOUT MEETINGS FOR PROJECTS REQUIRING SPECIAL 
PERMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley homeowner groups told a City Council planning committee 
Tuesday that they object to a proposal to reduce the city's public notification 
requirements for hearings on neighborhood land-use issues, such as liquor sales 
and subdivision construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would reduce the number of residents and property owners notified 
about public hearings for projects that require special city permits. 
Currently, those with property within 500 feet of such projects receive 
notices. The change would limit notification to those within 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, suggested by planning officials as a way to save the city money, 
would also rescind the requirement that hearings be advertised in local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearings that would be affected by the new notification process 
would include meetings on businesses that request conditional-use permits to 
sell alcoholic beverages, make zoning changes or add new subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning officials said they had not determined how much money the city spends 
to notify residents of such public hearings, nor do they know how much the city 
would save by reducing the notification area. When the City Council voted in 
1990 to extend the area from 300 to 500 feet, however, city officials estimated 
they would spend an additional $60,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners said the current notification process is worth the added cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are talking about here is participatory democracy," said Bill Jasper, 
president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "Your priorities should not be 
what it costs. Your priority should be how many people you can notify." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kishbaugh, president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., 
agreed. "If we have to err, let's err on the side of providing more 
participation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Joel Wachs and Laura Chick both said they opposed the proposed 
changes and suggested that the city study ways to more efficiently increase 
notification of public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message should be to increase public participation" not reduce it, Wachs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council's Planning and Land Use Committee declined to make a 
decision on the proposal, deciding instead to refer the entire matter to a 
newly formed commission that is studying ways to streamline the bureaucracy 
that controls development. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission supports the proposed changes in the public notification 
process, the entire matter will be returned to the Planning and Land Use 
Committee for further study and discussion, said Councilman Hal Bernson, 
chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, however, said it is clear the current process is "quite costly," 
inefficient and needs to be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the city met the minimum state requirement to notify property 
owners within 300 feet of a project that requires a special use permit. But in 
1990, the City Council, trying to increase public participation in local 
planning issues, voted to expand the notification area to 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, planning officials said there has been little evidence 
that the increased notification has led to more public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting Tuesday, the representatives of several homeowner groups 
suggested alternatives to increasing public participation without increasing 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Anson Burlingane of the Shadow Hills Homeowners Assn. suggested the city 
eliminate the "legalese" used in newspaper notifications and use simpler terms 
so residents can more easily understand the issues facing their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said the city could replace the newspaper notifications in some 
instances with commercials on the city's public access cable television 
channel, which he said is available to about 35% of city residents.

IN GOLDEN YEARS, THESE STRONGMEN PUMP IRON; LIFESTYLES: LOCAL ATHLETES OVER 70 
LIFT WEIGHTS TO KEEP THEM YOUNG. A DOCTOR CALLS THEM 'THE PINNACLE OF WHAT CAN 
BE ACHIEVED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A lean woman in a purple bra top and black spandex shorts studied her body in 
the mirrored wall as she walked across the gym floor, too busy admiring her own 
reflection to notice the slight man with thick, black-rimmed glasses sitting on 
a weight bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this chrome- and-carpet Mecca of buns of steel and bulging biceps, Bill 
Reale is a standout. He is not, to borrow from gym lingo, "buff." And he 
probably would be a bit awkward in a hip-hop aerobics class. But when it comes 
to lifting 40-pound barbells with one's teeth, Bill Reale is your man. Even if 
he is 97 and only one-third of those teeth are really his. 
</P>
<P>
 Reale is the oldest member of an iron-pumping, treadmill-pounding group that 
calls itself the Samson Seventies Strongmen. The fitness enthusiasts -- a few 
dozen men, and one woman -- from the San Fernando and Antelope valleys, 
consider themselves walking billboards for the benefits of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Theo Hasapes got the idea for the group years ago when his daughters urged him 
to start the Samson Sixties Strongmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many strong people in their 60s. I'll wait till I'm 70," Hasapes, 
now 73, told them. "That's when you separate the men from the boys. It's like 
putting 200,000 miles on your car. Some part is going to break down." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, the Strongmen have become more than just a 
weightlifting club. They take a weightlifting vaudeville act to nursing homes, 
county fairs, even high schools to show that exercise can mean the difference 
between, for instance, spending the golden years on a couch watching "I Love 
Lucy" reruns and having the energy to take up a sport or start a second career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be role models," Hasapes said. "Most adults -- seniors -- are 
couch potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this gang, whose motto could be, "Just say no to drugs -- and surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Chris Christiansen, 70, the first female Strongman. The Woodland Hills 
resident plays tennis every day and golfs when she can fit it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can stand on my head if I have to and I jump rope. I do all sports," she 
said, with the accent she brought with her upon emigrating from Austria in the 
1940s. "There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger. Maybe I can become a Chris 
Christiansenegger." 
</P>
<P>
 As Christiansen spoke, Tom Gumpper, an aspiring actor who will turn 74 in 
March, grimaced as he squeezed the last few crunches in a set of 100 sit-ups, 
one of five sets he does every other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Douglas works out for 2 1/2 hours every day in the sprawling Racquetworld 
gym in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise, as far as I'm concerned, is a physical and psychological way of 
living," the 74-year-old said. "It's not just lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to be able to come here and stack that machine," he said, motioning to 
a machine carrying weight bars totaling 250 pounds, "it gives me a 
psychological uplift. It makes me feel good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 It also intimidates some of the young bucks around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many young fellows don't like to work out with me," he said shyly. 
</P>
<P>
 For 79-year-old Ben Stone of Sherman Oaks, conditioning has been a lifelong 
commitment. Stone, who tried out for the Olympic diving team in 1934, swims 
laps and lifts weights three times a week after retiring seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when people retire in their 70s, they sit around," he said. "They 
get old in no time. You've got to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more physical activity that people get, the lower their mortality rates, 
particularly from coronary heart disease," said Dr. Jerome Fleg, senior 
investigator with the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleg, whose research focuses primarily on aged, but highly trained, endurance 
athletes, said many of the Samson members probably can thank genetics in part 
for their abilities. "They are the pinnacle of what can be achieved at an older 
age," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been a growing emphasis nationwide on weight training for older 
people to increase strength and ensure mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current gospel is that older people can benefit at least as much as young 
people, maybe more because they are less strong and less aerobically 
conditioned to start with, so there's more room for improvement," said Dr. 
David H. Solomon, director of the UCLA Center on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major milestones in the disability of old people is when they 
become too weak to walk or too much in fear of falling to walk . . . and from 
there on, it's a pretty bad life," Solomon said. "Increasing strength of leg 
muscles, particularly, is absolutely critical." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the gospel Hasapes carries with him when his troupe of seniors hits the 
nursing home circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a physically unfit nation, seniors especially. They rely on medication 
and so forth," he said. "If you don't move your blood, circulate that blood, 
you're going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dick Sondel travels with the group, his isn't a tale of staying young, 
it's of staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, Sondel is a "junior affiliate member" of the Strongmen. Sixteen years 
ago, his doctor told him: "Get your house in order" because he had been 
diagnosed with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be dead statistically," the Calabasas resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondel believes lifting weights and playing full-court basketball three times 
a week has given him the physical strength to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being mean helps, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What it comes down to, group members say, is they need the energy afforded by 
exercise to enjoy their other interests -- grandchildren, acting, competitive 
skiing, or even running a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be sick and do all these things," Hasapes said. "We don't have the 
luxury of time. They may not be here next year. I may not be here next year." 
</P>
<P>
 At his age, every year is a blessing for Bill Reale. But the 124-pound Canoga 
Park resident, now 5-foot-2 -- "I used to be 5-4. I shrunk two inches" -- plans 
to spend every day he has left punching the black "speed bag" hanging in a 
corner of his garage. He's been using the familiar boxer's workout tool since 
he was 16, since before he served on the battleship New Hampshire in World War 
I. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm 97," he said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; HEAD OF FOUNDATION CITES HEALTH NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new year has started with many nonprofit health groups hungrier than they 
were 12 months ago, the administrator of a grant foundation in Burbank said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is that over this past year that a lot of the nonprofit 
organizations are having some funding difficulties," said Robert N. Jensen Jr., 
administrator for the Burbank Community Hospital Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation runs an annual grant program that distributed $150,000 to 
Burbank-based health-related organizations in 1993. Most of that money -- 
$125,000 -- was used to open an immunization clinic for Burbank public school 
children at Thompson Memorial Medical Center in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, grants were also given to TRIPOD, a program to help deaf students in 
schools, the Burbank Center for the Retarded, the Burbank Family YMCA and 
Woodbury University. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation opened up the 1994 grant application process a month ago, and 
as of Monday had received about 10 applications, Jensen said. The deadline to 
submit a grant application is Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the foundation received 20 applications from Burbank nonprofit health 
groups, but only six received money. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the foundation expects to receive more applications than last year, 
from both small and large organizations, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total amount of money available for the grant program has not been 
determined yet, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're somewhat limited because we do cater to health-care groups, either in 
the city of Burbank or associated with the city of Burbank," said Jensen, who 
is a local certified public accountant. ED BOND

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE BATTLEFRONT; CHOPPER HELPS 
KEEP POLICE ON GROUND SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's just after 10 p.m. on a routine patrol when Los Angeles Police Officer 
Paul Holmen gets the call from an officer requesting assistance in the darkness 
of Polk Street and Glenoaks Boulevard in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men in their late teens or early 20s, in the process of stripping a stolen 
maroon Camaro, have fled from police. The officer making the call stands amid 
small, closely set houses in which residents have already shut themselves in 
for the night.  
</P>
<P>
 He is separated from his partner by several dark homes, he can't see very well 
and he reports that he does not know whether the men are armed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Holmen and pilot John Harrell arrive on the scene in their police 
helicopter, they hand the advantage back to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In some situations, Holmen and Harrell can take the place of 100 police 
officers; they can cover the ground from downtown Los Angeles to the center of 
the San Fernando Valley in 10 minutes; and with their 30,000-candlepower 
spotlight they can turn a midnight street into high noon, leaving the bad guys 
nowhere to run and few places to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 As members of the Los Angeles Police Department's Air Support Division, their 
first priority is making sure that officers on the ground make it home every 
night, but in the process, they catch their share of criminals. Sgt. John 
Preston, an air watch commander, says that suspects are caught in about 85% of 
the cases in which a chopper is the first unit to respond to a call. 
</P>
<P>
 Once over the sleeping block, Harrell drops down a bit from cruising altitude 
of 500 feet, swinging into a tight counterclockwise arc around a two- to 
three-block area. Holmen, the observer, can see better in a leftward bank. He 
fires up the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The only movement below is from the officer who radioed, whose dark uniform 
makes him look from the chopper like a black ant on its hind legs. Holmen 
widens and contracts the light's beam, keeping it off the officer so as not to 
make him a target. 
</P>
<P>
 As other patrol cars pour into the area, several officers head toward a house 
in the direction in which the suspects ran. Since it is difficult to see 
addresses in the closed-in area, the officers on the ground direct Holmen's eye 
to a blue-trimmed house on the west end of the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it," says the officer on the ground. "You've got your light on it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol officers announce that they're going into the house. The radio goes 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put the light on the house, the officers can check the front and I'm 
keeping my eyes on the back," Holmen says. "Anyone runs and I'm going to follow 
them. It keeps the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
 When operating with a full staff of 35 pilots and 23 observers, the Air 
Support Division can field three helicopters over Los Angeles 24 hours a day, 
in addition to special surveillance operations. One copter is responsible for 
the mid-cities area, one the south side and another, called Air 10, handles the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few sick officers or a major crime means that someplace -- usually the 
Valley, because of its lower crime rate -- goes uncovered. A recent test 
program, which based a copter at Van Nuys Airport instead of Downtown, and 
reserved it for the Valley, might not be extended, Preston says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at $145 to $230 per hour, depending on the type of helicopter used, the 
airborne officers maintain that they are more than cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 They can see more than scores of officers on the ground. And not only can they 
pursue fleeing criminals at higher speeds, but their chases don't endanger the 
driving public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not hands-on up here," Holmen says. "But you get to see the officer 
crawl back into a black and white. You kept them safe, you helped that officer 
go back out and arrest. That's really satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 After several minutes above the house with the blue trim, the officers on the 
ground flash their lights at the helicopter. "We think we've got them, airship, 
thanks for your help." 
</P>
<P>
 As the chopper swings out of its orbit and back up to 500 feet, flying with 
the grace and even motion of a movie's magic carpet, Holmen responds with his 
trademark sign-off: "Good work, guys. Have a good night and keep it safe."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY TO ACCEPT RENT SUBSIDY APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next week, the Burbank Housing Authority will begin accepting rent subsidy 
applications for the first time since January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a waiting list and it took four years to get through that waiting 
list," said Linda Simmons, Burbank's housing administrator.When the city last 
accepted applications, 1,100 people applied within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting we'll have a lot of applicants," Simmons said. The Housing 
Authority will have 961 openings for rental subsidies when the application 
process is reopened starting Monday. The application period will remain open 
indefinitely, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies are being funded through the federal Housing and Urban 
Development Department's Section 8 program. Under the program, tenants pay no 
more than 30% of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, individual tenants must earn less than $16,900, and households of 
four must earn less than $24,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said she expects a rush this year "because the economy is worse than 
it was four years ago and more people are in need of rental assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Those accepted into the program also receive an allowance for their utility 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available at the Burbank Housing Authority office at Burbank 
City Hall, 275 E. Olive Ave. ED BOND

 The riots of 1992 may be long over, but it's not too late for businesses in 
areas that were damaged during the unrest to apply for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
 State tax information for businesses in the part of Van Nuys targeted for riot 
relief will be presented at a meeting of the Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business owners are unaware that they are eligible for benefits, said 
Nancy Kuebel, a senior management analyst with the Los Angeles Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebel said the area bounded by Victory Boulevard on the south, Devonshire 
Boulevard on the north, Balboa Boulevard on the west and Sepulveda Boulevard on 
the east is part of the Los Angeles Revitalization Zone. Businesses located 
within the zone are eligible for tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, businesses in the zone who hired employees after May, 1992, may 
earn a state tax credit of up to $6,370 for the first year of employment, 
Kuebel said. Lesser tax credits per employee would continue through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebel will provide maps of the Van Nuys zone, go over the incentives that are 
available and answer technical questions. An accountant will also attend. The 
meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. at Economy Office Furniture, 6300 Sepulveda 
Blvd. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN GETS JAIL FOR TAGGING POLICE CAR

<P>
 A reputed gang member from Reseda has been sentenced to seven months in County 
Jail for spray-painting a police car with the penal code number for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Antonio Guzman, 22, was convicted Dec. 23 on misdemeanor charges of 
vandalism and vehicle tampering for painting the black and white police unit 
and slashing its tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police car was sprayed with "187," the number of the the 
California Penal Code section for murder. Prosecutors said this message is used 
by gangs as a warning that someone has been targeted for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short hearing Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Judge Paul I. 
Metzler sentenced Guzman to 213 days in jail -- six months for the offense and 
another 33 days because Guzman said he would spend time in custody rather than 
pay a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler said that Guzman failed to show any remorse for his actions and that 
he lied during his trial when he testified he did not confess to the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was the maximum allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Guzman and a 15-year-old juvenile, who also has been 
convicted, vandalized the police car when officers responded to a loud house 
party in Winnetka on Aug. 21. THOM MROZEK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GROUP AIDING BLIND MUST FIND NEW LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A financially strapped program for visually impaired San Fernando Valley 
residents is facing closure unless it can relocate this month. The nonprofit 
Visually Handicapped Adults of the Valley has three weeks to find a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's lease at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Van Nuys expired Dec. 31, 
but the church has agreed to allow the group to stay a few weeks longer to 
avoid closing the program that serves about 150 Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mark's, which plans to renovate its buildings, gave the group several 
months to find a new home, said the program's director, Nick Perrott. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the group asked for and received several months of free rent, 
according to Helen Harris, president of the organization and its parent group, 
Retinitis Pigmentosa International, which raises funds for research into 
Retinitis Pigmentosa, a disease that causes blindness. The church agreed, 
Harris said, but asked the group to look for new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Gary Hand of St. Mark's declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a new location proved a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they were unsuccessful with their plans and we find ourselves 
behind the 8 ball," Perrott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually Handicapped Adults, which has operated out of St. Mark's for the past 
six years, was started in 1972 by the late Sophia Myers, a nurse who lost her 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It has an annual budget of about $300,000, with $130,000 of that coming from 
city grants, said Helen Harris, president of the Retinitis agency. The rest 
comes from private donations, which have been slow in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people come to the center three days a week for independent living 
training, craft classes, typing, support sessions and on Thursday, for bowling 
day. The program has supplied vans to pick up participants at home and bring 
them to St. Mark's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We help each other and it helps to bear," said Gizella Laszloffy, known as 
Lassie by most in the program. "Blindness is a terrible thing, a shocking 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 82-year-old former nurse's sight began to deteriorate 33 years ago and now 
she sees only blurs. "It's hazy. Like you're in a deep fog," Laszloffy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank A. Camarillo Jr. said the center taught him to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 After his poor sight nearly caused an automobile accident in 1979, Camarillo's 
driver's license was revoked. He abandoned his upholstery business and 
withdrew. But four years ago, Camarillo tired of self-pity and came to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center has given me my dignity," he said. REBECCA BRYANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; CURBSIDE RECYCLING WILL START BY APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of single-family homes in unincorporated areas between Topanga 
Canyon and the Los Angeles County line will receive curbside recycling service 
by April 4, a county official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four disposal companies that serve the area will be required to pick up 
aluminum and tin cans, glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and milk jugs, 
and newspapers for recycling, on the same day other trash is collected, said 
Kathi Delegal, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works Waste Management Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do as much as we can to reduce the amount of waste going to 
landfills, not only because landfill space in the county is filling up, but 
also because of increasing state requirements for counties and cities," Delegal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has expanded curbside recycling to homes one area at a time 
because of the large amount of paperwork involved with notifying residents, 
Delegal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of one-family homes in the unincorporated area bounded by Malibu to 
the south, Calabasas to the north, Topanga Canyon to the east and the county 
line to the west will be notified soon that curbside recycling will begin no 
later than April 4, Delegal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside recycling may be offered at apartments, condominiums and businesses 
after the program expands to all one-family homes in the county, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disposal companies already offer curbside recycling to some of their 
customers, said Charlie Caspery, manager of Las Virgenes Disposal, one of four 
trash haulers in the area between Topanga Canyon and the county line. Several 
thousand residents within those boundaries do not have curbside recycling, he 
said. Most cities in that area require disposal companies to provide curbside 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The four disposal companies are: Las Virgenes Disposal, Hillside Rubbish Inc., 
John's Rubbish Co. and G.I. Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents with questions about curbside recycling may call the county at (800) 
552-5218. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR LAND-USE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas has been given an extended deadline to complete a community land-use 
plan that will determine the future of the city's remaining hillsides and oak 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the land-use plan will be a milestone in the short history of 
this city. Calabasas incorporated in 1991 in large part so its residents could 
have more control over development and keep its bedroom community character, 
said Steven Harris, the city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sets down on paper what the community's beliefs are and how people want 
the community to grow," Harris said. "This is every development decision, every 
budget decision . . . . It's not just a map of where buildings will go, it's a 
statement of policies and goals for what kind of community Calabasas is going 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas missed an October deadline to complete the state-mandated general 
plan, but was granted a one-year extension from the state in December. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-member citizens committee has been meeting since the fall of 1992 to 
complete a draft of the plan. The draft will be presented to the public in a 
series of workshops beginning next month. Hearing dates have not yet been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas still has more undeveloped land within the city than it has 
developed land, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city's 8,300 acres, about 5,700 are vacant, he said. Most of that land 
still retains the agricultural zoning it had under Los Angeles County 
regulations. Harris said the designation is, in essence, a "holding zone" 
typical of land slated to someday be developed for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Calabasas residents who supported incorporation wanted to slow the pace 
of office and industrial development in the area. That desire is reflected in 
the nearly completed draft plan, which attempts to limit commercial development 
to a few key areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's going to happen is we will see much lower intensity 
development than what L.A. County allowed," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Park Center will continue to function as the city's downtown, and 
will very likely see more office development under the draft plan, Harris said. 
The plan also includes provisions for stricter environmental oversight of 
hillside grading and removal of oak trees, he said. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; CHICK ASKS CITY TO REFURBISH MEDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Reseda, beauty is in the details. At least that's the tack taken by City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, who has asked the Los Angeles Street Maintenance 
Department to redo the medians, or islands, in the middle of the area's busiest 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is scheduled to start later this month, is neither costly 
nor dramatic. City officials say it will make the streets look a little cleaner 
-- the new flowers adding just a touch of color. But Chick field deputy Rayna 
Gabin said the real benefits will be psychological as well as visual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will make people feel a little bit better about Reseda," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kennedy, city street tree superintendent, said the city will start with 
pilot median-improvement projects using labor provided through alternative 
criminal sentences. Targeted are two medians east and west of Reseda Boulevard 
on Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The medians there, which date back to the 1950s, "are pretty much trashed," 
said Gabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the irrigation systems are shot, and cars accidentally rolling 
over the curbs have destroyed the plants. Maintenance workers will replace the 
edges with new stamped concrete, clean the medians of street dirt, and replant 
them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the Reseda business community will then be called upon to finish 
the effort elsewhere in Reseda through the department's "adopt-a-median" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, once one of the San Fernando Valley's busiest shopping areas, has 
fallen on difficult times in more recent years. Revitalization of the area is a 
high priority of local business people, and a stated goal of Councilwoman 
Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of our little steps forward," said Tom Hilborn, president of the 
Reseda Chamber of Commerce. JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOOLS WIN GRANTS FOR NOVEL PROGRAMS 
</P>

<P>
 Providing administrators and teachers with a means to kick off innovative 
curriculum programs, the Los Angeles Unified School District has awarded more 
than $175,000 in federal grants to nine San Fernando Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapter II Innovative Grants -- for a maximum of $25,000 each -- are 
awarded to schools every other year. This year, about 100 schools or clusters 
of schools applied for the grants and 21 schools in the district won them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the director of the district office that awards the grants, 
proposals are judged on their creativity and potential to improve student 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for good ideas that people have wanted to try," said Donnalyn 
Jaque-Anton, director of the Learning Collaborative. "But they can't just try 
something that is unfounded, there must be a solid research base for what they 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Roscoe Elementary, Carpenter Avenue Elementary, Haskell Elementary, Napa 
Street Elementary, Anatola Avenue Elementary, Northridge Middle School, Van 
Nuys Middle School, Taft High School and Cleveland High School all won grants 
ranging from $12,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roscoe Elementary in Sun Valley, administrators and teachers will use the 
$20,000 grant for training in the instructional technique known as the Scottish 
Story Line. It is a method that uses an integrated curriculum to encourage 
original student thinking by focusing subjects around a story line. Teachers, 
who are not confined by traditional grade-level restraints, will work together 
in mini-teams, transforming their classrooms along themes such as a historical 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ruth Bunyan, Roscoe's principal, the method has not yet been 
implemented in any other district elementary school.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a LEARN school, we are out there on the cutting edge," Bunyan said. "We 
keep reading that children in multi-grade settings achieve better. . . .The 
bottom line is that we want to improve our kids' achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Middle School, the $25,000 grant will be used for teacher 
training and materials to create a multicultural math/science program. Students 
will study those subjects from many cultural perspectives, focusing on 
contributions from Latin American, African and Asian scientists and 
mathematicians. SUSAN BYRNES

PROSECUTOR CALLS STORE KILLING AN 'INSIDE JOB'; COURTS: MURDER TRIAL BEGINS FOR 
SEAN DARNELL SLADE, THE ACCUSED TRIGGERMAN IN THE 1992 HOLDUP OF HOME DEPOT IN 
SAN FERNANDO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An armored truck guard was "deliberately executed" in 1992 during an $82,000 
holdup at a Home Depot store in San Fernando that was an "inside job" planned 
by several people, who mostly remain at large, a prosecutor said as the murder 
trial of the alleged triggerman began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a set-up from the start," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas said at the 
outset of the capital murder trial of Sean Darnell Slade in San Fernando 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an inside job with inside information. It was planned and pulled off 
with expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonas said the case remains under investigation by the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. He told a jury of six men and six women that his evidence 
would include testimony by expert witnesses to support his contention that as 
many as half a dozen people assisted Slade in planning what Slade allegedly 
referred to as a "lick." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor explained that a lick was a street term Slade employed to 
indicate that Home Depot would be "licked clean, leaving no witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, 27, faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. Jonas 
alleges that the July 20, 1992, shooting death of 26-year-old Edwin (Eddie) 
Maldonado, an $8-per-hour armored truck guard who worked to support his 
parents, was planned as part of the heist. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement to the jury, Jonas said Slade had grown up with a 
Home Depot employee who was leaving the store for the day at the time the 
robbery occurred. He was accompanied by another employee, who had scheduled a 
break at that time. And, Jonas said, the store's security cameras weren't 
working that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie Maldonado was a dead man when he got up that morning," Jonas said, 
showing jurors grisly photographs of the victim, who was shot three times with 
a 9-millimeter pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, the prosecutor said, "laid in wait, bolting forward with the 
9-millimeter pistol and spreading Mr. Maldonado's brains across Home Depot." 
The guard was first shot in the back of the head -- a blow so powerful that it 
knocked his sunglasses about 10 feet away, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade then allegedly grabbed the money bag, simultaneously shooting the guard 
twice more, a witness told police. "Killing a human being to him is like going 
into McDonald's and ordering a hamburger," Jonas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill countered that Jonas' statement relied on 
hyperbole, citing such terms as gangster and cold-blooded killer who "planned 
an execution" and blew "the victim's brains out." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hill said, there is no reliable evidence linking Slade to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he plans to call UCLA psychologist R. Edward Geiselman as an expert 
witness on eyewitness testimony to explain how witnesses can be mistaken about 
a suspect's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the defense attorney said, some witnesses described the killer as 
shorter than the 6-foot-tall Slade. Descriptions of how he wore his hair also 
varied. And, he said, Slade has an alibi.

 A high-stakes battle to keep a Chatsworth-based computer maker from leaving 
the state intensified Tuesday, with Palmdale and Los Angeles County officials 
offering the firm free land, low-interest loans and tax breaks to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize is the production facility of Packard Bell Electronics Inc., along 
with about 1,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has outgrown its Chatsworth facility, is also being heavily 
courted by Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City, according to sources involved in 
the negotiations. The company's executives are expected to announce their 
decision by Jan. 15.

 "We're looking at a situation California cannot afford to lose," said Al 
McCord, Palmdale's deputy city administrator, adding that he had been on the 
phone "all day" Tuesday negotiating the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palmdale is totally at the table, the county is coming on board and we're 
getting the state Legislature involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale is offering Packard Bell a free site, worth about $7.5 million, in 
the city's redevelopment zone, said McCord, who is also head of the city's 
recently formed economic development agency.  
</P>
<P>
 To sweeten the deal, the city has also offered to issue about $10 million in 
tax-exempt bonds, with the proceeds going to the company, which would pledge 
the land as security for repayment, he said. That may be enough for the company 
to build a new factory, McCord said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell executives declined to comment Tuesday, but McCord said the firm 
will come up with a "short list" of the top two or three contenders this 
weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 The county has also joined the battle to retain Packard Bell. The Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday granted the company $12,500 in property tax breaks annually 
for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a small amount of money compared to the company's estimated property 
tax bill of about $100,000 annually. But it is the most allowed under a new 
state law that allows municipalities to rebate only their share of a company's 
property taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Far more significant is the county's offer to loan Packard Bell an unspecified 
amount of money under its low-interest construction loan program, repayable in 
four years, McCord said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials would not comment on their efforts to keep Packard Bell from 
relocating out of state. But county Chief Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed 
said Tuesday she was optimistic about the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are seriously interested in staying in Los Angeles County and I think we 
have a good chance of persuading them," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord said officials at the county's Community Development Department on 
Tuesday drafted proposed state legislation that would allow Palmdale and other 
cities to offer companies incentives to relocate or expand in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Business Expansion and Revitalization Act, the law would permit 
cities to establish "revitalization zones" for companies with 500 or more 
employees that want to expand or relocate in California. Those companies would 
receive tax breaks, low-interest loans and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature will not be able to adopt the bill in time for Packard Bell's 
decision, but McCord said he is hoping to get letters of support from Gov. Pete 
Wilson and other officials to use to persuade the firm to move to Palmdale.

DEVELOPER FILES SUIT OVER AGENCY'S LAND PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer has filed suit against the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and 
the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District over the water agency's purchase of a 
492-acre parcel of land near Westlake Village Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Properties, which is affiliated with the Baldwin Co., alleges in a 
lawsuit filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court that the conservancy and 
water district violated an option agreement giving their company first chance 
to purchase the parcel. The developers contend they spent more than $2.5 
million preparing the land for development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suit is consistent with our long-asserted claim that we have rights to 
the property . . . we plan to defend those rights," said Robert Burns, 
president of Baldwin's Los Angeles/Ventura division. "We're going to fight this 
battle for as long and hard as we have to. We're not going to simply roll 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The water district paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. $6.3 million for a 
site where Village Properties had planned to develop 330 luxury homes on 
Westlake Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials maintain that development of the land could have 
resulted in the contamination of the 9,800-acre-foot reservoir, which provides 
tap water for homes in Calabasas, Agoura Hills and the Westlake Village areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie Wymer, a district spokeswoman, declined to comment on the lawsuit, 
which lists her agency, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Mountains 
Recreation and Conservation Authority as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Cheadle, an attorney for the conservancy, said her agency has referred the 
case to the attorney general's office, which represents the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it (the lawsuit) is completely without merit," Cheadle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed to pay half of the $6.3-million 
price tag in exchange for 235 acres of the Westlake Vista property and 237 
additional acres of water district property. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy maintains that the land is crucial to protecting the Lyon's 
pentachaeta, an aster with yellow flowers, and the Santa Monica Mountains 
Dudleya, a rare succulent under consideration for threatened status by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks the court to bar the sale of the property and to rule that 
the developers have first claim to the land, which should be sold to them under 
the same terms that the water district received. It also seeks an unspecified 
amount of general and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that city officials in Westlake Village may change 
the zoning, preventing the planned development and reducing the land's value by 
at least $9 million.

NEW OWNER OF STAR'S STUDIO CITY HOME LOSES SUIT OVER REPAIRS; COURTS: A REALTY 
COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS ARE ABSOLVED OF ALL CHARGES. BUT MICHAEL J. FOX AND HIS 
BUSINESS MANAGER STILL FACE SOME COUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge threw out a lawsuit Tuesday against a real estate company and its 
agents who sold actor Michael J. Fox's Studio City ranch home to a woman who 
described it as a dream house that turned into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Ader filed suit against Fox, his business manager, Robert Philpott, 
the Jon Douglas Co. and agents Bettina Linke and Marie Gray over landscaping 
and repairs to a $750,000 home nestled in the mountains between Mulholland 
Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleged fraud, conspiracy, negligent misrepresentation, breach of 
contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Florence T. Pickard dismissed the entire suit Tuesday 
against the Jon Douglas Co. and Linke and Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with the judge's ruling. My clients feel totally 
vindicated," said Don C. Sherwood, the attorney for the real estate company and 
its agents. "We felt we never should have been brought into this case in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickard also dismissed the conspiracy and infliction of emotional distress 
allegations against Fox and his manager, but left intact the lawsuit's three 
remaining allegations against Fox and a single allegation of negligent 
misrepresentation against Philpott. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that at most, breach of contract was all this case ever was," 
said Scott C. Haith, an attorney for Fox. "All the other allegations were smoke 
and mirrors in an attempt to make the case more than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Pomerance, an attorney representing Ader, said he was not totally 
surprised by Pickard's rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite pleased," Pomerance said. "Michael Fox is and has always been the 
target defendant in this lawsuit and he remains in the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomerance said he was only mildly disappointed by Pickard's decision to 
dismiss all allegations against the real estate company and its agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that Fox failed to deal with a potential termite problem 
in the home's foundation, replace numerous ficus trees killed by frost and that 
he knew more than a dozen cypress trees were diseased but failed to tell Ader. 
The trees subsequently died. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks up to $245,000 in damages and an undisclosed amount in punitive 
damages. Haith said he believes the dismissal of the infliction of emotional 
distress allegation has reduced Ader's chances of being awarded punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who now lives in New York, countersued, alleging that Ader breached her 
contract by closing escrow two months after the agreed-upon date of Feb. 15, 
1991. As a result, Fox was forced to make mortgage and tax payments during that 
time and is seeking unspecified damages.

VALLEY BRIEFING: TOPANGA PORTRAIT ; STRUGGLING TO PRESERVE NATURE SOUTH OF THE 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long considered a haven for free thinkers and the environmentally aware, 
Topanga Canyon was a focal point of the hippie movement in the 1960s. And from 
the looks of things, life there hasn't changed much. 
</P>
<P>
 Landmarks lining Topanga Canyon Boulevard include a roadside crystal stand, a 
"clothing optional" community and an outdoor theater that sponsors an annual 
event called "Peacefest." Probably its most famous landmark is the New Age 
restaurant, Inn of the Seventh Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracted to the canyon's seclusion yet proximity to Los Angeles, today's 
Topangans include musicians, artists and actors. But the artsy, New Age image 
is also a bit misleading. Many residents are attracted to the area simply by 
its rustic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be said, however, that many Topanga residents and their dwellings, from 
trailers to gated estates, are indeed eclectic. Houses of varying sizes dot the 
hilly landscape, but development has been kept to a minimum. Residents are 
vocal about their desire to keep Topanga undeveloped-witness the 15-year battle 
over a proposed development currently known as Canyon Oaks. A Colorful History  
</P>
<P>
 The name: There is some disagreement over the exact meaning of Topanga. A 
Native American word, it means either "where the mountains meet the sea" or 
"place above." Topanga's first inhabitants thousands of years ago lived off the 
area's many natural resources, farming and fishing the creek. A village dating 
back 8,000 years has been unearthed in what is now Topanga State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga State Park: Designated a state park in 1974, it had grown to 9,000 
acres with 32 miles of trails by the mid-1980s. When the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area was established in 1978, Topanga State Park became a 
major link in the chain of parkland reaching from Griffith Park to Point Mugu.  
</P>
<P>
 Elysium Fields: This "clothing optional" community opened in 1968 despite 
resistance from neighbors. Elysium has been ordered closed by the county 
several times, but always reopens and remains a fixture off Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard. Community Issues 
</P>
<P>
 Development: A long-running clash between developers and residents has endured 
over a proposed development calling for several hundred housing units, a golf 
course and commercial center. The Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Commission approved the project -- once called Montevideo, now called Canyon 
Oaks -- and the Board of Supervisors is tentatively scheduled to consider the 
project Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster vulnerability: Famed for its natural beauty, Topanga seems cursed by 
the very thing that makes it attractive. Still recovering from the fire that 
burned more than 17,000 acres in November, Topanga has survived a number of 
natural disasters. The County Fire Department recorded 15 major fires since the 
1920s, many followed by floods and landslides. Two of the worst floods were in 
1969 and 1980, when more than 25 inches of rain fell each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers: In response to complaints about immigrant day laborers loitering 
near Topanga's center area, a group called PATCH, (People Assisting Topanga 
Canyon with Helping Hands) three years ago created a labor exchange at a vacant 
lot where laborers were given information, food and a Spanish translator was 
available. The group isnow looking fo a new location because an archeological 
exploration will be conducted on the privately owned land. Community Profile

PARKLAND GRADING TIED TO FIRE CREWS, UTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County fire crews and the Southern California Edison Co. were 
involved in the apparently illegal grading of up to five acres of state 
parkland in Chatsworth late last month, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials, who have threatened legal action over damage to the 
historically significant site, will discuss the incident at a meeting next week 
with County Fire Department and Edison representatives, said Rich Rozzelle, 
land agent for the Angeles district of the California Department of Parks and 
Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an idea who was responsible for it, and we're proceeding to make them 
accountable for their actions," Rozzelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 County bulldozer crews apparently graded the area to clear brush and improve 
road access to an Edison transmission line that crosses the 666 acres of state 
parkland on the slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains. A source said Edison has 
maintenance agreements with the county and other fire departments that have 
heavy equipment in the vicinity of transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Edison and the County Fire Department acknowledged that the 
county had done work at the site on the utility's behalf, but otherwise 
declined to give details. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fortune, a supervisor in the services bureau of the Fire Department, 
directed a reporter to Edison, saying, "We work directly for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Workman, a regional superintendent for Edison, said county equipment 
operators "do perform work for us." But he said he would reserve comment "until 
we have a discussion with Mr. Rozzelle and get together and figure out exactly 
what took place." 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged area, south of the Simi Valley Freeway and west of the city of Los 
Angeles' Chatsworth Park South, is on land where officials hope to create a 
state park or historic site. The property, which features unusual rock 
formations, is considered to have historical and archeological importance as 
the site of a Chumash settlement and the Old Stage Coach Trail, established in 
the 1860s and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldozer operators plowed across the trail in the process of widening an 
existing dirt track into an earthen boulevard as much as 40 feet to 60 feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials, who last week learned about the grading from hikers, 
said the culprits could face trespassing or other criminal charges as well as a 
civil suit for damages to pay for rehabilitation of the site.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTONOVICH QUESTIONS NEW AIRPORT PROPOSAL; 
AVIATION: THE SUPERVISOR RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT A PLAN TO BUY THE AGUA DULCE 
AIRSTRIP AND EXPAND ITS USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Without taking a formal position, Supervisor Mike Antonovich indicated Tuesday 
that he has strong concerns about turning a rustic Agua Dulce airstrip into a 
county-owned, general aviation airport. 
</P>
<P>
 At Antonovich's request, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ordered 
the Aviation Commission to respond to 23 complex questions about the 
feasibility of the proposal, including 11 questions submitted by airport 
opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 "How safe is the existing location, given its proximity to homes and a 
school?" Antonovich read from the list of 11 questions. "Has the commission 
considered an acquisition for strictly emergency operations, i.e. no tie-downs, 
hangars or daily operations?" 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is scheduled to report to the board April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-debated proposal to use about $5 million in federal funds to buy and 
expand the privately owned Agua Dulce Air Park took on renewed urgency 
recently. Airport owner Jim Annin wants to subdivide the 208-acre property into 
10-acre lots for 19 single-family houses, prompting the board to order the 
commission's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots who use the airstrip say the county should buy it to prevent the 
35-year-old facility from closing. But residents oppose that plan because they 
say it will bring unwanted noise and traffic into their rural community, where 
construction of houses on less than two acres is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agua Dulce Air Park has been a source of contention since 1959 when three 
businessmen built it for their private use but soon tried to expand the number 
of planes housed there.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles leased it for nearly 10 years beginning in 1968 but 
eventually dropped plans to use it as an auxiliary to Van Nuys Airport because 
of community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Animosities were rekindled in 1986 when the county focused on the airstrip as 
the most feasible site for a general aviation airport in the Santa Clarita 
Valley.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CASTAIC TRUSTEES TO DECIDE HOW TO FILL SCHOOL 
BOARD SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Trustees will decide today how to fill the vacancy created by board member 
Bruce Fox's resignation on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, the second trustee to step down from the Castaic Union School District 
board in two months, resigned after moving from Castaic into Santa Clarita's 
Valencia community to be closer to his in-laws while raising his son. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires trustees to live in the school district they serve. Trustee 
Jane Pederson resigned from the Castaic board Oct. 18, two months before her 
term was to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, 29, was elected in November, 1991, to a four-year term. Whoever fills the 
position will serve the remaining two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A school board has 60 days to fill a vacant seat, either by appointment or 
special election. Trustees are scheduled to meet at 4:30 p.m. today at Castaic 
Elementary School to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, the district has always filled by provisional appointment," 
Supt. Scott Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of appointing someone saves the district the expense of hosting a 
special election, which Brown estimated would cost $14,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If trustees opt to appoint someone to the open seat, they will solicit letters 
of interest from Castaic residents and conduct public interviews of the 
candidates. The new trustee must be named by mid-February and will take the 
oath of office 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson's vacancy was filled by the regular November election that brought 
incumbent Irene Massey and newcomers Dirk Gosda and Nora Emmons into office.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BUILDER TO FINISH WORK ON ABANDONED HOMES; 
HOUSING: ORIGINAL DEVELOPER HALTED CONSTRUCTION AT LANCASTER TRACT IN 1988. 
NEIGHBORS WELCOME THE NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like the mythical phoenix that rose from its own ashes, a partially abandoned 
housing tract in Lancaster is getting a second chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa-based developer, Pacific-Teal Development Inc., plans to 
immediately begin repairing the 21 dilapidated homes at the Silverado housing 
development, more than five years after the original developer halted work. 
Homes will also be built on two Silverado lots where, since 1988, there has 
been only cement foundations and tumbleweeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending completion of the 188-home tract comes as welcome news to 
homeowners who, for years, have looked out their windows to watch the abandoned 
homes fall prey to vandals and become temporary shelters for vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad they're finally going to finish it," said Vince Pagano, who 
lives with his wife and son just three doors from the cul-de-sac on which most 
of the unfinished homes sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Rios has not been able to walk out his front door without being reminded 
of the condition of his neighborhood. Directly across the street from Rios' 
home are a group of the abandoned Silverado homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the trash, all the noise of people who go over there," Rios said. "It's 
hurt property values." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Housing Corp. of Burbank halted work on Silverado, a development at 30th 
Street West and Avenue L, in late 1988 after all but 23 of the remaining lots 
were sold. At the same time, the now-defunct company stopped development of the 
40-acre Legends housing tract, located a couple miles away at 30th Street West 
and Avenue J. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, federal officials seized Pennsylvania-based Hill Financial Savings, 
U.S. Housing Corp.'s lender on the two tracts. Lancaster in 1991 began 
negotiating with the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency responsible for 
liquidating the assets of failed savings and loans, to purchase Silverado and 
Legends. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part it's been very frustrating," said Lancaster redevelopment 
manager Steve Dukett. "I'm disgusted my own personal tax dollars are used to 
fund an organization like the RTC." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster finally took title in November to the 100-lot Legends and the 23 
unfinished lots in Silverado. The long delay in the city's purchase of the 
tracts resulted in a $1.5-million savings as real estate prices plummeted 
during the wait. Lancaster bought Legends and the unfinished portion of 
Silverado for $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific-Teal is buying the 23 lots in Silverado from Lancaster for $900,000, 
the amount the city paid the RTC. The Orange County company also has to give 
Lancaster half of all its revenues from the sale of the 23 lots that exceed 
$2,909,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently demolished the weathered home frames at Legends, said 
Dukett, and will begin in the spring searching for a developer to construct a 
new tract on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pacific-Teal principal Neal D. Graham said his company plans to 
begin immediately finishing work on the abandoned homes, using local 
contractors as much as possible. The goal is to have the houses occupied by 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverado is the second Lancaster development where Pacific-Teal has come in 
and picked up the pieces. About two years ago, the company bought an abandoned 
townhome project from a lender. It completed the construction and is having 
great success, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham is confident the same will happen at Silverado, where homes with 1,700 
to 2,100 square feet will sell for an estimated $119,000 to $132,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As a requirement imposed by the city, at least five of the homes in the tract 
must be sold to buyers who have moderate/median income levels, such as a family 
of four with an annual income of $57,960. Furthermore, the city is requiring 
Pacific-Teal to provide buyers with a 10-year warranty on the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner said: "I'm excited to see this coming to some final 
chapters, not only with Silverado but Legends."

SHERIFF CONCEDES POLICIES VIOLATED IN DEPUTY'S SHOOTING; O.C. LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
GATES ANSWERS CRITICISM OF HOW DEPARTMENT HANDLED ON-JOB DEATH OF ONE OF ITS 
OWN AND VOWS REVIEW OF TRAINING RULES AFTER D.A. COMPLETES INQUIRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, breaking his virtual silence on the 
Christmas Day shooting death of a veteran deputy, acknowledged for the first 
time Tuesday that internal policies apparently were broken during an impromptu 
training session that led to the fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also vowed that once a criminal probe into the shooting is completed, 
sheriff's officials would review training procedures that have come under 
attack from some community leaders in the wake of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins' 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, who was married with an 18-month-old daughter, was shot in the 
face by Deputy Brian P. Scanlan, 32, a field training officer from Anaheim who 
was using a loaded weapon during the drill, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the facts at this point but obviously a shooting took place that 
doesn't appear to follow department policies," Gates said. "There are obviously 
going to be problems once I get the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates had been largely unwilling to discuss the case or its broader 
implications for department policy. He said his department has been limited by 
county regulations from disclosing specific details of the investigation to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a two-hour interview that offered some new details, the sheriff said 
Tuesday that he wanted to help dispel criticism of the department's handling of 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Scanlan's use of a loaded gun during the drill appears to conflict 
with department regulations -- an acknowledgment that could play a part when it 
comes time for prosecutors to decide if Scanlan should be deemed criminally 
negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't train and utilize loaded weapons. You don't have your finger on the 
trigger," Gates said. "The policy clearly states that. Anyone that deals with 
guns in law enforcement understands that from the day they come into this 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, was killed just after 2 p.m. on Dec. 25 during what was described 
as an informal training exercise in a lot behind a movie theater in Lake 
Forest. The Orange County district attorney's office is trying to determine 
whether Robins, playing the suspect in a traffic stop, was shot when he 
startled Scanlan by pulling a gun out of the visor of his patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the central issue in the case remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question here for all of us is why was the gun loaded and why were they 
doing a training exercise with a loaded weapon," Gates said. "That is the 
bottom-line question we all want answered. Until we are able to get the 
information from the D.A. to complete the factual situation and look at that, 
we won't be able to answer that." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating the shooting to determine 
whether criminal charges -- such as involuntary manslaughter or other counts in 
the area of criminal negligence -- should be filed against Scanlan, a former 
Army private who is married to a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Scanlan, now on paid leave while receiving counseling, could also 
face disciplinary action ranging from a letter of reprimand to firing once the 
department undertakes an internal review. That process will likely take months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph said Gates' willingness to discuss the case 
publicly can only help assuage concerns that have lingered in the community 
since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always positive when people admit mistakes if mistakes have been made," 
she said. "I appreciate his going on record and stating the Sheriff's 
Department's position and his openness to re-evaluating whatever policies do 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shooting, the Sheriff's Department has faced increasing criticism 
from some community leaders and law-enforcement experts who question why 
deputies were training with a loaded weapon, whether they should have been 
training at a public strip mall in the first place, and why authorities were 
slow to release basic information. 
</P>
<P>
 Many elected leaders from around the county said they were unaware before the 
shooting that such public training exercises even existed. And officials at 
some other police agencies say that their departments do not generally employ 
such training techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the department would review the policy once prosecutors complete 
their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any situation where something has gone wrong, we sit down and review our 
entire policy," he said. "We review everything in place to make sure . . . it 
is a sound one. If it needs to be adjusted, we adjust it. We will do that in 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said informal training sessions "are done frequently in every law 
enforcement agency that I am aware of. . . . We see that they are done safely. 
We try to make sure that they are done in ways that don't endanger the deputies 
or the public." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Gates released on Tuesday excerpts from department policy 
manuals on training and related issues. He said Tuesday morning that he saw no 
reason why the full manuals should not be released to the media, but officials 
with the Sheriff's Department and the county counsel's office later refused to 
release copies, saying they had not yet been excised. 
</P>
<P>
 The manual excerpts made public showed that field training officers such as 
Scanlan are encouraged to use "role playing" techniques and allow a trainee to 
act out a law-enforcement situation. But the documents do not specify how these 
role-playing drills should be carried out or whether any situations or sites 
are considered off limits for training. 
</P>
<P>
 The manual also warns officers to avoid five "traps" in training: sarcasm, 
bullying, comedy, bluffing and complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to criticism that the department had been slow to release 
information on a case that has generated widespread public interest, Gates said 
that, in retrospect, the department might have "tried to get this stuff out a 
little bit quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 The department did not release its first details on the shooting until 27 
hours after it happened. The day after the incident, The Times quoted 
department officials in reporting that a then-unidentified deputy had 
accidentally shot and killed himself. But Gates insisted Tuesday that no one at 
his department ever said that. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said his office was hampered by the county's policy restrictions on the 
release of information in officer-involved shootings and said he was asked by a 
district attorney's investigator not to reveal certain details. 
</P>
<P>
 * OFF CAMERA: Gates says patrol car videotape failed to capture shooting. A13 
</P>
<P>
 * TUSTIN IN FOCUS: Tustin will install video cameras in all its police cars.

SCOUT FINED FOR USING CB IN BOAT RESCUE; RULES: LAGUNA HILLS HOMEOWNERS' GROUP 
IS MIFFED OVER BANNED RADIO, EVEN IF 6 PEOPLE WERE SAVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Explorer Scout who helped save six people aboard a boat stranded off Dana 
Point is now in icy water with his homeowners' association, which purportedly 
wants to fine him for the way he did it -- using his citizens band radio. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of Dec. 28, Richard Wright and two other CB operators responded 
to a distress call from an 18-foot pleasure boat. Through questions and 
communication relays, they guided a Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County 
sheriff's patrol boats to the stricken vessel five miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's good deed had a very short afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president of the (homeowners') association called our manager and he 
notified my mom that they want to fine me $150 for using my CB radio inside the 
association grounds," Wright, a 20-year-old member of Explorers Post 540, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Ron Meixell, president of the 124-member Moulton Parkway Assn. 
No. 1, confirmed that the association's board will decide at its meeting next 
week whether to fine Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Meixell, the youth had promised three months ago to stop using 
his CB radio after several condo owners complained that it interfered with 
their cordless telephones and television reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he and his mother are simply using this rescue thing to help them 
out," Meixell said Tuesday. "The Coast Guard even called me up, and several 
newspapers. This whole thing is a basket case." 
</P>
<P>
 He claims Wright used the CB a week before the rescue, which resulted in the 
threatened fine. But Wright said he was notified of the possible fine shortly 
after he used the CB to assist the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is clearly on Wright's side. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the association, a ranking officer called it "ludicrous to fine 
the boy for saving lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for his helping us," Coast Guard Petty Officer Randolph Reid 
added Tuesday, "it could have ended up in serious injury or loss of life to the 
boater and his family." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time that Wright, an aspiring firefighter, has won praise 
for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he was recommended for a certificate of valor from the Orange County 
Fire Department after he kicked open the door of a burning condo and searched 
for people possibly trapped inside. He found no people, but broke out a window 
to help the family dog and pet hamsters escape. 
</P>
<P>
 And in October, the youth and other Explorers who are part of an emergency 
services squad responded to the Laguna Beach fire and assisted in the staging 
area for emergency vehicles. A week later, the same post volunteered to help 
line muddy streets in Laguna Beach with sandbags after rainfall caused damage 
from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest adventure involved two other CB operators, Richard Bianchini, a 
Mission Viejo teen-ager, and another CB user known only as "Shorty." 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper, Jose Santana of Anaheim, was aboard the vessel with his wife, two 
children and two other adults without flashlights and only a few blankets, Reid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of questions and communication relays, the three radio 
operators were able to approximate the boat's bearings and forward the 
information to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said the youths used their familiarity with the Orange County coastline 
and quizzed Santana on physical landmarks he could see that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked if he could see San Clemente hill, which has a big red light up on 
top, the big green light at Dana Point Harbor and then the San Onofre power 
plant," Wright said. "When he said San Clemente hill was closest to him, I gave 
that information to the Coast Guard on my cellular phone that I grabbed from my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he remained in his car with an open line to the Coast Guard while 
relaying messages through the two CB radio operators. From time to time, the 
signal was weak, Wright said, and one of the three operators would lose or gain 
the signal during the three-hour rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first got the May Day about 5 o'clock," Wright said. "And, it took us 
about an hour to find out where the (boater) was. The whole thing ended like 
close to 8 at night." 
</P>
<P>
 While they remained in communications with the stranded boat, which had engine 
problems, they learned the pilot already had used up his signal flares and had 
only a camera with a flash attachment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard had instructed Wright, whose CB handle is "911," to notify 
Santana that when he heard the helicopter approaching to flash the camera at 
least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rescue copter came on the air," Wright said, "and said: 'Unit 911, do you 
still have a copy on the boat?' And, I said, 'yeah.' They then said, 'We now 
have a visual on the boat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's mother, Sue Sampsell, said she believes the homeowners' association 
and its president are targeting her son for previous conflicts the family has 
had with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're renters, and I don't think they like that. I don't feel we should have 
to pay this fine. We acknowledged that my son used the CB, but this was to save 
some person's life. This is what my son was brought up to do."

LAPD UNIT ON TRIAL FOR ALLOWING SUNLAND ROBBERY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: COURT BATTLE 
PITS SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE NEED TO GATHER EVIDENCE, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial Los Angeles police squad is set to defend itself in court 
again today, this time against claims that it allowed robbers to hold up a 
McDonald's and jeopardize a restaurant manager's life so it could build a case 
against the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbin L. Cox, a former manager at a McDonald's in Sunland, has sued the Los 
Angeles Police Department and the city of Los Angeles for unspecified damages, 
saying that officers in the Special Investigations Section had been staking out 
the robbers for hours, including the moments before they committed the 
late-night robbery on Feb. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox alleges the officers recklessly allowed the robbers to terrorize her at 
gunpoint while they monitored the scene from undercover cars parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had an overwhelming amount of manpower there. They could have easily 
stopped the whole thing," said her lawyer, Christopher Hiddleson. "But they 
chose to allow the robbery to go forward and be completed. . . . She is 
fortunate she wasn't shot or raped or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, 26, and her lawyer claim that SIS officers were negligent because they 
told patrol officers not to respond to a 911 call she made as the robbers broke 
in at closing time. Cox said she has suffered emotional trauma that led to 
long-term unemployment and that the robbery has ruined her chances of 
continuing a promising career at the fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who was unavailable for comment, said when she filed the suit in 1990 
that she wants at least $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is set to start today, and testimony could start the same day, 
including questioning of former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police Tuesday had no comment on the trial, one of many cases 
against the unit, whose role is to monitor and apprehend dangerous career 
criminals. The SIS has drawn controversy in recent years because of its high 
number of shootings and incidents in which officers allowed crimes to take 
place and victims were threatened or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit already has lost one suit in the widely publicized McDonald's case, 
when a federal jury found that the officers acted without cause when they fired 
on the robbers 35 times, killing three and wounding a fourth as the robbers 
fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the men had pellet guns, police believed they were armed with 
pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury awarded $44,000 in damages to the families of the dead men and the 
lone survivor, Alfredo Olivas, who later pleaded guilty to 10 counts of robbery 
and is serving a 17-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found that Gates, a key witness in the federal case, fostered 
and condoned the use of excessive force in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Glendale Superior Court trial, legal experts said, will raise 
issues of how police must balance protecting the public with the need to gather 
evidence against dangerous criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Julian Eule, associate dean at the UCLA law school and an expert in 
constitutional law, said the case raises myriad issues. Among them: whether the 
"good faith" immunity usually given to police officers as they perform their 
duties -- even when they act negligently -- will protect them from liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Eule said, jurors may have to delve into the complex issue of whether 
the U.S. Constitution mandates that police have an ironclad obligation to 
protect citizens from harm. Most successful lawsuits against police and other 
government agents focus on just the opposite -- cases in which they actively 
did something they should not have, such as invade someone's privacy or violate 
their civil rights, Eule said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes very tricky when you argue that the government has an obligation 
to do something that it hasn't done." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said Tuesday that it is continuing to investigate possible civil 
rights violations in the Sunland shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD and the city have tried to get the case dismissed, saying the 
officers acted in the best interests of everyone concerned, including Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a tactical decision, based on sound police work. That's what we 
believe," said Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, supervising attorney for the 
city's police litigation unit. "I don't think it's negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox already has received $95,000 in workers' compensation benefits from the 
state for emotional distress and disability, Vincent said. Cox has returned to 
college in Pasadena and is training for a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 She has said in court documents that she was so traumatized by the incident 
that she has been unable to work. Cox has said she was alone in the Foothill 
Boulevard restaurant at about 11:45 p.m. when she saw two suspicious-looking 
men and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 18 SIS members were watching, and an SIS leader canceled the 911 
response, saying everything was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Robbin Cox was in the restaurant with the suspects, police had no 
control of the situation whatsoever," Hiddleson said. "They completely lost 
control of it. . . . They let the whole thing go down so they could have an 
excuse to charge them with a more serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox was taken to the back of the restaurant, blindfolded, handcuffed and 
placed on the floor and threatened with death if she didn't open the safe, 
Hiddleson said. "She was under the impression she was going to be killed at any 
second," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said police didn't apprehend the robbers sooner because their modus 
operandi in previous holdups was to wait for managers to exit a restaurant 
before accosting them. Nor had they held other store managers hostage. Officers 
also had orders to apprehend the four men before they entered the McDonald's if 
they were together, but the men fanned out around the building and entered from 
a side not visible to the SIS officers, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he added, the best response was to wait it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chief Gates agreed in a deposition taken by Cox's lawyer in 1992: "They 
might walk into a situation that could result in a hostage situation and 
perhaps a shootout and your client could have been injured. It was her interest 
at heart that they didn't answer the call." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hiddleson countered that the SIS officers clearly violated department 
policy. He cited the LAPD manual, which states: "No arrest, conviction or piece 
of evidence can outweigh the value of human life." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hiddleson said, police had an obligation to respond to Cox's 911 
call, especially after the dispatcher told Cox that help was on the way. He 
also said he would argue during the trial that the case is part of a larger 
problem in which the SIS has allowed people to be robbed and assaulted before 
acting.

SAN FERNANDO FIRES EMBATTLED PARKS DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of speculation and rumor, the San Fernando City Council has fired 
parks Director Jess Margarito, a popular figure in grass-roots Latino politics 
and former mayor who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged 
misuse of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggard-looking council members announced their 4-1 decision at 11:30 p.m. 
Monday after a 3 1/2-hour closed session during which the council reviewed 
allegations that Margarito falsified time cards for convicts sentenced to work 
in the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-count confidential report by the San Fernando Police Department also 
alleges that Margarito caused the city to pay false invoices amounting to more 
than $2,000 for tasks that allegedly were not done. 
</P>
<P>
 Those allegations remain the focus of a separate criminal investigation by the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators last week seized Margarito's work computer and some documents, 
as well as personal bank records. 
</P>
<P>
 An affidavit submitted to a court in the request for the warrant to seize 
Margarito's bank records indicates investigators are widening their probe. 
According to the affidavit, investigators are looking into $4,000 Margarito 
allegedly received in 1987 from the nonprofit Immigration Services of Santa 
Rosa in San Fernando while serving on its board, a violation of its bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito said the check, dated Feb. 26, 1987, was for consulting services he 
performed before becoming a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit lists Feb. 2, 1987, as the date of incorporation for the group 
and its board. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members remained mum about their deliberations Tuesday, not saying who 
voted against the firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the city attorney advised them not to reveal any details, 
in part because Margarito has a fair-employment complaint pending against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in September, charges officials with racial 
discrimination and harassment in its inquiry into his three-year tenure as 
director of the Recreation and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In both personal and political circles, those who witnessed Margarito's rise 
from census worker and Latino activist to councilman and mayor expressed shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Jess for many years," said Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, who said he first met Margarito as a high school student at a youth 
leadership program at San Fernando Recreation Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope everything proves to be a big mistake. It's a very unfortunate thing 
for everyone involved. I think we have to let the process work. I wish both the 
city of San Fernando and Jess Margarito well." 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito received a final paycheck Tuesday morning, then tearfully emptied 
his desk at San Fernando Recreation Park under escort by a police officer. He 
vowed to fight the council -- possibly through a lawsuit -- saying it never 
gave him a chance to answer charges before firing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some mistakes, but I never benefited one cent," Margarito said. "In 
hindsight, I wish I was wiser. In hindsight, I wish I was more responsive to 
the administrative process." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the months of investigation, beginning with the district attorney's 
inquiry in April and concluding with the city's action Monday night, Margarito 
has maintained that he may have bent rules to help destitute friends and 
workers, but never profited, and never deserved to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearful senior citizens, workers and friends agreed, embracing Margarito as he 
left the office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito, who has been involved with the city's parks since 1968, openly 
sobbed as he embraced Viola Lott, a parks worker for the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman taught me to square-dance when I was 13," he said, his voice 
fading to a sob. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the problems are, but I know they're not on your part," 
Lott told Margarito as he turned to wipe away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, loyal parks workers also said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave us everything we needed. To me, he was a dad," said maintenance 
worker Larry Juarez, whose voice cracked with emotion. "He's for the people -- 
can't anyone understand that?" 
</P>
<P>
 At Las Palmas Park, Margarito spoke in Spanish to a group of elderly residents 
who take part in a nutrition program started under his tenure. "In my heart, I 
know you are with me," he said. "This is a step back, but the struggle goes 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Program participants then lined up to shake his hand and wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito's activist supporters expressed outrage and shock Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said Margarito was the victim of ulterior political motives with racial 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito, they said, always represented a disenfranchised Latino fringe that 
has struggled to obtain power in this small city of 23,500 in the northeastern 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't doubt that there is a good degree of that," Andres Torres, a Mission 
College professor and longtime Margarito friend, said of the race and politics 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what was needed by those that are against him was an excuse to get 
rid of him," said Torres, who ran for several state offices during the 1970s 
under the La Raza Unida party branch that Margarito helped found in 1970. "I'm 
suspicious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five members of the council that fired him, however, are Latinos, 
as is 83% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Rodriguez, a director of the Pueblo y Salud human-services group in San 
Fernando, said he regards some of the Latino council members as still tied to 
the previous white power structure, and said most of the top city 
administrative workers are still white. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll find most of the slate of administrators are not Latino," he said. 
"There's a concern that if people like Jess are allowed to stay in there, it 
will jeopardize their little fiefdom." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials refused to comment on any aspect of the case or 
counter-allegations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday night, they shrugged off such comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito acknowledged he made many enemies in his path to power from San 
Fernando's poorest neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping found La Raza Unida, a radical Chicano party, he sued the city 
of San Fernando in 1974 over its at-large districts, a voting-rights complaint 
that eventually was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito was trounced in a bid for City Council in 1972, a campaign that he 
acknowledges scared voters with its radical tone. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed up with the lawsuit, while struggling to help get La Raza Unida 
candidates elected statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, after two years on the council, he helped elect a slate of reform 
candidates to create the first Latino majority on the panel -- to the annoyance 
of candidates who were not reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, the new council selected him as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his appointment to the parks post in 1990 created controversy, after the 
council selected him over another candidate with a higher rating.

ECONOMY SLOWS BALLOT MEASURES BY VOTERS TO CRAWL; POLITICS: IN CONTRAST TO 
YEARS WHEN 18 INITIATIVES VIED FOR ATTENTION, ONLY ONE HAS QUALIFIED FOR JUNE 
ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With initiative donors strapped for cash, officials and consultants say 
California voters this year could face the fewest citizen-generated measures in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 One initiative on the June statewide ballot would provide $1.9 billion for 
parkland, including a portion of Laguna Canyon and other wildlife resources 
throughout the state. About 45,000 of the 725,000 signatures that were gathered 
statewide originated in Orange County, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, supporters of a pay-at-the-pump auto insurance proposal said they 
have scrapped a statewide ballot initiative headed for the November ballot. And 
former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum said he has received only 
tepid support for a proposed initiative aimed at illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, 
plans for another school voucher measure, similar to one defeated in November, 
have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bleak year," said Mike Arno of American Petition Consultants, which 
specializes in paid signature-gathering efforts to qualify initiatives for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno and others who have made big money in the past blame the troubled economy 
for persuading many potential donors to avoid initiative fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offhand, I'd say it's the recession," said Jack McDowell, one of the most 
successful initiative consultants, explaining the lack of initiative business 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proponents of direct democracy are still gathering signatures for 20 
potential initiatives, virtually all of them appear to lack significant 
political and financial support. Unless an initiative has extraordinary 
volunteer support, it typically costs $500,000 to $1 million to collect enough 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one citizen-generated measure, dealing with buying parkland, has already 
qualified for the June ballot, and there may be only one initiative in the 
November general election -- the proposal to sentence criminals to life terms 
for the third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 If that turns out to be true, Californians would face the fewest 
citizen-sponsored initiatives in a general election since 1974, when there was 
one each on the June and November ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno is working to qualify a single measure for the November ballot -- one to 
imprison for life criminals convicted of a third felony and significantly 
increase sentences of people convicted of a second serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, called "three strikes and you're out," gained momentum in the 
wake of the abduction and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma. 
However, proponents ran short of cash last month and were forced to temporarily 
halt the paid signature-gathering campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, legislators are rushing to introduce bills mimicking some 
aspects of the "three strikes" proposition, raising questions about the need 
for such an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Kimball, of Kimball & Associates, the other major firm engaged in paid 
signature gathering, said he expects to have no contracts in California in 
1994, and has sent many of his employees to other states where the initiative 
and referendum business is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline has passed for qualifying initiatives for the June ballot, but 
some measures still could qualify for November. The signatures -- 385,000 to 
change a law or 615,000 to change the state Constitution -- must be submitted 
to the secretary of state by April to be verified by a June deadline for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly are a lot (of proposed initiatives) in circulation, but most 
are not ones that have much substance," said Tony Miller, chief deputy 
secretary of state. "It does seem a light year in terms of substantive and 
weighty measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he believes potential initiative backers are hoping the 
Legislature does its job by responding to various problems in the state. 
Additionally, he said, donors have seen several heavily funded initiatives go 
down to defeat in in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are much more skeptical," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one citizen-generated initiative certain to be on the June ballot is 
sponsored by the Planning and Conservation League. The proposition calls on 
voters to approve nearly $2 billion in bonds to buy parkland, including a 
portion of Laguna Canyon, and renovate and buy urban recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the measure will provide $25 million to help complete the purchase 
from the Irvine Co. of Laguna Laurel, a site within Laguna Canyon once approved 
for construction of 1,500 housing units. Laguna Beach and the county are paying 
for most of the site. The remaining parcel of 189 acres is located near the 
Laguna Beach-Irvine border. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning and Conservation League, which has promoted several successful 
initiatives focusing on the environment, is also attempting to obtain 385,000 
signatures of registered voters to qualify a measure for the November ballot. 
The second measure seeks to add a 4-cent tax on gasoline to pay for rail and 
other transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The downturn in the initiative business follows several years in which the 
industry boomed. In 1988, for example, 18 measures made it onto the ballot. In 
1992, there were none on the June ballot, but seven on the general election 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiatives were so numerous that several legislators, academics and others 
clamored for reforms making it more difficult to place them on the ballot. A 
commission's report on the issue, which took two years to prepare, is scheduled 
to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures still seeking support for the November ballot are proposals 
to eliminate affirmative action in hiring for state jobs, authorize gambling on 
an experimental basis in the city of Adelanto and remove the authority of local 
governments to regulate mobile-home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials Harold Ezell and Alan 
Nelson continue to push a measure seeking to expel illegal immigrants from 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said he has not sought or received large donations, but added that he 
believes his measure will make it onto the ballot with a strictly volunteer 
signature-gathering effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have volunteers been able to gather the huge number of signatures 
needed to qualify measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schabarum is sponsoring a more limited measure aimed at illegal immigrants, 
but said he has encountered questionable enthusiasm for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, he said the chance of it making it onto the 
November ballot was 50-50. Schabarum said he had raised less than $70,000 of 
the $500,000 he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several consultants were in line to make large sums from the political war 
that would have erupted if the pay-at-the-pump initiative had made it onto the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine columnist Andrew Tobias, the chief backer, had said late in 
December that he was prepared to personally foot the estimated $700,000 it 
would have cost to get the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But after making a final round of telephone calls to potential supporters, he 
said he was persuaded that he should postpone the effort until the 1996 
election while building a broader base of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had organized a powerful coalition under the name Californians to 
Save Our Economy, and hired one of the most successful initiative consultants, 
the Burlingame firm of Woodward & McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the coalition we put together," McDowell said, explaining the reason 
Tobias withdrew it. "They never expected that kind of opposition."

34 FIRMS CITED FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN HANDLING ASBESTOS; ENVIRONMENT: TWO VAN 
NUYS FIRMS AND ONE IN SANTA CLARITA ARE AMONG THEM. OFFICIALS SAY IMPROPER 
TRANSPORT AND STORAGE MAY BE WIDESPREAD. 
</P>

<P>
 In a statewide crackdown on the asbestos transport industry, state health 
officials announced Tuesday that they have cited 34 California companies for 
violating laws that mandate safe handling of the cancer-causing substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Toxic Substances Control is seeking fines totaling 
$400,000 from the companies, which handled 70%, or over 333,000 tons, of the 
asbestos that traveled in or through California between June, 1991, and July, 
1993. Among the firms cited were two in Van Nuys and one in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials say none of the violations posed an immediate danger to 
the public because they did not involve release of asbestos fibers. But they 
said findings of their investigation were alarming because improper transport 
and storage was widespread within the industry, which handles asbestos removed 
from houses and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inhaling asbestos fibers is a clear danger to public health, and it's 
imperative that companies engaged in the transport and treatment of asbestos 
waste do so properly and safely," said William F. Soo Hoo, director of the 
state's toxics department. 
</P>
<P>
 The violations were found during a computerized check of hazardous waste 
shipping records over the 25 months. The investigation was prompted in part by 
complaints by some asbestos companies that many of their competitors were 
violating state laws, said Ron Baker, a spokesman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the alleged violations involve expired permits, inadequate records 
tracking the asbestos or improper storage. In many cases, the companies were 
storing asbestos for longer periods than allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is seeking the largest fines, just over $25,000 apiece, from 
Certified Environmental Transport of Fontana and CST Environmental in Anaheim. 
The companies can contest the violations and seek lower fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Van Nuys firms -- Controlled Environmental Solutions Inc., and Long & Co. 
Ltd. -- face proposed penalties of $16,900 and $12,950, respectively. Both 
firms are asbestos removal contractors that also transport asbestos waste to 
disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the local firms were accused of storing asbestos waste beyond a 
state maximum of six days. Long & Co. was also cited for transporting asbestos 
waste without a required registration. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all three companies were cited for having manifests -- or 
shipping records -- that were improperly filled out or were missing 
information. Martin was cited for two faulty manifests, and Controlled 
Environmental and Long & Co. for 203 and 47, respectively.

PACKWOOD WAIVED RIGHTS, LAWYERS SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) waited too long to claim that his right against 
self-incrimination would be violated if he is forced to surrender his diaries 
to the Senate Ethics Committee, Senate lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood waived his claim that the diaries could incriminate him "by failing 
to assert it in a timely manner," the lawyers said in legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is investigating allegations that Packwood made unwanted sexual 
advances to more than two dozen women, intimidated some of his accusers and 
attempted to obstruct the probe by altering his diaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel subpoenaed the diaries to determine whether to expand the 
investigation. The subpoena followed discovery of entries that mentioned a 
lobbyist's job offer to Packwood's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood has resisted the committee subpoena and has challenged it in court. 
There was no indication when U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Jackson would rule 
on the diary question.

VIDEOTAPE DOESN'T SHOW SHOOTING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: GATES SAYS D.A.'S OFFICE 
REVIEWING FILM BUT HE CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY CAMERA WAS TURNED AWAY DURING THE 
CRUCIAL MOMENT.

 New details in the death of Deputy Darryn LeRoy Robins surfaced Tuesday as 
investigators continued to look into how the veteran officer was shot in the 
face by a fellow deputy during an impromptu training exercise Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Sheriff Brad Gates said that videotapes taken from cameras in 
patrol cars that were at the scene have been turned over to the district 
attorney's office for its inquiry into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the videotapes depict three events leading up to the shooting and 
deputies driving Robins to the hospital. But for some unexplained reason, the 
film does not contain footage of the training session that led to the officer's 
death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff also said Tuesday that four deputies in three patrol cars, 
including Robins and a rookie patrol deputy, were behind the Lake Forest 
shopping center where they were going to review car stop tactics for felony 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to release the other officers' names, citing restrictions in 
county regulations, and added that he did not know whether the two deputies 
accompanying Robins and Brian Scanlan saw the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was limited in what he could say about the ensuing investigation 
and cautioned that he would not know all the facts until the Orange County 
district attorney's office completes its probe in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, which is responsible for investigating 
officer-involved shootings in the county, will determine whether criminal 
charges should be filed against Scanlan, the deputy who shot Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 . "We have asked (district attorney investigators) to move as rapidly as they 
possibly can," Gates said. "Once . . . they give us the results so we know what 
we are talking about, we will start the process of reviewing our policy related 
to that incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The videotapes turned over to investigators were taken from cameras installed 
in patrol vehicles under a new sheriff's program to provide evidence in 
criminal cases and police misconduct complaints. The fist-sized cameras, which 
are attached to the rearview mirror, can be turned on manually or automatically 
when a patrol car's lights and siren are activated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the tapes partially captured a California Highway Patrol arrest 
that the deputies assisted in earlier in the day. In another sequence, he said, 
the deputies are conducting field training sessions without any difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 That is followed by other footage showing the officers going to answer a 
burglary call at Fuddrucker's restaurant in the Twin Peaks shopping center in 
Lake Forest. The remaining film depicts deputies driving from the scene of 
Robins' shooting to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not aware of any footage of the shooting," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 One law enforcement source has told the Times that one camera appears to have 
been rolling during incident but was not aimed properly out the front window of 
the patrol car. Instead of recording the shooting, the source said, it got the 
dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are investigating the possibility that a deputy may have 
accidentally knocked the camera from its normal angle during the burglary 
investigation just minutes before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the camera might have been bumped by a shotgun and knocked out of 
alignment when one deputy got out of his car to answer the Fuddrucker's call. 
The video camera was later straightened out, he said, but he added that he did 
not know all the details or whose patrol car was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have said they are focusing on the possibility that Robins, 
playing the part of a suspect in the car, surprised Scanlan during the training 
session by reaching for a small gun he had hidden in the car's sun visor. 
</P>
<P>
 Former deputies have told The Times that many deputies carry small backup 
pistols in case they are disarmed by suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Sheriff's Department policy forbids on-duty deputies from carrying 
firearms other than their service pistols and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheriff said he did not know whether Robins was carrying any such 
weapon the day he was shot or whether any firearm that violated department 
policy was used during the training session.

 Thomas, 32, probably will retire after this season and assume a management 
position, the newspaper said. It quoted unidentified sources as saying he would 
be put in charge of its basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons declined to comment on the arrangement Tuesday, saying details 
will be disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Press did not say what share of the team Thomas would own or how the 
$55 million would be divided between stock and salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit New reported that the agreement calls for Thomas to receive a 
one-year contract extension with a balloon payment estimated to be somewhere 
between $7 to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon payment will be on Thomas' player contract, so the money will 
count against the Pistons' salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the News source, Thomas also will receive 10% of Piston owner 
William Davidson's sports empire, which includes the Pistons, The Palace, and 
the Pine Knob Music Theater. The team is worth an estimated $132 million, 
according to Financial World magazine. Davidson could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday, the Free Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team announced Tuesday that Thomas will remain in a Piston uniform until 
he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 That came after reports Sunday that he was about to be traded to the New York 
Knicks for Tony Campbell and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased we've finalized the whole controversy," Coach Don Chaney 
said from Chicago after the Pistons lost, 97-91, to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very distracting thing. Now the decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas did not play Tuesday, the sixth game in a row he has sat out because of 
foot and toe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take my hat off to him," Chicago's Scottie Pippen said. "He's being repaid 
for what he did for the franchise. It would be a shame if he didn't end his 
career in a Pistons uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a 12-time All-Star, is averaging 14.3 points and nine assists a game 
for the struggling Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' contract allows him to veto any trade. But he said Monday he would 
consider a move if it would help the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my new home," he said. "I plan to live here after my career is 
finished. But I wouldn't stand in the way if the Pistons wanted to progress." 
</P>
<P>
 But things apparently changed after a meeting between Thomas and Davidson on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to assume that he is going to be with the team for the remainder of 
his career," Piston spokeswoman Sue Emerick said Tuesday.

COMMENTARY; RAMS DRAW LOW MARKS, FEWER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Approximately 191 days until the Rams open training camp, and aren't you 
excited? 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be any better than what it was in 1993? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams go 0-4 in the exhibition season, the first time in franchise history 
they have failed to win a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett proclaims himself the greatest passer in Ram history before 
going on to compile a lower pass completion percentage than any other starting 
quarterback in the league -- T.J. Rubley included. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Anthony Newman cries after the Rams lose their season-opener by 30 
points. Fortunately, he's not clairvoyant and does not know there are 10 more 
losses to come. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams shut out Pittsburgh, blast Houston and then call it a year. After a 
2-2 start they fall by 31 points to New Orleans in Anaheim Stadium. Afterward, 
Everett says, "I've played better football games, I think I've played worse." 
He will play worse as the season goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams get bye, Darryl Henley gets asked to leave while authorities 
investigate alleged drug trafficking charges. He comes back to Rams Park, says 
no one should believe what they're reading. Later, he's indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An angry Robert Bailey throws a chair in the Ram locker room after the team 
loses to 0-5 Atlanta with Billy Joe Tolliver at quarterback. Linebacker Chris 
Martin, obviously a regular viewer of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, says, "It's 
not too late if we can pull ourselves together." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Losses continue to pile up, although Rubley excites fans with a rally 
against Detroit. Instead of crediting the kid for his work, Everett calls the 
offense obsolete in defense of his own shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Chuck Knox decides to give T.J. Rubley a feeling of what it was like 
to be part of the Charge of the Light Brigade and presents him with his first 
start against the 49ers -- in San Francisco. Everett tells CBS's John Madden, 
"We'll find out if I'm the reason we're 2-5." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everett's back in command a week later against Atlanta's No. 28-ranked 
defense, and as Falcon linebacker Darion Conner said, "We know Everett can't 
perform under pressure." He didn't, and Rams lost 13-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rubley saves the day against Washington, relieves Everett and the Rams win. 
Everett has made his last start of the season for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Injuries mount, and formerly unemployed football players are suddenly 
starting for the Rams. A total of 19 players are added to the roster after the 
team breaks training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owner Georgia Frontiere gives her first interview in years, says she won't 
sell but might move. Also says Knox is a lock to return in 1994. The same is 
not said about Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rubley becomes the starter and the Rams lose by 25 to San Francisco. Ram 
cornerback Wymon Henderson says after the game, "There were some things out 
there we can be proud of." Indeed, Henderson & Co. hold Steve Young to only 462 
passing yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams go to New Orleans and win. Henderson expects invites from Letterman & 
Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams finish 2-4 down the stretch with Rubley and blow an opportunity to 
pick second in 1994 draft with a season-closing victory over Chicago. After 
running back Jerome Bettis finishes No. 2 in rushing, teammate Irv Eatman says, 
"If Bettis stays healthy, he could be one of the best to ever play in this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rumors continue to swirl that the Rams will move to Baltimore after a 
season in which the team averaged 45,401 fans a home game -- the lowest total 
since their arrival in Anaheim Stadium in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very tough to block out all those (distractions)," Knox said. "They 
become disconcerting. Some people are able to block them out better than 
others. It's very tough to put a handle on how that impacts your team. It's 
like grabbing air. It's tough to measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up, injuries, distractions and inept play and it's right there in 
the record books: a 5-11 finish for the second time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But just wait until next season . . . QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Told you they should have played third-stringer Jamie Martin more. A 
top-flight running game is supposed to make it that much easier for a 
quarterback, but the Rams have No. 2 rusher in league and win five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett blamed his downfall in 1993 "on outside influences" and challenged a 
reporter to fight last week. Team officials expressed immediate concern, 
fearing that if he threw a punch there was no telling where it would land.  
</P>
<P>
 Rubley's career as a starter is finished just as it begins. Worst thing that 
can happen to a ninth-round pick from Tulsa who has failed to overwhelmingly 
impress is the hiring of a new quarterbacks coach. Rubley pitches as many 
touchdowns as Everett and six fewer interceptions, but fans aren't lining up to 
buy season tickets based on his promise. The next marketing push will revolve 
around the quarterback acquired during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Everett's 49.3 completion percentage is the lowest for a Ram 
starting quarterback since 1965, when Roman Gabriel completed 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad were they? Dieter Brock threw for 16 touchdowns in 15 games in 1985; 
Rubley and the greatest passer in Ram history combined to throw for 16 
touchdowns in 16 games. Grade: F RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for 1,429 yards, made the Pro Bowl and needs only one more 
1,200-yard season to negate fifth year of contract and become an unrestricted 
free agent -- just about the time the Rams' new quarterback becomes comfortable 
and ready to make a run for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy football owners take note next season: Bettis finished third in total 
yards gained from scrimmage behind Emmitt Smith and Thurman Thomas, and Bettis 
came out of the game in third-down passing situations in favor of Cleveland 
Gary. Gary does not figure to receive his mail at Rams Park next season, and 
Bettis caught five passes for 71 yards in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to Tim Lester for clearing the way for Bettis and for Gary's 
professionalism while losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about that Russell White? Shoot, the two times the big guy carried the 
ball, he gained 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 When Knox began using injuries as excuse for Rams' collapse, he started 
talking about David Lang's loss as if Lang were Emmitt Smith. Smith returned to 
Cowboys, and they began winning. Lang returned to the Rams, and they continued 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Bettis averaged 131 yards in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground Yuck: Rams were 2-5 in games in which Bettis rushed for more than 100 
yards. Grade: A plus RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait to hear Rams' pitch to free agents Tim Brown, Anthony Miller and 
Michael Haynes: "OK, so we intend to run Bettis almost every play, we don't 
have a quarterback worth a damn, we got the fifth pick and no shot at a young 
stud in the draft, but what would you say if we told you we might get booed 
this season, but next year when we move to Baltimore you'll hear nothing but 
cheers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ellard leads team in receptions, but then check out the alternatives: 
Todd Kinchen (hurt), Ernie Jones (hurt and can't catch), Sean LaChapelle (human 
glacier), Flipper Anderson (AWOL), Troy Drayton (playbook woes), James Lofton 
(eligible for Social Security) and Richard Buchanan (get serious). 
</P>
<P>
 Rams claim they have steal of draft in Drayton, then struggle in passing game 
but don't employ Drayton. They let it be known that he can't pick up Ram 
offense; hope he doesn't do his own taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Drayton caught 13 passes in the team's first 11 games and a total of 
14 in the final five. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Dave Kingman: Anderson remains Rams' No. 1 home-run threat, but 
unfortunately, he strikes out too often. In the last 31 games, Anderson has 
failed to record a 100-yard receiving game. Grade: D OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Erkenbeck has to beat cancer and try to win with these guys all in 
the same year. Cancer's no problem, but try and line up with Keith Loneker, 
Darryl Ashmore and Jeff Pahukoa. Erkenbeck gets the job done, and Rams allow 31 
sacks -- seventh best in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis helps, too. Best thing that can happen to a mediocre bunch of lugs is a 
standing order to run block. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams need Jackie Slater to return if nothing else for the example he sets in 
preparing himself for combat each week. After Slater injured his shoulder, the 
Ram line surrendered 16 sacks in the next 11 quarters of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Eatman is team's best free-agent acquisition.  
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Ram starters did not miss a game in 1992; Slater and guard Tom 
Newberry missed total of 15 starts in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed McMahon could still call: You would have thought Loneker had a better 
chance of winning the Publisher Clearinghouse's $10-million first-place award 
than starting a game in the NFL. Grade: B minus DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to upgrading Robert Young's minimum salary in 1994, the Rams might 
consider funding a trip to Lourdes to insure Young's recovery from knee 
surgery. Young's return is vital to the team's hopes for quick recovery next 
season. Young had seven sacks in 5 1/2 games and then missed rest of season 
with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Gilbert is a star and racks up 10 1/2 sacks despite being double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reports from credible observers that Marc Boutte played in all 16 
games this season, but the stats don't indicate it. Tony Woods is sleepless in 
Seattle, but loved in Anaheim. Gerald Robinson is probably looking for work 
elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Stokes has 9 1/2 sacks, makes every 2 a.m. feeding and doesn't have to 
worry about missing baby grow up while he's off at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Rams had 17 sacks in first four games with Young in lineup; six 
sacks in last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 A bargain: Rams paid $333,333.33 for each of Gerald Robinson's three sacks. 
Grade: C minus LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Emergence of Roman Phifer bodes well for development of defense. Phifer's 117 
tackles are the team's most since 1985 when Jim Collins had 140 and Carl Ekern 
had 118. Phifer also proved versatile at times in working as pass defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Conlan earns $2.34 million, gets nice suntan and doesn't have to be 
embarrassed in this year's Super Bowl again. When healthy, he also proves he 
can still play the game, although Rams continued to remove him from field on 
goal-line situations. Imagine taking Mike Singletary off the field as the other 
team is poised to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rolling ties for team lead with two interceptions, but fails to make a 
lasting impression because of a series of injuries. However, if Phifer, Conlan 
and Rolling emerge healthy from training camp next season Rams appear solid 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Ram starting linebackers, who are supposed to be the team's biggest 
hitters, did not force a fumble all season long. Reserve linebacker Chris 
Martin had two. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs Kevin Greene? Rams did not get a sack from any of their linebackers. 
Grade B DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on injuries, indictments or missed assignments, but these guys were 
the biggest disappointment in 1993. When they reported to training camp they 
looked like the strength of the team, but they couldn't catch the ball when 
given the opportunity for an interception and couldn't cover when the game was 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Henley missed 11 games because of a federal investigation into drug 
trafficking charges, and Todd Lyght missed final seven games with a knee 
injury. Problems aside, Rams finished last in the league defending against the 
pass, and that's with an up-and-coming Steve Israel playing a lot and starting 
free safety Anthony Newman on the field for every play and safeties Pat Terrell 
and Michael Stewart available for duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Newman started 16 games at free safety and finished the season 
without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Clowns: Rams finished last in the league in stopping opponents on 
third down because when opposition needed yardage, they went searching for 
Wymon Henderson, Dexter Davis and Mitchell Price. Grade: F SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 A season-long embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams fielded the league's overall worst special teams and that's hard to do. 
Longest punt return went 13 yards. Longest kickoff return was 35 yards -- by 
Russell White, who wasn't allowed to wear a uniform the last 10 weeks because 
the team considers him a stiff.  
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Rams were last in the league in net punt average at 31.7 yards and 
last in league returning punts at 5.4 yards a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone yell "boo?" Ellard made like Don Knotts on punt returns and began 
signaling for a fair catch while running onto the field. Rams returned a 
league-low 19 punts, signaling for fair catch 15 times. Grade: F minus COACHING 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say, "playoffs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rams had no faith in Everett last off-season, did nothing to address the 
problem and then acted shocked when he wimped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams went 2-2 despite a most difficult schedule to start the season, then 
crumbled. Injuries stifled team's lofty hopes, but come on, Rams were 0-4 
during the exhibition season and signs were everywhere for impending disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense failed to measure up to preseason hype because of inability to 
generate turnovers. Team never addressed wide receiver problems, failed to 
properly employ Drayton, and mishandled the who will start -- Gary or Bettis -- 
situation from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the "Rubley gets to start every time we play San Francisco" 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries sabotaged efforts to hang tough. Ask Don Shula about that. Rams 
practiced hard throughout the season, but how do you explain being party to six 
blowouts? Rams lost six games by 23 or more points, and is that because of a 
lack of talent or a team that has quit? 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit of doubt goes to Knox, who has turned it around previously here, with 
the Bills and with the Seahawks. Current criticism of the Rams and a last 
chance to add to his impressive coaching credentials might be just the ticket 
to raise Knox's Pennsylvania ire and demand overnight success. 
</P>
<P>
 Front office has considered coaching change, thought about hiring a GM, but 
has opted to play on as is. One more losing season, and as hard as they work, 
it won't matter -- these guys won't have to worry about moving to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Knox-coached teams in the last five years have compiled a 34-46 
record and have finished no higher than third in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest off-season question: Who decides who will be the starting quarterback 
next season, and for the years to come? Knox or front office? Grade: D

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; MANY COACHES WOULD LIKE TO KEEP BOOSTER CLUBS AT ARM'S 
LENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's dangerous business to bite the hand that feeds you. But that's exactly 
what some high school coaches would like to do. 
</P>
<P>
 They would like to take their booster club, shake it by the collar and scream, 
"Get off my back!"  
</P>
<P>
 But that's too risky. So if there's an anonymous name or two here, you can 
understand why. It's too risky to go on the record when California's fiscal 
troubles have forced athletic programs to rely more heavily than ever on 
boosters to raise money for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Additional coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attending premier out-of-town tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 All these are important if a program is to continue to improve, and the point 
of competing is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 And should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County high school sports in the 1990s is not about winning as much as 
it's about scholarships and special interests. At least that's what coaches say 
parents think. The pressure to win is great enough -- winning is the basic 
measuring stick for success -- but added to that is the pressure on coaches 
from parents, who contend their actions are in the best interests of their 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 So I spoke to a well-respected coach -- one who has a former player on an 
athletic scholarship for a top college program. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Honestly, can you say that eight of 10 players on a basketball team have 
parents who expect you to get their kid a scholarship, or is it just the three 
best players? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: "You'd be surprised. Generally, everyone is in it for the scholarships. 
The days of playing for competition and pride in your school are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about booster clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: "I'm leery of parents. I've found their involvement is usually 
commensurate with how well things are going, specifically for their child. It's 
all based on their playing time. The ones who play the most have the parents 
who are most active. And they also have the parents who have the greatest 
expectations in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. You raise money, maybe write a check or two, travel to a tournament and 
get to know the coach on a first-name basis. Suddenly, there's a perceived 
"in." And with that perception comes an expectation of increased playing time, 
perhaps a starting role with the ball in your child's hands more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as any school gives in to that pressure and doesn't put the boosters 
in their place, then it creates problems everywhere else," another coach said. 
"Then they start witch hunts and go after your butt when things don't go their 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a contentious society. When people don't like something, they try to 
change it -- including coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 And these attitudes have filtered down to many of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a coach: "Their thought process is no longer going out for the team, 
contributing, earning a varsity letter, backing up and being supportive, 
changing positions, doing whatever it takes to win; their thought process is 
what position can I play to get a scholarship, what camp do I have to go to, 
can I play another sport or will it hurt my chances? Everything is so uptight 
and driven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't sound like a pretty picture, does it? But it's real." 
</P>
<P>
 It's selfish. But that's the changing face of high school athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 What these and other coaches are thinking is that boosters should be boosters. 
If they can help, they should. If they can give something special to the 
program, then by all means, do so. But it should be done out of concern for the 
program, and they should not expect special considerations in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the response if a high school coach, after being diagnosed by his 
doctor, turned around and told the doctor how to perform surgery. The doctor 
would tell him to take a hike -- if he was being polite about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, then, how a coach feels when members of a booster club expect their 
sons or daughters to receive special attention, and the parents have no qualms 
about attempting a squeeze play by withholding financial support or going over 
the coach's head with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a burden no one should shoulder, and enough to to make a coach scream: 
</P>
<P>
 "Get off my back!"

<P>
 Booster clubs long have offered monetary and spiritual support for high school 
athletic programs, but lately, some grumbling has been heard about these same 
groups wielding excessive control in determining the direction of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and athletic directors complain of the abuse of power by some booster 
club members who believe, because of the support provided, they should have a 
say in everything from who gets playing time to who coaches the team. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, parents say they merely want accountability on behalf of 
the school's athletic program and its coaches. They're looking for a way to 
address concerns without fear of retribution, and for fair and equal treatment 
of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In these financially difficult times, high school athletics have become 
increasingly reliant on the support of booster clubs to help make ends meet. 
And despite some coaches' feelings that they can't live with them, they 
certainly can't live without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps by more clearly defining their roles and responsibilities, athletic 
departments and booster clubs could learn to peaceably coexist, working 
together to provide a positive and productive experience for the athletes. 
Isn't that what it's all about anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a no-frills program, you must prioritize your needs and exclude the 
luxuries." Q: Can a high school sports program survive without the support of a 
booster club?

two major league players (Eric Fox with Oakland and Don August with Milwaukee); 
six minor league players; 21 Division I college scholarships. Capistrano Valley 
is proud of its accomplishments in baseball. All this without the aid of a 
booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district supplied the necessary items: brick dust, fencing, 
uniforms, balls, protective gear, coaching stipends, scoreboard, 
transportation, field maintenance, batting machines and cages. The student body 
paid for umpires and tournament fees. The parents supplied the individual's 
equipment. All this coupled with outstanding players proved a winning 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the passage of Proposition 13 hampered the school district's ability 
to fund athletics. I thought of forming a booster club. But I had another idea 
that would help us out financially and give the same booster club-weary parents 
more time to spend with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 What I did had not been done previously because of an archaic education code. 
With the help of some administrators who looked the other way, I sold 4-foot by 
8-foot advertisements on the outfield fence. No one complained, so many of my 
coaching colleagues also began selling signs. Today, it is rare to go to a high 
school diamond in Orange County and not see advertisements on the fences. These 
signs generate about $2,000 per year, just enough to keep our no-frills program 
in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 To have a no-frills program, you must prioritize your needs and exclude the 
luxuries: expensive jackets, pregame jerseys, new balls for infield and 
bullpens, dugouts -- all require money. 
</P>
<P>
 At Capistrano Valley our No. 1 priority is the playing surface. The word "our" 
refers to the players. They spend time and effort maintaining the fields daily. 
The pride and confidence they have in their field is reflected in their play. 
Our field surface is rated as one of the finest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Our baseball parents have done a lot for their sons. The moral support being 
paramount. I want to thank them for their support by telling them to sit back, 
relax and enjoy their sons having fun.

 Booster clubs long have offered monetary and spiritual support for high school 
athletic programs, but lately, some grumbling has been heard about these same 
groups wielding excessive control in determining the direction of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and athletic directors complain of the abuse of power by some booster 
club members who believe, because of the support provided, they should have a 
say in everything from who gets playing time to who coaches the team. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, parents say they merely want accountability on behalf of 
the school's athletic program and its coaches. They're looking for a way to 
address concerns without fear of retribution, and for fair and equal treatment 
of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In these financially difficult times, high school athletics have become 
increasingly reliant on the support of booster clubs to help make ends meet. 
And despite some coaches' feelings that they can't live with them, they 
certainly can't live without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps by more clearly defining their roles and responsibilities, athletic 
departments and booster clubs could learn to peaceably coexist, working 
together to provide a positive and productive experience for the athletes. 
Isn't that what it's all about anyway?

 'When used correctly, booster clubs can be effective tools to combine the 
efforts of the school, parents, students and community." Q: Can a high school 
sports program survive without the support of a booster club? 
</P>
<P>
 CON 
</P>
<P>
 TONY DRAFT, Football Boosters President, Valenica High School 
</P>
<P>
 A Lifeline for Programs Needing Cash 
</P>
<P>
 The booster club is a vital part of a quality athletic program, acting as a 
support group to extend the athletic budget. Support is offered in many ways, 
such as morale building (team parties, recognition/awards, banquets), liaison 
with other school groups, fund-raising to provide financial assistance with 
coaching stipends, equipment needs, scouting, coaching clinics, camera/video 
needs, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic programs are often threatened by financial cutbacks when district 
budgets are decided. The booster club operates as a nonprofit entity, 
projecting a budget and raising the necessary funds through the efforts of the 
school, parents, concessions and community. The booster club then provides the 
necessary financial assistance to allow the schools to continue to offer 
quality extracurricular athletic programs. In doing so, it offers students 
drug-free, alcohol-free alternatives to some of the less favorable options 
awaiting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, our booster clubs have had to raise more and more 
money just to keep the programs at the same level, while the district continues 
to cut back funds to the extracurricular programs. One recent cutback, in the 
Placentia-Yorba Linda School District, requires that all booster clubs provide 
their own liability insurance. This requirement may cut out many booster clubs, 
as their budgets may not be capable of handling the existing responsibilities, 
let alone adding liability insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Can our athletic programs survive without booster clubs? Not if we value the 
quality of our programs; Not if we continue to have monetary cutbacks to our 
athletic programs, and Not as long as we see the importance of quality 
extracurricular programs for our youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has been a part of an active booster club is aware that success 
depends on a lot of time and hard work. When used correctly, booster clubs can 
be effective tools to combine the efforts of the school, parents, students and 
community. On behalf of the Valencia High School Football Boosters, we are 
proud to be an instrumental part of the success of such a quality football 
program and have that success add to the pride in our school.

</P>
<P>
 Q: How much input should a booster club member have in the running of a 
school's athletic program? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, booster clubs offered much welcomed spiritual and monetary 
support for high school athletic programs, all at the direction of the coach or 
other faculty sponsor. Many booster clubs have now progressed (or digressed) 
into organizations of control and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember, during my first year as principal of Kennedy High School, when 
the president of one of our major booster clubs told me during a conversation, 
'They didn't need to seek, nor follow my direction, as they were an independent 
corporation.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my firm opinion that booster clubs should not have any power to make 
decisions beyond whether or not cherry tomatoes are used in the salad for the 
welcome-back luncheon provided to staff members. Input, of course; 
decision-making power, never. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something goes wrong in the administration of a school program, the 
principal can never look to a booster club for accountability and, therefore, 
any decisions made in the program must always be made by the faculty sponsor." 
</P>
<P>
 C. Larry Fancher, Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "As an active booster at Los Amigos, I don't believe that any club should have 
a say about how a team should be run. A booster is there for the kids and to 
help those who need it. Some kids can't afford to play sports because of the 
costs, and this is where a booster can help. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're asked for advice in a certain field, by all means voice your ideas, 
but let the school and its staff run the athletic program. Just because you 
give big bucks, that doesn't make you the coach or athletic director. Money 
isn't everything that makes you a booster. It takes something from the heart. 
So all you high-rollers, just take a few steps backward and get back up in the 
stands where you belong. You'll enjoy the kids and the game much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford M. Weimer, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous the way booster clubs are running sports nowadays. If the 
parents don't like a certain thing, they take control of it and run it 
themselves, telling the coaches exactly what to do. Corona del Mar High has 
separate booster clubs, and they need to be combined into one club that serves 
all the sports teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Miller, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 "Booster club members do not know nearly as much as the coaches because the 
coaches are the ones running it; they know what's going on with the players. 
Booster club members should just stay out of running it but support the program 
as much as they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Blackburn, University sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main problems that parents encounter with coaches of high school 
sports is the lack of a proper channel for parental input. Most parents are 
afraid to make negative comments to the athletic director or principal 
concerning a sport or coach for fear or reprisal against their child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need a voice if they are going to be asked to work for a team. You 
would have a much better chance of gaining their positive support if at the and 
of each season they were allowed to participate in the evaluation of their 
sports program. If principals and athletic directors asked for postseason, 
anonymous input from both the student participants and their parents, and used 
this input to evaluate the effectiveness of each coach and whether they would 
be rehired, negative parent involvement would be reduced and programs would be 
improved." 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Collins, San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports programs are meant to be run for kids, and they should be run by the 
school. There should be no reason for booster input on whether or not a coach 
gets hired or fired. The decision should be made by the school's 
administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Aborne, Kennedy sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 "Proper booster club management and support can greatly enhance any athletic 
program. However, horror stories run rampant of booster clubs that try to 
intimidate, control and make unilateral decisions regarding coaching, fund 
distribution and playing time. A solid, confident coach can avoid these 
problems by openly communicating the function of the booster club. You raise 
the money, I'll spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, we don't tell the boosters how to run their business, why should 
they command trained educators and coaches on how to run their business? Three 
cheers for supportive boosters. If those boosters who want to carry their 
weight beyond what they are supposed to do, I would suggest they coach the team 
or get into an adult sports league to relive those lost glory years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce King, Brea-Olinda assistant baseball coach 
</P>
<P>
 "Booster clubs need to be positive, contributing forces at a high school. 
Their role should be that of helping the athletic programs survive in these 
financially difficult times. They should not exercise their influence to shape 
and direct the school's program." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Campbell, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 "To respond to parent concerns by saying that 'boosters should boost' is a 
heads-in-the-sand approach to running athletic programs in high school. Most 
boosters want a positive experience for their athlete. The discontent results 
from parents raising thousands of dollars of support while coaches make 
decisions about their children with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the greatest frustrations parents have is knowing that they must 'put 
up or shut up' when it comes to dealing with inequities and incompetent 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Karen O'Bric, Edison track coaches 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the booster club should have anything to say about the way high 
school sports are conducted because, frankly, they're a bunch of old biddies 
who might feel selling jockey shorts -- or something like that -- with Griffin 
logos on it would be offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Sahli, Los Alamitos senior 
</P>
<P>
 "During my sons' attendance at Servite and a year after, I had been the 
president of the booster club and an officer in the Parents Guild. There was 
never interference nor controversy between the organizations and school 
administration during my tenures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Booster clubs and parent organizations should be monitored by a designated 
faculty member, left alone and needs discussed and planned. Boosters or other 
organizations should be consulted by the faculty when issues arise which are 
not part of studies or discipline. A monthly report should be prepared and a 
copy forwarded to a designated faculty member. Monies should be disbursed for 
needs as mutually agreed upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Brady, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on a number of booster organizations at the high school, and I feel 
the role they should play is that of adviser to the coach. They should not have 
too much say, but they should come up with ways and means of raising funds and 
helping the players out with equipment and postseason events." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Torres, Orange, Class of '62 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember that booster club members are parents who choose 
to take an active role in supporting the needs of their child's athletic 
program. The fact is that in today's economic world there are not enough funds 
to properly support every sports program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have taken a pro-active position by organizing various fund-raisers that 
not only raise the needed revenues but also build team spirit and character in 
our players. The role of our booster club is to support the coaching staff and 
school administrators so they can concentrate 100% on coaching the team and 
providing the highest quality experience for our athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bagby, president of Edison's Boys' Soccer Booster Board 
</P>
<P>
 "Booster clubs, both academic and athletic, have become an integral part of 
high school life. At Sonora High School, each booster clubs' responsibility is 
to help set the 'off-field' tone for its particular sport. This is done by 
raising the money necessary to cover costs that some student athletes are not 
able to afford and would be unfunded due to the lack of a school budget. 
Additionally, a booster club should do whatever it can behind the scenes to 
increase school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The booster club should not be involved with the 'on-field' running of the 
program, nor with the decision to replace a coach, no matter how much money it 
raises for the program. If it were to have influence in these areas, it could 
hold the school hostage and ultimately, the school and the program would 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Ringl, La Habra Heights 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches and booster club members need to re-evaluate their own personal goals 
and priorities so they will be able to better understand and guide the athletes 
to meet their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases, from what I have observed, the athlete is more mature and 
professional than the coach or booster club members."

ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE FACES SUIT OVER BASKETBALL INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Erika Miller, a former junior college women's basketball player is seeking $1 
million in damages from Antelope Valley College, its women's basketball coach 
and a former Antelope Valley player, claiming she suffered a career-ending 
injury in a game against the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 20, who averaged 12.3 points a game last season for Golden West 
College in Huntington Beach, has filed the suit that names Antelope Valley 
Coach Jackie Lott and Niani Dunn, the former player. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit stems from a game Feb. 24 in the junior college playoffs. As Miller 
attempted a breakaway layup, she was shoved from behind and slammed into a wall 
behind the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered a dislocated left elbow, an injury which allegedly ended her 
career. Dunn was assessed a flagrant foul and ejected from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal action, even criminal prosecution, for deliberate acts of violence in 
sports is not unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Dino Ciccarelli of the Minnesota North Stars was sentenced to a day 
in jail for striking Luke Richardson of the Toronto Maple Leafs on the head 
twice with a hockey stick. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dwight Angelini, a member of the Harvard-Westlake High soccer 
team last season, was arrested and later charged with felony assault after he 
kicked Ryan Herrera of Notre Dame on the head during a match last February. 
Angelini was sentenced to six months probation and 40 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Herrera family has filed suit against Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miller's case, officials did not call the police, but then-Athletic 
Director Tom Hermstad fired off a letter to his counterpart at Antelope Valley 
to ask whether any action had been taken against Dunn and Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brandige, vice president of Antelope Valley Community College, declined on 
Monday to discuss the lawsuit or the contents of Hermstad's letter. The school 
also did not reply to Hermstad's correspondence, it said, because of the 
potential for litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn and Lott could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stricklin, the Rustlers' basketball coach, said the foul probably cost 
Golden West the state championship because the team lost Miller, a three-point 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's attorney, Susan Cameron Kelley of Huntington Beach, said her client's 
damage claim was routinely denied by the Antelope Valley School District last 
year. Kelley said she was almost certain that Miller would prevail in her 
lawsuit, noting that she had obtained a videotape showing the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "That foul was battery," Kelley said. "It's not what people agree to do when 
they step on a basketball court." DAVAN MAHARAJ

WELCH REFLECTS ON CAREER BY TIPPING CAP TO FRIENDS, FOES ALIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Welch quietly announced he was retiring from coaching and by Tuesday his 
telephone was ringing. Repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got off the phone with Aaron Emmanuel, who wasn't even one of my own 
players," said Welch, now the former coach at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmanuel, a running back at USC and Quartz Hill High, told Welch he was 
considering a career in coaching. Who better to talk to than Welch, a coach he 
tried desperately to beat in his prep days and a man he had come to admire 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after Welch resigned his football job, his call-waiting service was 
overloaded. Some were well-wishers. Some were coaches who were not bashful in 
their interest to replace the winningest coach in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to about 50 people today," said Welch, who sounded in midseason 
form: stressed and tired, but not too tired to talk. Especially now that the 
flood of memories that came from 12 seasons, 119 victories and three Southern 
Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaron Emmanuel and Tommie Smith (of Antelope Valley) were the most memorable 
players I coached against," Welch said. "They were men among boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Who was his favorite among his own players? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't say," Welch said. "They're all so different and so special. I promise 
you, I'll carry them with me to my grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Three consecutive section titles, a section record-tying 46 victories in a 
row, eight consecutive semifinal appearances in the playoffs. Welch won nearly 
80% of his games at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But what he remembers most is not always happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The infamous 28-27 playoff loss at Santa Barbara in 1989 will forever burn. 
Welch recalled how drunken partisan fans threatened Cowboy fans during the game 
and how the out-of-towners required a police escort out. Welch launched a 
postgame tirade in which he destroyed a trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running out in the game, Santa Barbara was allowed to run six plays 
within the Canyon four yard-line until the Dons scored. Time expired before the 
play on which Santa Barbara scored. Without explanation, the officials let them 
run another play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officials were honest men that became intimidated by the crowd," Welch 
said. "They were not anti-Canyon, but they created phantom situations (that 
allowed Santa Barbara to win). My kids were out there bruised and bloody. It 
was scary, it was awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was singularly my most memorable game. That was the worst situation that 
I've ever been involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch lost to archrival Hart six of the last seven seasons. Some people will 
tell you the Hart game was the only one that mattered. And so Welch took his 
hat off to former Indian coaches Carl Sweet and Rick Scott, and current coaches 
Mike, Rick and Dean Herrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hart has) always been so darn well-coached and has ticked me off," Welch 
said. "It was a bittersweet, marvelous rivalry. There ought to be more 
positives about it." 
</P>
<P>
 From Tom and Jim Bonds to Mike Kocicka, Welch went to bed at night trying to 
think of ways to stop Hart quarterbacks who have made All-Southern Section 
teams nine consecutive seasons and 10 times during Welch's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare and an honor going against those guys," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then 1982 popped into mind. It was Welch's first season with the Cowboys, who 
had never won a league championship since the school opened in 1965. Canyon 
went 5-0 in Golden League games, becoming the first team to go undefeated in 
league play. The Cowboys knocked off defending section champion Antelope 
Valley, 14-7, in their first league game under Welch and beat Temple City for 
their first playoff victory. The Rams had a record 46 consecutive victories to 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, amid Canyon's own 46-win streak, the Cowboys faced adversity. 
First-round playoff opponent Santa Maria St. Joseph, which led, 7-0, in the 
fourth quarter at Santa Maria. This was not a foreshadowing of the Santa 
Barbara travesty, but a glimpse of the character of his teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had been raining pretty well all day and all evening, and it was slippery 
and sloshy," said Welch, who called on an inexperienced sophomore, Ken Sollom, 
to complete passes. "I thought with his large hands he'd be able to hold onto 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Sollom threw a touchdown pass to Dave Sipes in the final minute and Canyon 
won, 8-7. A year later, Sollom was again waiting in the wings while quarterback 
John Watkins had kept the Cowboys undefeated. But after Watkins went down with 
an injury, Sollom threw four touchdown passes in a 53-0 rout of Serra in the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sollom outdueled Jim Bonds in memorable 6-3 and 42-32 victories over Hart and 
earned a scholarship to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then Welch wondered if he had created a monster. He had conditioned the 
fans to expect perfect seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Canyon beat Antelope Valley, 30-6, to end the regular season. Four 
weeks later, as the Cowboys beat the Antelopes again to win their third section 
title in a row, Welch heard a chorus of boos from his own fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came as the final gun went off," Welch said. "That should have struck a 
chord. We only won, 9-7." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Antelope Valley tackled Sollom on an option run to thwart a two-point 
conversion attempt and beat Canyon, 21-20, halting the winning streak at 46. 
The next day, a stranger in a convenience store told Welch he made a mistake by 
running the option. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Welch: "I should have known then that the rest of it would be a tough 
road." Harry Welch's 12 Years at Canyon Year: 1982 Record: 8-4 League: 1st 
Season highlight: Welch takes over team that was 5-4 the previous season. 
</P>

SOUTHERN SECTION LAUDS 7 FROM AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven players from the region, including three from Newbury Park High, have 
been selected to the All-Southern Section team by the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation's panel of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, announced Tuesday, is chosen from among the top players from all 11 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Keith Smith, receiver Leodes Van Buren and linebacker Justin Simo 
gave Newbury Park the largest contingent on the team. Those seniors were joined 
by Buena senior running back George Keiaho, Nordhoff senior kicker Sean Leach, 
Westlake junior receiver Billy Miller and Antelope Valley senior linebacker 
Keith Schiele. Miller is one of only four juniors selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (6-foot, 180 pounds) and Van Buren (6-1, 190) formed a record-setting 
passing combination that helped lead Newbury Park to a 14-0 record and a 
section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the Division III player of the year, is the state's all-time leading 
passer and No. 2 nationally with 9,971 yards. Smith completed 66% of his passes 
this season for a state record 4,244 yards with 40 touchdowns and 13 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, a member of the All-Southern Section team as a junior, is the 
state's all-time leader with 269 receptions and 4,446 yards receiving. He ranks 
second nationally in each category. He also led the state in both categories 
this season, catching 101 passes for 1,658 yards and 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Simo (6-1, 200) was the Panthers' leader on defense with a team-high 160 
tackles -- 24 for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena's Keiaho (5-9, 200) is the second-leading rusher in state history with 
6,585 yards. He rushed for a Ventura County-leading 2,248 yards and 30 
touchdowns as the Bulldogs advanced to the semifinals of the Division III 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff's Leach was the region's most consistent kicker. He made seven of 11 
field-goal attempts and 33 of 37 conversion kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's Miller (6-4, 205) finished third in the state in receptions with 82 
for 1,451 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley's Schiele (6-0, 210), The Times' Valley lineman of the year, 
helped Antelope Valley reach the Division I semifinals.

NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN; WELCH'S RESIGNATION ELICITS MEMORIES OF COACH WHO 
ENGENDERED FIERCE LOYALTIES AND ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Brent Parkinson already had heard the news. While it came as no real surprise, 
it was still hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Welch had quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson, a former football standout at Canyon High, could accept the 
announcement only on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say quit ," Parkinson said. "Say resigned. Harry's not a quitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, whose 12-year coaching career at Canyon catapulted the program into 
national prominence, announced his resignation Monday, citing concerns that his 
intense style might threaten his health. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch's announcement followed a tumultuous season in which separate car 
accidents left one of his players dead and an assistant coach paralyzed. In 
addition, Welch was involved in a postgame altercation with the parent of a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't everything, by any means. Four players and three assistant coaches 
from Thousand Oaks High defected to Canyon during the off-season, creating bad 
feelings among Thousand Oaks supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch also won a financial settlement from the Southern Section, ending a 
two-year battle that stemmed from charges that Canyon conducted an off-season 
practice in violation of section rules. Few area coaches celebrated his 
victory, however, with some arguing that Welch had simply beat the system to 
avoid punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlines that once trumpeted Welch's successes -- he entered the 1993 season 
with the third-best winning percentage among state coaches with at least 100 
victories -- instead addressed off-the-field controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's the best thing for him," Parkinson said. "Maybe he needs to take 
care of himself for once." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to football, Welch took care of business with uncanny efficiency. 
Canyon advanced to the Southern Section semifinals or beyond eight consecutive 
seasons. If the 48-year-old coach never returns to the coaching ranks -- he 
hasn't discounted the possibility -- he will be remembered as a man who did it 
his way. Was it the right way? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a world chock full of vacillation and democracy, it's refreshing to me 
that he did it his way," said John Becker, the Rams' director of player 
personnel, who coached with Welch at Crespi High and Valley College. "He 
insists it be done his way. He's got no bigger fan than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the resentment that Welch's success and notoriety fostered in some 
quarters, he will be missed, even by many of his biggest rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always enjoyed coaching against him," Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb 
said. "Boy, he was tough to beat. I'll miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch's ability to motivate players, many of ordinary size and talent, was 
unmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me never to give up," said Scott Blade, a junior linebacker at San 
Diego State. "He taught me that size doesn't matter, to never say die." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade personified the typical Canyon player. As a senior, Blade was all of 6 
feet, 185 pounds. Hardly the prototype NCAA Division I player, Blade 
characterized himself as one of Welch's legion of "overachievers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were little scrappy guys," Blade said. "He gets the most out of his 
players. . . . I would have done anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch could chide or charm, depending on the time of day and the task at hand. 
In fact, his demeanor on the sideline was almost the alter ego of his 
personality elsewhere. Welch is an English teacher at Canyon, an erudite man 
conversant in more than the world of sport. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday nights, though, Welch was often a man possessed. At practice, he 
wore wraparound sunglasses and didn't seem to mind the nickname, "Dirty Harry." 
His high-octane style long ago damaged his vocal chords, so he carried a 
bullhorn to help get his points across. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sprinted out of the womb an overachiever," Becker said. "He's been that 
way as long as I've known him." 
</P>
<P>
 While an assistant with the Buffalo Bills in the mid-1980s, Becker said he 
gave "very serious consideration" to sending his son to California play for 
Welch. His son, also named John, vetoed the idea -- which the father still 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needed that kick in the ass," Becker said. "It would have been good for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches smirked at Welch's intensity during passing-league games they 
considered trivial, but when the regular season rolled around, Welch usually 
accumulated the biggest pile of victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was on 'What's My Line?' you never would have guessed he was a football 
coach," said Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer, who coached with Welch at Crespi in 
the late 1960s. "He was Jekyll and Hyde, Rommel on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson recalls a moment last summer before a 
passing-league game against Canyon at Saugus High. Chaminade huddled moments 
before their game was set to begin when Welch asked to address Lawson's 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he was going to go over the rules or something," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lawson says Welch asked Chaminade to knock his players down, to play 
as physically as possible, to rough up his boys. In short, to help toughen the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of helped perpetuate his image," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few coaches had more head-to-head experience battling Welch than Newcomb, 
whose Antelope Valley team ended Canyon's 46-game winning streak in 1986. 
Antelope Valley defeated Canyon in the Cowboys' last Southern Section 
championship game appearance in 1988, and Antelope Valley fans serenaded Welch 
with sing-song jeers of "Haaaar-ree, Haaaar-ree." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch's track record by then was well-established. In the Antelope and Santa 
Clarita valleys, if the subject is high school football and somebody mentions 
Harry , no surname is necessary. Such is Welch's marquee recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask a random sampling of coaches what made Welch stand apart and the answer is 
predictable: Welch went the extra yard. Of course, when the Canyon program was 
accused of breaking Southern Section rules in the spring of 1991, it earned 
Welch a reputation as a coach who took, well, shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously he was a fine football coach," said Stan Thomas, the section 
commissioner who resigned last year after a review of his expense accounts. 
"All I wanted was for him to work within the framework of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a credit to football. If we could just keep him on the straight and 
narrow, he'd be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch put the pedestrian Canyon program on the map with section titles in 
1983, 1984 and 1985, and the Cowboys' 46-game win streak is the second-longest 
in state history. Thereafter, all Welch had to do was duplicate that success -- 
no mean feat. Coaches have speculated that unreasonably high expectations may 
have contributed to Welch's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon finished 6-4 last fall, marking its third consecutive season of four 
losses or more, and fourth in five years. Welch never had a losing season -- 
his career record is 86 games over .500 -- but what have the Cowboys done 
lately? 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon is 1-3 in postseason play since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eaten by the monster he created probably sums it up," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the budding stages of Welch's coaching career, when he was the Crespi 
junior varsity coach, he had begun to establish a reputation as a tireless 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of coaches I look up to, but he's one of them," said 
Schaeffer, who at the time was defensive coordinator for the Crespi varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Others respect Welch's work ethic, but questioned his sense of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you lose track of the fact that it's a game played by 17-year-old 
kids," Newbury Park Coach George Hurley said. "Sometimes there's as much to be 
learned by losing as by winning at all cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson, a 1985 Canyon graduate who played in three Rose Bowls at USC and 
played for the Denver Broncos, was a sophomore on Welch's first varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canyon football was nothing (before Welch)," Parkinson said. "He is a 
motivator. He expects nothing less than the best anybody has to give. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was tough, but we all learned a lot from him." 
</P>
<P>
 A few players, of course, didn't see eye to eye with the volatile coach. 
Players occasionally quit, including standouts such as Justin Fix and Chris 
Peery, though Peery eventually rejoined the team. While the sacrifice was too 
great for some, there were many more true believers. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Coach George Engbrecht lives in Canyon Country, has had two sons play 
for Welch and is a member of the Canyon booster club. Engbrecht said his son 
Chad, Canyon's starting quarterback in 1991, idolized Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worshiped him," Engbrecht said. "I always have to live up to what Harry 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking over at Van Nuys two years ago, Engbrecht spent time observing 
the Canyon program. He borrowed a few tactics from Welch while discounting 
others as being too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Engbrecht doubts Welch will return to coaching: "How can anyone leave that 
program (and attempt to rebuild elsewhere)? It has everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Others aren't so sure. St. Francis Coach Bill Redell, who took a four-year 
sabbatical from coaching only to return last fall, believes Welch will return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be back when he catches his second wind," said Redell, who is 
Welch's insurance agent. "It's hard to get football out of your system, 
especially when you're as competitive as he is."

SALSA EXPECTED TO NAME RICK DAVIS AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG STANKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Davis, Salsa general manager, is expected to be named coach of the 
American Professional Soccer League team this morning, a source familiar with 
the situation said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a key figure in efforts to build U.S. interest in the sport since the 
1970s, would neither confirm nor deny that he would be presented as the Salsa's 
second coach in a news conference today at the club's training facility at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the source, who requested anonymity, said Davis had been selected to 
replace Rildo Menezes, "and it's an excellent choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need now (in U.S. pro soccer) is people who have gone through our 
systems and understand the mentality of American players," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of U.S. talent is seen as critical to building fan interest here. 
But foreign-born coaches, from countries where soccer is the No. 1 sport, have 
often expressed frustration at the corresponding amount of teaching necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need somebody with a more modern approach, who isn't impatient with our 
young players," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is thoroughly familiar with soccer's struggle to gain a U.S. foothold. 
He was a member of the Cosmos, the North American Soccer League's New 
York-based glamour team, at age 18 and later starred in the Major Indoor Soccer 
League. Both have since folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis also was captain of the U.S. national team for 10 years. But his dream 
to play in a World Cup final was ended by knee problems in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With Davis as general manager, the Salsa ended its first year in the APSL by 
reaching the league final, played before a crowd of 10,743 at Titan Stadium. 
But that game, a 3-1 overtime loss to Colorado, also wound up being a factor in 
the coaching change. 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes left in regulation and a 1-0 Salsa lead, Menezes pulled 
league most valuable player Paulinho and replaced him with a defender. Colorado 
then forced overtime and eventually snatched the title away. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Salsa owner William De La Pena was openly furious with the coaching 
decision, and Menezes resigned under pressure soon after.

ANGELS OPEN TALKS WITH HARKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels opened negotiations with free-agent starting pitcher Mike Harkey 
and are scheduled to meet Thursday, when they are expected to offer a one-year 
contract with incentives worth about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkey, who lives in Chino Hills and attended Cal State Fullerton, was 10-10 
with a 5.26 ERA last season for the Chicago Cubs.Harkey became a free agent two 
weeks ago when the Cubs did not tender him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' biggest obstacle will be persuading Harkey, 27, that he would 
benefit more pitching in Anaheim than for Colorado. The Rockies have offered 
Harkey a one-year contract for about $600,000 plus about $300,000 in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels are willing to offer more money -- and unlike the Rockies 
are not insisting on an option year -- Harkey has expressed his desire to be 
reunited with Rockie catcher Joe Girardi and trainer Dave Cilladi, who were 
with him in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also engaged in talks once again with Steve Comte, the agent for 
left-handed reliever Steve Frey. Neither side compromised, however. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been teams who have expressed interest in Frey, according to Comte, 
including at least one offer that exceeds the Angels' two-year offer in excess 
of $1.6 million. BOB NIGHTENGALE

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: ANNUAL MUTUAL FUND REVIEW & OUTLOOK; STOCK ROCKET; 
INVESTORS ENJOY GAINS FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock mutual fund locomotive steamed ahead in 1993, as small investors in 
the typical stock fund enjoyed a third consecutive annual gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The average general U.S. stock fund rose 12.5% for the year, significantly 
better than the 8.9% average gain of 1992 and far above the 2.7% that investors 
might have earned if they sat out the often-volatile stock market in favor of a 
money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The average stock fund gain also was better than the 10.1% return (stock price 
appreciation plus dividends) in '93 on the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the 
benchmark of blue-chip stock performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors who diversified into foreign stock funds last year, the results 
were dramatically better: The average international fund rocketed 39.4% for the 
year, marking the first year since 1986 that foreign funds have outperformed 
U.S. stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual fund rankings, reported Tuesday by fund tracker Lipper Analytical 
Services in New York, will most likely gratify many of the small investors who 
channeled an unprecedented wave of cash into stock funds in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors also should realize that that cash wave helped create its own 
reward: As more money flowed into stock funds, fund managers pumped it into 
stocks, pushing the market up and thereby attracting new investors. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the market's powerful and broad advance is that not a single 
category of stock funds lost ground last year; the worst-performing category, 
environmental funds (which own stocks of pollution-control companies), rose 
3.4% for the year on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the bullish cycle can repeat in 1994 is anyone's guess, of course. In 
the fourth quarter, there were signs that fund managers themselves were growing 
wary of many high-flying growth stocks -- in such fields as telecommunications 
and gaming -- that had led the market earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 As the funds stopped buying those stocks, many of the shares sank -- which 
sparked a setback in the broader stock market in November. That, in turn, 
caused some small investors to turn skittish: Net new cash flows into stock 
funds fell 35% from October to November. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many Wall Streeters believe the stock market and thus many stock 
funds have at least an even chance of advancing again in '94, if the economy 
continues to grow without a sharp rise in inflation or interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most optimistic fund managers now warn that the market will be a 
much tougher game in 1994 and that a fund's performance will depend almost 
entirely on a manager's ability to pick the right stocks, rather than simply 
bet on riding the broad market higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, growth stock funds -- the most-owned category of funds -- may have 
provided in 1993 an early hint of what's to come: The average growth stock fund 
gained 10.6% last year, the poorest performance (relatively speaking) of any 
major fund category. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lipper, head of Lipper Analytical, said the problem for the growth 
funds was that many of those fund managers were unwilling to part with consumer 
products stocks in such fields as drugs, food and tobacco, even as the stocks 
crumbled because of rising competition and loss of brand-name pricing power. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12.5% average stock fund return, meanwhile, was a product of the 
continuing strong performance of smaller stocks. The average small-company fund 
rose 17%, the third straight year in which small-stock funds beat more 
conservative blue-chip funds, such as equity-income funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters believe small stocks are in the middle of a five- to 
seven-year cycle of outperforming blue-chips, as the economy's growth remains 
moderate -- an environment that is believed to be tougher on bigger companies 
than on more nimble and opportunistic smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the surge in international stock markets, fed in large part by U.S. 
investors' cash, is expected to continue in 1994, but not at the same torrid 
pace. And the potential for a temporary pullback in those streaking markets is 
extremely high, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the peasant rebellion in Mexico this week has provided novice 
international investors with their first taste of what can go wrong in thinly 
traded foreign markets. Mexican stocks plunged nearly 4% on Monday before 
rebounding somewhat Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many experts believe that international markets in general have better 
long-term prospects than the mature U.S. market. And given U.S. stocks' 
three-year run, investors may have little choice in their pursuit of higher 
returns than to target foreign stocks and other market niches that have only 
recently begun to rally. Hot Times for Gold, Foreign Funds ...

BIG THREE'S AUTO SALES SURGE 10.4%; CARS: DETROIT CONTINUED TO GRAB MARKET 
SHARE FROM THE JAPANESE IN 1993. ANALYSTS SEE THE TREND LASTING SEVERAL YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chrysler Corp. picked an unusual venue for a dinner during the Detroit 
International Auto Show this week: a comedy club in the Motor City's downtown 
theater district. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Robert Eaton delivered a serious but upbeat state-of-the-company 
speech Monday night -- followed by a clever skit with the Second City comedy 
troupe that had his audience laughing out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where people come to have fun," Eaton said. "And we at Chrysler are 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker has some company in Detroit. The Big Three -- all but given up 
for dead three years ago -- reported Tuesday that their 1993 sales increased 
more than 10.4% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, sales in America of both domestic and import vehicles climbed 8.5% to 
their highest level since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. auto makers continued to grab market share from their Japanese 
competitors. Just as important, there is growing recognition that the quality 
of U.S. cars and the efficiency of U.S. factories are at world-class levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations: Market trends will continue for several years, and auto 
sales should rise from 14 million last year to 15 million in 1994. Bullish 
industry officials expect sales of a record 17 million within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next two years can be seen as the years of the American car industry," 
said an admiring Helmut Panke, chairman and chief executive of BMW's U.S. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery in Detroit has come with remarkable speed. Just two years ago -- 
when Chrysler, Ford and General Motors together had operating losses of about 
$4 billion -- the Big Three embarrassingly went hat in hand to Japan with 
President Bush asking for trade concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is the Japanese who have long faces at the auto shows -- and the U.S. 
auto makers who are gloating. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick reversal of roles is as much a matter of circumstance and luck as it 
is the result of several years of gut-wrenching change and corporate 
soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the sales surge has been spurred by pent-up demand and aggressive 
marketing. The average car in use today is more than 8 years old. People simply 
need to replace aging vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower interest rates and mortgage refinancings have freed up cash, putting 
willing buyers in the showrooms. The companies are advertising "value" prices, 
offering vehicles equipped with lots of options at lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And all this interest in buying cars came just as the Japanese were being 
hampered by adverse currency fluctuations and economic problems in Tokyo. The 
yen gained more than 15% in value against the dollar before weakening slightly 
toward year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's rise forced up the price of Japanese cars, giving U.S. auto makers a 
price advantage of more than $2,000 on most competing models. Just last week, 
Toyota and Nissan raised prices again. 
</P>
<P>
 A severe recession in Japan has made matters worse. All the major Japanese 
auto makers saw income drop sharply last year. The problems at home were felt 
in U.S. subsidiaries, as management shake-ups and layoffs became commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverberations left their mark on the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three now control 74% of the U.S. market, up from 72.4% at the end of 
1992. The Japanese have a 23% share, down a point from the end of 1992 and down 
3 points from year-end 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler President Robert Lutz said Japan's share of the U.S. auto market 
could decline another 4% to 5% over the next four to five years. But others are 
more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese are in a little bit of an uphill struggle, but I do not for one 
second undersell their ability to react," said Richard Wagoner, chief financial 
officer of GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Toyota, Nissan and Honda are fighting back by moving more production 
to the United States to counteract the yen's strength. They are also luring 
customers with incentives and attractive financing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take an aggressive position with short-term leasing," said Richard 
Colliver, Honda's vice president of sales. Honda's sales were down 6.8% in 
1993, apparently dropping the company to third place among importers, behind 
Toyota and a resurgent Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are also being hurt because they sell few trucks -- the hottest 
and most profitable segment of the U.S. vehicle market. That segment, which 
includes minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickups, is dominated by the Big 
Three. Detroit's truck sales were up 16% last year; car sales were up only 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's truck sales shot up 19% in 1993, accounting for 48% of its total 3.6 
million in U.S. sales. Chrysler reported an 18% increase in truck sales, 
selling more than 500,000 minivans. GM's truck sales jumped 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford again counted the best-selling truck and car among its models: The 
F-Series pickup edged out Chevrolet's C/K pickup, and the Taurus sedan easily 
beat the Honda Accord for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Such news is apparent in Cobo Center, site of the Detroit Auto Show. The Big 
Three have held elaborate news conferences, highlighted by the latest video 
technology and gimmickry. The Japanese firms' announcements have been terse, 
somber affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even GM executives appeared optimistic. The company has lost nearly $18 
billion in North America since 1990. While it will report a loss in North 
America for 1993, the red ink has been sharply reduced, and GM promises a 
profit on the continent this year. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Smith, GM's chief executive and president, said sales and profit 
should improve in 1994 as the company continues to cut costs and introduces new 
products, including a redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier and new GMC Jimmy sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably no company is more upbeat than Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the auto maker announced that it will sell its subcompact Neon for 
a base price of $8,975. On Tuesday, Chrysler used a secret-agent spoof to 
unveil its new Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus, which will go on sale in the 
fall. An American Success Story 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit auto makers recaptured a chunk of the domestic market from their 
Japanese competitors in 1993, driving total U.S. car and truck sales up for the 
year.

JAMES FLANIGAN: LOOK TO THOMAS WATSON'S PAST FOR IBM'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Thomas Watson Jr., who died last Friday at 79, stepped down as chairman 
of IBM Corp. in 1971, the company that he and his father built had $8 billion 
in annual sales and $1 billion in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year by contrast, IBM had more than $60 billion in sales -- but losses 
estimated at $14 billion. In recent years, the decline of IBM -- a company that 
once seemed destined to rule the world of technology and business -- has become 
the stuff of mystery, a doctoral thesis or a novel waiting to be written. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Watson himself wrote the book that gives many reasons for IBM's rise to 
greatness as well as clues to its decline and possible hints about its future 
-- not to mention lessons for all business. It's called "Father, Son & Co.," a 
1990 book that is both a candid autobiography and one of the best business 
stories ever written. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who led IBM for almost 20 years, "had a very strong belief in the 
value of technology," says Jack D. Kuehler, who worked for 35 years at IBM and 
retired last year as its president. "He knew that a company had to sense change 
and go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson saw the first computer, ENIAC -- which later evolved into the Univac 
computers that today are products of Unisys Corp. -- shortly after World War II 
and realized that the speed of electronic computing would make IBM's 
electromechanical machines obsolete. So he led IBM into computers in the early 
1950s -- but not just into the field, to leadership of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, just as IBM was about to bring out a new computer, it learned that 
Univac's new machine would possess superior capabilities. So Watson rushed 
forward development of memory technology that had been planned for three years 
hence and had it running in IBM machines within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the 1960s, he bet the company on the System/360, a single computer 
design available in models renting for $2,500 to $115,000 a month. The effort 
to produce the 360 was grueling. Watson's book describes bitter arguments, near 
disasters and tough decisions -- one of which demoted and hurt Watson's own 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 360 was a wild success, and IBM began to pull away from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fascinating footnote to what might have been, Watson learned of a 
potential joint venture in the 1960s between Xerox and IBM, which he favored 
because he foresaw technological possibilities from a combination of copier and 
computer. But the venture had fallen through because of opposition from 
engineers in both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 That was unfortunate because Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center originated the 
basics of the personal computer -- the technology that ultimately undermined 
IBM, even though the company today sells more PCs than anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after Watson stepped down, following a heart attack at age 
56, IBM began to change. Chairman Frank Cary, who led IBM in the 1970s, 
perceived a threat from Japan and spent billions to stave off a computer 
invasion that never came because Japanese firms lacked the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer technology was moving too fast for Japan's large firms and soon it 
moved too fast for IBM. The Armonk, N.Y., company began to look upon each new 
development as a threat rather than an opportunity, says Bob Djurdjevic, a 
former IBM executive who now runs Annex Research in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 It missed on minicomputers in the 1970s and, more seriously, it missed the 
full implications of the personal computer which Apple brought out in the late 
'70s. IBM set up a separate unit to produce a PC quickly, using Intel 
microprocessors and Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company did not turn itself inside out, as it had for the 360. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it tried as much as possible to maintain comfortable cash flows from 
older products while giving only a defensive response to new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, IBM missed all sorts of technology. "The Sony video camera in the 
1970s was an electronic product and IBM could have had that technology -- with 
vast implications for today," says Paul Saffo of Institute for the Future, a 
Menlo Park research firm. "If IBM were awake on software, Microsoft would never 
have become the powerhouse firm it is today." 
</P>
<P>
 But yesterday's gone, what of tomorrow? Enthusiasm for IBM stock has been 
growing -- it rose again Tuesday to $59 a share, near a 12-month high but a 
fraction of the $175 a share IBM sold for in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors buying for earnings are likely to be disappointed. Analyst Steven 
Milunovich of Morgan Stanley sees IBM earning $5 a share in 1996, which makes 
$59 a generous price today. 
</P>
<P>
 The better possibilities lie in the technology in IBM's labs. "They lead in 
distributed databases, the kind that allow computers to talk to each other in 
airline reservation systems," says Kenneth Bosomworth of International Resource 
Development, a Connecticut research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And IBM has a software system, developed through a joint venture with Apple 
called Taligent, "that offers whole new ways of thinking about computing," says 
Kuehler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we had superior technology to complement our systems knowledge, our 
business skyrocketed," wrote Watson, who saw to it that the company kept ahead 
in a changing world. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether IBM's new chairman, Louis V. Gerstner, a 
former management consultant and head of RJR Nabisco who talks a lot about 
marketing, will pick up that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM shareholders should insist that he reread Watson's book.

HOT NEW ARENA FOR TAKEOVERS IS BANKRUPTCY; MERGERS: OPPORTUNITIES LIKE R.H. 
MACY & CO. ARISE AS SUITORS DEAL WITH -- OR BECOME -- CREDITORS OF DISTRESSED 
COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Going after a company that's under bankruptcy court protection -- as Federated 
Department Stores is doing with R.H. Macy & Co. -- isn't buying on the cheap. 
Experts say it's a complicated and costly way of doing a takeover, merger or 
acquisition, and one with significant risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, merger and bankruptcy experts alike predict a steady and increasing 
stream of such acquisitions, including takeovers that appear at first blush to 
be unwanted -- as in the Macy-Federated situation -- or downright hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 Why bother with the added legal expense of dealing with a company in Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection, with potential long delays and a court system known 
to have little patience for hostile advances? The answer is simple: 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy Court is the place to find vulnerable companies these days, said 
Paul S. Aronzon, an attorney who heads the bankruptcy practice of Milbank, 
Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in Los Angeles. "So much of corporate America has been 
put in the position of having a bad balance sheet," he said, "that this has 
become a natural arena to look for acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, he said, have been driven to seek Bankruptcy Court protection 
by the debt-based merger mania of the 1980s. Before that, an investor or 
company with money to spend probably wouldn't have gone through the trouble 
that dealing with bankruptcy court poses. Now, companies in financial distress 
are too plentiful to ignore, Aronzon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking control of a company when it's down on its luck is not new. Old Mr. 
Potter tried to do it to George Bailey's Building & Loan in "It's a Wonderful 
Life," and scions J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller actually succeeded in 
building their empires on the backs of others' misfortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the setting of the modern day Bankruptcy Court, such takeovers are 
just beginning to blossom. Mainly because of creditors, the group whose 
interests generally must be satisfied first in Bankruptcy Court procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some creditors become anxious when a company languishes in bankruptcy without 
developing a plan of reorganization and emerging from court protection. In such 
cases, it often is easy for those with takeover intentions to buy up the debt 
at a deep discount and gain standing with the court. Although it is not easy, 
said bankruptcy experts, creditors groups can now petition the court to end the 
bankrupt company's exclusive right to develop a reorganization plan and can 
propose one of their own -- one that could favor an outside suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearly two years, Macy's bankruptcy is "a little long in the tooth," said 
Jeffrey Chanin, president of Chanin & Co., a bankruptcy investment banking firm 
with offices in Los Angeles and Westport, Conn. "It's a complex, large (case) 
and as it starts pushing past two years, people . . . want a solution, their 
patience starts running out." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, other creditors are becoming more sophisticated and are able to use the 
bankruptcy laws to their advantage, said Ron Orr, a partner at the Los Angeles 
firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and head of its bankruptcy practice. Often, 
creditor groups may encourage competition for control of a bankrupt company, 
knowing that heightened bidding could raise the amount they get back on their 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeovers in bankruptcy, said Orr, could become a vital creditors' tool. "If 
Federated proceeds and looks like it has a possibility of winning, the Macy's 
management may try to cut a deal. Or, if Federated goes forward and succeeds, 
creditors in the future could threaten 'to do a Federated' " on other 
companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated, owner of Bloomingdale's and several department store chains -- and 
a chief competitor of Macy's in many Eastern cities -- purchased $449.3 million 
of Macy's debt from Prudential Insurance Co. of America and has an option on an 
equal amount. Owning some of Macy's $6 billion in debt essentially makes 
Federated an owner of Macy, but more importantly, gives it an opportunity to 
participate in structuring and approving its reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy so far has received Federated's interest coolly, as it previously has 
rebuffed other potential suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone considering an unwanted takeover of a company in bankruptcy has to be 
concerned about how negatively its attentions are perceived by the court. 
Bankruptcy judges have in the past have refused to allow some debt-buying 
prospective acquirers to participate in the reorganization process, questioning 
the good faith of the interloper's motives. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a seemingly hostile takeover can become friendly, if enough 
of the creditors come to favor the takeover terms. Such was the case in the 
reorganization of the Revco discount drug store chain, in which creditors 
ultimately sided with a group led by investor Sam Zell. The Zell Chilmark Fund 
also took over department store operators Carter Hawley Hale when it emerged 
from bankruptcy in late 1992, in a deal that was well received by Carter 
Hawley's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pitfalls, takeovers in bankruptcy will increasingly become a 
viable option, some attorneys said, for acquiring companies without the consent 
of management. Among the advantages is the general notion that it's easier to 
appeal to creditors than shareholders who were the focal point of takeover wars 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, potential suitors have an easier time getting a good look at a bankrupt 
company's innermost details, because of the extensive supportive documents a 
company seeking Chapter 11 protection must provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's for that very reason that James McTevia, a Detroit area consultant in 
business restructurings and bankruptcies, believes companies will try harder to 
restructure its finances without resorting to bankruptcy -- and risking a 
hostile takeover.

FLUOR LOOKS LIKE WINNER OF $300-MILLION MERCEDES BID; CONSTRUCTION: THE 
ENGINEERING GIANT WILL APPARENTLY GET THE NOD TO BUILD A FACILITY IN ALABAMA.

<P>
 Fluor Corp. has apparently won the coveted contract to build a $300-million 
auto plant for Mercedes-Benz near Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based engineering giant refused Tuesday to confirm its victory, and 
Mercedes said it will not make an official announcement until next week. But 
the German auto maker conceded that it has narrowed the competition to a couple 
of candidates, and one of those -- Rust International Corp. of Birmingham, Ala. 
-- said Mercedes has informed it that it is no longer in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received a letter on Dec. 21 notifying us that they would not be 
continuing discussions with us," Rust spokeswoman Jann Blitz said. "Of course, 
we are very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Fluor, the plant would be a showcase project -- a chance to show off its 
expertise on a prestigious job for a renowned auto company, said Mark Altman, 
an analyst with the brokerage Paine Webber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual size of the contract, however, is not that large. "It's a 
decent-sized contract," Altman said, "but certainly not a mega-contract -- 
especially when compared to the kind of contracts Fluor has been getting in the 
foreign market."

 Among its more lucrative deals in the past year, Fluor won a $1.5-billion 
contract to build an oil refinery in Belgium and a $1.3-billion contract to 
construct a refinery in Thailand. The company, which has rebounded in recent 
years after a severe downturn in the early to mid-1980s, earned a record $167 
million in 1993 on revenue of nearly $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes spokeswoman Linda Paulmeno said Tuesday that negotiations with Fluor 
are still under way and that "anything can happen." However, she noted that 
Fluor is in a strong position because it has already worked with Mercedes in 
scouting out a site for the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very good relationship with Fluor, so obviously that can help," 
Paulmeno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes chose Alabama in October from half a dozen states that courted the 
auto company with generous incentives. North Carolina proposed building a 
$35-million employee training center at the plant. Alabama matched the offer, 
though, and also agreed to pay workers' salaries while in training. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for completion late next year, the plant will be Mercedes' first 
U.S. factory to produce passenger vehicles. A Mercedes subsidiary, Freightliner 
Corp. in Portland, Ore., makes trucks for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes will build a new sport utility vehicle at its Alabama plant, which is 
expected to employ 1,500 people. The car -- designed to compete with Ford Motor 
Co.'s popular Explorer and Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Grand Cherokee -- will sell 
for between $20,000 and $30,000, making it the least expensive vehicle in the 
Mercedes lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of Fluor's new work orders last year came from outside the 
United States, spokeswoman Deborah Land said. However, U.S. contracts still 
represent 60% of the company's $14.7-billion backlog of projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strongest markets for new construction, particularly of energy-related 
facilities, have been in the Far East," analyst Altman said. "Domestically, 
market conditions are tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel, the core engineering and construction unit of Fluor Corp., has 
been involved in the construction of more than 60 automobile plants. Among 
those was a $660-million Nissan factory in Smyrna, Tenn., which Fluor built 13 
years ago, followed by a $450-million expansion of it in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 By U.S. auto factory standards, the Mercedes plant will be relatively small, 
assembling about 60,000 vehicles a year. "Typically, plants in the U.S. produce 
200,000 vehicles," said Michael Luckey, an automotive industry consultant in 
Woodcliff Lake, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "Production costs here are lower than in Germany, where unions are very 
strong," Luckey said. "This is a case study for Mercedes to see if it makes 
sense for the company to build more plants in the U.S."  
</P>
<P>
 News of Fluor's selection first appeared in a Birmingham newspaper Tuesday. In 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Fluor's stock closed at $41 a share, up 
50 cents. Accelerating Into 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor-Daniel appears to have won the contract to build Mercedes-Benz's first 
U.S. assembly plant. Details on the upcoming deal: 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Automobile assembly plant * Where: Alabama, between Tuscaloosa and 
Birmingham * Projected cost: $300 million * Top contenders: Fluor-Daniel and 
Rust International Corp. of Birmingham, Ala. * Groundbreaking: Set for late 
February * Expected completion: Late 1995 * Production start: Early 1997

 PUC Judge Blames Edison for Mohave Explosion: A proposed decision by an 
administrative law judge at the California Public Utilities Commission has 
faulted Southern California Edison for failing to take "reasonable steps" to 
maintain a steam pipe that broke in 1985 at the Mohave Generating Station in 
Laughlin, Nev.In the resulting explosion, 1,000-degree steam blasted through an 
employee lunch room and the plant's control room, killing six workers and 
seriously injuring 10 more. Edison, which owns 56% of the plant, maintains that 
a faulty weld made by the pipe manufacturer is to blame. If made binding by the 
commission, the decision would mean that Edison must charge shareholders, not 
ratepayers, for any costs associated with the accident.

 Red Adair Retires, Sells Firefighting Company: The most public of the Texas 
oil well firefighters has sold his Red Adair Co. to Lafayette, La.-based Global 
Industries Ltd., an oil production services company, for an undisclosed price. 
Adair, 78, said his 12-member staff will remain in Houston and continue with 
Global Industries, retaining the Red Adair name. Adair revolutionized the 
practice of controlling oil fires by introducing explosives and by drilling 
deep underground to cap the wells and deprive fires of fuel.

 Chiat/Day Wins Quaker State Account: The Venice advertising agency picked up 
$17 million in additional ad business from the Oil City, Pa.-based motor oil 
giant that has been handled since 1986 by New York-based Grey Advertising. 
Chiat/Day already handles the $8-million account for Quaker State Corp.'s 
Minit-Lubesubsidiary. The new campaign is expected to premiere in the first 
quarter of 1994, said Robert Cohen, executive vice president of marketing at 
Quaker State. Chiat/Day is expected to add to staff as a result of the 
additional business, but executives at the agency did not return calls to 
confirm that.

 BofA to Pay $37 Million in Maxwell Case: The San Francisco-based bank agreed 
to settle claims from a pension plan looted by the late publisher Robert 
Maxwell.Trustees for the pension plan of the Mirror Group newspaper company, 
which Maxwell once controlled, had been seeking $56 million each from Bank of 
America and Zurich-based Credit Suisse. BofA had acted as custodian for stocks 
held by the pension plans and passed them along to Credit Suisse as security 
for loans made to Maxwell's private businesses. BofA admitted no wrongdoing in 
agreeing to the settlement.

 Cedars-Sinai Executive to Resign: Sheldon S. King, president and chief 
executive of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center since 1989, will step down on Jan. 14. 
King, whose departure was not unexpected, is leaving to "pursue new career 
objectives," a hospital statement said.Cedars' board has elected Thomas M. 
Priselac, the hospital's No. 2 executive, to succeed King. A former chief 
executive of Stanford University Hospital, King had been rumored to be 
considering the top executive post at a Long Island, N.Y., hospital. But Cedars 
spokesman Ronald L. Wise said King has not disclosed what his next career step 
will be. Priselac, who was widely seen as King's likely successor, joined the 
900-bed hospital in 1979 as an assistant administrator and has held his current 
jobs as executive vice president and chief operating officer for five years.

CALIFORNIA SEEKS DELAY IN PRUDENTIAL CASE; SECURITIES: OFFICIAL TELLS FEDERAL 
JUDGE THAT AGGRIEVED INVESTORS ARE BEING PUSHED TO ACCEPT CLASS-ACTION 
SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contending that investors are hopelessly confused about their options, Gary S. 
Mendoza, California corporations commissioner, has asked a federal judge to 
delay a $120-million class-action settlement involving Prudential Securities' 
largest limited partnership program. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states are expected to join in the request to put off settling the 
litigation over Prudential's Energy Income Funds, a series of oil and gas 
limited partnerships in which 137,000 customers invested $1.44 billion between 
1984 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the investors suffered heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza sent a letter Monday to U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. in 
New Orleans, asking for a 90-day postponement of a Jan. 15 deadline by which 
investors must decide whether to participate in the settlement. State 
securities regulators in Missouri, Indiana and a few other states said they 
will probably join in California's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Private lawyers -- including John L. Grayson of Houston, whose firm represents 
more than 8,000 Energy Income investors -- contend that the early deadline will 
have the effect of stampeding investors into the settlement. Resolving customer 
disputes through that mechanism, the lawyers argue, is likely to be the least 
costly avenue for Prudential, while ensuring legal fees of up to $36 million 
for a small group of class-action lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current arrangement, Mendoza said in his letter, investors "have to 
review a set of settlement documents which are nearly incomprehensible to the 
average investor." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way for investors to calculate how much they would receive, he 
said. And they cannot compare the settlement to the sum they would get under an 
alternative procedure established under a separate agreement between Prudential 
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said a 90-day delay would give investors an opportunity to see the 
size of payments being awarded in the SEC settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlements followed allegations of massive fraud by Prudential in its 
sale of about $8 billion in limited partnerships. In October, Prudential agreed 
to the filing of SEC findings alleging that it misled small investors and for 
years failed to disclose massive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the two settlement mechanisms, Energy Income investors can chose to 
pursue individual arbitration or private lawsuits. Recently, a number of 
investors who filed for arbitration got all of their money back plus interest 
and, in a few cases, punitive damages as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless investors by the end of next week send in a form opting out of the 
class-action settlement, they will automatically lose their rights to choose 
the other options. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Dec. 30, only 5,753 investors had sent in the forms to opt out of the 
settlement, although many more are expected by Jan. 15, according to Edward A. 
Grossman, the lead class-action lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is greatly improved from one that was on the table at the 
beginning of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal -- which would have provided no more than $37 million in cash -- 
would have given investors only about 7 seven cents on the dollar for their 
losses. But Livaudais derailed it in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker & Parsley Petroleum subsequently bought the limited partnerships for 
$491 million. The proceeds from the sale, combined with about $650 million in 
distributions paid over the years by the partnerships, leave investors with 
only about $300 million in out-of-pocket losses. For most investors, the latest 
settlement would make good less than 30% of that remaining loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Grossman called the settlement a good deal for most investors 
and said it should go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our money will get paid to class members faster than going any other 
approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman also said he doubts that any Energy Income investors would be awarded 
interest on their losses under the SEC settlement procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irving Pollack, the lawyer hired to administer the SEC settlement, 
strongly disagreed. "If a person has a clear claim, he would get interest on 
his out-of-pocket losses," Pollack said.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY; COMPETITORS MATCH NORTHWEST'S 45% CUT IN DISCOUNTED FARES; 
TRAVEL: IN ANOTHER PRICE WAR, ALASKA LAUNCHES SALE IN RESPONSE TO PROMOTION BY 
RENO AIR.

<P>
 Major airlines Tuesday followed the lead of Northwest Airlines and cut 
discount fares by up to 45% for travel through much of the United States, 
Canada and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Steep fare sales are common in the winter, when travel drops off and airlines 
try to fill empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's January -- there must be an air fare war," said Thomas Nulty, president 
of Santa Ana-based Associated Travel Management. "The airlines can't get by 
without having one." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest discounts apply to travel between Jan. 18 and Feb. 16 and for 
flights Monday through Thursday. The discounts are smaller on other days and 
for trips between Feb. 16 and April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount tickets, which must be purchased by Jan. 11, require a Saturday 
night stay and must be bought at least two weeks in advance. The supply of 
discounted seats is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get (travelers) thinking about the sun and ski destinations they 
have been wanting to see," said Northwest spokeswoman Susan Halstead. 
</P>
<P>
 American, America West, Delta, United and USAir matched the Northwest sale to 
varying degrees. American, for example, applied the cuts to all its 
destinations in the continental United States but only to selective routes to 
Canada, Hawaii and the Caribbean where it competes with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sale, the price of a discounted, off-peak Los Angeles-New York round 
trip falls from $628 to $338 for travel by Feb. 16 and to $377 for trips 
between Feb. 17 and April 15. A Los Angeles-Dallas round trip -- normally 
discounted at $491 -- will cost as little as $282 through Feb. 16, then rise to 
$306. 
</P>
<P>
 In another air fare war, Alaska Airlines cut discount fares on many of its 
major routes in response to a promotion by Reno Air. The non-refundable 
tickets, which must be purchased by Jan. 18, include round trips between 
several Southern California airports and Seattle and Portland for between $159 
and $179. The sale applies to a limited number of seats and requires passengers 
to purchase tickets two weeks in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 Some travel agents said customers have grown accustomed to waiting for the 
post-New Year's fare wars before buying a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost gotten to be predictable, and that's a problem," said Ada Brown, 
owner of Seaside Travel in Long Beach. "When it's predictable, people wait."

AIRLINE INDUSTRY; CRAIB, FORMER CEO AT ALLSTATE, TAKES HELM OF THE NEW TWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald F. Craib Jr., retired chairman and chief executive of Allstate 
Insurance Group, on Tuesday was named chairman and chief executive of Trans 
World Airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 Craib, 68, will replace William Howard, 72, who joined the airline in July as 
it was preparing to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Howard said he 
resigned after his primary goal of getting the airline out of Bankruptcy Court 
was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chairman Glenn Zander, 47, who was responsible for the airline's finances 
and reportedly had been feuding with Howard, also resigned. He cited personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Craib, who has never before run an airline, has since August served on TWA's 
board as a representative of creditors. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance executive was chairman of Allstate from March, 1982, through 
October, 1986. Craib was also chairman of Allstate's Los Angeles-based 
Metropolitan Savings & Loan, now Sears Savings Bank, in the mid-1960s, and also 
managed Allstate's regional office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Craib, a UCLA alumnus, is a member of the board of the UCLA Graduate School of 
Management and a trustee of the UCLA Foundation.

BRISTOL-MYERS TO SLASH 5,000 JOBS IN NEW RESTRUCTURING; PHARMACEUTICALS: THE 
MOVE IS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE NATION'S THIRD-LARGEST DRUG CONCERN MORE 
COMPETITIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Tuesday that it will slash 5,000 jobs as part of 
a restructuring designed to make the languishing drug company more competitive 
in an increasingly difficult environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two years, 3,500 workers will be let go; 1,500 have elected to 
leave this year under an early-retirement program announced in September, 
Bristol-Myers spokesman Jon Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes little more than a year after the nation's third-largest 
pharmaceutical concern said it was trimming its worldwide work force by 6%, or 
about 2,200 jobs, amid pressure to keep the lid on drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers took an $890-million pretax charge in the 1992 fourth quarter to 
cover costs associated with those cuts as well as any future restructuring 
activities. Weisberg said that charge will adequately cover costs incurred 
under the new restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said in a statement that the restructuring, which will affect its 
four core units as well as its headquarters staff, is designed to "align its 
businesses with the changes taking place in the global marketplace and to 
improve its overall competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and investors generally applauded the move. "What they're now doing 
is overdue and absolutely necessary," said Neil Sweig, an analyst with 
Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers closed at $58.75, up $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But several observers questioned whether the restructuring goes far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is the last chapter in the book," said Paine Webber Inc. 
analyst Ronald Nordmann. "There could be additional head count reductions and 
additional business unit formations that would allow them to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
 As managed care increases its presence on the health care landscape, drug 
makers have been forced to cut prices and court large purchasers such as health 
maintenance organizations and other third-party payers who demand discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers said its U.S. sales force will be organized into 12 regional 
business units "supported by a strengthened managed care operation and a 
marketing staff with a structure which reflects the changing status of health 
care buyers in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the company's salespeople will now be able to offer a full range of 
Bristol-Myers products, rather than focusing on narrower groups of products. 
</P>
<P>
 Many industry observers have said Bristol-Myers has long been in need of a 
restructuring. Once a consistent performer with years of double-digit earnings 
increases, it now has flat sales and modest earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
 While the restructuring "eventually will be beneficial, none of it will save 
the bad year Bristol-Myers is going to report for 1993," Sweig said. Each of 
the company's core businesses -- pharmaceuticals, medical devices, 
non-prescription health products and toiletries and beauty aids -- is expected 
to either post a decline in sales of about 1% or gains of no more than 2%, he 
said.

 Mobil to Take Large 4th-Quarter Charge: Mobil Corp. said it will take a 
non-cash charge of $250 million to earnings because of "the recent dramatic 
decline in worldwide crude oil prices." In a news release, the company said the 
charge covers excess of inventory book value over current market values, 
reflecting the decline in crude and product prices since 1982, when Mobil 
adopted last in/first out accounting in its international marketing and 
refining operations.

 Chevron Workers to Get Bonuses: The San Francisco-based company said it will 
pay a total of $115 million in cash to almost all of its employees worldwide. 
The payments, which will equal 5% employee base pay for 42,500 workers, amount 
to $70 million after taxes and will be taken as a fourth-quarter charge. The 
company said the payments are being made in recognition of achieving what 
Chevron said is the highest shareholder return on investment from 1989 to 1993.

MCA BRANCHING OUT TO VIDEO GAME PUBLISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Inc. has formed a multimedia entertainment division to develop and publish 
video games and interactive software, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new business unit, Universal Interactive Studios, will be headed by Skip 
Paul, MCA executive vice president. Its first title, expected to be released 
within a few months, will be a CD-ROM game based on Steven Spielberg's 
blockbuster movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly all the major film studios have invested in software firms and 
started interactive units of their own in the last two years, Matsushita 
subsidiary MCA had previously limited its investment in the nascent multimedia 
industry to 3DO, a high-tech video game hardware firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone prudently and rationally into this area, as opposed to just 
throwing money at little investments in outside companies," said Paul, one of 
the few senior Hollywood executives who has had extensive experience in the 
interactive realm -- from his days at Atari during the first video game boom. 
"Our goal is to be a higher-end producer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul said that Universal Interactive will focus on producing software for the 
more sophisticated 32-bit video game systems that are just going on the market. 
These allow for more realistic graphics and near-broadcast-quality video. One 
of its main tasks will be to develop titles for 3DO, whose success depends 
largely on developing games that will be attractive enough to make consumers 
want to go out and buy the machines on which to play them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other titles in the works include several projects developed at an interactive 
"skunk works" set up at MCA's music group earlier this year -- such as 
interactive liner notes for Elton John's recently released album and a BB King 
CD-ROM. Robert Biniaz, MCA Music and Entertainment's senior vice president for 
business development, was involved in the skunk works and will be chief 
operating officer at Universal Interactive.

FED PLAN WOULD HAVE 2 BANK REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, responding to a White House plan for a single bank 
regulator, on Tuesday laid out a plan to replace the four regulatory agencies 
with two that would add 7,000 banks to the Fed's domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan is simple and straightforward and accomplishes the streamlining of 
the regulatory system without creating a monolith," Fed Gov. John LaWare said. 
</P>
<P>
 But top Treasury Department officials rejected the plan -- which was outlined 
by LaWare in a seven-page Fed proposal -- saying it would be wasteful and could 
cause confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House in November proposed merging the regulatory duties of the four 
agencies under a Federal Banking Commission, a plan that must be approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials blasted that idea, saying it would create a "monopolistic" 
regulator and hamper the board's ability to deal with a crisis, such as a stock 
market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said the Fed must have direct supervision over the movement of 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have some direct involvement in the supervisory process," LaWare 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed proposed that it oversee all state-chartered banks -- adding most of 
the 7,000 institutions now regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. It 
would continue to oversee bank holding companies and foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed currently regulates about 1,000 banks and about 6,300 bank holding 
companies. The Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates about 3,400 
national banks, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which governs about 1,700 
thrifts, would be merged into one agency for federally chartered banks and 
thrifts.

PACT COULD CUT GAS COSTS BY $1.5 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. said Tuesday that it has signed agreements with 
two major gas suppliers that could result in as much as $1.5 billion in savings 
to utility customers over the next 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility and its gas-supply affiliates will pay less for gas in exchange 
for lump-sum payments and flexibility in other terms for their suppliers of 
California offshore and Canadian natural gas, the utility said. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term net savings will cost the gas company $500 million counting 
payments to the suppliers and transporters and the cost of transferring some 
pipeline and gas treatment facilities to Exxon, which supplies gas to the 
utility from offshore California wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreements "are fair both to our customers and the supplier of this 
gas," said Richard D. Farman, chief executive of the gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Exxon confirmed the agreement but declined to disclose the 
size of the payment it will collect or any other terms. Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., 
the Canadian supplier, said it will receive a payment of $192 million and will 
lower the price at which it sells gas to the utility to rates competitive with 
U.S. gas sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, natural gas utilities across the country have renegotiated 
long-term supply contracts first signed during the 1970s, a period of high gas 
prices and occasional shortages. The original contracts left utilities buying 
gas at rates well above the current market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement is a direct result of an agreement orchestrated last 
fall by the state Public Utilities Commission between the gas company, several 
industrial customers and consumer groups addressing this and other energy cost 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is finally putting the matter to bed for SoCal Gas," said Yves 
Siegel, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.

AST RESEARCH SUES TI OVER ROYALTY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer maker AST Research Inc. has sued Texas Instruments Inc., alleging 
that Dallas-based TI has failed to honor royalty rights AST acquired when it 
bought Tandy Corp.'s computer division last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based AST alleged in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Santa Ana that 
it acquired the right to pay a reduced royalty on patents held by TI when it 
bought Tandy's computer manufacturing assets for $105 million in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in the wake of a patent lawsuit, Tandy reportedly negotiated a 
settlement with TI in which it won the right to pay smaller license fees than 
other companies, such as AST. Upon acquiring the Tandy unit, however, AST 
discovered that TI would not honor the same royalty terms with AST. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to pay the same rates as paid by our competitors," AST spokesman 
Emory Epperson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri West, a spokeswoman for TI, said the company could not comment because 
officials had not seen a copy of the lawsuit. She said the patents involved 
govern the ways in which a computer's brain, or microprocessor, sends or 
receives data from other computer components. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, TI holds basic patents that govern the diagnostic routine that 
occurs when a personal computer is turned on, West said. 
</P>
<P>
 AST did not disclose the amount of damages it is seeking. Epperson said the 
suit was sealed upon filing Monday because it contains confidential competitive 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said the suit alleges that TI violated federal antitrust laws governing 
anti-competitive practices and violated the California Unfair Practices Act. 
Both laws prohibit secret and discriminatory practices that give discounts to 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 AST also alleged that TI violated an AST patent and that certain TI patents 
are invalid. It did not provide more information. 
</P>
<P>
 The patents were the subject of lawsuits between TI and computer makers Tandy, 
Dell Computer Corp., Zenith Data Systems and Samsung Electronics. The suits 
were settled last year, and a suit against computer maker Daewoo was settled in 
1992.

BRIEFING BOOK: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; ANALYSTS SEE PLENTY OF LIFE LEFT IN 
SOUTHEAST ASIA'S STOCK RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: In 1993, billions of dollars' worth of foreign investment flowed into 
the bourses of Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
Investors who jumped in early enough last year saw some sweet returns. But will 
the joy ride continue in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: A few numbers tell a very compelling story. As of Dec. 28, Hong 
Kong stocks were up 110% in dollar terms since the beginning of 1993, while 
Philippine stocks had advanced by a head-turning 152%. The markets in 
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand posted gains of 50% to 80% during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 1993 rally relied very much on the flood of overseas mutual fund 
money, there are signs that local investors are starting to get into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Singaporeans poured millions of dollars into stocks last year, 
spurred by a government education campaign to encourage investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign coincided with a massive sale of stock in Singapore 
Telecommunications Ltd. that turned half the adult population into 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Many of these markets are pricey, thinly regulated and dependent on 
foreign money. And, while getting a piece of the growth in Southeast Asian 
markets emerged as a fad in global investing in 1993, already there are those 
who see a bust in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite wise to be sitting on cash right now," said Timothy Wong, an 
analyst at Vickers Ballas Investment Research. "I mean, how much more can it 
go?" 
</P>
<P>
 While matching the gains in 1993 will be a tall order, a number of analysts 
said they believe the stock rally in the region has plenty of life left. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the economies of Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia are 
all expected to grow between 5% and 8% in 1994, according to the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development's forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 And China, the world's fastest-growing economy, is expected to turn in a 13% 
advance in the year ahead -- compared to a projected U.S. growth rate of 3% and 
little or no growth through most of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, while price-to-earnings ratios -- a company's stock market price divided 
by its annual earnings per share -- certainly rose this year, the region's 
markets still offer some bargains. Analysts watch the figure because a high 
ratio may signal that a market is becoming too pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that the Hong Kong Hang Seng index, which more than doubled in value 
in 1993, has a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.12, according to calculations by 
Bloomberg Business News. That compares to the Dow Jones industrial average's 
38.72 and Japan's Nikkei-225's 65.63. Both Thai and Singapore stocks are also 
well below these figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some analysts see the increased involvement of local investors as a good 
omen for the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to liberalization in Singapore, Thailand has liberalized the 
domestic mutual fund market so commercial banks can launch funds. That should 
prompt more Thais, of whom only 5% have money in stocks, to shift into 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: To be sure, analysts warn that investors had better be selective, 
particularly about speculative stocks in markets such as Malaysia, where rumors 
can send stocks soaring and tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the speculation is turning on which companies will benefit from a wave 
of big-ticket projects in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are opportunities out there. . . . Given the size of these projects, it 
is certain to create a lot of opportunities for prices to run," said Phuah Eng 
Chye, research manager at PB Securities in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet given Malaysia's loose rules on company disclosures, investors are having 
a difficult time figuring out which companies stand the best chances of winning 
lucrative contracts.  
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, all bets could be off if Beijing mishandles China's runaway 
economic growth. Inflation is running a scary 20% in the major urban centers 
and 14.5% nationwide. If China were to tumble, the whole region would feel a 
chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, judging from the dazzling run-up in Hong Kong stocks -- 26% in December 
-- investors still seem plenty bullish on China and the entire Southeast Asia 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regional markets are helping pull us up here in Hong Kong," said David 
Lavington, institutional broker at Morgan Grenfell Asia. "Usually the market 
flattens out" in December, he said, but international investors seemed to want 
to get into Hong Kong before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If that kind of sentiment continues, Southeast Asian stocks seem sure to hover 
in the stratosphere well into 1994.

 Inflation Anxiety Scuttles Brazilian Bond Sale: For the third straight week, 
Brazil's central bank canceled its auction of benchmark bonds, or BBCs, because 
inflation-wary investors demanded higher interest than the bank was willing to 
pay. The bank is trying to reduce inflation anxiety by not accepting low bids 
on the bonds, analysts said.Brazil's inflation rate, as measured monthly by 
Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an academic research institute, was 38.26% in 
December. The rate for all of 1993 was 2,567%, the highest ever. Instead of 
selling the bonds, which pay predetermined returns for a fixed maturity, the 
government has borrowed one day at a time and issued dollar-linked treasury 
notes, securities with returns tied to the rate of inflation or value of the 
dollar.

 Czech GDP Expected to Shrink for '93: Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
revised an earlier forecast of about 1% growth in gross domestic product for 
1993 and said the GDP could instead fall as much as 1%, the Wall Street Journal 
Europe reported. Klaus said on Czech television that the decline would stem 
from the shock of Czechoslovakia splitting into Czech and Slovak states last 
January. The Czech GDP fell 2.2% in the first quarter of last year compared to 
the first quarter of 1992.

ANNUAL MUTUAL FUND REVIEW & OUTLOOK; SELECTION OF INVESTMENT 'HEDGES' LOOKS A 
BIT SCRAWNY; SAFEGUARDS: GOLD FUNDS PERFORMED WELL IN '93, BUT QUESTION OF 
CONTINUED DEMAND CLOUDS FUTURE PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With U.S. and global stock markets at or near record highs, many investors are 
beginning to ask the simple question: What if things go wrong when markets seem 
to be priced for everything going right? 
</P>
<P>
 That has sparked the search by some investors for a "hedge" -- an investment 
that might go up, or hold steady, if stock funds suddenly go down because of a 
jump in inflation and-or interest rates, or some international calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that hedges are hard to find for small players. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold funds were obviously a favorite hedge in 1993. The average gold fund 
rocketed 80.9% for the year, even though the price of gold bullion rose just 
17%. 
</P>
<P>
 If inflation does surprise everyone in 1994, gold will probably get an 
additional lift, says Victor Flores, manager of the United Services Gold Shares 
fund in San Antonio. Likewise, gold should benefit, at least temporarily, from 
any unforeseen international turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flores said he believes gold bullion has been moving up not on inflation 
fears, but on simple supply and demand: Third World consumers and investors 
have been boosting their gold holdings (often merely via jewelry purchases) at 
a time when gold mine production has been waning worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, if demand should trail off, and inflation doesn't materialize as a major 
problem in the United States and Europe, Flores says, the gold-mining shares in 
gold funds could be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stocks are expensive, but they've been expensive all along," he says. He 
figures that North American gold-mining shares' prices now anticipate a gold 
price of about $450 an ounce, compared to the current price of about $394. 
"Either you get gold to that price or the stocks come down," Flores says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other classic hedges, at least against inflation, are real estate and 
commodities. While there are stock funds specializing in equities in those 
fields, their use as hedges is limited, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural resources funds, the category closest to qualifying as a commodity 
investment, are usually heavily invested in energy stocks. The problem there: 
While other commodity prices have been rising recently, oil's price has 
plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, real estate funds could be helped if inflation returns and 
investors' appetite for real assets surges. But higher inflation would also 
mean higher interest rates. And many real estate funds own real estate 
investment trust shares, which are viewed as bond substitutes and thus get 
whacked when interest rates jump. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, for the average fund investor, there is no great universal hedge, 
says Michael Lipper of fund tracker Lipper Analytical. Except for plain old 
cash, that is. If you're really worried about stock prices, Lipper says, just 
cut back somewhat on your stock funds and keep an above-average portion of your 
assets in money funds. Non-Gold Hedge Funds? 
</P>
<P>
 Funds that specialize in natural resources and real estate might be ways to 
hedge against a return of inflation, but some experts say they're imperfect 
hedges at best. Recent performance of some funds in those groups:

ANNUAL MUTUAL FUND REVIEW & OUTLOOK; RED-HOT FOREIGN MARKETS REMAIN POPULAR; 
FUNDS: WHILE EVERYONE IS WORRIED, MANY EXPERTS SAY IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO BET 
THAT THE RUN IS OVER, AFTER JUST ONE YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 High, but going higher -- though maybe not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way many global fund managers view red-hot foreign stock markets' 
prospects for '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of American cash that poured into foreign stock funds last year 
helped make foreign stock gains a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 The average international stock fund posted a total return of 39.4% in 1993. 
And even the poorest-performing fund was up 20.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 While last year's huge overseas returns have everyone worried, many experts 
say it would be foolish to bet that the foreign markets' run is over, after 
just one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive stories of '93 remain positive for '94, analysts note: China's 
boom, Latin America's economic resurgence, and the eventuality of a European 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the simple issue of cash flow: After years of ignoring 
foreign markets, Americans have decided to think globally. That isn't likely to 
change, says Michael Stolper, a San Diego money manager and pension fund 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to be the game to play for several years," Stolper 
says. "Even if the U.S. market cracks, money is still going to go into non-U.S. 
markets," he said -- because U.S. investors know that many foreign economies 
are certain to grow much faster than the U.S. economy in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But have foreign share prices gotten ridiculously expensive? Richard 
Hazelwood, manager of the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund in Boston, advises 
U.S. investors to remember that the world is less a stock market than a market 
of stocks. Bargains and interesting growth opportunities may be less prevalent 
than a year ago, but they're still there, he argues -- for investors with a 
long time horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his favorite themes is what he calls the "spread of middle-class 
Western values": The desire to have a home, car and gadgets. "With that spread 
comes a lot of growth stocks," he says -- from utilities in Hong Kong to 
cellular phone firms in Malaysia to cement mixers in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Bryan Sudweeks, co-manager of the Montgomery Emerging Markets Fund 
in San Francisco, says critics fretting about the surge in Third World 
investing are forgetting that these are much bigger markets than even five 
years ago. In theory, that should make them more liquid and at least slightly 
less speculative. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Sudweeks concedes, "If you're taking less than a two- or 
three-year view . . . this is not the place to be." The Best, Worst of Last 
Year 
</P>

 Here are the 10 best-performing and 10 worst-performing general international

ANNUAL MUTUAL FUND REVIEW & OUTLOOK; FIDELITY MAGELLAN'S MANAGER SAYS THIS YEAR 
WILL BE TOUGHER 
</P>

<P>
 Jeff Vinik may have made managing the nation's largest stock fund look a 
little too easy in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fidelity Magellan fund, whose $30 billion in assets is nearly half again 
as large as the second-biggest fund, scored a 24.7% total return in 1993, more 
than double the 10.6% return of the average U.S. growth stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vinik is quick to warn that he doesn't expect to repeat that performance 
in 1994. "This is going to be a tougher year for me than 1993," he says. "I'm 
not a bear and I'm not a bull. I'm kind of neutral on the stock market now." 
</P>
<P>
 For Vinik, "neutral" just means he'll have to work that much harder to find 
decent stocks to fill out his huge portfolio, which usually contains 650 to 700 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinik says he scored big in 1993 on three fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Owning semiconductor stocks, such as Motorola, which rocketed on booming 
computer sales. * Picking smartly among blue-chips, especially industrials. For 
example, his rail and auto holdings jumped sharply, as did Sears and hospital 
manager Humana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoiding consumer products stocks, such as tobacco, drug and food issues, 
many of which plunged as they saw their product pricing power evaporate in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1994, Vinik says, he's keeping a large bet on energy, especially natural 
gas stocks, because he believes the supply-demand equation will continue to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 He has trimmed some of his semiconductor holdings, but he won't sell them out 
completely, he says. "I still think these stocks have a lot of life left in 
them over the next two to five years." 
</P>
<P>
 He also remains positive on such tech names as disk drive maker Seagate and 
software firms Lotus Development and Computer Associates. He owns IBM as a 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Among industrials, he believes Caterpillar and some other Rust Belt giants are 
good names to own for the next three years but concedes they could stall 
short-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Vinik has Magellan skewed in favor of stocks that would benefit from 
a stronger U.S. economy. The classic slow-economy plays such as drugs and foods 
may look like bargains to some fund managers, but not to Vinik. He views their 
loss of pricing power as an ongoing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So even if those stocks bounce higher in the short term, Vinik says, "I'm not 
going to buy bad (fundamental) stories."

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; INDICATORS POINT TO SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT AFTER HOUSING 
INDUSTRY'S 4-YEAR SLIDE 
</P>

<P>
 Welcome to 1994 -- the final year, if the pundits have it right, of a record 
four-year slump in Orange County's housing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers started looking a little less anemic and a little more positive 
early last fall with statisticians who track resales, new-home sales and 
sales-price trends all telling us that the month-to-month and year-to-year 
changes were mostly increases and, though small, were sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 Things still are a long, long way from the boom times of the 1980s, but at 
least, conventional wisdom has it, they get better every month. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most recent reports, from the Construction Industry Research Board, 
shows that in November -- typically a pretty slow month -- new-home builders in 
the county obtained permits for 349 single-family homes.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the highest November rate since 1989 and the eighth month of 1993 in 
which the number of single-family permits exceed the same month in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 11 months of 1993, the Burbank-based research board reported, 
builders in Orange County pulled permits for 3,963 single-family homes, up 19% 
from the first 11 months of 1992 and the highest January-through-November tally 
since 1989.

SIR SPEEDY TO OFFER PHOTO, DOCUMENT CD SERVICE; TECHNOLOGY: THE LAGUNA 
HILLS-BASED QUICK-PRINT CHAIN WILL JOIN WITH KODAK TO OFFER BUSINESSES AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO SLIDES OR VIDEOCASSETTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. plans to announce today that Sir Speedy Inc. will be among 
the first quick-print chains to launch a service that puts images and documents 
on compact disks for business presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak and Sir Speedy are betting that the Photo CD Portfolio system will find 
a ready market among companies that want an affordable alternative to slides or 
videocassette tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD system works this way: 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures and documents are scanned by computer, then arranged on disks. The 
data can then be organized in a number of ways for different audiences, with 
graphics as well as audio tracks of narrative and music added as desired. Each 
disk can hold the equivalent of 100 color photographs, 500 floppy disks or 
250,000 pieces of paper, Kodak and Sir Speedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Speedy officials said they have not yet set prices for the CD service. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak spokesman Paul McAfee said companies that now provide slide trays to 
their sales representatives could save money by switching to CDs, which he said 
are cheaper to reproduce. And the CD format can be customized, he said, so that 
the full version could be presented to a purchasing manager and a condensed 
version to a chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage of CDs over regular videocassettes is that quality does not 
erode with age and usage, McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD system is "a very inexpensive way to put together a custom 
presentation, with custom text and a variety of choices on how to play it 
back," McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Speedy, based in Laguna Hills, plans to make the Kodak CD technology 
available at 321 Sir Speedy and Copies Now shops nationwide, including nine in 
Orange County. Other chains will offer the CD system at about 30 locations 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The official announcement of the agreement between Kodak and Sir Speedy is to 
be made today at the MacWorld Expo '94 computer conference in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak, in conjunction with photo finishers, has had a system available for 
more than a year that allows consumers to put their photos on disk so they then 
can be viewed on TV screens by using a special player or on personal computers 
equipped with CD-ROM drive. Sir Speedy will take marketing of the technology a 
step further, setting up centers within its existing outlets to cater to a 
business clientele.

LAST PORTION OF PRESLEY LOAN IS PURCHASED; FINANCE: SALE OF B OF A'S SHARE OF A 
$340-MILLION LOAN PACKAGE IS A MAJOR STEP IN THE FIRM'S EFFORT TO RESTRUCTURE.

 Continuing its financial restructuring, Presley Cos. said Monday that Bank of 
America has sold the final portion of a $340-million loan package that provides 
the Orange county home builder with much of its operating cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach-based company said that Foothill Capital Corp. in Los 
Angeles and Pearl Street L.P. in New York have bought Bank of America's share, 
which totaled about $105 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two finance companies were among four such firms that acquired the first 
chunk of the loans, about $235 million worth, last May from two banks and a 
thrift. At that time, Presley won a two-year extension on the due date, moving 
it from this May to May, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in lenders does not increase the amount of interest that Presley 
must pay, a company spokesman said. Nor does it rescue the builder from its 
financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley said it has hired the investment banking firm of Bear, Stearns & Co. 
to act as a financial adviser and has formed a special committee to review 
proposed restructurings or other changes in the company's stock and debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the company nor its spokesman would comment on whether Presley 
directors are seeking a purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Cable, Presley's president, said the sale of Bank of America's position 
is a major step in his company's effort to restructure its debt and equity. 
Unlike banks, finance companies are not under pressure from federal regulators 
to resolve large loans to troubled companies. A Presley spokesman pointed out, 
though, that the company is current on its loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley, one of California's oldest and once one of its largest home builders, 
has been hurt by California's real estate slump. 
</P>
<P>
 It lost $22.3 million for the first nine months of last year, nearly double a 
$11.4-million loss for the same period in 1992. Its revenue slumped 37% to $20 
million for the period from $31.7 million for the previous year's first nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, with 39 sales offices, has master-planned communities and other 
projects in California, Arizona and New Mexico.

 Fourth-Quarter Improvement: Fourth-quarter new-home sales in Orange County 
were the best in four years as builders moved 1,770 homes and condos, according 
to the Meyers Group. The Newport Beach-based real estate consulting company 
counted 6,874 new-home sales in all of 1993 -- up from 5,972 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the phone book-size report into clients' hands fast, Meyers Group stops 
collecting data on Dec. 15, so the last two weeks of the year aren't included.  
</P>
<P>
 Setting that shortcoming aside, the report pegs the median price of an 
attached unit during the period at $154,900 -- up just under 1% from $153,912 
in the third quarter. The median price of a conventional single-family home was 
$269,990, down 1.1% from the third quarter's $272,960. 
</P>
<P>
 Price changes are accounted for by differences in lot and house size as 
builders switch the sort of housing offered as well as by the deals various 
developers got when they bought the land for their projects.

 What Does It Mean? Deciphering what the permit and sales increases mean, and 
predicting where things are going this year, will be the topic of the Orange 
County Building Industry Assn.'s inaugural meeting for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 dinner at the Irvine Marriott will feature economists Dennis 
Aigner, dean of the graduate school of management at UC Irvine; and James Doti, 
president of the private Chapman University in Orange and former director of 
its Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Both universities turn out annual forecasts of the county economy, and Aigner 
and Doti have been asked to share their thinking about what the future holds

 Positive Forecast: If you can't wait until the 17th, here's the future -- in 
brief -- from real estate economist Walter Hahn of Kenneth Leventhal & Co. 
accounting firm's Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the housing industry recovering, starting in the last half of the year 
and then going into a fairly substantial building mode for a couple of years as 
we catch up with the pent-up demand for housing that has gone unsatisfied 
during this recession. . . . What happens after every recession is that the 
economic uncertainty diminishes. When people aren't afraid for their jobs and 
their income so much, they go out, they form new households, they rent 
apartments and they buy houses, and all of a sudden you have this wave of 
demand that hits the market."

 Notes Sale: Newport Beach's Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. said Tuesday in 
that it sold $150 million in notes last week. The notes mature on Dec. 30, 
2023, and bear interest of 7.9%. Since mutual life insurance companies are not 
public and cannot offer stock, they raise capital by selling such notes.

FAMILY; SUPPORT IS KEY IN TEENS' LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worry less about the kind of friends your teen-ager hangs out with and more 
about providing a supportive home atmosphere, advises an Ohio State University 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, teen-agers who hang out with the "wrong 
crowd" are not at the highest risk of behavior problems, says Stephen Gavazzi, 
an assistant professor of family relations and human development who 
interviewed 60 teens and their parents and published the findings in the 
Journal of Adolescent Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens who believed that their parents were not supportive and were too 
intrusive had the most behavior problems -- regardless of the kind of friends 
the teens had. 
</P>
<P>
 When a family is not supportive, Gavazzi says, a peer group can have 
tremendous effects on development, especially if the teen-ager sees the parents 
as too intrusive. Parents becoming overinvolved in their teen-ager's life was 
cited as one example of intrusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best conditions . . . are when they experience a sense of both family 
intimacy and individuality," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 How? Strike a balance between helping teens and letting them be independent, 
he says. "Let them make mistakes," he suggests, emphasizing that he is not 
referring to major mistakes such as drug abuse. "Then be there to help them 
pick up the pieces." KATHLEEN DOHENY

VIOLENCE AND HEALTH CARE TOP THE AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN and LYNN SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Families can expect to find themselves at the vanguard of a number of other 
important trends in 1994. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A surge in local violence-prevention programs such as California's Wellness 
Foundation, which has funded the San Francisco-based Pacific Center for 
Violence Prevention. "Parents will see the discussion about violence becoming 
more sophisticated," said Darwin Farrar, the center's director. He said 
practical solutions will "either go to harsher penalties -- longer sentences 
and incarcerating more young people -- or toward alternatives to incarceration, 
particularly for the majority of kids who do not commit violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * An increase of self-help efforts to curb violence, such as ex-gang members 
mentoring youths. In many communities, parents will also hear their children 
talking about conflict-resolution programs in schools. To provide safety zones, 
some schools may stay open until well into the evening, or even seven days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * For divorcing parents, a national movement toward "parenting plans" -- 
mandated agreements on long-term child-raising strategies intended to replace 
the adversarial concepts of custody and visitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steadily increasing legal and judicial action on behalf of children. State 
legislatures, predicted Howard Davidson, director of the National Center on 
Children and the Law, will take pains to provide for adequate representation 
for children in court proceedings. Lawyers and judges, Davidson added, will 
ignore "at their peril" the fact that "proceedings that are about children will 
have to treat the children with the dignity and respect that would normally be 
accorded to parties in any lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 * On the health care front, aggressive lobbying to ensure that universal 
coverage for children is included in all health care reform packages. "Most of 
the nation's 9 million uninsured children are in families who work full time," 
said Eve Brooks, president of the National Assn. of Child Advocates in 
Washington, D.C. "Anything short of universal coverage will leave a lot of 
those kids out." 
</P>
<P>
 * In anticipation of the reforms, some family physicians are moving toward 
team-oriented, family focused treatment, rather than one-on-one doctor/patient 
relationships. A model program at the University of Rochester is one 
illustration of the effort to train family-focused physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * New recognition by health care professionals of the importance of including 
families in treatment strategies and decision-making. "Research has shown that 
including spouses and family in the treatment of medical illnesses increases 
the likelihood of people having better outcomes," said John Hutchins of the 
American Assn. for Marriage and Family Therapy in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 * Full-scale health care clinics for women, sponsored by the Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America, and located in schools and workplaces. Pamela 
Maraldo, the group's president, said these clinics would offer obstetrical care 
and diagnostic services. 
</P>
<P>
 * To accommodate crowded personal and professional schedules, a growing demand 
for flexibility in the workplace. Benefits that include flexibility in terms of 
hours, home office work or computer commuting will take on the importance of 
salary increases in attracting people to jobs, said Fran Rodgers, president of 
Work/Family Directions in Boston. Brad Googins, head of the Center for Work and 
Family at Boston University, agrees that in 1994, "Work/family will become less 
of a benefit and more of a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 * With continued corporate downsizing, Rodgers also foresees employers 
offering support seminars for families, looking at the effect on families when 
primary wage-earners lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A surge in volunteer activities by whole families, representing concrete 
efforts by families to address critical needs in their own communities. 
Virginia Austin, director of the Family Matters volunteer program at the Points 
of Light Foundation in Washington, D.C., said 1,000 families signed up for 
volunteer projects in Houston in 1992, the program's first year. Nationally, 
Austin said, "our goal is to increase participation by 30% in three years." 
</P>
<P>
 * A rise in the number of people older than 65 who have adult children 
dependent on them. Eileen Crimmins, a professor of gerontology and sociology at 
USC, said 14% of people older than 65 live with an adult child -- half of them 
because the child needs help or a place to live. Whereas a coveted American 
fantasy has elderly widows moving in with their children to be cared for and 
respected, "typically nowadays, it's you moving in with your mom," Crimmins 
said. By terms of this intergenerational restructuring, Crimmins explained, an 
aging mother provides "free lodging and meal service." ELIZABETH MEHREN and

STRETCHING THE FAMILY CIRCLE; BUILDING WALLS AROUND OUR LIVES HASN'T GIVEN US 
SAFETY OR PEACE OF MIND. THIS YEAR, EXPERTS SAY, WE'LL WORK HARDER AT BUILDING 
COMMUNITIES 
</P>

<P>
 In the "stucco wasteland" of Poway, one family had had enough of the 
isolation, the self-imposed but socially mandated nightly retreat behind the 
alarm system and the automatic garage-door opener. They lived in a house with a 
two-car garage, a wet bar -- and no front porch. They scarcely knew their 
neighbors, their mail carrier, or the kids who delivered pizza or the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Feverishly, they dug up the front yard and installed a courtyard, a sort of 
outdoor living room. Almost instantly -- magnetically, it seemed -- grown-ups 
from nearby houses were depositing themselves in the Adirondack chairs 
scattered about the neighborhood's first real gathering spot. Children 
congregated on the low stone wall that begged them to climb on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like their own personal 'Field of Dreams,' " recalled San Diego writer 
Richard Louv, who supplied this example of how American families, vintage 1994, 
are striving to create organic support systems that weave them into a 
super-extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 Louv -- author of "Childhood's Future," "FatherLove" and, most recently, "101 
Things You Can Do for Our Children's Future" -- joins a growing list of child 
advocates and family-watchers who see 1994 as a time of major realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Families, they contend, are overlooking conventional boundaries as they reach 
outward in search of connection. The overused word community may make people's 
eyes glaze over, yet common ground is definitely one keen goal. So, however, is 
a passionate yearning among families for a sense of safety and security that 
extends beyond their own triple-locked front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, said Susan Nall Bales, director of children's programs at the Benton 
Foundation in Washington, D.C., "We're restirring the pot, rethinking the 
question of what kind of environments we want to provide for our families and 
for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost daily, organizations spring up as part of a vast, if still shapeless, 
family movement. Although lacking a unified voice or single leader, these 
groups represent a powerful numerical force that collectively recognizes the 
concerns of people who live together in an assortment of configurations. 
</P>
<P>
 In their efforts at advocacy, many of these groups are displaying a degree of 
political astuteness that some government leaders might find unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues pertaining to children and the family have traditionally been seen as 
soft and politically expendable, and family advocates were viewed largely as 
unsophisticated and disorganized. But as 1994 begins, these crusaders for 
family interests are entering the fray with new confidence and an agenda that 
politicians will have trouble ignoring. More than anywhere else, these 
advocates are expected to direct their energies to the two towering issues of 
health care reform and violence prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they will approach their mission with a clearer sense of their 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advocates for children and the family used to think we were speaking for some 
small percentage of our society. We thought in terms of categories, 
constituencies, the woes of the day," said Jack Levine, director of the Florida 
Center for Children & Youth in Tallahassee. "Well, we were naive. The 
population for whom we are advocating is 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of how the family movement is mobilizing, Levine said his group 
helped to register 60,000 new voters at Florida child-care centers, hospitals, 
nursing homes and schools in 1993. For 1994, his goal is to add 250,000 new 
voters. Just to make sure elected officials don't overlook this voting bloc, 
"We're going to have banners at our child-care centers saying 'This is a 100% 
voter-registered child-care center.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency, or backup, child care will be a top priority in the coming year's 
discussion of family-centered issues, said Barbara Reisman of the Child Care 
Action Coalition in New York City. Reisman also advocates including a training 
program for child-care workers in President Clinton's national service program. 
</P>
<P>
 Books in 1994 will pay more attention to issues pertaining to children's 
mental health, said Toni Burbank, executive editor of Bantam Books in New York. 
"We're seeing children much more as individuals. There's less of a sense that 
children are these blank slates on which their parents write." 
</P>
<P>
 In business, said Pamela Maraldo of the Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America, organizations and systems are relying less on traditional hierarchies 
and superstructures. In 1994, Maraldo said, that same boundary-less notion will 
apply to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 This means a widening acceptance of the kind of nonbiological family ties that 
occur when older people who are widowed choose to live together, or when single 
parents affix an additional adult to their household. "In some cases, you may 
find friendships replacing the traditional nuclear family," Maraldo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay households have become so commonplace that many experts now list them 
under the "nuclear family" umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as the definition of the family widens, so does its focus. "You'll see 
families taking on issues like how wide the sidewalk is in a new development," 
said Louv, who has interviewed thousands of families for his research. Families 
may begin to look harder at the physical structures of their local schools -- 
how safe are those drainpipes? -- as well as the "family friendly" quality of 
day-care centers and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will begin to look more inclusively toward the next generation as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see a growth in things like mentoring for someone who is not 
your own child," said the Benton Foundation's Bales. 
</P>
<P>
 In homes with adolescents, a sense of safe haven will be central in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are realizing that most of our communities and organizations and 
schools have not responded adequately" to the growing number of adolescents who 
are unsupervised in the after-school hours, said Ruby Takanishi of the 
Washington, D.C.-based Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel more concerned because of the growing fear of violence," she 
said. "But there's also a kind of shift going on in the kind of space -- 
physically and emotionally -- that adolescents really need." 
</P>
<P>
 One well-known after-school pastime is sitting in front of the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children are watching a lot of television, and often not watching what we 
would want them to," said Alice Cahn, director of children's programming for 
the Public Broadcasting Service. Children are also becoming much more 
sophisticated about the interactive and other technological aspects of 
television, Cahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that "TV is not going to go away," Cahn said parents are finding 
"new ways to use that television with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, parents continue to feel a nagging apprehension about their kids' lives 
in 1994. Most of all, Levine said, parents recognize that the phrase "at risk" 
no longer applies to a narrow segment of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents understand that if their children are OK, then the children next door 
to them are not," Levine said. "There are no moats, no drawbridges." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This frustration translates to an unprecedented level of anger at those in 
authority, Levine said. "We are looking around for folks to explain why, for 
most families, the American dream has become an American joke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With few answers forthcoming, "my phone log is fat with parents calling for 
marching orders," Levine said. "We know that either you do politics, or it gets 
done to you." 
</P>

 In California, one of the key parental issues on the 1994 legislative calendar 
is a bill that would make parents liable for up to $10,000 of damage caused by 
their children through robbery, graffiti or other vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in Los Angeles will also be dealing with the effects of a recent 
decision by the California Supreme Court upholding a Los Angeles ordinance that 
imposes jail time or a $2,500 fine on parents whose children are truant or 
delinquent. Michael Tranbarger, special assistant to the Los Angeles district 
attorney, said his office is looking at stricter enforcement of curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we're not only going to see in Los Angeles County but, I 
suspect, around the state," Tranbarger said. "This is really crime prevention 
-- getting parents to take responsibility early for things like curfew and 
truancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, parents will closely watch congressional debate on the 
reauthorization of Head Start, said Reisman of the Child Care Action Coalition. 
Welfare reform will also take a top priority, Reisman said, cautioning that 
"child care is a critical, critical component of any successful welfare 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes may be international in scope as well. Howard Davidson, director 
of the National Center on Children and the Law, predicts that President Clinton 
will sign the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. So far, 
leaders of 141 countries have signed this document defining government 
obligations to children in terms of international law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the signing would be a symbolic act, pending Senate action would make 
the measure legally binding in the United States. Davidson said U.S. 
participation in the accord would show a renewed commitment to the concerns of 
children around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a demonstration that we really care about children in that we want to 
become a part of the world community's efforts to advance the rights of 
children," he said.

DOES RAPE IN WORDS EQUAL RAPE IN DEED?; MEDIA: A CRITIC'S BLUNT REPLY TO AUTHOR 
CATHARINE MACKINNON'S ASSERTION THAT 'TO SAY IT IS TO DO IT' IGNITES A FUROR 
OVER FACT AND FANTASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID STREITFELD, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Words can be just as evil as deeds, influential anti-pornography theorist 
Catharine MacKinnon asserts in her new book, "Only Words." 
</P>
<P>
 "To say it is to do it, and to do it is to say it," writes MacKinnon, who 
argues that pornography causes sexual violence and therefore should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 So when reviewer Carlin Romano, writing in the Nation, provocatively raised 
the idea of raping MacKinnon to prove that thoughts and deeds do differ, her 
response followed quite naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a public rape," MacKinnon said Monday. "What Romano did was place me 
in the position of a raped woman so that he had me where he wanted me. . . . 
All women are hurt by this. It changes the public boundaries for the treatment 
of women." 
</P>
<P>
 Romano responded: "She's gone from saying pornography is rape to saying book 
reviewing is rape. Catharine MacKinnon's mind is one long slippery slope." 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven weeks since the review appeared, it has mushroomed into an 
increasingly vituperative cause ce le bre that mirrors the larger debate in 
feminist, legal and journalistic circles about pornography and the First 
Amendment. Romano's review, although it contains nothing salacious, has become 
for some feminists a symbol of those who just don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing here is the increasing penetration into the mainstream 
media of what previously was only done by pornographers," MacKinnon charged. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not exactly defenseless, however. A number of groups and individuals 
have taken up her cause, at least one of them at her invitation. First 
Amendment fan Nat Hentoff, whose surname was appropriated in Romano's review as 
one of her fictional assailants, received a letter from MacKinnon. "Please 
disavow this rape of me in your name," she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentoff complied last week with a Village Voice column headlined "The Public 
Rape of Catharine MacKinnon." He wrote: "The rape -- hypothetical or fantasy or 
whatever -- was a rape. . . . Romano deliberately, cruelly, set out to debase 
Catharine MacKinnon's person, along with her ideas. It was not a rape that will 
land him in a cell, but his name will be connected with it for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's a promise made by Jeffrey Masson as well, in a letter that was sent to 
Romano but which has enjoyed ample circulation among interested parties. Masson 
-- a writer who has become best known for his libel case against New Yorker 
writer Janet Malcolm -- rose to defend the woman he lives with. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is ever anything I can do to hurt your career, I will do it," Masson 
wrote, adding that he wanted to grab, shake and hurt Romano in the same way the 
critic imagined hurting MacKinnon. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, MacKinnon echoed that sentiment: "I do think Carlin Romano should be 
held accountable for what he did. There are a lot of people out there and a lot 
of ways that can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Romano began his review of "Only Words" with this dramatic sentence: "Suppose 
I decide to rape Catharine MacKinnon before reviewing her book." 
</P>
<P>
 This begins a complicated conceit in which he decides not to rape her ("People 
simply won't understand"), and instead does "the next best thing: I imagine the 
act." 
</P>
<P>
 He then supposes that he writes a "savage, pornographic" review, based on his 
fantasy. Meanwhile, another critic is also assigned MacKinnon's book for 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 This fellow, given the suggestive name of Dworkin Hentoff after two prominent 
defenders of the First Amendment, "concludes that he too needs to rape 
Catharine MacKinnon before properly evaluating her book." Unlike Romano, he 
actually does it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Romano and Dworkin Hentoff are arrested for rape. Not fair, points out 
the jailed Romano: All I did was imagine it. Dworkin Hentoff really did it. But 
in MacKinnon's world, both are guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the real world, Hentoff said he wasn't crazy about being tagged as a 
rapist, even in a hypothetical example in a book review. "The son of a bitch 
should have asked me as a sort of common decency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Dworkin" side of the rapist, meanwhile, has been variously attributed to 
MacKinnon colleague Andrea Dworkin or MacKinnon opponent Ronald Dworkin. Romano 
denied that it was meant to suggest either. 
</P>
<P>
 The critic's review, after its unusual opening premise, accuses MacKinnon of 
having "a sensibility so soaked in gender hatred, and so convinced of foolish 
generalizations about male psychology, that she threatens to become the Lyndon 
LaRouche of sexual-discrimination law." In addition, he calls her reasoning 
"often specious," her empirical claims "often suspect" and her values dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Romano, book critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer and a visiting fellow at 
Harvard, said he anticipated a strong reaction to the review. "I just hoped 
some of it would be more subtle. . . . Let's not forget my offensiveness was a 
response to her offensiveness about men in 'Only Words.' I at least treated her 
as a thinker in my review. She treats men as spare parts attached to penises." 
</P>
<P>
 He also accused her of trivializing. "Real rape seems unimportant when the 
word gets watered down," said Romano. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded MacKinnon: "He's just using raped women to cover himself. That's 
really offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation has gotten at least 50 letters about the review, had five 
subscriptions canceled and received demands for an apology from at least two 
men's anti-pornography groups. The review was the lead-off piece in the Nov. 15 
Fall Books issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Romano isn't the only critic to attack "Only Words." In fact, the book has 
been widely vilified.

BILL WOULD BAR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AT STATE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a resounding rebuff last year, an Orange County assemblyman announced 
Tuesday that he will push anew a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from 
attending California's universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said he felt the tide of public opinion 
had turned on the immigration issue, giving him hope the Legislature would go 
along with efforts to require that only legal residents be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who say we're just beating up on illegal aliens are missing the 
point," Conroy declared during a Capitol news conference. "What I'm concerned 
about is my grandchildren, whether they're going to have a place in our 
university system. Handing out our tax dollars is great when we have a lot of 
money, but we've run out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill, which stalled in committee last year, would appear to once again 
be headed nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Assembly Higher Education Committee scuttled legislation 
authored by Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) that is virtually 
identical to Conroy's bill. The same committee is expected to take up Conroy's 
measure next week. 
</P>
<P>
 During the committee hearing, Democrat lawmakers attacked the proposal to 
screen out illegal immigrants as inflammatory, unnecessary and bigoted. 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) took particular exception, 
calling the idea "morally reprehensible" and suggesting that "providing an 
education makes them more likely to contribute and not be on the public dole." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott P. Plotkin, governmental affairs director for the California State 
University system, said winnowing out illegal immigrants is administratively 
difficult and defies the traditional methods for selecting students -- academic 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in becoming agents of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy and other immigration reformers see the issue more simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, no one should be in the country illegally, they note. As 
such, they argue, illegal immigrants should be barred from tapping public 
programs, which serve as a powerful magnet to lure people across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend the illegal immigrants who attend California universities 
are unfairly taking spots when there are not enough openings for legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how many college students in California are illegal immigrants remains in 
doubt. Conroy and other advocates for stricter entrance screening say illegal 
immigrants may number more than 14,000 in state colleges and universities. If 
so, taxpayers are paying more than $50 million a year to subsidize those 
students, they estimate.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not peanuts," said Alan C. Nelson, director of the Federation of 
American Immigration Reform, which is sponsoring Conroy's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, former INS commissioner during the Reagan Administration, contends 
state university officials have repeatedly "stonewalled" any attempts to review 
their enrollment numbers and practices concerning illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 About $9.7 billion was budgeted for higher education in the state this year.

WED FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, BUT IN SECRET; FEES: COST OF A CONFIDENTIAL 
MARRIAGE LICENSE, BOUGHT BY MORE THAN HALF THE COUPLES APPLYING TO WED IN 1993, 
WILL GO UP $8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past two decades, thousands of couples have been paying the county to 
keep their marriage licenses a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are varied, and most unromantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Most seek to avoid the blood tests required for public marriage licenses, 
while others in longtime relationships enjoy the speed with which the licenses 
can establish community property rights and the ability to file joint income 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But until Tuesday, when the Board of Supervisors increased the fee for this 
brand of privacy by $8, few top officials in county government even knew the 
confidential license option existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before voting on the fee increase, board Chairwoman Harriett M. Wieder 
had to ask County Clerk Gary L. Granville for a quick explanation of the law, 
which has been on the books since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the betrothed, however, the secrecy provision has never been more 
popular. In 1993, Granville said, more couples -- 9,824 -- paid for 
confidential licenses than for those that are public information. 
</P>
<P>
 "For unmarried people who have been cohabiting for a long time, it's 
convenient for them to establish their community property rights without having 
to go through the trouble of getting a blood test," Granville said. About 80% 
of the people applying for the licenses list the same address as the person 
they intend to marry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the cash-strapped county is now taking advantage of this 
trend by increasing the price of confidentiality from $59.25 to $67.25. The 
money will pay for additional programs aimed at quelling family violence. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the fee increase is expected to raise about $73,000 for the 
county's Domestic Violence Program Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, none of the (couples) will have to seek the services of those 
programs," Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the popularity of the secret licenses, Granville said there has been some 
concern expressed by his colleagues throughout the state about allowing couples 
to skip blood tests, especially given the spread of the AIDS virus. Under state 
law, AIDS testing must be offered by the doctor or technician when a couple 
applies for a conventional marriage license, but the couple has the option of 
refusing that test. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Granville said, couples seeking confidential licenses are provided 
with health information addressing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that government should serve the wants of the people," 
Granville said. "At that stage, I think people should be able to make decisions 
for themselves. They are consenting adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for some, the confidentiality doesn't always extend to divorce 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In divorce, it all hangs out," Granville said. Marriage Secrets While the 
total number of marriage licenses issued in Orange County has declined about 
10% since hitting a five-year high in 1990, the number of confidential licenses 
has increased steadily: 04,06,10,14,08 Standard Confidential Total 1989 14,718 
6,379 21,097 1990 13,451 8,388 21,839 1991 11,025 9,450 20,475 1992 10,446 
9,777 20,223 1993 9,792 9,824 19,616 How They Differ 
</P>
<P>
 Standard licenses 
</P>
<P>
 * Are public record 
</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>

issuing county Trend 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of confidential licenses has risen steadily in the past five 
years. Today, half of all marriage licenses are confidential.

DANA PARSONS: IT ISN'T ALL DUCKY FOR EISNER AS EURO DISNEY LAYS AN EGG

 Michael Eisner made $550,000 last year . . . per day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, Bunky. A half-million bucks every day, just for showing up to 
run the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like he had to be Roseanne and Tom Arnold's personal valet. Now, that 
would be earning $200 million a year the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Eisner is steamed. He'll deny it publicly, but confidential internal 
Disney memos show that he is fuming over not receiving a bonus in addition to 
his other income.

 Dear Mr. Eisner:

<P>
 Thank you for stating your position so succinctly in your April 6 memo. Your 
sentiments are understandable, and we on this end wish we could greet them with 
better news. As you know, your bonus package is tied to return on shareholder 
equity, and projections are that the company will not meet the pre-agreed 
return level. Mid-year projections are that company revenues will drop 
considerably this year, due primarily to Euro Disney. After opening to much 
fanfare, the park has since gone into the, to use the vernacular, toilette. Who 
would have suspected the French would be so tight with a buck?

the season hasn't even started yet. I'm begging you, forget about France. Think 
Anaheim.

 The committee senses the anguish contained in your Aug. 4 memo. However, by 
our calculations, you will earn $200 million in 1993, even without a bonus. We 
spent many long hours among ourselves and couldn't come up with any scenario in 
which a human being could possibly spend that much money, even in a lifetime. 
The committee hopes that information softens what we know has been a trying 
experience for you.

 We apologize for not replying more quickly to your memo dated Oct. 19, 
regarding our calculations. What we feared might happen has happened. The 1993 
bonus you so eagerly anticipated and richly deserve is, how shall we say it, 
"out the window." Hoping this does not affect your earlier promise to us for 
free Ducks tickets, we wish you every success during this difficult period and

 You will live to regret your memo of Nov. 30. So, it's "out the window," is 
it? Aren't you the clever ones? I was particularly amused by your apparently 
serious reference to free Ducks tickets. Hear this: Donald Duck will score a 
power-play goal before you so much as look at a free ticket.

COUNTY TARGETED IN U.S. PROBE OF GUN TRADE; VIOLENCE: FEDERAL AGENTS TOLD TO 
STUDY WEAPONS TRAFFICKING IN 10 HIGH-CRIME AREAS. LOCAL OFFICIALS WELCOME 
EFFORT BUT DOUBT IT WILL HELP.

 Naming Orange County as one of 10 areas nationally with the biggest crime 
problem, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Tuesday said he has directed 
federal agents to try to determine the source of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Bentsen said he has 
asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to study gun trafficking 
patterns in the 10 localities, which also include Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen cited a Justice Department study that found that those 10 areas 
account for 23% of the nation's felonies. Senior Treasury Department officials 
said the study would seek to determine whether guns are being brought into the 
areas by individuals or organizations and where they originate. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement officials said they welcome the effort but 
believe it's a nearly impossible job. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Lt. Bob Helton, spokesman for the Santa Ana Police Department, 
said: "If you're trying to develop some kind of a trail, that's going to be a 
very difficult task. In my experience, many criminals aren't willing to give up 
the source of their guns, because they may want to go back to the same source 
in the future, or they're afraid of being labeled a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bentsen named Orange County as one of the top crime areas of the 
country, U.S. Department of Justice studies show that the county has fared much 
better than other suburban counties with populations of 100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the total number of crimes per 100,000 population actually 
fell from 1982 to 1992. But violent crimes -- murders, rapes, serious assaults 
and armed robberies -- shot up 61%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, overall, the county's crime rate matched the nation's norm, while 
Los Angeles had a crime rate much higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the three California counties selected for study, the other areas 
named by Bentsen on Tuesday are Cook County, Ill.; Harris and Dallas counties 
in Texas; Maricopa County, Ariz.; Wayne County, Mich.; Dade County, Fla., and 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's announcement came as he called for a nearly tenfold increase in gun 
dealer license fees as a step toward tightening federal controls over gun 
purchases. But he conceded that the proposal deals with at most a third of the 
nation's weapons sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, a self-described lifetime gun owner and hunter, said hiking license 
fees would weed out as many as 80% of license holders, who Clinton 
Administration officials say acquire the permits solely to take advantage of 
tax breaks and manufacturers discounts or to ship weapons across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of such licensees has caused serious problems for the 240 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms inspectors responsible for 
policing the industry, said Bentsen, whose department includes the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen acknowledged that the higher fees would have limited effect because 
only one-third of the nation's guns are purchased through the 284,000 licensed 
dealers. He estimated that the other two-thirds come from off-the-street sales, 
from criminals who trade drugs for guns or steal them during burglaries, from 
black markets and flea markets and children who get them from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "No law enforcers -- not 400, not 4,000, not 400,000 -- can stop that," 
Bentsen said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 1 RESIDENT INJURED IN MOBILE HOME FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 48-year-old man was treated for smoke inhalation early Tuesday after a fire 
broke out in the bedroom of his mobile home and spread to the attic, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 3:30 in a coach parked in the Friendly Village Mobile 
Home Park, 5815 E. La Palma Ave., said Anaheim Fire Division Chief Steve 
Magliocco. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which took 22 firefighters 30 minutes to bring under control, 
caused about $40,000 in damage to the mobile home and destroyed an estimated 
$20,000 in contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mobile home was well involved by the time firefighters arrived," 
Magliocco said. "There was a lot of fire. Mobile homes traditionally keep fire 
in so they burn pretty hot, almost like little furnaces." 
</P>
<P>
 The resident, whose name was not released, was treated at Kaiser Permanente 
Hospital-Orange County in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is doing fine and it doesn't look like there will be any long-term 
problems," Magliocco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which remains under investigation, did not damage any other homes in 
the park. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TRAIL TO BE DETOUR-FREE UNTIL APRIL 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana River Trail, heavily used by bicycle riders, walkers, joggers 
and horseback riders, will be open without detours from the ocean to Yorba 
Linda during a three-month construction halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the midst of a $1.4-billion project to 
provide better floor protection along the river. The project, to be completed 
by 2000, has included rerouting parts of the 26-mile trail to permit 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corps on Jan. 1 halted construction for the winter and is not expected to 
resume work until April 1, said Terrie Medeiros, Orange County Environmental 
Management Agency project manager for the lower Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Bicycle Coalition, which has monitored the safety of the 
detours, plans a public bike ride Saturday to celebrate the three months of no 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encourage everybody to get out and enjoy the trail," said Paul 
Pirtle, vice chairman of the group. "It's been closed so long in so many 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bicycle Coalition riders will meet at 10 a.m. at Suburbia Park in Costa 
Mesa, on the south side of the junction of the river and the San Diego Freeway. 
Both short and long bicycle tours will be available to any bikers between 10 
a.m. and noon, said Don Harvey, chairman of the Bicycle Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials estimate that at least half a million people use the trail 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent detour sent people through Fountain Valley streets. Some 
county bicycle enthusiasts argued that the detour -- sending users along 
Talbert Avenue, Newhope Street and Edinger Avenue to avoid construction -- was 
dangerous. Bike riders suggested a path could be temporarily made in the river 
bed itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials rejected that idea, saying a trail through the 
construction area would be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Medeiros said there is now pavement on the east side of the river bank that 
varies from 10 to 12 feet. On the west side, to accommodate horses, the trail 
has been formed from decomposed granite, she said. Both trails are the 
maintenance roads for the river, she said.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FIRE SPURS RESIDENTS TO CLEAR BRUSH, TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After fire destroyed hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach two months ago, people 
in this city watched the flames scorch the grassy hills to the south. Though 
the fire never reached their front doors, residents and the Fire Department 
were frightened into swift action. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing like a fire to put the fear of God in you," said Mary 
Farris, who lives on Poppy Street, which overlooks the city's No. 1 fire 
hazard, Buck Gully. "We could see an orange glow (of flames) all along that 
ridge" about a mile from their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Timothy D. Riley said this week that 75 of 158 residents along Buck 
Gully and nearby Morning Canyon have complied with department orders to clear 
dry and dead vegetation from overgrown canyons that cut through their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley added that 156 residents have said they will complete the job. The city 
held meetings last month with residents and set a deadline for compliance this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows what they have to do," said Riley, "and people are doing it." 
 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Farris and her husband, Jack Anderson, were told by the Fire 
Department to trim a thicket of bushes in the 200-foot-deep canyon behind their 
house. They also have to clear dead vegetation and thin trees overhanging their 
house and neighbors' houses. 
</P>
<P>
 That job will cost them $800 that they will gladly pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire is a huge concern here. You have got to be safe," Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
 From their deck, it is apparent that each of the neighbors has done some 
trimming and clearing in the canyon and on tall trees.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department has sent inspectors out regularly to make sure people are 
trimming enough. Riley said that if people fail to do the job in a reasonable 
period, the city will do it for them and bill them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Fire Department asked the same residents to minimize the 
highly flammable vegetation. At that time, the issue was controversial because 
many people were concerned that the canyon's habitat would be destroyed by an 
overly zealous effort at brush clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, people are only being asked to trim bushes, not cut them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the public sentiment is to recognize this as a necessity," Riley 
said. "They thought they would have to bulldoze, but it is not as dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the city has to clear some of its property at Mission Canyon. City 
officials plan to make brush clearance an annual issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a successful effort to abate the city's fire hazard," Riley said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; BOY RESCUED 
FROM HOUSE FIRE DIES IN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy who was found unconscious last week in a burning house that 
was apparently set afire by a Christmas tree died Monday at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Johnson died a few minutes before noon in the hospital's pediatric 
intensive care unit, where he was being treated for smoke inhalation, a nursing 
supervisor said.An official cause of death had not been determined, according 
to a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had been in the hospital since Thursday, when firefighters found him 
in the closet of his Sylmar home, unconscious and not breathing. Firefighters 
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the boy in front of the burning 
house until he was transported to Olive View Medical Center and then flown by 
helicopter to the Northridge hospital, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother, Shawn Johnson, 27, and his brother, Denton, 4, also suffered 
burns and smoke inhalation and were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center. The 
mother remains hospitalized for burns on her head, hands and back. Denton has 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believe the fire started when Denton began playing 
with a candle near the family tree. The boys' mother was able to pull Denton 
from the burning house but could not get back in to save Lance, fire officials 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY WILL REPLACE BROKEN WATER MAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is planning to spend about $50,000 to replace an 8-inch water main 
that burst last month and caused some local flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe is located under Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard.When it burst, 
it created holes 15 feet in diameter on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews have made temporary repairs by blocking the water flow. They have 
rerouted water so residents aren't affected. But if the pipe is not replaced, 
hundreds of residents could go without water should there be another break, 
said Elray Hanna, general manager of public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pipe has been bypassed," Hanna said. "We had to isolate it so the water 
is not flowing through now but we need to have the system circulating again. We 
need that section of pipe for the recirculation of our water." 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe replacement could take several months and has to be approved by 
Caltrans.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MERCHANTS GRANTED OK TO FLY BANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously Monday to give all merchants more freedom 
to fly banners as business advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses have been allowed to fly banners, flags, pennants and inflatable 
signs for only 14 days each quarter.The time restriction is now lifted until 
the city settles on a new sign ordinance later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council two years ago gave Newport Boulevard merchants the right to fly 
banners every day to help compensate for the construction of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway. The freeway was built below the Newport Boulevard street grade, taking 
vehicle traffic away from the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Boulevard exemption ran out at the beginning of this year. Since 
freeway construction is now over, City Atty. Thomas Kathe said the city has no 
legal basis for continuing to give Newport Boulevard special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But many business people from Newport Boulevard came to the council meeting to 
plead for their banners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'd do if somebody came by this week and told me to take 
those banners down," said Bob Washer, owner of the Sandpiper Motel at 1967 
Newport Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Washer told the council his motel business was damaged by the construction of 
the Costa Mesa Freeway. He said he needs banners to help people see where his 
motel is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Fawcett, director of the Chamber of Commerce, also came to the meeting to 
ask for further help for the downtown businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armando Vasquez, a resident and architect, warned the council not to let 
too many signs pollute the downtown's appearance.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; THIRD APPEALS BOARD CREATED FOR BACKLOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A backlog of 25,000 assessment appeals by property owners prompted the Board 
of Supervisors on Tuesday to create a third appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional board, which reviews the petitions filed by property owners who 
want their assessed values refigured or adjusted, is part of a package of 
reforms that county officials hope will speed the often criticized process. 
Supervisor William G. Steiner said the measures will shave weeks or months off 
property owners' wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Abut 65,000 appeals are pending before the county. About 25,000 of those were 
filed last year and should have been done by now, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the office's current pace, officials said, it would take three years to 
clear away that piled paperwork -- if no one else files an appeal. County 
Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs has said the logjam was created by a depressed 
property market and a lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delays have drawn fire from residents frustrated by the delays and the 
automatic 2% increase that has been tacked onto their property assessments 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearly increase, coupled with the downward slide of Southland property 
values during rocky economic times, prompted thousands of residents to file 
appeals in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted early last month to revamp the system used by the county 
assessor's office and to hire temporary employees. 
</P>
<P>
 They also increased the number of hearing officers, who meet individually with 
property owners to help settle appeals.  
</P>
<P>
 All three assessment appeals boards will now have regularly scheduled meetings 
for the first time, with meeting sessions expanded to a full day instead of 
just a few hours, a county report shows. The report on the adopted reforms 
shows officials expect the workload to increase by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Goodno, who led a committee examining the backlog problem, said Tuesday 
that the revamped approach has appeals process has "accelerated tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has come together real well, things have been set in motion to 
improve the situation," Goodno said.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, the reforms will cost the county $370,000. The reforms will not 
immediately benefit landowners awaiting an answer to their appeal -- officials 
expect to reduce the backlog by just 30% by July.GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STUDY ON MERGING 4 WATER DISTRICTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a scandal that enveloped a South County water district, the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday approved a $37,600 contract for the Orange County Grand 
Jury to study the possible benefits of merging at least four agencies that 
provide water to local districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, hailed by board Chairwoman Harriett M. Wieder as a step toward 
slicing expensive government bureaucracy, will examine the agencies' overall 
efficiency of water distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consolidation might increase efficiency and might stop oversized bureaucracy 
that costs taxpayers millions of dollars every year," Wieder said. "It's an 
idea whose time has come." 
</P>
<P>
 As outlined by the grand jury in a letter to the agencies, the accounting firm 
of Ernst & Young will study the operations of the Coastal Municipal Water 
District, Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, the Orange County Water District 
and the Municipal Water District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The four agencies all function as intermediaries in the county water 
distribution system and sell water to either city water departments or other 
water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is expected to coordinate the Ernst & Young study with a 
separate inquiry being conducted by the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission, which is also reviewing the possible merger of water and sanitation 
service agencies in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the grand jury audit Tuesday comes nearly a year after disclosures 
that top executives of the Santa Margarita Water District engaged in excessive 
spending and gift-taking from firms that were granted lucrative contracts with 
the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar grand jury study of water districts in 1982 found that the agencies 
were breeding grounds for financial waste and abuse since most operated in 
relative obscurity, managed by a core of directors who remained insulated from 
public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Wieder has called for a scaling back of local government 
bureaucracy, using the Santa Margarita Water District troubles as an example in 
the quest for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 31 city governments in Orange County, one county government and 84 
special districts," Wieder said. "I wholeheartedly support the efforts of the 
grand jury."KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; AREA CORDONED OFF DUE TO SEWER VAPORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mysteriously high levels of explosive vapors in underground sewers forced 
authorities Tuesday to cordon off a quarter-mile section of Seal Beach. 
Residents were only allowed in on foot because of fear that car motors would 
ignite the vapors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Cha, County Fire Department spokeswoman, said no one was injured in 
the incident and there were no evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cha said the vapors were discovered about 10:50 a.m. by county sanitation 
workers performing a routine sewer gas inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got some readings as high as 80% of the limit for a low-level 
explosion," Cha said. "They stopped everything and called for assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous material teams from Newport Beach and Huntington Beach were brought 
in, as well as county health officials. Samples of the gas were taken as part 
of the investigation into the source of the problem, but no results were 
available late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have a cause," Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the neighborhood said they suspect an Exxon refining facility 
next to the city's Marina Community Center. But Cha and county health officials 
said it was too early to point a finger at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon halted operations at the facility pending the outcome of the 
investigation, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 5,000 gallons of water was being pumped into the sewer system 
from a hydrant at 1st Street and Wood Lane in an effort to flush out the 
vapors. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident came only a week before neighborhood residents are scheduled to 
speak at a City Council meeting in opposition to plans by Unocal to expand a 
long-dormant site next to the Exxon facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's simply no place for something like this in a residential area," said 
John O'Neill, who lives in the area cordoned off Tuesday and is a member of the 
Keep Seal Beach Safe organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon officials couldn't be reached for comment. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; DEVELOPMENT ISSUE TO DOMINATE 3 RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight candidates are vying for seats on the City Council in a race likely to 
be dominated by development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of five council seats are up for election on March 29, and all three 
incumbents are seeking second terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 1, council member Marilyn Bruce Hastings is being challenged by 
Jim Klisanin, a teacher and businessman, and Charles Antos, a county planner 
and community activist. The district covers the Old Town area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gwen Forsythe is running against homemaker Kathy Parker and Main Street 
merchant John Baker to represent the Marina Hill area in District 3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Leisure World's District 5, council member William J. Doane faces a 
challenge by Richard Davies, an engineering manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The council terms of George Brown, who also represents Leisure World, and 
Frank Laszlo, who represents College Park East, do not expire until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street development is expected to be a major issue in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who live around the business strip complain that some 
businesses create noise, parking and traffic problems. Some merchants, on the 
other hand, accuse the city of being "anti-business" for rejecting their 
proposals to sell alcoholic beverages and extend operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hastings and Forsythe have frequently sided with residents in disputes 
about alcohol sales and operating hours. Doane has been more sympathetic to the 
concerns of merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue expected to be debated is a proposal to build about 100 homes in 
the Bixby Ranch area near the Seal Beach Boulevard and Lampson Avenue. City 
officials expect to receive an environmental impact report on the project in 
coming weeks. Public hearings will take place this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents vote only for candidates in their own districts. Runoff elections 
will be held May 10 in races where no candidate received more than 50% of the 
vote. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CHURCH CAN MEET IN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted Monday to permit a new church to use an industrial 
building during non-business hours despite opposition from industrial neighbors 
and an earlier denial by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonebridge Christian Church will be allowed to hold services in a 
2,000-square-foot portion of a 23,873-square-foot industrial building at 5331 
McFadden Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial uses would continue on weekdays and the church would operate on 
Sundays and some weeknights during non-business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 businesses contended in a petition to city officials that they 
couldn't coexist with a church in the industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission in October turned down the church's request on grounds 
it is not compatible for the area and that industrial uses could generate 
unacceptable noise levels and involve storage of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kenneth K. Gibo, a church member and president of Intra Storage 
Systems Inc. who is making a part of his company's building available for the 
church, told the council that church members agree not to file complaints about 
noise or other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibo said he expects the church to become established in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Toriumi, who told council members that he is an ordained Presbyterian 
minister and a leader of Stonebridge Christian Church, said the new church will 
reach out to third- and fourth-generation Japanese Americans and other Asian 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the space in the industrial building "an ideal setting for the 
beginning of a new church." A traditional church would be a costly investment 
that would be "a ball and chain for members for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said they expect about 70 to 150 people would attend regular 
Sunday worship services. About five to 40 people are expected at informal 
gatherings on weeknights, they said.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; LAW CLARIFIES RULES ON UPKEEP OF HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has granted preliminary approval to an ordinance which 
prohibits, among other things, drying laundry on a clothesline visible from a 
public street and leaving trash containers in public view on days trash is not 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday approved the ordinance, which is designed to keep 
residential neighborhoods safe and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance refines a set of rules under which residents did not necessarily 
know when a property was considered unsafe or unsightly enough to violate the 
law, said Robyn Uptegraff, executive director of the planning and building 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance lets "residents know more specifically what's expected of them. 
It's spelled out more clearly for the community" and for code enforcement 
personnel, she said. The city plans to publicize the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also states that property owners must keep private driveways in 
good condition and ensure they are not hazardous to pedestrians, and that 
patios and balconies may not be used for storing items such as refrigerators or 
mattresses. Walls, fences and hedges must also be kept in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Uptegraff said that the conditions outlined in the new ordinance were already 
prohibited under other ordinances, but not listed so that homeowners would 
necessarily realize their properties failed to meet legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 By listing those requirements in the new ordinance and educating the public, 
Uptegraff said she expects many people will comply with the rules on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary goal is to maintain single-family neighborhoods as a quality 
place to live," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next few months, city staff will distribute flyers to neighborhood 
associations explaining the responsibilities of property owners. Residents will 
receive similar notices along with their water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval on Jan. 17. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTION POLICY TO BE WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City planners hope that a policy going before the City Council tonight will 
slow the construction of illegal housing units in overpopulated, low-income 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners would be able to challenge blueprints that contain extra rooms with 
outside access and plumbing that could easily be converted into illegal living 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, builders would either have to remove the 
plumbing and access from plans or specify that the room would not be rented out 
as living space. The council will also look at a zoning change that would spell 
out the nature of living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, our definitions were not really exact," said Bob Goldin, deputy 
city planner. "We hope these measures will help limit illegal conversions." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, city residents have complained about bootleg units in the 
downtown area about one to three blocks west of El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding in apartments and condominiums made parking scarce on 
neighborhood streets, Goldin said. Many dwellings are poorly maintained and 
badly in need of paint while trash has accumulated in yards and on curbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city responded by hiring an additional code enforcement officer who 
handles overcrowding complaints. City officials also initiated a Neighborhood 
Pride program that provides paint and crews to clean up blighted areas. FRANK 
MESSINA

PACKARD: SOUTH COUNTY CITIES NEED SAY ON BASE; EL TORO: CONGRESSMAN SAYS HE 
WILL BE WATCHING THE NINE-MEMBER AGENCY TO ENSURE THE AREA IS 'TREATED FAIRLY' 
IN THE SITE CONVERSION DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lending his political clout to south Orange County cities, Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) said Tuesday that the area should have a greater say in the 
redevelopment planning for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and should "not 
roll over" if they feel their interests are not being protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard stopped short of criticizing the structure of the El Toro planning 
agency proposed last month by the Board of Supervisors and Irvine, saying it is 
a local decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But the congressman, who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee 
and whose district includes part of South County, said he would be watching the 
El Toro agency to ensure South County cities are "treated fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed nine-member board that will pick the final base conversion plan 
includes the five supervisors, three Irvine representatives and one from Lake 
Forest. The 29 remaining Orange County cities will be invited to sit on an 
advisory panel that will screen redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (South County leaders) have deep concerns, they ought to do what they can 
to change the structure" of the agency, Packard said in an interview following 
his private meeting with the city officials. "I think this is of such 
importance that nobody ought to roll over and say 'We have put up a good 
fight.' The planning has got to be done well." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also acknowledged the county's difficulty in reaching a compromise on 
the makeup of the planning agency, and warned against prolonging the debate 
over whether a commercial airport should be developed at the base. That 
political fight could force the federal government to take the decision away 
from local officials, Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all know and agree that we will never have an opportunity to plan 
a major part of Orange County like we do under this scenario," Packard said of 
the 4,700-acre site. "My hope is that one issue or one question will not so 
dominate that it will cloud or influence or negate any planning effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard is a longtime opponent of a commercial airport at El Toro, favoring 
instead general aviation operations once the Marines move out in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no solutions for (South County officials), and I am not going to be 
carrying any legislation or any other effort to try to prevent anything from 
happening at this point," he added. "We are not at that point yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates said afterward that she was 
surprised to learn that commercial aviation could operate at El Toro on an 
interim basis as the Marines move out and the redevelopment plan is being 
finalized, with approval from the El Toro planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The board "certainly has authority we were not aware of. It's a very, very 
powerful group," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Councilwoman Melody Carruth added that Packard "was pleased that 
we stood up for the citizens of South County to make sure their voices are 
heard." In addition to Bates and Carruth, council members from Dana Point, 
Laguna Beach and Lake Forest attended, as well as a representative from Leisure 
World of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The session also signaled the continuing determination of South County cities 
to influence the El Toro planning process even though they are expected to be 
left off the county's decision-making board. 
</P>
<P>
 South County officials plan to meet this month in Washington with officials of 
federal agencies that will be involved in the base conversion, including the 
Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the FAA has already decided that El Toro should become an 
international airport, Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow said the delegation 
wants to make sure "there's no preconceived notion and that they are going to 
go into this (planning process) with an open mind."

CAR DEALERSHIP CHARGED IN SMOG CHECK CRACKDOWN; CRIME: TOYOTA OF GARDEN GROVE, 
MECHANICS AND OTHERS FACE FELONY COUNTS FOR ALLEGEDLY ISSUING CERTIFICATES FOR 
CARS THAT FAILED INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County car dealership, five mechanics and others were charged 
Tuesday with issuing smog certificates for cars that failed the state's smog 
check program, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown is the first of its kind in California, said Louis Bonsignore, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Consumer Affairs. It followed a 
six-month investigation begun after the state Bureau of Automotive Repairs 
received complaints or tips about violators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants include Toyota of Garden Grove and a woman suspected of 
knowingly buying a fraudulent certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the consumer, all of the defendants were charged with issuing false 
smog certificates, which carries a maximum sentence of four years in state 
prison, and with entering false information into a computer database, which 
carries a maximum three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer, Jean S. Hinckley, 62, of Fullerton, is charged with a 
misdemeanor, a maximum penalty of $5,000 fine and one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from several state agencies including the district attorney's 
office served search warrants most of last year.  
</P>
<P>
 In August, state investigators began surveillance at the Toyota dealership's 
new lot on Trask Avenue and its old site on Harbor Boulevard, officials said. 
Search warrants were served there in November. The dealership has been charged 
with 16 felony violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged are the dealership's former service manager, Scott Lee Harrison, 
35, of Yorba Linda, and a former mechanic, Edgardo Lujan, 26, of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in August, agents investigated mechanic Tony Pham, 35, of Santa Ana, who 
worked at Doug's Muffler and Brake Inc. on 11th Street. Pham and the owner of 
the company, Benito Ciano, 52, of Costa Mesa, were later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 After an April stakeout by state officials, Esmaiel Fadaee, 37, of Irvine, 
owner of the defunct Santa Ana Public Auto Auction, fled from authorities. 
There is a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of 22 felony violations, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested Tuesday Nader Molaie Sharif, 37, of Westminster for 
allegedly issuing false smog certificates with Fadaee. Sharif was a mechanic at 
H & E Auto Repair in Orange, and is facing 12 felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also served search warrants in November on Timothy R. Slee, 47, of 
Corona as he worked at Bridges Union Service in Fullerton.

TUSTIN POLICE CARS TO CARRY VIDEO CAMERAS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WINDSHIELD-MOUNTED 
DEVICE WILL RECORD TRAFFIC STOPS AND AID IN CRIME DETECTION, SUCH AS DRUNK 
DRIVING ARRESTS AND ATTACKS ON OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 All police patrol cars will carry a video camera, in part to protect the 
safety of police officers, by late next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday unanimously approved spending $100,000 from 
asset-forfeiture funds to buy and install video cameras on police patrol cars 
by late February. Asset-forfeiture funds generally are those derived from 
drug-related cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, alarmed by the growing incidents of violence against police 
officers, including the recent shooting death of a Manhattan Beach officer 
making a traffic stop, hope that the cameras would work as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "People generally behave when they know they are on camera," said Mayor Jim 
Potts, who is also a sergeant with the Irvine Police Department. "It will help 
reduce crime, because if you can't run or hide, hopefully, you will obey the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said video cameras could have helped solve the murder of Martin L. Ganz, 
the Manhattan Beach officer, and the police killings in Compton and Garden 
Grove. The camera could have recorded the suspects and their vehicles which, 
with the help of the public, could have been located, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies in Orange County, including the Sheriff's Department and the 
Los Alamitos Police Department, have installed video cameras in their patrol 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Video cameras are helpful in police work because "it records everything 
accurately. We don't have to rely on someone's faulty memory," according to 
Capt. Fred Wakefield of the Tustin police. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, three patrol cars have been fitted with video cameras, "and we're 
happy with the results," Wakefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, we didn't have to use the camera to record a homicide yet, but 
it has been helpful, particularly in (drunk driving) arrests," Wakefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cameras, each costing about $4,500, will be bought from Crimtech Systems 
Inc., a company based in Livonia, Mich., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakefield said the video camera is no more than three square inches in size, 
and is mounted on a bracket on the passenger's side windshield of the police 
car. The camera, equipped with a zoom lens, can be operated at night and is 
connected to a recorder inside the police car's trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a control panel, the officer can start or stop recording and control 
the lens. A monitor allows the officer to see what the camera sees, and a 
remote microphone provides the audio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very valuable tool," Wakefield said.

JUDGE LOWERS BAIL FOR MAN HELD IN SCAM; COURTS: JAMES ROBERT BORZYNSKI, ACCUSED 
OF CONNING THREE WOMEN OUT OF $87,000, FACES THREE COUNTS OF GRAND THEFT.

<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge Tuesday reduced bail for a former used 
car salesman accused of conning three Orange County women out of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge David T. McEachen set bail at $100,000 for James Robert 
Borzynski, who was ordered two weeks ago to stand trial on three counts of 
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles -- who heard three local women testify that 
Borzynski posed as a Newport Beach lawyer and promised to marry them just to 
empty their bank accounts -- had described Borzynski in post-trial comments as 
a "sociopathic predator." 
</P>
<P>
 Iles also raised Borzynski's bond from $50,000 to $500,000, saying she feared 
that he would flee because he is a fugitive from authorities in Wisconsin, 
where he was convicted for forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski, a former Laguna Niguel resident, has denied any wrongdoing. His 
lawyer, Gregory W. Jones, acknowledged that the former used car salesman lied 
to the three local women about his identity, but said the women gave his client 
"loans" in what were "boyfriend-girlfriend" relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 At Borzynski's arraignment in Superior Court on Tuesday, Jones asked McEachen 
to reduce his client's bail, claiming that he was not a flight risk or a threat 
to society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no reason to believe that he's more dangerous now than when his bail 
was set at $50,000," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino urged the judge to "keep the bail in the 
six-figures range," claiming that prosecutors know about five other alleged 
victims of Borzynski's who live outside Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino asserted that Borzynski was about to victimize another woman when 
police arrested him Nov. 4 in Tiburon. 
</P>
<P>
 McEachen, who was recently sworn in as a Superior Court judge, said he would 
follow a recommendation by court officials to set bail at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski is expected to appear before Superior Court Judge Francisco P. 
Briseno on Jan. 14 to determine when his trial will be held.

MIXED VICTORY IN LAGUNA'S CAMPAIGN REFORM MEASURE; POLITICS: AS CITY COUNCIL 
TENTATIVELY OKS THE $250-PER-PERSON DONATIONS LIMIT, IT SAYS IT MAY REJECT 
TOUGHER ASPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign reform measure that would limit donations to $250 per person 
received tentative approval Tuesday from the Laguna Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimous vote left ordinance supporters with mixed feelings, 
because the council indicated it may reject some of the more stringent aspects 
of the measure, which was originally crafted by the League of Women Voters of 
Orange Coast and Orange County Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the council has not yet decided whether it will put the $250 cap 
on "in-kind" donations of things such as professional services or the use of 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval by the council is expected within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Common Cause members gathered outside council chambers to 
discuss their mixed victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't support an ordinance that's not complete, that has loopholes you can 
drive a truck through," said Common Cause member Brenda Bolanos.Q "People trust 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents do not support the measure at all, saying it is too 
complicated, implies that city leaders can be bought and favors incumbents, 
three of whom are up for election next November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think this particular ordinance is going to help the situation very 
much," said Bob Mosier, president of the Laguna Beach Tax Payers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the cost of elections rising steadily here in recent years, many 
residents strongly support financial controls to prevent anyone from wielding 
disproportionate influence in city government. The 1992 election was the most 
expensive City Council race in this city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can level the playing field for everyone," Karen Difede told the 
council. "I hope you will get serious and pass this tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, Shirley Grindle, who helped craft a similar measure for 
the county, referred to as the TIN CUP ordinance, said that in considering such 
reform, Laguna Beach was endorsing a trend in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get a TIN CUP-type ordinance adopted in as many cities as we 
can to attempt to standardize things a little more," she said. "There's nothing 
unique about Laguna Beach except they do have heated elections, and (even) 
that's not unique in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities that have approved similar ordinances with caps ranging from $250 
to $1,000 are Orange, Anaheim, Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, Grindle said. 
Community groups are also rallying in other cities to get such controls in 
place, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance would not limit the amount of his or her own money a 
candidate can spend on a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 While Laguna Beach may not be acting unilaterally, the Council's action does 
come at a politically sensitive time for this city, where the terms of all 
three members who typically form a voting majority will expire at the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The original proposed ordinance was strongly supported by Village Laguna, the 
city's most powerful political group, but was opposed by United Laguna, a newer 
group that often has taken a stand in opposition to Village Laguna and will 
probably try to install new council members in November.

WELFARE EMPLOYEE IS ACCUSED OF AIDING INELIGIBLE RELATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state welfare employee was accused Tuesday of providing food stamps and cash 
to a relative who was ineligible for aid, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson said Georgina Martinez, 28, was charged 
with two felony counts each of misappropriating public funds and being an 
accessory to welfare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, an eligibility technician with the state Department of Social 
Services, is to be arraigned Jan. 19 in Municipal Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Martinez faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office didn't disclose the identity of the relative 
who received the aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged misappropriation was discovered by the Department of Social 
Services and investigated by district attorney's investigators.

SANTA ANA TEEN IS FIRST GANG-RELATED HOMICIDE OF YEAR; VIOLENCE: REPUTED GANG 
MEMBER'S BODY FOUND WITH GUN IN HIS POCKET NEXT TO RAILROAD TRACKS. PEOPLE 
NEARBY HAD HEARD SHOTS BUT DIDN'T CALL POLICE.

<P>
 A 17-year-old who was found shot to death a few feet away from the Santa Fe 
railroad tracks early Tuesday morning may have become the county's first 
gang-related homicide of 1994, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siriaco Gonzalez was shot once in the right side of his head and once in the 
left side of his body at close range, said Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton. 
He died at the scene, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that there was some kind of confrontation on the railroad tracks 
between the victim and whoever shot him," Helton said. "But what the 
circumstances are surrounding the shooting, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a reputed gang member who was found with a loaded .22-caliber 
handgun in his front shirt pocket, had apparently been dead for at least two 
hours before police were called to the scene in the 300 block of E. Adams 
Street at 9:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and employees of some nearby businesses told police they heard 
gunshots about 7:30 a.m., but no one called police until two hours later, when 
a man noticed the body near the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People reported hearing what sounded like gunshots or loud pops, but they 
didn't investigate," Helton said. "We believe that the shots that were heard 
involved this young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and few leads in the case, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a resident of Santa Ana, died near the back fence of a home 
belonging to longtime resident Rudy Valenzuela, whose home abuts the railroad 
tracks. Valenzuela, 63, said he heard loud pops and a thud against his back 
fence, but thought nothing of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard someone hit the fence but that's nothing new because the kids walking 
to Saddleback High School are always passing through that way to school," 
Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who has lived in Santa Ana since 1958, was upset after learning of 
the slaying, but he said he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shoot every night here, so it's nothing new," he said. "I hope they find 
whoever shot this guy. This stuff has gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 The 80 homicides committed in Santa Ana in 1993 shattered the city's previous 
record of 59 killings, set in 1992. Of last year's cases, 47 were gang-related, 
more than double the previous record, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great for the community and for everyone if we didn't even come 
close to the number of homicides we had last year," Helton said as he stood 
near the railroad tracks where the latest slaying occurred. "We would look 
forward to any decrease."

O.C. MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES; BIG GUYS CHOOSE RISK-FREE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For those looking to expand their knowledge of music, 1994 isn't shaping up as 
a terribly promising year. Concert programs by the county's major 
organizations, with a bare few exceptions, consist mostly of meat-and-potatoes 
repertory. People must turn to the less-well-heeled local groups and the dance 
world for expanding their horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, none of the local groups has announced 1994-95 seasons yet, so some 
surprises and risks may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony will play Beethoven's Fifth (Feb. 2, 3), Brahms' Fourth 
(April 6, 7), Mahler's "Resurrection" (May 18, 19) and Berlioz's "Symphonie 
Fantastique" (June 1, 2) at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Not much 
audience risk here. 
</P>
<P>
 Among newer works, the orchestra will offer John Corigliano's Piano Concerto 
and Pacific composer-in-residence Frank Ticheli's "Postcard" (both Feb. 2, 3) 
and Ticheli's "Radiant Voices" (March 24, 25). 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting Dresden Philharmonic will play Beethoven's Triple concerto and 
Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2 on Jan. 25 at the center, courtesy of the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Philharmonic Society-sponsored visiting orchestras include the State 
Symphony of Russia (Feb. 6), the Orchestre National de France (Feb. 27), the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic (April 16) and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra 
(April 30). 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the repertory is pretty standard, but the L.A. Chamber Orchestra 
program will include the world premiere of a work by Joan Tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific is venturing out on a limb by offering Wagner's "Die Walkure" 
(March 4-20). This is its first effort in seven years at demanding, heavyweight 
Germanic repertory. Is Opera Pacific, for all its pretensions at offering 
"world-class" opera, ready for the challenge? 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Opera Pacific season includes Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow" 
(Jan. 21-30) and Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" (March 9-19). Lots of 
hummable tunes here. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be cause for special concern, however, if what is past is prologue, 
as Shakespeare wrote in "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have predicted Opera Pacific's half-naked flagellants during the 
Overture to Mozart's "Don Giovanni" in 1990, the general raunch-and-grope in 
Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" last year, or the public rutting during the 
buoyant Act I Waltz of Gounod's "Faust," also presented last year? 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what Lolo, Dodo, Clo-Clo and the other girls at Lehar's Maxim's 
might be wearing this time out. . . . Will there be bare-breasted Valkyries 
with naked corpses slung across their horses in the famous Ride? Will Lucia do 
a striptease during her Mad Scene? 
</P>
<P>
 Some comparison shopping: 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Music Center Opera will rehearse and then offer a one-day 
performance, Jan. 15, of Manuel Penella's "El Gato Montes" at the center before 
moving the production to Los Angeles for a Jan. 19-29 engagement. The program 
here, a benefit for Opera Pacific, qualifies Orange County as getting the West 
Coast premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the work is a zarzuela, which is a Spanish musical-theater form, 
rather than an opera. The cast will include Placido Domingo, Justino Diaz and 
Veronica Villarroel. Look for credible acting and tight ensemble work -- 
qualities that are rarely present in local operatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The more venturesome repertory is being offered by groups that are continuing 
to fight financial battles. William Hall will lead the Master Chorale of Orange 
County in Rachmaninoff's Vespers on Feb. 13 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 John Alexander will conduct the Pacific Chorale in works by French composers 
on April 23 (Shakespeare's birthday) at the Performing Arts Center. The program 
will include the lovely "Cantique de Jean Racine," written by Gabriel Faure 
when he was 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary chamber music remains largely the preserve of the Southwest 
Chamber Music Society, which plays a series of works by Elliott Carter and 
Mozart on Sunday and Jan. 23 at Chapman University in Orange. Other composers 
are included in programs on Feb. 20, March 27, April 17 and June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The series co-sponsored by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the 
Philharmonic Society resumes operations with the Borodin String Quartet on Jan. 
15 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Groups to follow include the 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio (Feb. 1), the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln 
Center (March 23) and violinist Cho-Liang Lin and pianist Andre-Michel Schub 
(May 7). 
</P>
<P>
 The Founders Hall chamber-music series at the center continues with the 
Quartet Sine Nomine (Feb. 16) and the Angeles String Quartet (April 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Cerovsek, the bi-talented artist from Austria via Canada, will again 
play both a violin and a piano concerto with Ami Porat and the Mozart Camerata 
on Jan. 16 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. Cerovsek will 
be soloist in the Violin Concerto No. 4 and the Piano Concerto No. 21. The 
season will continue on April 10 and May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Tony Plug appears with Micah Levy and the Orange County Chamber 
Orchestra on Feb. 6 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. The season continues with 
programs there on March 27 and May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Friends of Music will offer free Sunday afternoon concerts on 
Jan. 16, Feb. 27 and May 1 at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. The North 
Orange County Community Concerts Assn. has programs set for Jan. 17, March 7 
and April 8 at the Fullerton First United Methodist Church. The Harmonia 
Baroque Players will play on Feb. 6 and April 24 at Christ Church by the Sea 
United Methodist in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for dance, there is no ballet scheduled at the Performing Arts Center 
through the first half of the year. Whether there will be any in the second 
half depends on the facility announcing a '94-95 series, which may come 
imminently. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Ballet Pacifica will dance at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on March 
25 and 26 and May 13 and 14. The St. Joseph Ballet will give its annual spring 
concerts at the Irvine theater on April 28-30. Beth Burns' inner-city troupe 
was honored Tuesday by the Orange County Board of Supervisors for the positive 
effect it has had on at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 World dance will be represented by the Los Angeles-based Aman Folk Ensemble on 
Jan. 22 at Saddleback College, the Ballet Folklorico "Quetzalli" de Veracruz at 
the UC Irvine Bren Center on Feb. 6, and the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble on 
March 15 at the Performing Arts Center, courtesy of the Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern dance, by default, again falls mostly to the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 
which continues its enterprising Feet First Contemporary Dance Series, 
co-sponsored by UCI Cultural Events. Groups at the theater in 1994 will include 
New York's Lar Lubovitch Dance Company (Feb. 12 and 13), Lines Contemporary 
Ballet from San Francisco on March 19 and New York-based Donald Byrd/The Group 
on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The great Gregory Hines will guest with Rhapsody in Taps on March 11 at 
Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton. Hines created a work, "Toeing the 3rd and 
Fifth" for the company, in 1990. The five-woman troupe will dance, minus Hines, 
on Jan. 29 at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The summertime so far falls wholly to the Pacific Symphony, which opens its 
five-concert series at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on July 4. Look for Klaus 
Donath to conduct the Mozart program on Aug. 13.

GROWING INTO THE ROLE; MOVIES: RALPH FIENNES GAINED WEIGHT -- AND CRITICAL 
PRAISE -- FOR HIS ROLE AS A BRUTAL NAZI WORK-CAMP COMMANDANT IN 'SCHINDLER'S 
LIST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ralph Fiennes had agreed to meet for morning coffee at the august Savoy Hotel, 
but when the appointed hour arrived, he was glowering in the foyer. He was 
dressed smartly in leather jacket, striped shirt and bolo tie, but this 
ensemble did not please the Savoy; its impenetrable dress codes dictated he 
must don a formal coat. We agreed to decamp to the more relaxed Waldorf, 200 
yards down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Savoy offered me one of their jackets, but I wasn't about to do that," 
muttered Fiennes as we strolled along the Strand. "Honestly, this kind of thing 
just makes me want to pack up and move to the States." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be music to Hollywood's ears. In the wake of his stunningly 
powerful performance as the brutal, sadistic Nazi work-camp commandant, Amon 
Goeth, in Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List," the British Fiennes is a hot 
property. Best supporting actor awards from the National Society of Film 
Critics and the New York Film Critics' Circle, and a Golden Globe nomination in 
the same category, have only intensified the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a remarkable experience working with Steven," says Fiennes, visibly 
relaxing after being ushered to a table at the Waldorf. "I feel as though he's 
touched a tender human nerve in all of us with this film." Fiennes also talks 
of "the huge bond of loyalty and friendship" that now exists among Spielberg 
and his "Schindler's List" stars (Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and himself) after 
the grueling five-month shoot in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiennes (whose name is pronounced Rafe Fines) is a friendly, soft-spoken 
30-year-old with impeccable manners, a shy smile, a slim frame and fair hair 
that flops boyishly over his forehead. It is almost impossible to square his 
demeanor with that of Amon Goeth, a man capable of randomly shooting Jewish 
prisoners with a rifle from the balcony of his villa overlooking the work camp. 
As Goeth, Fiennes summoned up a look of chilling cruelty around his eyes; he 
wore his hair slicked back and strutted around with a huge paunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven didn't get involved in motivation or in my interpretation of Amon 
Goeth," recalls Fiennes. "He wasn't dictatorial or autocratic. He trusted, and 
the trust built. But he did tell me not to make Goeth a cliched Nazi, and he 
thought I should certainly put on weight." 
</P>
<P>
 So Fiennes started eating three full meals a day before shooting began, 
washing down dinner with a few pints of Guinness. He accelerated the process by 
consuming a weight-enhancing substance made of vegetable fats and eventually 
gained 25 pounds, most noticeably around his stomach and jowls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone makes cracks about this being like De Niro putting on the pounds for 
'Raging Bull,' but I think the decision was justified," Fiennes says. "Goeth 
was a man with a sense of his own incredible power, the power to let people 
live or die. And powerful men often carry a paunch around with them in a way 
that demonstrates that power. It makes them more expansive, it creates extra 
space around them. There's something almost phallic about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiennes may have seemed a left-field choice for such a rich role as Amon 
Goeth. Until now he has been best known in Britain for stage work -- in a 
three-year stint at the Royal Shakespeare Company, he played Henry VI and 
Triolus. He then played Lawrence of Arabia in a British TV film called "A 
Dangerous Man" and starred as Heathcliff in Paramount's ill-fated remake of 
"Wuthering Heights," which was never released in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked him as Lawrence," says Spielberg. "He took a lot of chances, 
especially with Peter O'Toole looming above the part like a guillotine. I asked 
to see a print of 'Wuthering Heights' and thought it was a difficult part he 
pulled off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, Ralph has a charm which can cut off and become deadly calm. Goeth was 
such a nasty man, as evil as any of the icons of German Nazism -- and Ralph as 
Goeth looks you in the eye and makes your blood run cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiennes believes Spielberg saw elements of Goeth in his portrayal of 
Heathcliff: "I made him more vengeful and malevolent than he was in (Emily 
Bronte's) novel." 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Fiennes is seen by film audiences, he won't be brutal or 
vengeful. Immediately after wrapping "Schindler's List" in Poland, he flew to 
New York to play the celebrity 1950s TV quiz contestant Charles van Doren in 
Robert Redford's movie for Disney, "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles van Doren was thin and angular, so of course I had to lose the 25 
pounds immediately," he says ruefully. "Redford got me a personal trainer." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two films he made last year, Fiennes also was married in 
1993, to British actress Alex Kingston. The future looks rather rosy too.  
</P>

 "I've already read scripts which have ended up going to Tom Cruise and Daniel 
Day-Lewis. I can see the ingredients that go into a star role. But one has to 
be really careful. Having just played two psychologically intriguing roles, I'd 
like to follow them up with something that offers the same kind of challenge." 
</P>

 Fiennes is still wrapped up in "Schindler's List," though. "Working with 
Steven was so stimulating," he said. "You felt you could take risks. I remember 
saying as much to Ben Kingsley one day after we'd seen the dailies. Ben said, 
'Yes, and just look at where Steven's putting the camera. We're in good hands, 
you know.' "

CULTURAL REVOLUTION, ARTISTIC EVOLUTION; FANG LIJUN GETS CREATIVE IMPETUS FROM 
MODERN CHINESE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Fang Lijun was 5 years old, something happened that would shape his life, 
and his art, forever. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, 1968, China was in the early, most emotional phase of the 10-year 
Cultural Revolution. Fang was the happy son of a railroad engineer and his 
wife, living in the sooty, gray northern Chinese city of Handan, Hebei 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he recalled recently at a restaurant near his studio in the Beijing 
suburbs, there was a particularly festive air in the railroad workers' compound 
where his family lived. Young Red Guards ran between houses urging residents to 
assemble at the sports stadium. Fang joined the other excited children in the 
front rows, expecting to be entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 The public rally was an all-too-common one in China in those days. Red Guards 
incited the crowd with chants of "beat the landlord!" as, one by one, supposed 
class enemies were marched to the stage and forced to wear dunce hats or 
placards listing their "crimes." Sometimes the militants flailed their victims 
or forced them to bend forward and raise their arms behind their backs in the 
excruciating exercise they called "doing the airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 For the children, it was a kind of theater, a grand game staged by adults for 
their benefit. Fang said he watched and participated happily until he saw that 
one of the men being forced to mount the stage was his own beloved grandfather, 
accused of being a "rich peasant" enemy of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beat landlord Fang!" the crowd of 10,000 people shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 For grandson Fang, the world was suddenly reduced to a howling, 
finger-pointing maelstrom. Twenty-five years later, the 30-year-old artist 
calmly spoke of that moment as his artistic epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 Fang graduated from the Beijing Central Academy of Fine Arts in the summer of 
1989. He was present in the vast square on the night of June 4, 1989, when army 
units moved into the city to break up the pro-democracy movement. Just as the 
Cultural Revolution propelled him into becoming an artist, the events of Tian 
An Men marked the beginning of his artistic production. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Fang insists his work is not politically motivated. "People 
always ask me about the political, social and economic basis of my work. But to 
me it is my job. I get up, go to the studio, paint and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, in fact, Fang is experimenting with a broader range of subjects. 
His most recent works are large gray oils depicting swimmers. "I like water," 
he said. Earlier, he did smiling self-portraits with a female model. Full-blown 
roses decorate some pictures, floating among unconscious subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 But his first works, those best known in the West, are mainly large 
self-portraits as a finger-pointing accuser or a laughing figure with shaven 
pate among other bald men who wear what appear to be prison uniforms. His 
entire oeuvre is about 30 oil-on-canvas paintings ranging from 6 1/2-by-7 1/2 
feet to a handful as small as 1 1/3-by-1 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fang's vision is from the perspective of a child. What Gunther Grass did for 
literature with "The Tin Drum" -- Nazi Germany viewed from the eyes of a boy -- 
Fang is attempting with his painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened just as I was coming of age," said Fang, a lean smiling man whose 
shaved head is framed by large elfin ears, translucent as thin candle wax, as 
he recalled the Handan rally. "I just knew that I loved my grandfather and that 
he was a good man. It allowed me to understand what people are capable of 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of the Cultural Revolution and its profound effects on 
Chinese art, literature and cinema. Celebrated Chinese movie directors Chen 
Kaige ("Farewell My Concubine") and Zhang Yimou ("Raise the Red Lantern") have 
both recorded their artistic debt to the tumultuous period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difference between Chen and Fang is that Chen was already grown when 
the Cultural Revolution occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Fang and his generation were still children during the Cultural Revolution. 
Because they do not have to wrestle with the demons of their past actions, Fang 
argues, the new generation has a broader tableau on which to make its art. "I 
think there is more creative potential for people of my generation," he said, 
adding, "but it is impossible to group art by generations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among his colleagues in the Yuanmingyuan artistic community, Fang is by far 
the most successful. The colony of new, cheap traditional courtyard style homes 
not far from Beijing University is now crowded with less-talented artists who 
blatantly imitate Fang's style. The congestion in the once-quiet community is 
such that Fang, assisted by his German wife, Michaela Raab, an international 
aid worker in Beijing, plans to move his studio in the coming months.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Fang's works were exhibited at the prestigious Venice Biennale and at 
the Malborough Fine Arts gallery in London, agents for the late Francis Bacon 
and other noted contemporary modern artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with Liu Wei," said Malborough galleries director Gilbert Lloyd, 
referring to another 1989 graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts often grouped 
with Fang in the Cynical Realist school, "I consider Fang Lijun one of the most 
promising artists in China." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Fang has been invited to participate in the "World Morality" 
exhibition in the Basel, Switzerland, Kunsthalle, along with 14 other prominent 
artists and photographers, including Mike Kelley, Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, 
Juan Munoz and Pipilotti Rist. Also scheduled is an exhibition of works by 
Chinese artists in Fukuoka, Japan, and a one-man show in Paris at the Gallerie 
Bellefroid. 
</P>
<P>
 As often happens with successful Chinese artists, Fang's success overseas has 
subjected him to criticism at home that he caters too much to an international 
audience, ignoring the cultural idiosyncrasies of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fang greets this criticism with a broad smile and hearty laugh. "During the 
Cultural Revolution," he said, harking back to the familiar theme, "artists had 
no idea that their works would ever see light. The most we could hope for was 
that someone might someday make prints and smuggle them out so someone could 
see it. We never dreamed that we would be exhibited internationally. That makes 
this kind of criticism seem like nothing."

WHEN EARLY ACTING CAREERS CAREEN TO AN END; ADVOCACY: PAUL PETERSEN OF 'THE 
DONNA REED SHOW' HAS ESTABLISHED A SUPPORT GROUP FOR FORMER YOUNG ACTORS WHO 
HAVE FACED REAL-LIFE HORROR STORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last winter, Paul Petersen was awakened by a frantic call. "It was this kid 
calling from the Roxy," recalls Petersen, 48, an author and onetime child actor 
who played Jeff on "The Donna Reed Show" from 1958 through 1966. "He said he 
saw River Phoenix in one of the nightclub's bathroom stalls shooting heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who for four years has been organizing support groups for former 
child stars and the pressure they face in an often indifferent Hollywood, 
sprang into action. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, he and a group of other former child actors knocked on the 
front door of Phoenix's Los Angeles home and confronted him with the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him we'd all been there," he says. "But he just told us there was no 
problem." Phoenix closed the door, cutting off the attempted intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In late October, when Petersen heard of the 23-year-old Phoenix's heroin and 
cocaine overdose, he was neither surprised nor especially upset. "At least we'd 
tried to intervene; we gave him an option," says Petersen. "I could sleep after 
hearing about River, but I couldn't after I heard about Rusty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rusty" was Rusty Hamer, who played Danny Thomas' son on "The Danny Thomas 
Show." In January, 1990, Hamer, then 42, shot himself to death, ending a life 
of poverty and depression near New Orleans.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamer's life had been sadly similar to those of many child stars, never living 
up to those moments of fame bestowed at a young age. Once he grew up, Hollywood 
was no longer interested. He had no skills, no money and no education. His life 
spiraled downward through drugs, alcohol and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me about Rusty was that I could have helped," says Petersen, who 
can still cause pedestrians on his Gardena street to stop and squint their eyes 
in recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get involved even though the book I was working on at the time -- to 
be called 'A Minor Consideration' -- was about the problems of child actors. 
The morning I heard, I said to my wife, 'Rana, it's time to do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen never finished the book, but he took its title for his nonprofit 
support and advocacy group. "A Minor Consideration is a support and 
intervention group for anybody who's ever been a child actor," he says. "You 
don't have to sign up; if you were a child actor, you're already a member. And 
we're also an advocacy group. There are a lot of laws and practices we'd like 
to see changed.  
</P>
<P>
 "They say children in this industry are protected. Bull----. Hollywood would 
save Bosnia before the life of a single child actor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to his easygoing small-screen persona, Petersen, he is the first to 
admit, is not a reasonable advocate of change. He is, he says, "an in-your-face 
militant" on the subject of children in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger is always close to the surface, a result, he says, of seeing no 
positive changes in a system that treated him and his contemporaries, as well 
as child actors today, "as nothing more than chattel."  
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Iowa and Southern California, Petersen was, briefly, one of the 
original 16 Mousketeers. A number of commercials and a star turn in "Houseboat" 
with Cary Grant landed him, in 1958, the role of Jeff on "The Donna Reed Show," 
a character he would portray for the next eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen's own crises didn't happen while he was actually a child star. 
"Whatever dark period I had came after the show," he says, though he admits 
that running around Hollywood with pals Ricky Nelson, Tony Dow ("Leave It to 
Beaver"), Don Grady ("My Three Sons") and Johnny Crawford ("The Rifleman") in 
fast cars while imbibing large amounts of alcohol was not exactly a normal 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1966, I worked 16 weeks; in 1968, four weeks; and in 1969, I didn't work 
at all. By then, I was a complete basket case." 
</P>
<P>
 It was advice from another former child actor that sobered him up. "I was 
living in Encino in a house I could no longer afford when, one day, Mickey 
Rooney showed up. He told me that Hollywood wouldn't hire me again for another 
25 years. He told me to go find another life." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen moved to Connecticut, attended Yale and began a new life as a writer. 
He has 16 books to his credit, including "Walt, Mickey and Me," an account of 
the lives of the original Mousketeers after they turned in their ears, most of 
which, he says, "were pretty desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no plan when I started," he says. "At that time, Danny Bonaduce ("The 
Partridge Family") was in jail in Florida on drug charges, Todd Bridges 
("Diff'rent Strokes") was going to court on attempted murder, Gary Coleman 
("Diff'rent Strokes") was about to sue his parents and Jay North ("Dennis the 
Menace") was tormented by personal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The roar of the crowd watching Miami's two-minute drill against Pittsburgh on 
"Monday Night Football" is timid compared to the child-actor bull session in 
Petersen's small living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject is financial abuse; horror stories are familiar to all present: 
Petersen, Lee Aaker ("Rin Tin Tin"), Julia Benjamin ("Hazel"), Beverly Washburn 
("Old Yeller"), Bobby Diamond ("Fury") and Randy Boone ("The Virginian").  
</P>
<P>
 "Shirley Temple Black supported a household of 12, including her mother and 
father, throughout her career," recites Petersen. "When she reached the end of 
her career, do you know what she had? A few thousand dollars and the deed to 
her dollhouse in the back yard of her parents' home in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Aaker had $20,000 when he left show business. He said he asked his mother 
recently what happened to the other hundreds of thousands of dollars. She said 
she didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Washburn had $250 when she became an adult. "When my mother sold the 
house she'd bought with my earnings, she gave me $50 to go buy a new pantsuit," 
she says, her eyes welling with tears. "I know she loved me. I guess she just 
didn't know any better." 
</P>
<P>
 California's Coogan Law was enacted in the 1930s, after child actor Jackie 
Coogan successfully sued his parents over the mishandling of his earnings. 
Since then, the law requires that a percentage of the child's earnings be 
placed in blocked accounts. That in theory is fine, Petersen says, but more 
often than not, unscrupulous parents and business managers get the courts to 
set the terms aside, which can be done if the courts believe a better financial 
situation is being created for the child.  
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Gary Coleman. His parents and business managers had Coogan 
Law provisions set aside so they could create a pension fund from Coleman's 
earnings. They omitted telling the judge, however, that they were also 
employees of Coleman's production company. Later, they dissolved the pension 
fund. The parents' pension was $770,000; Coleman's was $220,000. Last year, 
Coleman, 25, successfully sued his parents and managers for $3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met him, he was living in a condo in Fox Hills with a single 
chair and a mattress," says Petersen. "This is a kid whose career is over, who 
has no kidneys and is on dialysis 18 hours a week. He made $24 million during 
his career. Why wasn't there anyone protecting his interests?" 
</P>
<P>
 As devastating as it is to learn you have nothing at the end of your childhood 
career, everyone in Petersen's living room agrees that even worse is finding 
that you are no longer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Ziegler, a Beverly Hills psychologist who specializes in child actors, 
says many of his clients have their development arrested when their TV series 
or movie careers end.  
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are treated like royalty," he says. "Instead of a natural 
childhood of acne and budding breasts, they are pampered, protected and catered 
to. Suddenly, that world ends and they are forced to make this adjustment to 
the real world. Most can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler says the most notable current case in point is Michael Jackson. 
"People spend a lot of time trying to find reasons for his behavior. I think 
there is no question but that most of his problems stem from being a child 
star." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Petersen would like to see legislation passed providing more protection 
to child actors, he believes the lion's share of responsibility should fall to 
the Screen Actors Guild. "With (a budget of several million dollars), you'd 
think the guild could provide independent business managers to these kids. 
You'd think after nine years on 'Diff'rent Strokes,' Dana Plato, or Lisa Loring 
("Addams Family") would qualify for drug and alcohol rehab. But they don't earn 
enough in residuals to qualify for the medical plan, so they're out on the 
street." Both actresses have had very public problems with drug abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 SAG president Barry Gordon, a former child actor himself (among other films, 
he appeared in "The Girl Can't Help It" and "Cinderfella"), declined to 
comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Petersen also believes it is the responsibility of the guild and producers 
alike to make sure there is a stable and safe environment for kids to work in. 
On "Father Knows Best," he points out, America's ideal family was headed by an 
active alcoholic (Robert Young, who has spoken at length about his problem), 
and the child actors -- Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin -- all 
suffered from a variety of personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapin detailed hers (including heroin addiction and a stint as a call girl) 
in her 1988 autobiography, "Father Does Know Best." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things haven't changed that much; there are still shows like that on today," 
says Petersen. "We call 'Diff'rent Strokes' (which is now on the air only in 
reruns) the series from hell: Dana Plato, arrested for shoplifting, drug abuse; 
Todd Bridges, arrested for murder; Gary Coleman, suing his parents to get his 
money. And this town considers it all business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the militancy the group voices in demanding change, A Minor 
Consideration is, at its core, a safe haven for those who have undergone the 
trauma of childhood fame. Julie Benjamin, who has played lots of small parts, 
mostly in commercials, does not fall into any of the group's usual categories. 
She has never abused drugs or alcohol and has worked steadily since her debut 
in a commercial at age 5.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, however, while tending a family barbecue in Florida, Benjamin was 
attacked by a 100-pound Akita and severely mauled. Dozens of stitches, months 
of recuperation and a divorce later, she is still trying to put her life back 
together. And she finds the support of people who have been through the 
grueling spotlight of child stardom somehow can help her. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are my brothers and sisters," she says, gazing around the room. 
"Sometimes I talk and sometimes I cry, but they always give their shoulders."

DAVID A. JAFFE NAMED GETTY CURATOR OF PAINTINGS; ART: THE SCHOLAR IS 
'DELIGHTED. . . . FROM A CURATORIAL POINT OF VIEW THE MUSEUM'S VISION IS A 
DREAM VISION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David A. Jaffe, a former curator of European art at the National Gallery of 
Australia in Canberra, has been named curator of paintings at the J. Paul Getty 
Museum. Jaffe will succeed George R. Goldner, who resigned last October to head 
the departments of drawings and prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe, 40, is a scholar of Italian Renaissance and Baroque art who has 
specialized in the work of 17th-Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens. 
During the last three years he has lived in London and worked independently on 
Rubens projects. His recent accomplishments include writing a book, "Rubens and 
His Friends, Some New Letters," and organizing a major exhibition, "Rubens and 
the Italian Renaissance," for the National Gallery of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the announcement, Getty Museum Director John Walsh said "although he 
is not as well known as many museum curators, he has a really amazing visual 
gift. Furthermore, he has a great deal of experience in the art market, so he 
can help us with great acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely delighted to have got the job," Jaffe said in a telephone 
interview. "I have met the staff, which is very talented and friendly. It's a 
small team, with a family spirit, and I look forward to joining them." Praising 
the museum for proving that a significant art collection can be built in the 
late 20th Century, he said: "From a curatorial point of view the museum's 
vision is a dream vision. And the museum has a hands-off director who 
encourages his curators to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Goldner focused on building the museum's collections of drawings and 
paintings -- occasionally making international news with multimillion-dollar 
purchases -- Jaffe will take on additional responsibilities at the Getty's new 
museum in Brentwood, which is expected to open in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe was educated at the University of Melbourne and at the Courtauld 
Institute of Art in London, where he received a master's degree in art history 
in 1978. During his tenure as curator at Australia's National Gallery, from 
1982-90, he was in charge of temporary exhibitions and acquisitions of European 
art. He will join the Getty's staff on Feb. 1.

ADDRESSING EVERYDAY PAIN IN 'SURVIVAL'; ART: IN HER LACMA INSTALLATION, LIZ 
YOUNG, WHO HAS BEEN IN A WHEELCHAIR FOR 17 YEARS, IS AIMING AT UNIVERSALITY. 
EVERYBODY 'LIVES WITH PAIN AND STRUGGLE,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even without her disability, one would be surprised to find that Liz Young -- 
a bubbly woman with an easy countenance -- could create the artwork showcased 
in "The Dignity of Survival: Desire and Destiny," on view at the L.A. County 
Museum of Art through Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Young says the exhibition -- a room-size installation composed of a caged-in 
room, a guillotine-like shaving stand and an old-fashioned birthing chair 
reminiscent of an electric chair but connected to a ball-and-chain-like trail 
of cast iron bones and internal organs -- is "about how everybody, in a 
day-to-day situation, lives with pain and struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 35, who has been in a wheelchair since her back was broken in a car 
accident at 18, makes work that is highly personal. The birthing chair, for 
instance, has straps that tie one's legs onto the chair and rawhide shoes with 
heavy steel soles that stick to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work, she says, aims at universality. "Obviously, I'm not the only one who 
struggles. I am, most evidently, physically tied to myself here. But I always 
hope that those kind of issues are universal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young's LACMA show is a breakthrough for the artist, whose work has been seen 
at alternative venues such as Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, S.I.T.E. 
and the Foundation for Art Resources' FAR Bazzar. Young is the first artist to 
have an exhibition sponsored by LACMA's Art Here and Now, a 7-year-old 
contemporary art program that grew out of the museum's former Young Talent 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary art program, normally confined to acquiring work by emerging 
and mid-career L.A. artists, made an exception in this case, museum officials 
said, because the curators were so impressed by Young's work that they wanted 
to do more than just acquire a single object. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized that Liz's art form is highly installational and theatrical, 
and we wanted to support that," said LACMA curator Howard N. Fox, who curated 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the installation itself, the museum also sponsored three of her 
"live procedures," performed by Young and five companions using the works in 
her exhibition as props. The last of these "procedures" -- which carry a 
disclaimer advising parental discretion because of partial nudity -- takes 
place Jan. 21 at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who has a companion installation of smaller works on view at Ruth Bloom 
Gallery in Santa Monica through Jan. 13, said she believes that LACMA took "a 
risk" in showing her work because "some people just don't want to look at the 
ideas of life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that she isn't after shock value, Young said she agrees with the 
museum's parental discretion advisory. "After all, I make the work, first, for 
me," she says. "I am interested in this attraction-repulsion thing myself. But 
I'm also trying to use materials and turn them inside out, to make the pieces 
useful but obsolete, to bring in irony." 
</P>
<P>
 Young is as much craftsperson as artist. She was responsible for every element 
of the installation -- from the cardboard covered walls to the unfinished wood 
floors to the welded cage and cast-iron chains, to the crocheted "umbilical 
cord" made with dried animal intestines.

 "I did everything -- I'm interested in making it my space -- good or bad," the 
Otis/Parsons graduate says. "I've been welding for nine or 10 years, so I've 
pretty much got that down now. But I try to incorporate both what it's like to 
be in a man's world -- going to the steel yard and the use of heavy materials 
-- and also incorporate womanly crafty materials. I'm interested in both 
aspects.

 "I make things in pieces, and I do have help. To put that whole cage up at the 
museum -- even an able-bodied person couldn't have done that without help. So 
it's a community effort. I never question, or think, 'I can't do this because 
I'm in a wheelchair.' I just think, 'Who can I call to help me?' 
</P>

 "Next year I will have lived half my life in a wheelchair," she says. "I'm not 
proud of that, but I can't escape it. I don't believe every day that I'm 
tortured, but even if I wasn't in a wheelchair, I don't think anybody can go 
through life without feeling oppressed. And that's what the work is about -- 
the notion of survival amidst these struggles of everyday life."

STATE OF ADDRESS COVERAGE: IT'LL BE SPOTTY; TELEVISION: STATIONS PLAN EXCERPTS 
AND TAPED SHOWINGS, BUT GOV. WILSON'S SPEECH WON'T BE AIRED LIVE TODAY. 
</P>

 Unlike a year ago, none of the seven local VHF television stations were 
planning as of Tuesday afternoon to air live complete coverage of today's State 
of the State address by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL-TV Channel 9, which last year preempted an "I Dream of Jeannie" rerun for 
the speech, decided this year that it would be "best covered within the context 
of its regularly scheduled newscasts," a station spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 p.m. speech, expected to be about 20 minutes long, will be shown at 2:35 
a.m. by KNBC-TV Channel 4 and at 11 a.m. Thursday on the California Channel, a 
public-affairs network carried by some cable systems throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Channel cannot show the address live because it ends its 
broadcast day at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio stations KABC-AM (790), KFI-AM (640) and KNX-AM (1070) do plan live 
coverage of the address. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS-TV Channel 2 plans to show about five minutes of the speech during its 5 
p.m. newscast, and a wrap-up and the Democratic response at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no live complete television coverage of Wilson's address in 1992, 
although KNBC-TV Channel 4 carried it on a delayed basis at 2:05 a.m. and 
KSCI-TV Channel 18 showed it at 6 p.m. interpreted into Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL's live coverage in 1993 earned the station praise from the governor's 
office and in academic circles, but attracted few viewers. The station was the 
lowest rated in the market during the half hour of Wilson's speech. Its 2.8 
rating was dwarfed by newscasts on the three major network owned-and-operated 
stations and by an episode of "Batman: The Animated Series," on KTTV-TV Channel 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jeff Wald, the news director at KCOP-TV Channel 13, the "overriding" reason 
for the live coverage shutout is economics.

 "In this market, the (level of) advertising dollars are not where they used to 
be," Wald said. "If you lose 20-25 minutes of air time, unless it's something 
that's really earthshaking like an earthquake or something that affects a lot 
of the population, a political address is probably better served on the 10 
o'clock news." 
</P>
<P>
 Wald said he would have considered airing Wilson's address in its entirety on 
the 10 p.m. newscast if it were shorter and the governor's comments newsworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The station took a similar approach to Michael Jackson's satellite-delivered 
denial of child molestation accusations last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry L. Berg, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, 
does not find the lack of live coverage unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of something horrendous happening," Berg said, "the stations never 
cover Sacramento anyway, and when they do, they send somebody up there who 
doesn't know as much about Sacramento as the people who are up there all the 
time."
