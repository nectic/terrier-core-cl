O.C.'S UMBERG STILL IN A SPIN AFTER DEFEAT; POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT ASSEMBLYMAN 
WHO LOST HIS BID FOR STATE OFFICE CONTEMPLATES HIS FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It's enough to send anyone reeling. On Election Day, Tom Umberg went from 
Orange County's hottest Democrat to Orange County's most famous also-ran. 
Battered in his effort to unseat Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren by a decisive 
54%-to-39% margin, Umberg will soon be out of politics and out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been spinning the last few days," said Umberg, who abandoned his Garden 
Grove Assembly seat to run statewide. "I'm going to have to sit back for a 
little while and figure out what the future holds. Obviously, I would have 
liked to have been attorney general. But that ain't happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, not all is gloom and doom. Even in defeat, the 39-year-old lawmaker 
remains remarkably resilient, the days ahead still his to seize. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent Southern California law firms have already called. His 
supporters talk optimistically of a possible appointment to a post with the 
U.S. Justice Department. Meanwhile, some politicos continue to insist Umberg 
remains a potentially hot property, tailor-made to run for Congress, district 
attorney, maybe even attorney general again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tom Umberg has a good political future," said Joseph Cerrell, a 
Democrat campaign consultant. "Politics is the art of being at the right place 
at the right time, and he was bucking a Republican year and a Republican 
incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 John Van de Kamp, former state attorney general, said his advice to Umberg has 
been simple: Follow your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a bright future, but where he'll land I don't know," said 
Van de Kamp, who is now in private law practice in Los Angeles. "I think Tom 
really loves public service. I think he'll be back in that in some fashion or 
another. . . . I would think the Clinton Administration and (U.S. Atty. Gen.) 
Janet Reno would find Tom very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans see it far differently, gleefully driving a rhetorical stake into 
the heart of the Democrat who had horrified them most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have met few individuals with a greater naked ambition and lack of 
character than Tom Umberg," said Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, 
a longtime Umberg loather. "He is a fellow who would compromise principle and 
any inkling of values for political expediency like few others. It must be a 
terribly difficult thing to come crashing down with this big a rejection by the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Fuentes doesn't doubt that Umberg could rise from the political 
grave. "He's too much a government type to give it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Umberg isn't ruling out another foray in politics. But such 
thoughts seem a rude intrusion at a time of mourning. "Right now the thought of 
running for office again is like asking someone who had a baby die if they're 
going to have more children," Umberg said. "You just poured your heart and soul 
into something and it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Umberg's political career in Sacramento and the endless campaigns 
have greatly intruded into his family life. The silver lining of defeat is that 
he gets to spend more time with his wife, Robin, and three young children.  
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said he has absolutely no second thoughts about the tough tactics his 
campaign team employed in the attorney general's race. 
</P>
<P>
 As the underdog, he gambled on a television ad that attempted to do what might 
have seemed impossible before the race -- to tag his opponent as soft on crime 
by blaming him in part for the death of 12-year-old kidnaping victim Polly 
Klaas. The controversial TV spot, which showed the girl's grandfather laying 
flowers at her memorial shrine, faulted Lungren for failing to obtain funding 
for a computer system that might have allowed officers to arrest her alleged 
abductor, Richard Allen Davis, before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren denounced the commercial as flat-out wrong, even before it was 
broadcast. Later, he criticized Umberg for taking more than $800,000 in 
campaign contributions from Native American tribes that were battling the 
attorney general over reservation gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg is doing no Monday-morning quarterbacking on the commercial or the 
contributions. The Polly Klaas ad, he reasoned, was necessary to get 
"everyone's attention" amid the TV tumult of California's high-stakes 
governor's race and the costliest U.S. Senate contest in the nation's history. 
Of the money from the Native American casinos, Umberg stressed that the tribes 
have "a legitimate right to electronic games on their reservations and a right 
to play in the political arena." 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercial didn't sour his future," said George Urch, Umberg's campaign 
manager. "People are always looking for the easy answer, and in this race that 
commercial was a wash. If anything, he comes out looking strong. He raised $3.2 
million and he beat Lungren in most of the debates. He won the individual 
battles, but he lost the war." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an assessment some political consultants find hard to swallow. They 
suggest that the Polly Klaas ad, in particular, may have lowered Umberg's stock 
both with the public and political leaders in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Umberg has hurt himself," said Sal Russo, a conservative consultant. "He had 
an uphill battle, but everyone had high expectations for him. A few of my 
Democrat friends were dismayed with the direction he took. He lost some favor. 
And I think the commercial crossed the line of propriety with the public." 
</P>
<P>
 While that debate continues, there is little question among most Orange County 
leaders that Umberg played a key role during his four-year tenure in the 
Capitol. With the Democrats in full control, Umberg was the vital link to the 
ruling party for a county dominated by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he did a great job for Orange County serving people of both 
parties," said Christopher Townsend, an Orange County Democrat who helped with 
the 1992 Clinton campaign. "He represented the progressive moderate our party 
needs. I believe he could have defeated (Republican Rep.) Bob Dornan if he had 
wanted to run for Congress instead. I know Dornan was relieved he didn't run." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg delivered for the county on numerous occasions, lobbying for money to 
widen the Santa Ana Freeway, getting funds for indigent health care, 
shepherding a bill that helped ease the controversy over where to locate a new 
county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, he introduced 98 pieces of legislation, with 65 reaching the 
governor's desk and 53 being signed into law. Among them were a hate-crime bill 
that made it a felony to terrorize an individual based on race or religion, 
another cracking down on boiler-room crime and one designed to cut into 
attorney fraud against the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans such as Fuentes often portrayed Umberg as a puppet of Willie 
Brown, the powerful Democratic Assembly Speaker. They consistently argued that 
Umberg, a former U.S. attorney and military prosecutor, was allowed to vote 
tough on crime and tax issues only so he would run well at election time back 
in conservative Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a characterization that still chafes at Umberg. He characterizes himself 
as a moderate who consistently ran afoul of more liberal members of his party, 
Brown included. He recalls continually butting heads with the Speaker and other 
liberals over immigration and criminal justice bills. 
</P>
<P>
 When Umberg authored a measure to eliminate conjugal prison visits for the 
spouses of convicted murderers, he said, the Democratic caucus "just about took 
my head off." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he criticizes many of his Democratic colleagues for their attitude on 
crime issues, most notably the "three strikes" anti-crime law.  
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to bury their heads in the sand," he said. "They didn't want to 
author responsible alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 As a self-avowed centrist, Umberg said his most profound disappointment with 
Sacramento was the polarization between the parties and the intense 
partisanship that marked the Capitol during his tenure. "For many of my 
colleagues," he said, "it was much more important to embarrass the other party 
than it was to accomplish anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also has a fair share of good memories, most notably the times that the 
process worked. Umberg enjoyed the problem solving, those rare instances of 
bipartisan spirit and the opportunity to do a good deed for a constituent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of his conservative Republican colleagues from Orange County, 
Umberg has never viewed government as the sworn enemy. Late on the last night 
of the 1994 session, Umberg stood in the middle of the Assembly floor and gazed 
at the rows of oak desks, the lofty galleries and velvet drapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood there looking around," Umberg said, "and thought there are very few 
people who have the same sort of privilege to be a policy maker."

GINGRICH LAYS OUT RIGID GOP AGENDA; CONGRESS: AS NEXT HOUSE SPEAKER, REPUBLICAN 
LAWMAKER SAYS HE WILL 'COOPERATE' WITH CLINTON. BUT HE VOWS NO COMPROMISE ON 
HIS 10-POINT PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Newt Gingrich, the firebrand destined to become the first Republican House 
Speaker in 40 years, challenged Washington's "counterculture" Friday to an open 
debate about America's future but warned that he will not give an inch when it 
comes to writing his conservative agenda into law.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very prepared to cooperate with the Clinton Administration," said the 
Georgia congressman, who spearheaded the Republicans' drive to take control of 
the House in Tuesday's elections. But, he said flatly, "I am not prepared to 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first speech since returning to the capital and in an interview with 
The Times, Gingrich made clear that he expects to preside over a freewheeling 
congressional debate about the "cultural meanings of being American" and said 
that he will do little to rein in independent-minded Republicans in House 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a pointed warning to Democrats who might try to block his legislative 
plans, Gingrich predicted that American voters "will move toward a third party 
in a massive way" if partisan squabbling deadlocks Congress in the coming 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokeswoman Friday once more promised cooperation with 
congressional Republicans but questioned whether the GOP can balance the 
budget, as promised, and fulfill its other campaign pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to pass all 10 items, period," said Gingrich, unflinching 
as he waded through a throng of reporters. He was referring to his party's 
10-point "contract with America," a blueprint for legislative change ranging 
from balancing the budget to reforming welfare to limiting politicians' terms 
in office. "And we're not going to compromise on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting one of his harshest attacks on the liberal forces he said now 
dominate Washington, Gingrich declared: "We have to say to the counterculture: 
Nice try. You failed. You're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 On his first day in the capital since Tuesday's elections, Gingrich greeted 
jubilant Republican staff members and began a round of meetings with other 
leaders, including outgoing Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). He is 
expected to meet with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and with 
President Clinton sometime in the next few days, according to staff aides. 
</P>
<P>
 An anticipated meeting between Dole and Gingrich on Friday did not take place. 
Senate and House Republicans have been at odds on many matters and the meeting 
with Dole, who is scheduled to become Senate majority leader in January, is 
likely to emphasize GOP unity.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's meeting with Gephardt came a day after the Georgia Republican wrote 
to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who was voted out of office on 
Tuesday, asking him to ensure that no documents are destroyed during the 
transition to Republican control of the House. Gingrich denied Friday that he 
had meant to impute "sinister" motives to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take over an institution after 40 years, since you have no idea what 
the documents are, because they've all been kept by the Democrats and you've 
never had access to any of them, it seems to me reasonable and prudent to 
suggest that they simply be kept intact as they were on Election Day," Gingrich 
told reporters after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's speech Friday, delivered to an audience of financial and investment 
professionals, represented his most forceful and comprehensive exposition to 
date of the philosophical grounds on which he will challenge the Democrats in 
the next two years. Speaking for more than 30 minutes without notes, the former 
history professor drew a sharp contrast between the principles he said underlie 
Republican priorities and those which in his view guide the Democrats' policy 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Alexis de Tocqueville as well as 
Alvin Toffler, author of the more recent "Future Shock," Gingrich said that the 
Republican victory Tuesday was a victory for "some fairly big ideas."  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to simply, calmly, methodically reassert American civilization. . . . 
And I believe that starts with the work ethic," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Gingrich painted those who have dominated Washington in recent 
years as embracing "counterculture values, bigger government, redistributionist 
economics and bureaucracies deciding how you should spend your money." He added 
pointedly: "They were on the losing end in virtually every part of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Gingrich shrink from recent criticism that in the closing days of the 
campaign, he had used an apparently senseless crime -- the case of a South 
Carolina mother charged with murdering her children -- for partisan gain. On 
several occasions Friday, Gingrich linked crime to a breakdown of American 
society, blaming both on policies embraced by the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear gunshots in your nation's capital at night and you know that 
young Americans have died needlessly, then I would suggest to you that we have 
every reason to have the moral courage to confront every weakness of the 
current structure and to replace it," Gingrich said. "And if the first wave of 
experiments fail, to have the courage to say, 'Well, that one didn't work,' and 
have a second one and a third one and a fourth one." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Gingrich said he believes that Republicans 
have "a nine- to 12-month window to actually get something positive done" 
before the presidential campaign dominates, making further achievement 
difficult. During that period, he made clear, he will give Republican members 
the latitude to pursue their own legislative priorities and will not stress 
loyalty to him or his agenda in meting out Republican leadership jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to consciously decentralize and disburse and delegate and you want 
people to go off and be as creative as possible. You just want to make sure 
it's in a general direction you agree on," Gingrich said. "You try to 
micro-manage and centralize, you'll destroy the system and you won't get 
anything done and you'll get everyone mad at you." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Gingrich stressed that he will be the final arbiter of which 
issues come to the House floor for debate and voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very hard . . . to bring something up against a Speaker that 
doesn't want it to be brought up," Gingrich said. Asked whether he would permit 
legislation making all abortion illegal -- a measure fervently backed by some 
Republicans but which is a divisive issue in the party -- he said flatly: "That 
won't happen." Profile: Newt Gingrich 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is in line to become the 
next Speaker of the U.S. House: 
</P>
<P>
 * Age: 51 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree from Emory University, master's degree from 
Tulane University and a doctorate from Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career: Taught history at West Georgia College, 1970-78. Elected to the 
House in 1978 and reelected to eight consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal: Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, have two children from his 
previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: On the new Republican gains in Congress: "It is an extraordinary

FATE OF FOSTER CHILDREN UNCLEAR AFTER PROP. 187; SOCIAL SERVICES: O.C. 
OFFICIALS WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN STORE FOR THE 67 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT YOUTHS IN 
THEIR CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Social Services officials are anxiously trying to determine the fate of 67 
illegal immigrants in the Orange County foster care system whose futures are 
uncertain in the wake of the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers and foster care providers are worried that the youngsters, many 
of whom were abused and abandoned by their parents, may be left with no place 
to go if funding for their foster placements is withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned because these kids are victims of abuse and neglect," said 
Larry Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency. "Federal and 
state law requires us to protect all these kids and legal status isn't 
mentioned. Does 187 change that? If so, what are we to do with the kids in our 
system who we find are undocumented?" 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, passed overwhelmingly by voters Tuesday, bars illegal immigrants 
from receiving educational, social and non-emergency medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has approximately 3,000 minors in its foster care system who are 
either living with families or in group homes. Their immigration status is not 
routinely checked by social workers when they enter the system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure (state officials) are aware of this potential dilemma," 
Leaman said. "Policy-makers need to address this situation so we're not flying 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaman was told this week that state officials are in the process of 
developing emergency regulations on how to enforce the proposition. Until then, 
he said, "We're not changing anything."  
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits have been filed in courts throughout the state challenging 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leaman is worried nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you let your imagination run wild, you can envision kids who are victims 
with no ability of government to spend money to help them," he said. "Maybe 
there's something in the fine print of 187 that says nothing changes." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the measure's co-authors, Harold Ezell, said even he isn't sure how the 
proposition will affect foster kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we don't have a set answer on," Ezell said. "You put these 
broad parameters out there and the refinement is done in the regulations. But 
whether a child or young adult is a ward of the court or in foster care doesn't 
change their immigration status." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, a former western regional commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said illegal immigrant foster children may require 
special attention if the law is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have been orphaned or abandoned or delinquent, all of that has to be 
taken into consideration with an immigration judge," Ezell said. "They may have 
to go before an immigration judge and ask for a stay of deportation." 
</P>
<P>
 County records reveal several dozen examples of children who were brought to 
California illegally, then abused, neglected or abandoned. Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 14-year-old boy who was sent by his family in Mexico to California to live 
with his older brother. The brother abandoned the youth, who went to work as a 
live-in maid for an Orange County family and then was fired from that job. The 
homeless youngster jumped off a bridge, but survived and was placed in a group 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 12-year-old boy whose mother moved to North Carolina to find work, leaving 
him in the care of her boyfriend. A short time later, the boyfriend abandoned 
the child, who is now in a group home. 
</P>
<P>
 * An 8-year-old girl who was brought here from Romania in 1990 by her adoptive 
mother. She was abandoned and left in an abusive situation with the adoptive 
mother's relatives. The child is now living in a group home. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 16-year-old boy from England, who was neglected and exploited by his 
father. The boy received a large settlement from an auto accident and the 
father tried to use the money for his own personal gain while refusing to seek 
medical and psychological care for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 14-year-old boy whose mother held his hand over a burning stove, cut him 
with a kitchen knife and struck him with a broom and metal tubing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are kids who are so fragile and have been injured emotionally, 
physically and spiritually," said Mary Ann Xavier, director of the Florence 
Crittenton Center in Fullerton, a residential treatment center for 180 troubled 
children and youth. "They've already been totally uprooted and put into another 
environment and now another fear has been thrown into them. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are really damaged kids and we'd like them to be at ease," Xavier 
added. "It's real scary to them. We have been taking their emotional pulse. We 
have kids who are asking how they can become legal. We also have girls who are 
illegal but have babies who are legal and that creates a real complication." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier said other children are concerned because some of their relatives are 
illegal immigrants. "Wherever their families are, they may not be there when 
they go looking for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier said that until they are ordered to do otherwise, staff members at the 
center's two campuses have vowed to continue business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a commitment that our first obligation is to protect these kids 
and keep them safe," Xavier said. "Whether or not we are for 187, we leave that 
at the door when we come to work."

 HALLOW VICTORY? Add Orange Unified Schools Supt. Robert L. French to those 
unhappy about Disneyland giving free entrance on Halloween -- a smashing 
success for the Anaheim amusement park, with more than 40,000 visitors. French 
wrote Disneyland of his displeasure. Elementary school absences in his district 
that day more than doubled, and the district lost $6,000 in state revenue, 
which is based on attendance. . . . Said French: "As an educator, I am offended 
by this action." Note: Halloween 1995 is on a Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 CHECK MATES: When chess organizer Eric Hicks recently got permission to start 
a chess club at Las Palmas Elementary in San Clemente, he predicted to students 
they'd love it more than milk caps. . . . "Now, they're starting to believe 
me," he said. The club is so successful that the game is spreading to other 
campuses of the Capistrano Unified School District. District trustees this week 
established a formal chess program, in cooperation with the U.S. Chess 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 BOTH SIDES NOW: Not only is the Fullerton-Rancho Santiago community college 
rivalry the oldest in the state, it's also the closest. . . . The teams have 
met 70 times and the series stands at 33-33-4. They meet tonight at 7 at the 
Cal State Fullerton campus with first place on the line in the Mission 
Conference Central Division. Each is 4-0 in the division. Rancho Santiago Coach 
Dave Ogas played for Fullerton when it won the 1965 national championship. . . 
. Said Ogas: "I'm telling our players, 'I was once the enemy.' You can't lie to 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 RUN WITH HART: Wyatt Hart, top vote-getter in the San Juan Capistrano City 
Council election, raised the most money, but it also didn't hurt that his name 
was already well known in South County. For five years, Hart served as media 
spokesman for Sheriff Brad Gates. . . . The retired sheriff's captain figured 
his name appeared in newspapers "a few thousand times" long before he entered 
the race, and added: "I'm sure it did help."

 Despite 20 years of affirmative action policies in the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department, women and minorities have been locked out of top-level posts and 
reportedly subjected to widespread sexual and racial harassment at "rookie kill 
stations," where efforts are made to run them out of the department, according 
to a city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also suffers from a perception of "nepotism, cronyism" and a 
promotional system based on "who you know," the Personnel Department found in a 
confidential study obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal of work remains to be done by the Fire Department, not only to 
create a work force which reflects the community it serves, but to establish 
and maintain a healthy, positive working environment which encourages success 
for all its members," said the draft 225-page report, which was commissioned by 
the City Council in April in response to numerous complaints from minority 
firefighters. They included allegations of hazing, isolation, ridicule for 
making mistakes and a lack of promotional opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a concerted effort on the part of Fire Department management to 
dispel the perception and incidence of nepotism, cronyism, differential 
application of discipline, differential treatment of women and minorities and a 
'good old boy' syndrome," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the 3,100-member department disputed the report's findings 
Friday, saying they were based on unscientific methodology, inaccurate figures 
and anonymous statements from a small number of biased firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just rife with inaccuracies and absolutely incorrect information," said 
Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, a department spokesman. "It's the shabbiest 
piece of staff work that I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a hatchet job," said Fire Chief Donald O. Manning, who said the 
sampling of firefighters interviewed represented a scant 2% of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which will be made public Wednesday at a hearing of the council's 
Personnel Committee, was based on an analysis of hiring practices since 1974 
and interviews with 84 former and current firefighters. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 20 top department officials and administrators, 95% are white men, 
and there are no Asian Americans, women or blacks. Minority representation in 
those ranks is less than it was in 1990, when white men held 83% of the chief, 
deputy chief and assistant chief slots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women and minority firefighters reported a significant amount of hostility 
at eight so-called "kill stations," where "management allegedly sends (female 
and minority rookies) specifically to see them fail." At these stations, also 
called "houses of pain," the firefighters said they were ostracized and given 
inadequate training. 
</P>
<P>
 * At other stations, captains called Latinos "lazy Mexicans" and told a rookie 
African American firefighter: "I don't want to see your black ass make it."  
</P>
<P>
 * Officials who hold key administrative positions that serve as promotional 
springboards are often allowed to recommend their replacements. Information 
about promotions is not widely publicized. Consequently, "members outside those 
circles do not have a clear idea of the qualifications management is seeking." 
</P>
<P>
 * The department needs to develop comprehensive manuals addressing race 
discrimination and sex discrimination in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who requested the audit, said Friday the report 
highlights longstanding problems that have been tolerated by department 
officials. He said he did not doubt the accuracy of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an obvious problem here that simply has to be corrected," he said. 
"I'm very anxious to see how the department is going to step up to the plate 
and correct these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fire Commissioner Larry Gonzalez: "I have received a number of complaints 
from minority firefighters, particularly Latinos, who have said to me it is 
very difficult to promote within the department. . . . I don't need a report to 
tell me there is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg had read only about 40 pages of the report Friday 
but said she was particularly troubled that officials are able to recommend 
their own replacements.  
</P>
<P>
 "One thing for sure, we need a merit-based system," said Goldberg, chairwoman 
of the Personnel Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Manning has proposed a department reorganization that would increase 
minority and female hiring and promotion by starting career guidance programs 
and beefing up outreach efforts. The plan would also improve tracking of 
discrimination allegations and revise complaint procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The department was not integrated until after the U.S. Supreme Court's 
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education ruling in 1954. Since 1974, the 
department has operated under a federal consent decree that settled a 
discrimination lawsuit. The department agreed that at least half of all new 
recruits would be black, Latino or Asian American each year until the 
percentages of those minorities in the department equaled the percentages in 
the city population.  
</P>
<P>
 The decree was amended in 1981 to allow officials to limit the percentage of 
white applicants to achieve the 50% minority figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the department is 62% white, 23% Latino, 11% black and 4% Asian. 
Women make up 3% of the force. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit acknowledged that the consent decree has sparked resentment among 
many white firefighters, who feel that it is reverse discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Cathey said the department has exceeded the goals of the decree by making 
minorities 57% of all new hires, increasing overall minority representation by 
600% since 1974. And the department has made a 242% increase in the number of 
minorities in promotional ranks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning noted that ethnic representation among African American firefighters 
mirrors their population percentage in the city. He also noted that an American 
Civil Liberties Union study of regional fire departments, released last month, 
found that the city Fire Department ranked among the best in terms of ethnic 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters quoted in the audit said a disproportionate number of female and 
minority recruits were sent to the eight "rookie kill stations." There, 
firefighters said, women and minorities were denied training when they asked 
for assistance and were ridiculed when they made mistakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "In contrast, white male probationers who made similar mistakes were believed 
to have been treated with less harshness or given encouragement," the report 
said. "It was also noted that the tactics of isolation and hazing are used to 
create a hostile environment for women and minorities."  
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters interviewed faulted captains at the allegedly troubled 
stations for not discouraging the abusive behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Problems were reported at other stations. One black rookie who quit the 
department said he was racially harassed by a captain who told him: "You are 
slowly growing to be a pain. I don't want to see your black ass make it 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 At another station, a Latino firefighter, who also quit, said the captain 
called Latinos "stupid Mexicans" on two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Cathey said he could not independently verify whether such 
comments were made but added that the department does not tolerate 
insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit acknowledged that the department has made significant improvements 
at entry-level firefighter positions, noting that overall minority 
representation in the department has increased by 32% among uniformed members.  
</P>
<P>
 But diversity has not been reflected in the upper managerial ranks, the report 
found.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is felt that 20 years under a consent decree is sufficient time to produce 
a representation level higher than what is present," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of representation, according to the audit, is the result of several 
factors.  
</P>
<P>
 When vacancies occur in certain "plum" assignments -- jobs in which officials 
work directly with a chief officer and learn administrative procedures -- there 
has been a reliance upon incumbents to identify possible replacements, the 
report said. Those positions include medical liaison and administrative justice 
positions, which have been filled mainly by white men. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a near total consensus that these positions are filled almost 
exclusively on the basis of nepotism and cronyism and that work-related 
qualifications are not the primary basis for selection," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also cited a "lack of equal access concerning career promotion" as 
another hurdle to minority and female promotions. Some firefighters interviewed 
charged that captains refused to offer training at stations. Others said that 
training and promotional materials were not uniformly distributed at the city's 
103 fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Further, because personal referral has served as the basis for so much 
placement in the department, members outside of those circles do not have a 
clear idea of the qualifications management is seeking, particularly for 
special duty positions," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said that it takes time for diversity to reach the upper levels, but 
that the department is making significant progress. "It's coming along and we 
are making great strides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief also said the position of officer in charge of overseeing 
affirmative action matters was eliminated because of budget cuts three years 
ago. However, that position has been proposed in the reorganization, Manning 
said.

COLUMN ONE; A KILLER'S SANITY MAY FREE HIM; AFTER DAVID LEE NAGEL SLASHED HIS 
GRANDPARENTS, A GEORGIA JURY SENT HIM TO A HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF TO PRISON. BUT 
EXPERTS NOW SAY HE WAS NEVER MENTALLY ILL. SO THE STATE MUST RELEASE HIM -- OR 
DEFY THE LAW.

<TEXT>
<P>
 By the spring of 1981, the question of what to do with David Lee Nagel 
suggested a grim but unequivocal answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel had spent his adolescence bouncing among jails, youth camps and mental 
hospitals. He had racked up what the psychologists called a "long history of 
antisocial behavior," meaning fights, breaking and entering, auto theft, 
fleeing the police and attacking a counselor. He had also, on the night of May 
8, 1981, in this region about 70 miles southwest of Atlanta, stabbed his 
grandparents to death, apparently because they had denied him their car keys. 
</P>
<P>
 When three state doctors soon after pronounced the 19-year-old sane, 
responsible for his acts and competent to stand trial, the Troup County 
district attorney did not hesitate. It was clear to him that Nagel should be 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurors at his murder trial thought otherwise. Exactly why they balked 
remains a matter of speculation. Perhaps they were swayed by Nagel's tenure in 
mental institutions, or the vague references in his records to schizophrenia. 
Perhaps they shrank from sending a frail teen-ager to the executioner. Or 
perhaps they could not imagine -- could not accept -- that anyone who was 
mentally sound could commit such an act of butchery. Whatever the reason, 
jurors on Dec. 2, 1981, found Nagel not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 For 13 years, the verdict didn't much matter; Nagel, whom the court ordered 
institutionalized, simply disappeared behind the bars of a maximum-security 
mental hospital rather than a prison. Now the verdict does matter. Now the 
verdict means that Georgia faces the unappealing prospect of releasing a double 
killer -- or defying state mental health laws and the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of caring for him, the state's top mental health experts have 
concluded that David Nagel is not mentally ill -- and in fact was never 
mentally ill. "Nagel does not meet the legal criteria for involuntary 
commitment to a mental institution," declares forensic psychiatrist Dr. Everett 
Kuglar, acting superintendent of the Georgia Mental Health Institute. "Nagel 
should be released." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court may eventually agree. Two years ago, looking at a 
patient much like Nagel, the justices said Louisiana could not continue to 
confine Terry Foucha once a mental hospital decided that he showed no sign of 
mental illness.  
</P>
<P>
 The due process clause of the 14th Amendment just won't allow it, the justices 
declared. You can't confine someone in a mental hospital for what he's done in 
the past, or might do in the future, if he isn't mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nagel, Foucha -- found not guilty by reason of insanity in an aggravated 
burglary case -- was diagnosed as having an "antisocial personality" and had a 
history of altercations while confined. Like Nagel, he may have suffered from a 
"drug-induced psychosis" at the time of his crime. Like Nagel, he could find no 
doctors willing to guarantee that he would not be dangerous in the future. No 
matter. "As Foucha was not convicted, he may not be punished," wrote Justice 
Byron R. White for the majority. "Louisiana has by reason of his acquittal 
exempted Foucha from criminal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 To Everett Kuglar, the Foucha decision makes obvious what must be done with 
Nagel. The state psychiatrist well understands the desire to confine a killer 
-- in fact, he believes Nagel should have been convicted of murder -- but he 
flatly declines the role of jailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our problem today what mistake the justice system made years ago," 
Kuglar said. "If you can't get a jury to convict . . . well, that's it. It's 
not the business of a mental hospital to retain people who aren't mentally 
ill."  
</P>
<P>
 Georgia judges, however, don't see it that way. From the trial level to the 
state Supreme Court, they don't appear inclined to let Nagel go. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in its wisdom found Nagel insane, these judges proclaim, and we presume 
he continues to be insane. Nothing Nagel now offers proves otherwise; nothing 
establishes that he will not turn violent again if released. "Weighty as the 
medical experts' testimony may be," Troup County Superior Court Judge Allan B. 
Keeble observed in denying Nagel's release, "this court must balance that 
testimony against the seriousness of (Nagel's) acts." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Nagel's victims puts the matter more directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what the psychiatrists say," declares Emmett Frank Marshall Jr., 
who is Nagel's uncle. "For what he done to my parents, I don't think he should 
ever be released." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's little sympathy for Nagel here in Troup County. In small ways and 
large, he has tormented the region for much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from an abusive and broken family, he landed, at age 15, in a Christian 
boys' home, which soon asked that he be removed. Back in LaGrange, he spent 
four years in relatives' homes and assorted institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd get into trouble, he'd be real sorry," Emmett Marshall recalled. "He'd 
con you, telling you this sad story about how he was going to straighten out, 
wanted to do right. And for a while, he would do OK. But it would never last." 
</P>
<P>
 No one felt able to deal with him: An exasperated high school principal asked 
that Nagel withdraw after a few weeks in class; his grandparents said they 
feared him; a youth detention camp counselor decided "David needs constant 
institutionalization and therapy more than any other kid I've worked with." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel was clearly troubled, but was he mentally ill? Various Georgia doctors' 
diagnoses never involved what physicians and state law define as mental illness 
-- a "disorder of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment, 
behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to cope with the ordinary 
demands of life." Rather, Nagel was seen as a more familiar type: a highly 
disturbed adolescent, suffering from depression, anxiety, low frustration level 
and poor impulse control. Nagel also abused drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 His perceived problems were what the doctors categorize as "behavioral," not 
psychotic. As a result, the doctors treating Nagel never believed he justified 
involuntary commitment, which requires, among other things, a finding of mental 
illness. Once the doctors stabilized Nagel, they felt they had to release him 
if and when he wished to go. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened in December, 1980. This time it was from the West Central 
Georgia Regional Hospital in Columbus. In early April, Nagel's mother, unable 
to deal with his drinking, drug abuse and hostile behavior, sent him back to 
West Central. On April 23, the hospital released him to his maternal 
grandparents, Frank Emmett Marshall Sr. and Mattie Louise Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Nagel stabbed his grandparents, cut their throats and dumped 
them in the countryside. Then he drove around with two friends before renting a 
motel room. Questioned the next day by LaGrange police, Nagel confessed, 
appearing calm and remorseless. He'd been drinking and taking pills (possibly 
PCP), he explained. Other than that, he offered no motive. 
</P>
<P>
 No transcript exists of Nagel's trial, only the memories of those few 
involved. Mack Reynolds, the young lawyer appointed by the court to defend 
Nagel in the only death penalty case ever tried in Troup County, recalls that 
he could not even get his client's mother or minister to testify on his behalf. 
Nor could he call a medical expert to the stand, for the court provided no 
funds to hire one. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had going for him, to counter three state doctors' testimony that the 
defendant was not mentally ill, were the records from Nagel's 22-month stay at 
a private Florida psychiatric hospital in 1979-80 -- records that happen to 
include tenuous references to "pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia." 
</P>
<P>
 This diagnosis -- which could be applied broadly to anyone a doctor thought 
might have some characteristics of a schizophrenic -- is no longer used 
anywhere, by anyone. In fact, the American Psychiatric Assn. dropped it as a 
recognized diagnosis in 1980, the very year Nagel was being diagnosed, and a 
full year before his murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just was not reliable, certainly not for the legal system," explains Dr. 
Robert Miller, chief psychiatrist for the Colorado Department of Corrections. 
"It was way too subjective. There was no scientific evidence for its 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the records containing this diagnosis would not have been admissible 
without testimony from Nagel's doctor in Florida. But the district attorney -- 
aware travel funds were limited and apparently confident of a conviction -- 
stipulated their entry into evidence. That gave Reynolds a chance to talk about 
them in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any good lawyer can testify better than an expert," Reynolds said recently. 
"I can't exactly recall what the records said, but they supported my philosophy 
of the case. My philosophy of the case was, 'These murders were so horrible 
nobody in their right mind would have done that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors apparently bought that theme, thereby riling much of Georgia. For 
weeks after the trial, outraged citizens bombarded Reynolds with hostile calls. 
At the next session of the state Legislature, politicians did away with the 
"not guilty by insanity" category entirely, changing it to "guilty but mentally 
ill."  
</P>
<P>
 None of this altered Nagel's situation, of course. The task of confining him 
still fell to doctors and counselors, rather than wardens and prison guards. 
More precisely, the task of confining Nagel eventually fell to Kuglar, who 
knows all too well what acts are within the realm of sane human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he met him in 1985, Kuglar thought Nagel was not psychotic. 
Kuglar then was superintendent of the Georgia Regional Hospital in Augusta, 
where Nagel was confined. 
</P>
<P>
 In a building full of psychotics, half of them schizophrenic, 90% of them 
violent, most of them dazed and deluded, Nagel stood out. So in time, Kuglar 
became well acquainted with him.  
</P>
<P>
 What he saw was an angry, insecure young man, full of guilt, the product of a 
chaotic family. What he saw, in other words, was not unusual for young men in 
their 20s, at least not the ones who come Kuglar's way. Most admissions to 
adolescent units are there because of their behavior, not because they are 
mentally ill. Nagel had a personality disorder. Nagel most decidedly needed to 
stay away from liquor and drugs. Nagel undeniably had brutally killed two 
people.  
</P>
<P>
 But to Kuglar, Nagel had nothing approaching the type of thought or mood 
disorder that defined mental illness in Georgia. Where true psychotics such as 
schizophrenics were withdrawn, detached and delusional, Nagel was direct, 
lucid, engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly, he had killed his grandparents during a temporary drug-induced 
psychosis. But there had been no substances to abuse since, and no evidence of 
mental disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the criteria for civil commitment, you had to be mentally ill, and 
dangerous to yourself or others, and in need of involuntary inpatient 
treatment. You had to be all three of these. To Kuglar, Nagel just didn't meet 
these criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 This conclusion pulled Kuglar into unfamiliar territory. For 35 years, he has 
straddled the Georgia mental health and legal systems, running hospitals while 
evaluating defendants for Georgia courts. More often than not, he is the 
state's expert, proclaiming a defendant competent to stand trial. More often 
than not, this judgment makes the prosecutor's case for conviction and prison. 
Now, this same judgment was making the case for Nagel's release. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years in the 1980s, Kuglar didn't have to face such a difficult 
prospect. Nagel didn't want to leave the mental hospital. The hospital meant 
security and structure; the hospital protected him from the community's anger 
and his own demons. So Kuglar obliged him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel received not anti-psychotic drugs or formal psychotherapy, but 
"socialization" -- a small part-time job, activities, recreation. In 1989, he 
was transferred to Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, but Kuglar also 
ended up at Central State that year, as medical director of the forensic 
services division. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined now by Robert Storms, the senior forensic psychologist there, Kuglar 
talked regularly with Nagel, not in formal therapy sessions, but in hallways 
and offices, where Nagel worked buffing floors. Watching him write to female 
friends, weep when his mother made a rare visit, earnestly mull over problems 
with the hospital staff, Kuglar and Storms grew to like Nagel. They liked him 
despite his occasional fights with other patients; they liked him despite his 
occasional tendency to threaten escape, suicide or attacks on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar and Storms didn't take the threats seriously. To them, Nagel was simply 
trying to manipulate his environment, as all people do.  
</P>
<P>
 The fights meant even less to the doctors. In the Binion Building, Nagel had 
to deal with truly psychotic patients. Three times, he had ended up in scuffles 
started by the other guy, and had been placed in seclusion. In one of those 
cases, a big guy sitting over in a corner working on his delusions had finally 
decided Nagel was the devil. It was very tough, Kuglar and Storms well knew, to 
keep your cool with some of these folks.  
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar and Storms eventually concluded that Nagel not only wasn't psychotic, 
but in fact had never been. Schizophrenia and manic-depressive illnesses are 
primarily progressive. Nagel could not have been schizophrenic at age 19, 
Kuglar reasoned, and now show no signs of the disease. Kuglar had known about 
3,000 patients fairly well. He'd never seen one do anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar thought references in Nagel's record to pseudopsychopathic 
schizophrenia were "nonsense terms" -- part of a game played by therapists 
seeking insurance payments. Kuglar couldn't entirely condemn those who played 
that game. If you needed such a diagnosis to get funding so you could treat 
your patient, maybe such actions were justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Justified -- but not accurate.  
</P>
<P>
 By the fall of 1990, Nagel wanted out. No longer did he desire the security of 
a mental hospital. He wanted a hearing on whether he met commitment criteria. 
He wanted a lawyer. He wanted Kuglar's help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Central State Hospital's Forensic Division Team convened in May, 
1991, to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Nagel, all involved appreciated 
the difficult question they faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel had committed a heinous crime. He was in their words, "impulsive, 
immature, naive, unpredictable, manipulative and somewhat antisocial." Nagel 
would fit well in most prison populations. His ability to function in the 
community was uncertain, since he had spent most of his life in institutions. 
He might return to liquor and drugs once his forced abstinence ended. Kuglar 
didn't think that would happen, but no one could guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that to be used as a rationale to keep Nagel confined in a mental 
hospital? If so, how long could he be held? On what basis? On what basis would 
he get out? Did he first need to prove he wouldn't be dangerous in the future? 
Wasn't that an insurmountable burden? Wasn't that unconstitutional preventive 
detention?  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his behavioral problems, Nagel was alert, concise and communicative. 
His insight and judgment were normal. He appeared to be in good contact with 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's conclusions and recommendations were, in the end, unanimous: Nagel 
was not psychotic and therefore did not meet the criteria for continued 
hospitalization. The process for Nagel's release should be initiated in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "David Nagel is an easy one to live with," Kuglar said of this decision. "It's 
not even close. I get some I don't sleep over, I get some I feel torn about. 
David is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 By September of 1991, both Central State hospital and Nagel's attorney -- 
Torin Togut of the Georgia Legal Services Program -- had filed petitions 
seeking a discharge hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 In Georgia, release hearings must be conducted by the court that originally 
committed the patient. The trial judge at Nagel's murder trial had retired and 
the prosecutor was working in Nevada. No matter -- on Oct. 17, 1991, Nagel, in 
pursuit of his freedom, returned to Troup County, to the scene of the slayings 
and his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was waiting. "Hearing Thursday May Free Killer Nagel" warned the 
banner headline atop Page One of the LaGrange Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With David Nagel once again in their midst, albeit shackled, it cannot be said 
that the citizens of Troup County were overly concerned with the fine points of 
Georgia mental health laws or U.S. Supreme Court rulings. In truth, it mattered 
little to some whether or not Nagel was insane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was ever anything wrong with David," the victims' son 
Emmett Marshall told a reporter just before the hearing. "He was just mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, officers brought Nagel to the LaGrange courtroom in handcuffs and 
foot chains. No longer a frail, nervous youth, he sported a goatee, 
shoulder-length brown hair, and muscles derived from years of bodybuilding. 
Guards were everywhere, inspecting the courtroom and the 20 spectators, among 
them Nagel's mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten years before, the state had argued Nagel sane and responsible, while the 
defense had argued him incompetent. Now these positions were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Kuglar remained consistent. "No, I don't think David meets the commitment 
criteria," he told the court. "I don't think he ever met it, to be honest with 
you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus this day was not on commitment criteria, however. The focus was on 
Nagel's stormy, violent history. The hospital fights and threats that looked 
commonplace to the doctors looked like danger signs to Judge Allen Keeble and 
the county district attorney. And Kuglar could offer no guarantees to assuage 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think David would present any harm to others in the near or immediate 
future," Kuglar explained. "I doubt seriously if he would ever. . . . But then 
you want me to predict whether he will or not. . . . I can't predict that. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our feelings about the release are not based on the fact that we think David 
has been very perfect. It's based on the fact that we don't think he has a 
mental illness that meets the state's criteria for continued hospitalization. 
Now, what he may do when he gets out, I don't know. . . . But I have strong 
feelings that anything he does, he will not be doing it because of mental 
illness. He will be doing it because he made a choice to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to such comments all morning, Judge Keeble felt compelled to 
step in. Intentionally or not, he began to lead Kuglar through a field full of 
legal land mines. 
</P>
<P>
 "As best I can understand what you're saying is that in your opinion, Mr. 
Nagel has no serious mental problem now and never has had any?" Keeble asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my opinion, Your Honor." 
</P>
<P>
 "So I assume, then, that it would be your opinion that those 12 Troup County 
jurors in 1981 who found him not guilty by reason of insanity made a mistake?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir."  
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar -- all jowls and wrinkles, gruff and blunt, with no taste for small 
talk or testing the political currents -- had managed to trample a bit on the 
concept that a jury's verdict establishes a legal verity. In doing so, it would 
emerge later, he had also managed to trample on the Georgia Supreme Court's 
sensibilities. But at this moment, Judge Keeble, low-key and reserved of 
manner, looked more perplexed than triumphant at where he had led the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems," Keeble said, "very difficult for me to look at the situation in 
which an individual essentially butchers his grandparents . . . without 
concluding . . . that such an act could only have occurred had the person been 
abnormal in some respects from a mental standpoint. . . . From a lay 
standpoint, for a person to do this kind of thing he has to be mentally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 If only that were so, Kuglar thought. If only sane people didn't do brutal 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Out loud, he said: "Those people who think that have not had firsthand 
experience with what severe abuse of some of these drugs would do." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge digested this comment. Watching from his seat, even Nagel's attorney 
Togut sensed Keeble was trying to be fair. This judge had a reputation in 
Togut's office as being the best in the circuit. No judge in this circumstance, 
Togut believed, could handle the case differently. Certainly no judge who lived 
in Troup County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming you are correct," Keeble continued, "and the jury made a mistake . . 
. there is nothing we can do about that. That's a legal fact at this point. . . 
. One of the things that I guess concerns me most is that in April of 1981 
someone came to the very same conclusion that you have . . . And less than a 
month after that (Nagel) murdered two people." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar wouldn't budge; the lawyers in Georgia, having failed to confine Nagel, 
could not so easily ask the doctors to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your honor. . . ," he said, "it is not the business of mental hospitals to 
keep retained those people who might be dangerous if they do not have the 
mental illness. The mental illness has to be there first." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this enduring conflict between the interests of the community and 
the concerns for individual rights, Keeble and Kuglar's revealing exchange 
finally reached an impasse.  
</P>
<P>
 "OK," the judge said. "That's all the questions I have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kuglar's efforts just didn't wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the medical experts' testimony, despite the failure of the state to 
offer any contrary medical opinion, despite the U.S. Supreme Court's Foucha 
decision, Judge Keeble, in denying Nagel's release, ruled that "his acts of 
butchering can only be described as depraved and senseless." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a defendant is determined to be insane and to meet the criteria for civil 
commitment, by state law "this condition is presumed to continue." The Superior 
Court, and not mental health professionals, "has the responsibility for 
deciding applications for release." Before "this court can conclude that Nagel 
is sane," there must be "at least a better than even chance that his condition 
will persist." 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Supreme Court, ruling on appeal last spring, went even further 
than Keeble. Where Keeble at least acknowledged the medical experts, the high 
court flatly said Kuglar and Storms' testimony "deserved no weight whatsoever." 
By law the jury's verdict established Nagel's mental illness, "so the issue to 
be determined was whether Nagel's sanity had been restored," not "whether the 
jury had made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuglar and Storms were, in effect, "attempting to impeach the original verdict 
of the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Supreme Court's ruling will not be the last word in the matter of 
David Nagel. In July, Nagel's attorney Togut filed a habeas corpus petition in 
U.S. District Court. As he moves the case from the state to the federal legal 
system, Togut will press a number of legally substantive arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 He will cite the Foucha vs. Louisiana decision. He will quote Justice Leah 
Sears-Collins, the solitary dissenter on the seven-person Georgia high court, 
who argued that her colleagues have created a "Catch-22" in which Nagel, to 
prevail, would have to "convince a psychiatrist to testify falsely . . . that 
the jury reached the correct result." He will talk of preventive detention and 
insurmountable obstacles and the 14th Amendment. Most fundamentally, he will 
plead for "the principle of law" to prevail.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not these arguments succeed, the question of what to do with Nagel 
promises to continue to haunt Georgia much as it has for the past 15 years. The 
state, after all, has no satisfactory solution. Everyone involved knows Nagel 
belongs neither at large, nor in a mental hospital; Nagel belongs in prison. 
But Georgia can't put him there. 
</P>
<P>
 As he considered that notion one recent afternoon, Everett Kuglar sat at his 
desk, staring out a window at a rolling lawn at the Georgia Mental Health 
Institute in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weightless," the justices had called his opinion. What should he have done, 
lie? Agree that a person "must be crazy" to commit brutal murders? That Nagel 
once was mentally ill? That the jury got it right?  
</P>
<P>
 "If society doesn't like the laws, change it," Kuglar rumbled. "If society 
wants a person to spend the same number of years in a mental hospital as he 
would have in prison, then say so. Don't have the law say that as soon as a 
person doesn't meet commitment criteria, he gets out, then use ruses and quirks 
to keep him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, Kuglar had to agree the matter was not all that simple. Yes, 
he understood why most people were happy that Nagel remained confined; yes, he 
understood why Emmett Marshall's wife would say: "We're scared right now. It's 
scary he could get out." Hell, he didn't know if Nagel was dangerous. In truth, 
Kuglar allowed, he probably would have been the state's star witness in 1981; 
if called to testify, he would have made the case for conviction and prison, if 
not the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that also meant he would not have made the case for a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious, perplexing irony of his position left Kuglar shaking his head. 
Usually, responsibility was his watchword; usually, it was the defense attorney 
who opposed him, not the state. Falling silent, Kuglar turned his chair, his 
back now to his visitors, his mind now on a jury's 13-year-old verdict -- the 
inescapable, irreducible predicament at the heart of the Nagel affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "David should have been convicted and sentenced," Kuglar said finally. "But 
that's not what happened. That's just not what happened."

GOVERNOR IS ONE OF FEW TO DISMISS WILSON PRESIDENCY; POLITICS: HE REPEATEDLY 
SAYS HE IS NOT INTERESTED. BUT EXPERTS SAY HIS COMEBACK MAKES HIM A TOP 
CONTENDER.

 Pete Wilson for President? 
</P>
<P>
 After winning reelection as California's governor in a remarkable comeback 
victory this week, Wilson is appearing with increasing frequency on lists of 
potential 1996 Republican presidential candidates who have a solid chance of 
winning the nomination and the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old governor has repeatedly said he is not interested in national 
politics and that a second term as governor is all he wants to climax a 32-year 
career in public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the talk of a possible Wilson candidacy should be taken seriously, 
political experts said Friday. It is, they say, more than the mostly idle 
chatter that travels the political circuit every time a Californian is thrust 
into national celebrity by the mere fact of winning the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, take it seriously. Absolutely," said Darry Sragow, a respected Democratic 
political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 William Schneider, a political analyst for the American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington and Cable News Network, said, "A lot of Republicans think he's 
the answer. He's tough. He's wily. He's created his own miracle. He came up 
from the worst possible situation and turned the election around." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Al Neuharth, the founder and publisher of USA Today, said in his 
weekly column that Wilson "is far out front for the rejuvenated Republican 
Party's presidential nomination." 
</P>
<P>
 Neuharth, a prominent corporate media figure for decades, went so far as to 
list potential vice presidential running mates for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 With its early March primary, California is in the bag for Wilson, Neuharth 
said. That will allow Wilson to focus on such other big March primary states as 
New York, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win most of those and it's over before April Fools' Day," Neuharth said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson candidacy was predicted this year by the late former President 
Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The item was greeted as something of an interesting footnote after Nixon's 
death April 22, when New York Times columnist William Safire reported that one 
of Nixon's last political predictions was that Wilson would be nominated for 
President if he survived his reelection effort this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Safire, who had been a Nixon aide, quoted Nixon as saying: "If Pete Wilson 
survives in California in '94, he will be nominated in '96 and will be a strong 
candidate. He's very good on foreign and defense policy. Been everything -- 
mayor, senator, governor. A moderate on domestic stuff, but not a mushy 
moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was something of a mentor to Wilson. The governor's first job in 
politics was as a 28-year-old advance man in Nixon's unsuccessful campaign for 
governor of California in 1962. Nixon, then a former vice president, ran 
against Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., the father of Wilson's 1994 
Democratic foe, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gorton, Wilson's reelection campaign manager, said Friday that Wilson 
has not changed his position that he is not running for President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor said as recently as Wednesday that nothing has changed," Gorton 
said. "I take him at his word that nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson opened his reelection campaign in March, he was asked by reporters 
if he would serve a full term in Sacramento and not seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll rule it out," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion recently, a reporter asked if he planned to serve a full 
term and not run for national office if reelected this November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Wilson said. He smiled and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, there were chants of "Pete in '96" and "First Lady Gayle" 
when the newly reelected governor and his wife emerged at the Republican 
victory party. As he stood at the podium, one enthusiastic supporter screamed: 
"Let's go Pete! President Wilson!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson beamed. The crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as talk of Wilson for President persists, everything he does will be 
examined for signs of whether he is running. For instance, he will address the 
National Press Club in Washington this Friday and what he says will be minutely 
analyzed by Washington reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 What does he have to do now if he wants to run? 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said about all he would have to do is travel around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, Wilson would have to do little overtly in the near future to 
make himself a candidate. He is a prodigious fund-raiser and sources said he 
would not have trouble raising the necessary money in time. 
</P>
<P>
 In many states, he will be on the ballot automatically in Republican primaries 
unless he signs a statement absolutely declaring he is not a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the last three California governors ran for President with mixed 
results. Ronald Reagan sought the GOP nomination and lost twice, including an 
abortive late-blooming attempt when he was governor. Long after he was 
governor, Reagan came back to win the nomination and the presidency in 1980 and 
reelection in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. unsuccessfully sought the Democratic 
nomination several times, while he was governor and after he left office. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some talk of Wilson for President when he first won the governorship 
in 1990 after serving in the state Assembly, as mayor of San Diego and a U.S. 
senator. That talk died as California was racked with recession, riots and 
natural disasters. Wilson was forced to agree to a $7-billion tax increase in 
1991, but later said that was a mistake and vowed that it would never happen 
again. His job rating as governor plummeted to record lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential talk -- most of it emanating from the East and within the 
Washington Beltway -- revived this summer as it became apparent that Wilson was 
headed toward victory over Brown, less than two years after he was given little 
or no chance of winning a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Wilson ran as a moderate Republican, strongly supporting abortion and 
gay rights and boasting of his environmental protection achievements in the 
Senate. In 1994, he ran as a conservative, linking his campaign to a pledge of 
no tax increases and being tough on crime and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas have been 
mentioned most frequently as possible presidential contenders. There is a 
growing consensus that Dole, who will become Senate majority leader again in 
January, will not run. Neuharth doubted that Quayle could win. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential Republican candidates include Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who 
oversaw the successful national campaign to win back control of the Senate; 
former Reagan Cabinet secretary Jack Kemp, and others. Sen. Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania is expected to announce his candidacy next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the GOP nomination takes on new luster with the big Republican 
victory of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field is completely wide open," Schneider said. "Pete Wilson has a big 
plus, which is California. Bill Clinton can't win without California." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's handicaps among GOP voters include his support of a woman's choice on 
abortion and the $7-billion tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party smells red meat. They smell blood. They're looking for 
another Reagan, not another Bush," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brennan, director of the Los Angeles Times Poll, noted that although many 
Eastern observers may consider Wilson's revival in the last two years a virtual 
miracle, Wilson got about half his votes from Californians because he was "the 
lesser of two evils." 
</P>
<P>
 And although he has rebuilt his job rating from 30% to 50%, "that still is not 
stellar," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow, the Democratic consultant, also noted that Wilson is not a charismatic 
campaigner: "He's not warm. He's not fuzzy. He is not emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 "But he keeps doing it," Sragow added. "He is probably the shrewdest political 
strategist and technician in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 A practical problem facing Wilson is that if he were elected President, his 
resignation would turn over the governor's office to a Democrat, Controller 
Gray Davis, who was elected lieutenant governor Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sragow said that would not top "a list of reasons why Pete Wilson can't be 
President. If I want to be President of the United States, I'll find a way 
around that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if Republicans are in control of one or both houses of the 
Legislature by January, 1997, they could effectively checkmate a Democratic 
governor on most major issues -- particularly state spending.

SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS 3 ISRAELI SOLDIERS IN GAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suicide bomber, apparently on a revenge mission, detonated explosives 
strapped to his body as he rode his bicycle into an Israeli checkpoint Friday, 
killing himself and three soldiers and wounding 11 other people. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred at the main junction of Gaza's north-south highway, 200 
yards from an Israeli settlement. Israeli and Palestinian soldiers mount their 
joint patrols of the road at the spot, and operate separate checkpoints there. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the bombing, a pair of masked gunmen appeared in a crowd of 
about 3,000 people holding a memorial service in Gaza City for Hani Abed, a 
leader of the militant Islamic Jihad movement who was blown to bits Nov. 2 by a 
bomb in his car in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen claimed responsibility for the attack on the Israeli soldiers, 
saying it was the "first revenge attack for the death of Hani Abed." 
</P>
<P>
 A leaflet that was later distributed by Islamic Jihad identified the bomber as 
Hisham Ismail Hamad, 21, of Gaza City's Sheik Radwan neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat quickly condemned the 
attack on the Israelis, through an aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asserted that the Palestinian Authority and its bodies will take all 
necessary and deterrent measures to deal with the situation," Arafat aide 
Khaled Salam told Reuters news agency. Quoting Palestinian sources, Reuters 
later said Arafat had ordered a roundup of militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's condemnation is unlikely to mollify Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, who faces growing domestic political pressure to compel Arafat to crack 
down on Islamic militant movements in Gaza. Israel withdrew from most of Gaza 
in May, handing over responsibility for security and daily life to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Israelis and Palestinians jointly patrol some roads, and Israelis 
still provide security for Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the expectations that Arafat would be in control of the territories are 
not being realized," said Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's minister of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with Arafat just three days before the bombing, Rabin decided to 
speed up talks on transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians in the 
occupied West Bank. The Palestinians want Israeli troops to move out of 
Palestinian population centers so that they can hold elections before the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But each attack on Israeli civilians or soldiers makes it harder for Rabin to 
explain to Israelis why they should trust Arafat to control the West Bank, 
where about 140,000 Jewish settlers live -- some in close proximity to 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians must know that how they conduct things here is a sort of 
precedent," Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the military's chief of staff, said Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicyclist apparently rode past the Palestinian checkpoint and pedaled up 
to the concrete blocks meant to protect Israeli soldiers who guard the road 
leading to the Jewish settlement. He blew himself up between an army jeep and a 
red Fiat sedan carrying members of the Kmeil family, Palestinians on their way 
to spend a day at their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Those killed included three army reserve officers, according to Israel 
Television.  
</P>
<P>
 Four other soldiers, one border police officer and one other police officer 
were wounded in the blast. One of the wounded was reported to be in critical 
condition, suffering from head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the Kmeils said six family members were wounded in the blast. 
Palestinian police said a colonel in the police force was also wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abu Kmeil, 34, was reported in moderate condition Friday night in 
Gaza's Shifa Hospital. Hospital staff said Kmeil was shot in the back, 
apparently when soldiers opened fire after the bomb exploded. His 60-year-old 
mother, his wife and their three children escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A visibly angry Barak stood near the debris left by the blast three hours 
after it occurred and blamed the Palestinian Authority for failing to prevent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an agreement," Barak said. "We expect them to live up to their 
responsibilities. We expect the Palestinian Authority to move ahead and take 
responsibility, to prevent people from reaching such places with explosives on 
their bodies or in their cars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian security officials planned to meet Friday night to 
decide how to jointly investigate the attack and prevent future attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians should know," he said, that the occurrence of such attacks 
"might influence the content and nature of relations (between Israel and the 
Palestinians) and the chances of our future dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Barak declined to say whether Israel will reimpose the closure on the Gaza 
Strip that it began to lift only 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin had closed the strip after another suicide bomber, from the Islamic 
militant movement Hamas, attacked a bus in Tel Aviv on Oct. 19. That bombing 
took the life of the attacker and 22 others.  
</P>
<P>
 As Barak spoke, workers began to clear away evidence of the bombing. Syringes 
and other emergency medical supplies littered the blood-soaked ground where 
medics had treated the wounded before helicopters evacuated them to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kmeils' sedan, its windows blown out and its frame crumpled, lay in the 
street surrounded by pieces of the family's clothing and picnic lunch. A few 
yards from the sedan stood an army jeep with its front window shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred yards up the closed-off and darkened road, a trio of reserve 
soldiers stood behind more concrete blocks, guarding the gates of the Netzarim 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were our friends," said one of the soldiers, who declined to give his 
name and refused to allow reporters to enter the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 10 families here," he said angrily, gesturing toward the 
settlement. "Those three guys who were killed, they each have families." 
</P>
<P>
 The reservist said the three officers had gone to the checkpoint after hearing 
that a Palestinian demonstration was planned there. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomber apparently slipped through the Palestinian checkpoint when 
Palestinian police were distracted by the arrival there, shortly before 2 p.m., 
of a busload of Palestinians wishing to protest the Israeli presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has nearly 20 small settlements in Gaza, but most are clustered in two 
locations in the north and south of the strip. Netzarim is an isolated 
settlement in an area heavily populated by Palestinians.

U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR FALLOUT AS BOSNIA ROLE IS BOOSTED; BALKANS: MUSLIMS SCORE 
VICTORIES, AND WASHINGTON BEGINS TO WORRY ITS EFFORTS WILL CAUSE FRICTION WITH 
ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, facing a six-month deadline to achieve a 
negotiated peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is acting on several fronts to step up 
pressure on Bosnia's Serbian rebels and to support the Muslim-led government 
after the U.S. decision this week to stop enforcing a U.N. arms embargo against 
the embattled republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, though, U.S. officials have begun to worry not that their 
efforts might fail but that they might succeed too well. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the Muslim-led Bosnian army has scored some unexpected 
victories on the battlefield, retaking territory in western Bosnia that had 
been seized by the Serbs. Normally that would be good news to U.S. 
policy-makers, who regard the Bosnian Serbs as aggressors and the government as 
victims in the ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that the government offensive 
could produce unwanted consequences, including new friction between Washington 
and its allies, a confrontation between the Administration and the 
Republican-controlled Congress and -- in a worst-case scenario -- U.S. armed 
intervention in a Vietnam-style war. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the White House announced publicly Friday that President Clinton had 
ordered the Navy to allow ships bearing weapons for Bosnia to slip through the 
U.N.-ordered blockade, officials made it clear that this was a reluctant 
decision, made only because Congress required it. 
</P>
<P>
 At both the State Department and the Pentagon, officials fretted that the move 
might set back their attempts to mediate by putting the United States squarely 
on one side of the war. And, they noted, it had the unwelcome effect of 
dividing the United States from Britain, France and other North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization members, which have been enforcing the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher summed up the optimistic view: "Our 
policy is to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs any way we can. That the Bosnian 
government may be holding its own helps to put more pressure on the Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon official added that the decision to stop enforcing the arms embargo 
"should have a political effect of making it clear to the Bosnian Serbs that 
the pressure on them will increase -- and that they would be well-advised to 
agree to the Contact Group proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal -- the cornerstone of U.S. policy in Bosnia -- is a partition 
plan advanced by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany that 
would cede 49% of Bosnia to the Serbian minority and reserve 51% for the 
federation of the government and the third major ethnic group, the Bosnian 
Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and the Croats have accepted the plan, but the Serbian rebels, 
who still hold about 70% of the country, have refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Christopher's upbeat assessment, the prevailing view at the State 
Department is profoundly ambivalent. Government battlefield successes may 
pressure the Serbian rebels into accepting the Contact Group map, but the 
chances are at least as good that the offensive will only reheat a war that had 
been relatively quiet recently, perhaps drawing in outside powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government's offensive opens the door for everything to fall flat on its 
face," one Administration official said. "We don't have much control over this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that the government successes may be evidence that Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic has kept his promise to stop the flow of arms and 
other supplies from Serbia to the Bosnian Serb forces. And that is regarded as 
a plus. But if the military pressure on the Bosnian Serbs keeps up, that might 
cause Milosevic to resume helping them. And that would be a clear setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Many non-government experts doubt that the government army has the strength to 
force the rebel Serbs to accept a negotiated end to the war. These specialists 
said the government advances may be a welcome change from rebel conquest but 
they may make the situation even more perilous for the government and for the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be happy about government advances, because they make it less 
likely that the Serbs will win big against the Muslims," said Warren 
Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to the Yugoslav federation before it 
disintegrated. "I don't agree that this may shorten the war and bring a 
negotiated settlement closer, however. The odds are that it will increase the 
incentive for the Serbs to take some bloody revenge. That would put a 
negotiated settlement even farther away and produce a war that goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Marten H.A. van Heuven, a former U.S. foreign service officer and intelligence 
analyst, said government military advances may prolong the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a Bosnian Muslim and was hoping to drag the United States into it 
on my side, I would not want to sign anything now," said Van Heuven, now a 
scholar in the Washington office of the RAND think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government offensive is also certain to produce strains between 
Washington and the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that if the government registers many successes, the Bosnian 
Serbs are almost sure to mount a counteroffensive that may target the U.N. 
force, which includes British, French and Russian contingents but no U.S. 
ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government registers major victories, the United Nations seems certain 
to withdraw the peacekeepers, a step that could prove disastrous for civilians, 
many of them Muslims who depend on the U.N. operation for food and other 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government's recent advances were possible because the army has 
lately been able to circumvent a U.N.-imposed arms embargo against all former 
Yugoslav republics. But the leakage is relatively modest, and the army remains 
at a disadvantage in heavy weapons to the Serbs, who are unaffected by the 
embargo because they have access to much of the arsenal of the old Yugoslav 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 Under legislation passed by Congress earlier this year, the Administration 
must urge the U.N. Security Council to lift the embargo if the Serbs do not 
accept the Contact Group partition plan by Tuesday. The United States has 
introduced a draft resolution to end the embargo, but it has no chance of 
approval, because Britain, France and Russia all oppose it and each has veto 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 The same law required Clinton to stop U.S. enforcement of the embargo -- an 
action that officials said will have little practical effect, since only three 
of the 19 ships maintaining the blockade are American, and the other NATO 
countries plan to continue blocking arms shipments to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also requires the Administration to draw up a plan for the United 
States to break the embargo by shipping weapons to Bosnia. Such an action would 
cause a full-scale crisis between the United States and its allies, and Clinton 
has refused to take that step -- even though he opposes the embargo in 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican victory in congressional elections will make Clinton's awkward 
position even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Senate majority leader, Bob Dole (R-Kan.), is a leading advocate 
of breaking the embargo, and Administration officials fear that he will try to 
force Clinton's hand with binding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be disastrous, analyst Van Heuven warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the United States were to unilaterally lift the embargo, we would be 
assuming responsibility for the Bosnian Muslims," he said. " . . . Before you 
know it, you have going in the Balkans a proxy war in which we are backing one 
side and Moscow and perhaps others are backing the other side. We could not 
afford to lose this -- so we would escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Britain and France publicly criticized the U.S. decision to stop 
enforcing the arms blockade as a step toward possibly breaking the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a worry, because this is a mandatory resolution of the (U.N.) Security 
Council," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe issued a statement saying that his 
government regrets the U.S. action and called for an emergency meeting with 
Christopher.

GOP TO SEEK NEW, STRONGER ANTI-CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans who will take control of Congress in January said Friday that they 
will quickly pass a stronger crime bill to end lengthy appeals for convicted 
criminals, give police more leeway in searching for evidence and encourage 
states to require violent offenders to serve longer terms, build more prisons 
and adopt sentencing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to pass a real crime bill and we are committed to bringing it forward 
within the first 100 days," said Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), a leader on crime 
legislation in the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans on Capitol Hill have chafed for more than a decade at their 
inability to pass ever-tougher measures to combat crime. While Democrats have 
moved to the right on crime, their senior committee chairmen in the House often 
bottled up what they saw as extreme proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, suddenly, the way is cleared for Republicans to wage their own 
legislative war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have (Jack) Brooks blocking us any more," a jubilant McCollum said, 
referring to the crusty chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who was 
defeated by Texas voters on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals are spelled out in "The Taking Back Our Streets Act" section of 
the Republican "contract with America," which more than 300 Republican 
candidates signed before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the far-reaching Republican proposals for a balanced budget, tax 
cuts and strict time limits for welfare, the proposed anti-crime initiatives 
are not revolutionary. Many simply piggyback on popular state proposals, such 
as imposing mandatory prisons terms for repeat, violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In other instances, the steps would expand programs included in this year's 
crime legislation. For example, the new crime law gives some money to states to 
encourage the adoption of "truth-in-sentencing" laws and the Republicans want 
to devote more money to that purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 It is widely agreed that the public has grown angry at hearing of violent 
criminals who, for example, might be sentenced to 15 years in prison but would 
become "eligible for parole" in perhaps four years. Under truth-in-sentencing, 
which became part of federal law in 1988, convicted criminals must serve at 
least 85% of their prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly, the Republican leaders have distanced themselves from tough 
proposals advocated during the Ronald Reagan era, such as dropping the 
so-called Miranda warnings or scrapping the "exclusionary rule," which bars the 
use of illegally obtained evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), expected to become chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, was asked Friday if he favors loosening the Miranda rule 
that makes a confession illegal when police fail to warn a suspect of his right 
to remain silent and to consult a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some trouble there," Hatch said. "Personally, I think that the Miranda 
warning probably is a good thing," Hatch told interviewers on the Court TV 
program, "Washington Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, McCollum was asked whether Republicans might broadly attack the 
Supreme Court's 1961 decision that excludes illegally obtained evidence from a 
criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we won't want to excuse a clearly illegal search that violates someone's 
rights," he said. "But if an officer thought he was complying with the law in 
good faith, we don't want that evidence thrown out."  
</P>
<P>
 Twice during the 1980s, Republicans won broad support on Capitol Hill to amend 
the law to allow the use of criminal evidence turned up by "good faith" police 
searches but senior Democrats blocked the proposals from coming to a vote on 
the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Republicans also deny that they intend to repeal the recently enacted ban 
on the possession of certain assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not in the contract," McCollum said. "Some people might bring it up 
but I don't think it will be part of the agenda." Hatch said that he opposed 
the assault weapon ban but doubts that a majority in the Senate would want to 
reopen the issue next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Republican lawmakers and their advisers on crime said that there 
is broad agreement on five key proposals for a new crime bill: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce the social spending included in the recent crime law and give more of 
the money to city officials to fight crime as they see fit. The crime bill 
passed last summer provides $6.9 billion over six years for crime prevention 
programs, many of which were derided by Republicans as wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the first priority will be to take out the pork-barrel programs and 
turn it into block grants for local governments to use for crime prevention," 
said Richard K. Willard, a former Reagan Administration official who has 
advised House Republicans on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The current law is "broken up into little programs that reflect federal 
judgments more than the states'," said William P. Barr, attorney general during 
the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, "block grants" have been criticized as a Republican version of 
pork-barrel spending, and this proposal will likely meet strong opposition from 
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut off "frivolous" appeals for Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give them one bite of the apple and that's it," McCollum said. 
State prosecutors complain that state inmates should not be permitted to 
repeatedly appeal their cases in federal court. In recent years, the Supreme 
Court has tightened the law to end most such repeat appeals but the Republicans 
propose to end them entirely, except where the inmate can show convincing new 
evidence that he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the "good faith exception" to warrantless police searches. The 
Supreme Court in 1984 ruled that criminal evidence can be used if police 
followed a search warrant that was later declared defective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans say that they want to expand this idea to allow the use of 
evidence in situations where police are "following proper procedures" but a 
judge later concludes that they erred. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how this proposal is defined, it could prove highly 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage longer prison terms for violent offenders. The Republicans want to 
increase spending to $10.5 billion over six years to build more prisons and to 
require states to keep convicts behind bars until they have served 85% of their 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 * Punish those who use guns in committing crimes. The "contract with America" 
proposes a mandatory 10-year prison term for anyone who uses a gun in a crime 
and a mandatory 20-year term for a second such offense.  
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans say they think that their proposals will get wide support in 
Congress, as well as the signature of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will be a bipartisan effort," McCollum said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; A DEMORALIZED WHITE HOUSE MOVES SWIFTLY TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House, still reeling from the slap of repudiation delivered by 
voters Tuesday, is searching for a path that allows President Clinton to 
salvage some of his agenda and his political future. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his staff, if anything, appeared to be more demoralized at the end 
of the week than they were immediately after Tuesday's GOP binge, in which 
voters turned over both houses of Congress to Republicans and seemed to 
decisively reject Clinton's vision of an activist government. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President prepared for a weeklong trip to Asia, he was inundated with 
assessments of the election -- and contradictory recommendations for what to do 
with what is left of his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestions range from a wholesale staff and Cabinet shake-up to a new 
emphasis on foreign policy achievements, to an ideological war with the 
conservative new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, an urgent reassessment is under way, both in Washington and 
among Clinton's traveling party. At the last minute, he dragooned senior 
adviser George Stephanopoulos to accompany him on the Asia trip to coordinate 
staff discussions on the Administration's future policies and politics and to 
begin plotting a course for Clinton's expected reelection drive. 
</P>
<P>
 As White House factions battle among themselves for the President's ear, it 
appears that an early winner is the moderate wing of the Democratic Party that 
nurtured the young governor of Arkansas and helped elect him President. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Thursday that he plans to return to the "New Democrat" agenda 
that was the cornerstone of his 1992 campaign. It calls for smaller, more 
efficient government, an emphasis on personal responsibility and restoration of 
the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he will spend more time carrying out laws Congress already 
has approved, rather than proposing new measures, and that he will travel 
around the country to try to do a better job of selling his programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about the message voters sent Clinton: 'You said you were 
a different kind of Democrat, but you haven't governed as one,' " said Al From, 
director of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, reflecting views that 
he passed to Clinton in a memo last week. "I'm not sure he's gotten that 
message yet, because they're all in a state of shellshock and denial over 
there. But it'll sink in soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Certain casualties of the midterm elections are the sweeping health care 
reform plan devised by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and a welfare reform 
plan. If either is to have any hope of passage in the new Congress, it will be 
in a much more limited form with modest or no impact on the 1996 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel changes also appear inevitable. White House political director Joan 
Baggett and Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm are said to be 
on their way out. Several other top White House aides, including chief domestic 
policy adviser Carol Rasco, press secretary Dee Dee Myers and staff secretary 
John Podesta, are likely to be eased out or conclude on their own that there's 
more fun and more money to be had elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In a post-election news conference Wednesday and again in a speech Thursday, 
Clinton referred back almost wistfully to his one unambiguous triumph, the 1992 
campaign. He said that he intends to try to deliver on the campaign's central 
promises of greater economic security for the middle class and broader 
opportunity for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to compromise on my convictions," Clinton asserted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton has been nagged throughout his presidency by public confusion over 
what his convictions are. Even his friends have said that Clinton badly strayed 
from the centrist message that he ran on, either trading away his principles 
for votes or abandoning his moderate stance to embrace liberal crime and health 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has become a man defined more by his failures than his successes," 
From said. "He defined health care as being what his Administration was about 
and he proposed a big liberal failed program. The crime bill was another real 
turning point because opponents successfully likened it to a mother sending a 
teen-ager to a store for a quart of milk with $20 and having the kid come back 
with the milk and $19 worth of junk food." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is now consulting with aides and outside advisers to find a formula 
for governing and to craft a new message that responds to the voters' evident 
displeasure with what he and Congress have delivered during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A flurry of memos has been flying around the White House offering ideas on how 
to "redefine the Clinton presidency," a quest that the White House has embarked 
on rather publicly many times in his 22 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some memos suggest a rightward shift that would return him to the New Democrat 
agenda combined with a search for common ground with Republicans in Congress on 
such issues as political and governmental reform, budget discipline and changes 
in federal welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, former Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and a 
number of other top aides have endorsed this approach, saying it not only 
responds to public anger but most closely comports with Clinton's campaign 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the message he ran on and the one he believes in," said a top aide. 
"The reason the message was so effective in 1992 is that it was what Clinton 
deeply believed and spent years working on. He thinks it got lost in the 
partisan clatter. This year has been one of intense partisanship and acrimony 
and everything we did was a very tough fight." 
</P>
<P>
 But other advisers, among them Stephanopoulos and political consultant Paul 
Begala, are urging a more combative, populist approach, pointing to Harry S. 
Truman's successful response to the massive Republican gains of 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 They are saying that compromise with Congress and incremental attempts at 
reform are likely to further erode the President's popularity and his stature 
as a leader. They are advocating what they call "an outside game," going over 
the heads of Congress and the media to appeal to the disenchanted middle class 
with jobs programs and a message of moral renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Begala said that Clinton likely would pursue both courses at once. "You'll see 
him both emphasizing government reform issues that the President and many 
moderate Democrats have been long advocating and have been frustrated in 
pursuing. And you'll see a more aggressive populist stance, pointing out the 
differences between Democrats and Republicans on such issues as the deficit, 
women's rights and gun control." 
</P>
<P>
 Both camps believe that Clinton needs to take some time to rest and think 
about what he hopes to accomplish in the next two years. They are once again 
trying to stifle his tendency to think out loud and talk too much, as he did on 
Thursday, mournfully mulling over Tuesday's results before an audience at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the audience at his undergraduate alma mater that the public was angry 
and upset because these are not "normal times." He admitted that he thought 
that his Administration had made a good start at addressing the nation's 
problems and was stunned to find that the public violently disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking weary, Clinton said that the way the Administration and Congress have 
done their business recently has been "messy" and "almost revolting." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was supposed to be an overview of Clinton's foreign policy and a 
kickoff to Clinton's trip to the Asian economic summit. His rambling remarks 
were unplanned -- and unwelcome to his staff.

 HELPING OUT: He may have lost his voice, but Glenn Gershan has gained a lot of 
new friends. Gershan is the Valley College student with cerebral palsy whose 
electronic voice keyboard was stolen recently, denying him the ability to 
communicate (B3). . . . Since word of his situation got out, dozens of people 
have offered their help. 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD RUSHER: John Elway may be the best NFL player to come out of the 
Valley. But who's the best CFL player? You could say Mike Pringle, 27, who went 
to Kennedy High. He set the league's single-season rushing record this year 
with 1,972 yards. . . . He plays for the Baltimore franchise, which meets 
Toronto in the playoffs today. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW FIGHT: Quit horsing around. That's the word from the U. S. Army Corps of 
Engineers to Eddie J. Milligan, above, operator of Hansen Dam Equestrian 
Center. This time, the fight's over a biological buffer zone the corps wants 
established in one of the center's parking lots (B5). . . . In the past, 
Milligan says, the corps has tried to evict his family from their mobile homes 
at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 MOVING ON: To his surprise, the Rev. Paul Egertson, pastor at St. Matthew's in 
North Hollywood, has been elected bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America. It's a surprise because he supports gays and lesbians in the ministry, 
and the church doesn't (B11). 
</P>
<P>
 BOOK TOUR? If Brando could talk to Larry King, is the Pope next? Don't bet on 
it. At a Universal City lunch Friday, Archbishop John Foley, in charge of TV 
and film for the Vatican, said Pope John Paul II won't do TV interviews, even 
to plug his hot new book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope." . . . Says Foley: 
"The Pope does not feel secure that translations will always capture the 
nuances of what he's saying." Michael Arkush

SEISMIC SAFETY PANEL WEIGHS REFORM IN ERA OF CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blaming shoddy design, construction and inspection for much of the damage in 
the Northridge earthquake, the California Seismic Safety Commission has called 
for new laws requiring additional training for architects, engineers, 
contractors and code-enforcement officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission, meeting this week, tentatively agreed on the educational 
requirements and several other recommendations. But it postponed final action 
on an already overdue report Gov. Pete Wilson requested on the adequacy of 
current seismic construction standards.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission stressed the need to retrofit schools and other public 
buildings to reduce hazards from non-structural elements such as toppling 
lighting fixtures. But commissioners wrestled with how to safeguard lives and 
property in the face of the state's dire fiscal constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters are not interested in big-ticket items," said Frances E. Winslow, 
a commissioner and director of emergency services for the city of San Jose. "We 
have to ask ourselves what we can do administratively or without involving a 
lot of expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of debate Thursday, the commission shot down a potentially 
costly proposal to establish a new state agency or designate a "quake czar" who 
would have been responsible for managing seismic risk-reduction programs now 
divided between several agencies. The new department would also have been 
responsible for promulgating seismic-safety training and building standards.  
</P>
<P>
 Developers and local building officials contended that the agency would have 
been a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters made a statement about how they felt about big government 
Tuesday," testified Robert E. Raymer, technical director of the California 
Building Industry Assn. "This item alone could hurt the credibility of your 
entire document."  
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners argued that the new department could wind up saving the 
state money by consolidating fragmented programs. But others warned that even 
if it were cost-effective, it would be solidly opposed by the turf-hungry state 
agencies that currently regulate seismic safety, including the Division of the 
State Architect and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
Legislation to consolidate the various programs has failed to win passage in 
the past, partly because the agencies opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission lacks the authority to enforce new rules it recommends but is 
often considered persuasive on issues of seismic safety. It will meet again on 
Dec. 8, and the final report is not likely to be completed until shortly before 
the first anniversary of the Jan. 17 earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission has tentatively concluded that the building code is largely 
adequate to protect lives but found compliance lacking. Many of the 11,787 
buildings that were heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake showed 
evidence of shoddy construction, design or inspection, said Fred Turner, the 
commission's structural engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 "We would not have had a lot of the damage we had . . . if we had just taken 
what we had today and used it properly," said Paul F. Fratessa, chairman of the 
Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has recommended that building departments hire architects or 
engineers to review sophisticated blueprints, that code-enforcement officials 
and others receive additional training and that updated seismic-safety 
principles be included in contractors' licensing exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also tentatively agreed to adopt a recommendation that would 
require the owners of the state's 1,300 dams and large river levees to update 
their inundation maps by Jan. 1, 1996. The dams appear to be structurally 
sound, the commission said, but local jurisdictions need the maps to evaluate 
future development and prepare evacuation strategies in the event of a 
cataclysmic earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also plans to ask the Legislature to allocate state and federal 
money for a seismic-hazards mapping program that could also help cities plan 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft report urged that automatic shut-off valves be required at the service 
entry point of all mobile-home parks in California. Gas-fed fires from snapped 
lines destroyed 184 mobile homes after the Northridge earthquake struck, 
according to the commission. Some Los Angeles City Council members have 
proposed that the valves be required in all residences. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co., which has 4.7 million customers 
in the Southland, said the firm opposes any mandates because the valves often 
shut down unnecessarily, leaving consumers without service and forcing the firm 
to make costly home visits to turn the gas back on. The company is seeking 
permission from the Public Utilities Commission to test a shut-off valve in the 
San Fernando Valley, Orange County and the Inland Empire that can be turned 
back on by the customer, the spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission completed its business this week without acting on one 
potentially costly recommendation: that local governments identify and draw up 
plans to retrofit structures that are vulnerable to failure in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially vulnerable buildings identified by the commission include those 
made of unreinforced brick, non-ductile reinforced concrete like the collapsed 
Bullock's department store in Northridge, concrete tilt-up construction like 
some grocery stores and warehouses, and certain wood-frame buildings like the 
Northridge Meadows Apartments complex, where 16 tenants perished.  
</P>
<P>
 But the state has no money to pay for the process of identifying vulnerable 
buildings. Under a recent law, the Legislature is required to underwrite the 
cost of any new mandates it imposes on local governments. The city of Los 
Angeles is already considering a retrofit program.  
</P>
<P>
 To help building owners pay for retrofits, the commission tentatively agreed 
to propose legislation to allow the creation of redevelopment districts that 
could divert local property-tax revenue to areas deemed vulnerable to 
earthquakes. But in Sherman Oaks, opponents of a proposal to use redevelopment 
agency powers to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods said they would fight any 
attempt to expand the redevelopment domain.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one trusts community redevelopment agencies because they dictate what can 
be built . . . and they don't care what the residents think," said Richard 
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission continued to debate whether the building code should go further 
than the "life-safety" standard -- which requires that structures be strong 
enough not to collapse and cause a fatality -- and be appended to protect 
buildings as well as lives. For instance, a companion code could be developed 
that would offer building owners the option of designing a structure that would 
survive a quake with minimal damage or one that functions so well that 
activities are barely interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, insurance companies would be urged to offer incentives 
such as reduced rates to building owners who opt for the higher standards.

AFRICA; THE 'DINOSAUR' DICTATORS OUTLAST COLONIAL POWERS; FRANCE, IN 
PARTICULAR, IS STYMIED BY THEM. REFORM FATIGUE MAY BE HELPING TO PREVENT THEIR 
OUSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just four years ago, President Francois Mitterrand lost patience with human 
rights abuses in Zaire, Gabon and Togo and vowed to work for the ouster of 
those countries' dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, though, in the French resort of Biarritz, those same dictators 
again were enjoying head-of-state perks at the Franco-African summit -- still 
in power and still supping with Mitterrand and top French officials. 
</P>
<P>
 " Les dinosaures, " as Mitterrand once called them, have survived, proving 
themselves tougher than any former colonial power. But their resilience also 
suggests that France, the United States and others in the West, horrified by 
the anarchy in Somalia and the bloodshed in Rwanda, have grown weary of the 
battle for democracy in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success of democratic transitions in South Africa, Niger, Mali and 
several other countries, a kind of reform fatigue now grips Africa. The 
democratic process has failed in Zaire, Nigeria, Gabon and Togo, where the 
strongmen prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pressure for political change, after four years of painful 
pro-democracy moves, has eased across Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaire's leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, is a case in point. In his 29 years in 
power, Mobutu has amassed a vast fortune at the expense of his people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Kouchner, head of the French aid agency Doctors Without Borders, once 
described Mobutu as "a traveling safe wearing a leopard-skin cap." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mobutu, once ostracized by the French and on the verge of being overthrown 
four years ago by his own military, was welcomed back to the Franco-African 
summit this week. The official reason: gratitude for his logistics support for 
French forces in Rwanda and his modest moves toward political and economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Even U.S. diplomats who once demanded Mobutu's ouster now seem willing to 
accept his attempt at sharing power with opposition Prime Minister Leon Kengo 
wa Dondo. The Clinton Administration's new policy is to strengthen the hand of 
Dondo, hoping that Mobutu will disappear. But Africa experts contend that 
strategy can only help Mobutu, who wants nothing so much as acceptance in 
Washington and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Africa has undergone some positive political changes in recent 
years. Peaceful changes of government, something unheard of on the continent 
before 1990, have occurred in at least a dozen countries, from Zambia and 
Malawi to Mali and Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But fraudulent elections have restored autocratic rulers to power in other 
countries, such as Kenya. Much-heralded elections in Angola disintegrated into 
civil war when the loser refused to accept his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, there was a coup in Gambia, which occurred just as the U.S. 
ambassador showed up for a meeting at the presidential palace. (The envoy and 
the deposed president left by boat together.) 
</P>
<P>
 And the man who won Nigeria's free, democratic elections 17 months ago has 
been jailed by the general who still runs that country. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, the country most deeply involved in Africa, the departure next year 
of Mitterrand, after 14 years in power, also signals a change, diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
 The paternalism and friendship that Mitterrand and his predecessors fostered 
will end, replaced by a policy based more on hard-headed business interests 
than personal ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: France will again be doing business with people such as Mobutu, 
Omar Bongo in Gabon and Gnassingbe Eyadema in Togo. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberation, a Paris daily newspaper, has dubbed this new policy 
"rehabilitation for services rendered." 
</P>
<P>
 France, like the United States, has often been willing to ignore human rights 
shortcomings of its friends in Africa in exchange for strategic and economic 
concessions. It strongly supported the now-deposed Hutu government in Rwanda 
for years, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the French face questions about their policy in Rwanda, the only 
French-speaking African country not invited to this week's summit. 
</P>
<P>
 France was the first Western nation to send troops to help stem the killing in 
Rwanda in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government said its mission was humanitarian, many analysts saw 
it as an attempt to prop up the Hutus. Now Paris considers the new 
Tutsi-dominated government to be unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, France's intervention in Africa has long been humanitarian -- laced 
with self-interest. And whatever Mitterrand's successor does in Africa, he will 
find his policies criticized, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mitterrand's office complained in a memorandum distributed recently, 
"Either France is accused of intervening too much or of letting Africa drop."

EUROPE; LONG-ISOLATED ALBANIA FIGHTS INFECTIOUS-DISEASE 'IMPORTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When this Rip Van Winkle country opened its doors to the outside world four 
years ago, few of those who had been locked away for half a century expected 
the first major foreign influx to be infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the first "imports" to Albania in the post-Stalinist era have been 
cholera, syphilis, hepatitis-B and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance and poor hygiene have conspired to expose this long-isolated country 
to a degree of pestilence unseen on this continent since early this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised to learn tomorrow that we also have an outbreak of 
malaria," said Vladimir Gusmari, head of the World Health Organization office. 
"All of the conditions are there." 
</P>
<P>
 As witnessed during a recent cholera epidemic, the worst in Europe for decades 
with more than 1,000 infected and at least 14 dead, Albania is virgin territory 
for infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half of the population lives in homes with indoor plumbing. Wanton 
disregard for the environment during the 41-year dictatorship of the late Enver 
Hoxha left Albania strewn with piles of garbage and pools of raw sewage, ready 
breeding grounds for germ-carrying rodents and insects. 
</P>
<P>
 With industry at a standstill after chaotic change in the political system, 
the money propping up this country comes mostly from 500,000 workers who slip 
illegally into Greece and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 That migrant work force is believed to be the source of the sudden emergence 
of AIDS in this country, with 10 HIV-positive cases identified in less than a 
year and three Albanians already sick with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of AIDS for Albania is not one of if, but when," said the local 
UNICEF director, Alireza Mahallati. "The cases we've identified so far are just 
the tip of the iceberg. . . . This country had no sex education of any shape or 
kind and still doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of migrant workers are males in the prime of their reproductive 
years, Mahallati said. Many become sexually involved while abroad with 
high-risk partners, such as prostitutes and drug users, then pass on diseases 
to wives or girlfriends when they return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Albanian health officials say they are getting help in combatting infectious 
disease from international agencies, as well as from neighboring countries that 
fear Albania's plagues could spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Rotary Club has been bankrolling immunization against 
childhood diseases, and when the first cholera cases emerged in late summer, 
Italy quickly dispatched specialists and tankers of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of foreign agencies, Albania has also embarked on a massive AIDS 
awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hoxha espoused strong pro-natal policies in an unbridled quest to 
build up the army, birth control and abortion were banned here until the 
hard-line Communists were ousted in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Contraceptives are now available, but the costs are prohibitive, and few rural 
Albanians understand much about their use. 
</P>
<P>
 At a shantytown just outside Tirana where thousands fleeing worse poverty in 
the countryside have taken up residence in squalid shacks and abandoned 
bunkers, the hazardous future is there to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Arben Jata, an 18-year-old tending his family's sheep, said he had heard of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and claimed to understand how it is spread. 
But when asked whether condoms were available, he said he had no idea what they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 One hope for Albania is the gritty determination of its 3.3 million people to 
catch up to European living standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other post-Communist societies, for example, in which people tend to 
spend their first earnings on a car, Albanians are investing in modern 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasil Stefani is one of hundreds of construction workers in Tirana who cannot 
keep up with the demand for new bathrooms and kitchens. Even at the equivalent 
of $1,500 for a sink, toilet and tub ensemble, Stefani said he has to turn 
customers away. 
</P>
<P>
 Amused by Albanians' newfound fixation with hygiene, Stefani observed, "It 
seems Albania is trying to enter Europe through the bathroom."

SCHOOL DISTRICT SELLS AD SPACE TO RAISE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cash-strapped school district has sold out, selling ad space on everything 
from gymnasiums to school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 El Paso County's School District 11 is the nation's first to come up with such 
a plan, using the ad revenue to buy books, lab equipment and other supplies the 
city cannot provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go for your dreams! Stay in school! -- Reilly Buick-GMC Truck" reads an ad 
inside Palmer High School's gym. Dozens of other signs are plastered on school 
hallways, including ads from Pepsi and Shoney's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Fremont Elementary School travel in bright yellow buses painted 
with the round red spots that sell 7-Up. Burger King ads, designed with the 
help of students, are painted on other district buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Engeln, Palmer's principal, and a handful of school administrators came up 
with the idea while plotting ways to raise badly needed funds. The district's 
1994-95 fiscal budget of $133 million isn't enough to cover all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads first went up in January in all the district's 53 schools. About 50 
businesses have bought space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that one of the things we do have is exposure," Engeln said. "We 
thought: 'We can start marketing our schools.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher salaries have been frozen for three years, and voters have not 
approved a bond issue or tax increase for the district since 1972. The city was 
strapped by tight budgets and offered little financial help. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign permits ad space on walls, newsletters, district reports, maps, 
stadium walls and buses. Businesses can also buy space on warm-up jackets for 
sports teams but not on their uniforms. So far, no space has been sold for the 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Cooper, district public relations officer, said advertising has raised 
about $100,000. The district's share is $59,000. The ad agency handling the 
school's account, O'Donnell & Riley, gets the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is expected to raise an additional $200,000 next year, which 
would meet the district's goal of $300,000, said Pat Riley, a partner in the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Engeln said only 10% of wall space in schools will be used for ads.

WOBBLY ASTRONAUTS MAY RECLINE ON RETURN AFTER LONG SPACE STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronauts made flabby and wobbly by months on the Russian space station will 
be able to put their feet up on their trip home next year aboard the space 
shuttle Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis' astronauts Friday installed a platform on the shuttle to accommodate 
recliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis' next flight after its current 11-day mission is a docking with 
Russia's orbiting outpost Mir in June. The shuttle will take home two Russian 
cosmonauts and NASA astronaut Norman Thagard, who will ride a Russian rocket to 
the station in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Thagard and his Russian crew mates will need to lie down aboard Atlantis 
during the jarring trip back to Earth. They will be too weak to sit up after 
three months aboard Mir. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscles become flabby during long periods of weightlessness, and the sudden 
encounter with gravity sometimes makes astronauts dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle astronauts always sit upright on the ride home, strapped in their 
seats. But they have never spent more than 15 days in orbit at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the crew install the 
seats' platform and mounting bracket in orbit to make sure the hardware fits 
when the shuttle undergoes structural stress in space. The seats themselves 
will not be installed until the docking mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis' astronauts today will capture an ozone-studying satellite they 
released eight days earlier. Ozone measurements by instruments aboard the 
shuttle were interrupted briefly Friday when a power converter shut down; the 
crew switched to a backup converter.

BALTIC FERRY ROUTE RESUMES THOUGH MEMORY OF TRAGEDY HAUNTS NATION; ESTONIA: 
PASSENGERS ON NEW VESSEL PAY RESPECTS AT SITE WHERE MORE THAN 800 DIED. 
VICTIMS' FAMILIES CALL FIRM, GOVERNMENT CALLOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The customary dance band was not aboard when the Mare Balticum left this port 
Friday night. Few of the fancy big ferry's 438 passengers and crew were in a 
mood for live music. Some clutched bouquets. They were sailing to a wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing the dark, frigid Baltic en route to Stockholm, Capt. Erich Moik 
planned one stop, around midnight, near the place where another ferry, the 
15,500-ton Estonia, listed violently and plunged to the bottom on Sept. 28 in 
Europe's worst peacetime disaster at sea. There, at the sound of a foghorn, the 
flowers were to be scattered to the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be thinking of my friends as we pass over them," said the captain, a 
gentle man with thick gray hair who stood erect on the bridge with both hands 
behind his back, gazing into a calm sea. "I lost all my friends out there," he 
added softly. "All my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after its namesake vessel pulled at least 885 people to their 
deaths, this tiny seafaring nation resumed the popular Tallinn-Stockholm 
passenger run Friday by launching the Mare Balticum, a slightly smaller luxury 
ferry refurbished with $3.8 million worth of new safety features. 
</P>
<P>
 But the captain's sentiments, echoed by many aboard and many more on shore, 
gave only a hint of the trauma his country feels -- and is just starting to 
come to grips with -- in its fourth year of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia's 1.6 million people, who had come to think of themselves as the most 
Western and progressive of former Soviet republics, feel not just grief for the 
300 or so Estonians lost at sea, but a shattering sense of relapse into the 
worst characteristics of their Communist past. 
</P>
<P>
 For an aspiring annex of Scandinavia, a nation with the most vibrant economy 
and stablest currency among Moscow's former subjects, the disaster exposed 
painful inadequacies -- from questionable seamanship to the Soviet-style 
confusion, still unclarified, over exactly how many people left aboard the 
ferry that night. Most of the dead were from Sweden, a society many Estonians 
want to be like. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the boat flew the country's flag and bore its name -- a reminder 
televised recently from a robot camera that panned the wreckage showing the 
enormous black letters E-S-T-O-N-I-A. "For years, foreigners will associate the 
word Estonia with a shipwreck," political analyst Riho Laanemae wrote in the 
Estonian Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonians among the 136 survivors and those who lost loved ones complain of 
Soviet-like defensiveness, secrecy and callousness on the part of the 
state-owned Estonian Shipping Co. and government agencies handling the 
disaster. The company monopolizes the Tallinn-Stockholm line through a joint 
venture with Sweden called Estline. 
</P>
<P>
 No Estline official attended the funeral of Andres Tammes, the crewman who 
sent the Estonia's Mayday signal and whose body was one of 94 recovered from 
the sea. His widow, Sigrid, is also bitter, because Estline paid just $40 for 
his funeral, less than half what it cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this worry about Estonia's image is just a way to avoid talking about the 
real issues," she said. "There should be more talk about those who died and 
their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia is hardly equipped to deal with such a tragedy. Its social welfare 
system is practically nonexistent, and few people have life insurance. Estline 
has told people affected by the tragedy to apply for payments from the ship's 
Norwegian insurer, but they are slow to find legal help to do that or to file 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in late November will the government start paying compensation of $75 a 
month, from foreign donations, to each family that lost a breadwinner. A 
private agency started by an Estonian newspaper is now providing more modest 
relief, focusing on the country's 60 orphaned children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case, we will support these people," said Mart Laar, who had been 
acting prime minister until this month. "The aid is not up to Swedish 
standards, but far more than in Soviet times, when no one would have helped us 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistance has come from Finnish psychiatrists, who treat Estonians grieving 
for drowned loved ones. The Finns have challenged the Soviet emphasis on 
medication and the Estonian instinct for stoic suffering. They encourage people 
to vent their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are slowly overcoming the first stage of their grief, their 
disbelief," said Anti Liiv, an Estonian psychologist who shares the Finnish 
approach. "Now they're entering a stage where they feel total hopelessness on 
the one hand, and hostility on the other. They want assurances that someone 
will be . . . crucified." 
</P>
<P>
 With no official conclusion yet on the cause of the sinking, Estonians have 
embraced conspiracy theories: Russian sabotage, an overload of smuggled 
strategic metals, a bomb by one mafia gang to stop another's cargo. But Liiv 
said people increasingly blame the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonia was a roll-on, roll-off ferry, which allowed cars to enter at the 
stern and drive off the bow. Since the accident, such ferries have been banned 
in the Baltic. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the ferry sank in rough seas after its visor-like front 
hatch, weighing 54 tons, swung upward and broke off, causing water to rush in, 
tip over cars and destabilize the ferry. They hope to retrieve the hatch next 
week to learn whether it fell off from faulty construction, metal fatigue or 
speeding by the captain, which would have multiplied the force of the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Tallinn-Stockholm ferry, taken from another Estline route, underwent 
modifications to weld the front hatch closed, widen the stern to add stability, 
improve the communication and fire safety systems and buy new life jackets that 
light up for night rescuers when they hit the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Vironia, the original name of the ferry and an ancient name for this nation, 
was changed to Mare Balticum to disassociate it from the ill-fated ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Mare Balticum sailed Friday night, a retired teacher who was not 
taking the trip set flowers beside an unmarked, 20-foot white wooden cross that 
lies on a snowy knoll near Tallinn's port. There were dozens of other bouquets 
there, along with small candles burning in glass holders. 
</P>
<P>
 She has gone to that spot nearly every day since her 36-year-old daughter went 
down with the Estonia. For many others, the makeshift memorial is sufficient: 
Let shipwreck victims stay buried at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But the retired teacher comes down on the other side of an emotional debate 
about whether Estonia, Sweden and Finland should spend the $70 million needed 
to raise the Estonia and the estimated 800 bodies entombed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a body, it's like there is no end to the tragedy," she said. 
"Sometimes, I even imagine that she is, somehow, still alive down there."

U.S., ASIA PARTNERS BACK FREE-TRADE PACT; COMMERCE: OFFICIALS AT APEC 
CONFERENCE REACH OUTLINE OF DEAL TO REDUCE BARRIERS. CONSENSUS ON DETAILS COULD 
BE DIFFICULT, PARTICIPANTS ACKNOWLEDGE. 
</P>

 The United States and its trading partners in the Far East indicated Friday 
that they have reached a broad agreement on removing most trade barriers early 
in the next century. The anticipated deal is designed to make it as easy to 
sell a Chrysler in Bangkok as it is to buy a Toyota in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlines of a loosely worded commitment to free trade began to emerge as 
ministers from 18 nations skirting the Pacific Rim sat down to their second 
annual meeting aimed at improving economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a general consensus that the year 2020 should be a goal and a vision 
for free trade in the region," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher are attending the two days of negotiations at the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum. President Clinton, who hosted the group's inaugural 
session in Seattle last year, is flying in for a Monday summit of Pacific 
leaders in the hilltop retreat of Bogor that is expected to formally endorse 
the trade proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade idea, which would require the developing countries of Asia to reduce 
tariffs and other barriers to imports, has won support from countries on 
various steps of the development ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do hope that our meeting in Bogor will produce a basic agreement on the 
cooperation among APEC members that will accelerate trade liberalization and 
investment among us," said Indonesian President Suharto, who is hosting this 
year's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Suharto, the 73-year-old leader of this impoverished nation of 180 million, is 
widely credited with providing the momentum necessary to swing skeptics such as 
Malaysia and China to endorse the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono described the proposal as 
"very ambitious" but added that Japan hopes the leaders will send a "very 
strong political message for trade and investment liberalization." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 members of APEC are the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, 
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, Japan, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, China and Taiwan. 
As was the case last year, Taiwan's leader was asked not to attend the talks to 
avoid conflicts with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there appears to be agreement on the outlines of a trade plan, the 
details could still scuttle a formal pact. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, developed countries such as the United States and Japan would 
be required to move faster than developing countries in removing trade 
barriers.  
</P>
<P>
 Countries such as China maintain that they should be given the maximum time, 
while the United States argues that China's huge economy already places it in 
the ranks of the developed world. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing countries tend to add steep taxes to imports as a way of 
discouraging consumers from buying overseas goods and to protect their own 
industries. The United States, which has relatively low duties on imports, 
wants to see these barriers removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really moving forward rapidly," Kantor said. "I'm impressed how much 
consensus there is." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kantor added that a detailed agreement would take years to stitch 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 One indication of the spirit of cooperation in Jakarta was the resolution of a 
deadlock over a non-binding code to govern investments. The United States had 
blocked the adoption of the code because it believed that the wording was too 
vague on such points as removing laws that give domestic investors advantages 
over foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 All decisions at the APEC meeting are made by consensus, which means that a 
single country can veto any proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the United States agreed to a compromise package that removed the 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to present a unified recommendation," said Nancy Adams, the chief 
U.S. delegate to the investment talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the real significance of the APEC talks is that, taken together 
with other trade liberalization moves, such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and next month's Summit of the Americas in Miami, the new trade 
environment will boost the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said he doubts that the Republicans' capture of both houses of Congress 
will slow that momentum, saying the elections "are not going to affect our 
trade policy." 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, Kantor said he met Thursday with Indonesian Manpower 
Minister Abdul Latief, and the Indonesian presented a "comprehensive program" 
aimed at improving workers' rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Kantor's office is now investigating whether Indonesia should lose trade 
preferences because of allegations that the country does not allow its workers 
freedom to join labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an international outcry earlier this week when an Indonesian court 
sentenced Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the country's largest independent union, 
to three years in prison for allegedly inciting violence during labor unrest 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the Indonesians are seeking the help of organizations such as the 
AFL-CIO to improve the country's labor record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indonesians have promised annual reviews of the minimum wage to bring pay 
scales above the poverty level. But the proposed reforms showed no easing of 
the government's opposition to the formation of new unions in competition with 
the state-run union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will say that this comprehensive program is not enough," Kantor said. 
"Others might say that this program resolves all our outstanding issues. The 
truth lies somewhere between."

U.S., CHINA IN TALKS ON GATT RULES; TRADE: CHINA WANTS WASHINGTON'S BACKING IN 
MEMBERSHIP BID. KEY ISSUE IS WHETHER BEIJING SHOULD GET MORE LENIENT TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration and China launched an intensive, high-level drive 
Friday to resolve the most important and acrimonious dispute between the two 
countries, trying to settle on the rules that will govern China's future 
economic relations with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
met for 45 minutes in the first of three scheduled Cabinet-level meetings 
between the two countries this weekend. They will be followed by a summit 
meeting between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday. 
Clinton will arrive in Jakarta on Sunday to attend an Asian trade conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In all of the sessions, China is expected to press the United States to 
support its bid for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
In effect, China wants to join the club of the world's leading trading nations, 
and to do so as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The main question is whether China -- now emerging as one of the world's 
leading economic powers -- should be given different, more lenient treatment 
than American, Western European and Japanese companies in the world trading 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has huge implications for American companies that try to sell 
their goods in China. At issue is the extent to which China may give special 
protection for its own industries, and to favor them over foreign products or 
companies, as it enters the GATT and its successor, the new World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 When American companies try to do business in China, "we still often face a 
Chinese market that is closed," Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told 
reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is also important beyond the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say that if they let China enter the world trading system on 
special or privileged terms, they may be asked in the future to do so for other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any special conditions we give to China will have broad implications for the 
next members of GATT," one senior Clinton Administration official explained. 
"There hasn't been a major new member of GATT for a long time. All of us 
recognize that Russia and the Eastern European countries will be next in line." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, China has been arguing that it is still an impoverished, 
developing country and should not be forced to compete on equal terms with 
developed nations. Chinese officials point out that China's per capita income 
level remains low, no more than a few hundred dollars per year. 
</P>
<P>
 But American officials counter that China's economy is growing so fast that it 
cannot be lumped with developing countries such as, say, Rwanda, which have 
weak economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is the second- or third-largest economy in the world," U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters Friday. "It has a $28-billion trade 
surplus with the United States. . . . I don't think China's situation would 
enable it to be considered a developing country." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor is expected to meet with China's minister of foreign economic relations 
and trade, Wu Yi, for more than three hours Sunday in what appears to be a 
determined effort to settle the dispute. Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown 
will also meet this weekend with the trade minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, Administration officials say, China has suggested 
repeatedly that if it cannot get what it wants from the Clinton Administration 
on the GATT issue, then it will block progress toward trade liberalization at 
the summit of Asian nations that Clinton will attend here next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and other nations, such as Indonesia, are asking 
the leaders of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to adopt a 
joint statement pledging to work for free trade in the region by a fixed date, 
such as 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese have been trying to say, 'Our price for signing the (Asian) 
leaders' statement is U.S. support for China's admission to GATT,' " one senior 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 China has been bargaining hard to gain admission to the world trading group in 
time to be considered a special member of the new World Trade Organization when 
it is set up in January. And Beijing has applied the brunt of its pressure on 
the United States, which it views as the principal obstacle to getting into 
GATT on the terms it wants.

SQUID SPRINT IN TOKYO: TO THE VICTOR GOES THE SUSHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Squid sprints brought downtown Tokyo to a virtual halt Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered around a 13-foot-long, 24-inch-deep tank of water at the entrance to 
a mall in the Ginza shopping district, hundreds of office workers cheered on 
their favorite squids in the bizarre race. 
</P>
<P>
 The squids, racing in six lanes, were prodded into motion with sticks. The 
event was staged as a promotion by a northern tourism association. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big hit at home so we thought Tokyoites would love it even more," a 
Kazamaura Tourism Assn. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never timed how fast squids can swim, but the bigger ones shoot across 
the four-meter track in a matter of seconds," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning bets entitled a gambler to enter a lottery for the prize -- the 
winning squid, a culinary delicacy.

RIO RESIDENTS FEEL ARMY HAS CUT CRIME; BRAZIL: TROOPS HAVE TAKEN LITTLE ACTION. 
SOME FEAR VIOLENCE IF SOLDIERS CONFRONT DRUG DEALERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 No massive arrests have been made, not a shot has been fired, but already 
residents here have begun to feel a modicum of relief in the early stages of an 
unprecedented effort by the army to roll back the crime wave that has plagued 
Brazil's most famous city for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the army took control of state and city law enforcement last week, drug 
traffickers who lord over the city's poor communities have begun to lie low. 
</P>
<P>
 Petty thieves and bandits who prey on the more affluent have begun to 
disappear from city streets, and for the first time in a long while, slum 
residents such as Joan Dark, a 23-year-old maid, can sit peacefully outside 
their homes without worrying about being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a life of leisure here now," said Dark, who sat with friends 
outside her Cachoeirinho shantytown home, just around the corner from a 
military outpost. "Before, it was hell. Shootings every night. People getting 
hit by stray bullets. The children couldn't play outside." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same sentiment miles away in the Jacarezinho shantytown, the base 
community for the Red Command crime gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living now as if we left the fire and entered paradise," said Antonio 
Fernades Alvez inside his secondhand shop there. "God help us that it works 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The army took control of Rio's 12,000 law enforcement officers under an 
agreement between President Itamar Franco and Rio Gov. Nilo Batista. Federal 
officials hope that they can do what the notoriously corrupt, abusive local 
authorities did not -- return this city to its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence in Rio -- a city of 10 million where more than 23 people are murdered 
daily and gun battles between police and bandits have regularly closed schools 
-- has sent the city on a slide over the last decade. Since 1988, tourism 
dollars have dropped by $800 million annually. Of Brazil's 35 largest banks, 
only one is still based in Rio. Hundreds of the nation's largest private 
businesses have left the state in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The army, so far and at least symbolically, is winning the war against drug 
traffickers and robbery gangs by taking barely any action. Troops have set up 
only one visible post, complete with sandbags and armed soldiers, outside the 
Marcilio Dias Naval Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 There, gunfire from drug traffickers from two warring favelas , or slums, used 
to rain down nightly upon the hospital, with bullets sometimes penetrating 
patient rooms and even the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much calmer," said Luiz Nasimento, 45, a nurse for 20 years at the 
facility. "The shooting used to be constant, but now it's stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 A few army tanks and heavy trucks have been seen transporting personnel and 
materiel along the Niteroi Bridge leading into the city from northern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been few other visible signs of army activity, and the early 
rounds of the army's offensive has largely been waged not in the streets but 
through the media. Newspapers and nightly newscasts have breathlessly carried 
reports of impending action. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, army officials said they had targeted about 150 drug lords for 
immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
 They later said they had the names of 300 corrupt, ranking police officials 
who will be dismissed and possibly jailed soon. Eight top police officials, who 
had already been singled out by prosecutors, resigned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officials had said that helicopters had been scrutinizing the shantytown 
strongholds of drug lords and that generals had mapped out attack routes. 
</P>
<P>
 But later, army officials said they had ruled out storming the hills on which 
most of the city's 400 shantytowns are nestled. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said, they had mapped out plans for "major action," the nature 
of which will become apparent once it was under way. Finally, Justice Minister 
Alexandre Dupeyrat said the target date for the maneuvers had been moved up to 
occur before the state's election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing apparently has happened yet, but the dire talk has had an effect: Many 
drug traffickers are reportedly scurrying out of the city to the adjacent 
states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, to wait out the army siege. 
</P>
<P>
 In two poor communities this week, other drug traffickers left small, symbolic 
caches of shotguns, machine guns and automatic pistols on the steps of 
community centers. These were accompanied by notes, saying they want no part of 
a confrontation with the army. 
</P>
<P>
 And just days after the army moved in, a drug trafficker was shot by fellow 
drug lords. His bullet-riddled body was found stuffed into the back of a stolen 
car after he sent a note to the army daring generals to invade his territory in 
the Nova Brasilia shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug dealers are trying to keep a low profile," said Fernando Reddalo, 
24, of Vigario Geral shantytown, where 21 people were killed by masked police 
officers last year. "They don't respect the police, but they respect the army." 
</P>
<P>
 The random violence that has plagued Rio has abated, but it has hardly 
disappeared. On separate days early this week, a mother and daughter were 
wounded by stray bullets, and a 43-year-old maid was fatally wounded by an 
errant round as she prepared to board a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents across Rio report a lessening of tensions and fear since the 
army took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different, you can feel it, and for me, there is a great a sense of 
satisfaction in them being here," said Ralph Salgueirro, 46, a real estate 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Brazilians -- who lived for more than two decades under a military 
dictatorship -- are anxiously awaiting the army's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that a lot of innocent people are going to get killed if they 
invade," said Dalva Ameval, 48, who was visiting her father at the naval 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Fialho, public relations manager for the Copacabana Palace Hotel, said 
she is concerned about talk of keeping the army in the city through next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a military government, and it was a bad experience," Fialho said.  
</P>
<P>
 But many people, who for years have endured the terror inflicted by drug wars 
and who are most likely to be in the way of bullets if any shooting starts 
between troops and traffickers, say they want action soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army has got to invade and kill them all," said Silvera Olveira, 23, 
whose 7-year-old son was shot in the foot by a stray bullet. "If they don't, 
they'll just come back when (the army) leaves. Just kill them all so we can 
live in peace."

WOMAN TO END GUATEMALA HUNGER STRIKE; HUMAN RIGHTS: U.S. LAWYER WILL SEEK 
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST ARMY OFFICERS. SHE HAD STARVED HERSELF FOR 32 DAYS IN 
EFFORT TO LEARN OF HER HUSBAND'S FATE.

<P>
 An American lawyer who has been on a hunger strike in Guatemala for 32 days 
said Friday that she is changing her tactics for pressuring Guatemalan 
authorities for information on her missing husband's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Harbury, 43, said she will end her hunger strike and seek criminal 
charges against eight Guatemalan army officers, whom she claims have committed 
crimes against her husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a Mayan guerrilla 
commander who has been missing since March, 1992. The army says Bamaca died at 
that time in a firefight with an army unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before seeking criminal charges, Harbury plans to fly to Washington this 
weekend for talks with White House officials who, she said, want to talk with 
her. She expects to return to Guatemala in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbury's intentions were disclosed in a letter made available here by her 
public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She began her hunger strike Oct. 11 and said she would continue her fast until 
death or until Guatemalan authorities owned up to what she says is a 2 1/2-year 
unbroken record of deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 She had assumed her husband was killed in the 1992 firefight. But a guerrilla 
colleague of Bamaca's, Santiago Cabrera Lopez, claimed to have seen Bamaca in 
detention. Cabrera has testified before the United Nations and the Organization 
of American States that he saw Bamaca in a secret military prison several times 
during 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Harbury was taken to a site 175 miles northwest of Guatemala City 
where the bodies of two unidentified men were exhumed. She said neither was her 
husband. Harbury's lawyer, Jose Pertierra, said the government concocted 
Thursday's exhumations "to deflect criticism from the ineptness of the 
government's investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Guatemala on Friday, Harbury and Pertierra met with U.S. Ambassador Marilyn 
McAfee, who Pertierra said told them that U.S. officials had concluded Bamaca 
was taken captive by the army in the March, 1992, firefight and had suffered 
injuries that were not life-threatening. But McAfee also reportedly said U.S. 
officials had no information to suggest Bamaca was alive more than a few weeks 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbury, a Harvard law graduate, met Bamaca in 1990 while interviewing 
guerrillas in western Guatemala. They married a year later in Texas.

CAT TRAPPED 5 WEEKS IN WALL DIES AFTER RESCUE

<P>
 A kitten trapped within an apartment's bathroom wall for five weeks died as 
rescuers using high-tech equipment tried to save it, the rescuers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Various experts had been called in to try and free the traumatized cat, which 
they located with thermal-imaging equipment often used to find people trapped 
in accidents or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of three men worked about 16 hours, an International Rescue Corps 
spokesman said, and after removing the bathtub the kitten was retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was actually alive," the spokesman said. "But for whatever reason, and 
it's probably the noise, the cat just died."

U.S. ENVOY'S GUARD SOUGHT IN HAITIAN EMPLOYEES' DEATHS

 A bodyguard of the U.S. ambassador to Haiti is the chief suspect in the 
killings of two Haitian employees of the embassy who were shot during an armed 
robbery, a U.S. official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said American officials want to 
question Francois College, 25, in connection with the robbery and killings. 
Schrager would not say whether College was U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing's 
bodyguard, but another U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, confirmed 
that College was one of about eight guards who protect the ambassador and other 
senior embassy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 College is being sought in Port-au-Prince for questioning in the robbery 
Thursday, in which a gunman hijacked an American Embassy vehicle, killing a 
Haitian man and woman and seriously injuring another Haitian man, all of whom 
were embassy employees. The gunman made off with about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims had just left a bank with pay packets for embassy personnel when a 
man flagged down their car, a U.S. Embassy official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who requested anonymity, said the three victims had given the 
man a ride, but he shot them and escaped with the money. The survivor recounted 
the incident before being airlifted to the United States, the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Embassy distributed a "Wanted" poster to security forces and 
local media with a description of the man and telephone numbers to call with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. personnel went to the man's house Thursday but found it empty. "No trace, 
nothing there. His wife was gone," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the U.S.-installed Haitian 
government and the American military over claims that U.S. troops on Wednesday 
fired tear gas at demonstrators loyal to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Aristide government said American troops fired tear gas on 
demonstrators in Cap Haitien after they protested against a right-wing bishop 
Aristide had embraced in a gesture of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. military officials denied that the troops, who have been greeted as 
heroes since arriving to restore Aristide, had used tear gas to disperse the 
crowd of Haitians.

 Poorly educated people are four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's 
disease than those with higher levels of learning, a new Canadian study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, published this week in the medical journal Neurology, confirm 
much of the evidence collected in the last few years showing that people who 
are more mentally active throughout their lives tend to be insulated against 
the effects of Alzheimer's, said epidemiologist Joan Lindsay, one of the 
investigators in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean if you are educated, then you won't get the disease, but the 
likelihood is much lower," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was conducted in 36 cities across Canada and involved more than 
10,000 people.

 Guerrillas bombed targets in Lima for a second straight day, and the military 
said it killed 30 Shining Path rebels in the Andean highlands. Bombs exploded 
at two branch offices of the Banco de Credito, the country's largest bank, 
causing damage but wounding no one, police said.Dynamite was thrown at the bank 
offices in the working-class districts of La Victoria and Brena. A day earlier, 
rebels set off a car bomb in front of an air force officers club, damaging a 
wall without causing injuries. Meanwhile, the military said 30 guerrillas were 
killed earlier in the week in a battle about 200 miles east of Lima. Three 
soldiers were killed and seven injured in the hourlong battle when troops on 
patrol encountered a column of about 100 rebels. President Alberto Fujimori has 
pledged to eliminate the Shining Path by the end of his term in July, 1995.

 South Africa's Parliament approved the first major post-apartheid law giving 
thousands of blacks stripped of their land under apartheid three years to 
reclaim it.The Restitution of Land Rights Bill is the first legislation 
implementing President Nelson Mandela's pre-election promise to redress the 
wrongs of nearly 46 years of apartheid. The bill needs only Mandela's signature 
to put it on the statute books. It provides for a land claims court and a 
commission on the restitution of land rights. It gives blacks who were moved 
off their land in the racial segregation plans of previous white-minority 
governments three years to claim restitution and compensation.

GOP LAWMAKERS PLAN WHITEWATER PROBES; CONGRESS: REP. JIM LEACH AND SEN. ALFONSE 
D'AMATO PLEDGE THAT NEW INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE WITCH HUNTS. NEW YORK SENATOR 
WANTS EARLY HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two Republicans expected to head the House and Senate Banking committees 
in the new Congress plan intensive investigations into the role of President 
Clinton in the failed Whitewater real estate venture -- inquiries that could 
become a major headache for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) -- in line to head the House Banking, Finance 
and Urban Affairs Committee -- predicted that their boss will use the subpoena 
power to obtain Whitewater-related documents that federal regulators refused to 
give him when he was a minority member of the committee last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) -- scheduled to head the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee -- has vowed to conduct a new round of 
Whitewater hearings shortly after the next Congress convenes in January, 
although he said the inquiry would not be a "witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach also pledged to avoid a witch hunt and does not plan to schedule 
hearings as early as D'Amato. But members of his staff said that House hearings 
are certain sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach sent conciliatory signals Friday, saying that he does not see the 
Whitewater matter as one of the top priorities of the committee when he becomes 
its chairman. He said that, above all, he wants to avoid any 
"mean-spiritedness" in the inquiry.  
</P>
<P>
 In a Washington speech and in talks with reporters later, Leach said he plans 
a careful investigation. "I'm not contemplating early hearings on Whitewater," 
he told reporters following his address. "I want to assess what (Whitewater 
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr) does." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the congressman and his aides also said he wants to work on substantive 
banking and financial regulatory issues -- such as problems with the 
derivatives market -- before turning to the Whitewater inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republicans agreed with that approach, saying it would be bad politics 
for the Republican-controlled Congress to open Whitewater hearings immediately. 
"If we are perceived as a Whitewater Congress instead of as a reform Congress, 
we're dead," said one Republican staff member who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said he believes strongly that Congress' role in investigating the 
Whitewater matter should focus as much as possible on the larger public policy 
questions it raises, notably what he sees as possible political influence on 
independent regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iowa congressman and his aides said they hope that the White House and 
regulatory agencies will supply the documents they will need without use of the 
subpoena power. A Leach aide said that the new chairman probably will send a 
letter soon after taking over the committee, requesting documents denied to him 
last summer by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Resolution Trust Corp., 
two agencies that investigated Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed 
Arkansas thrift owned by Clinton's one-time business partner in Whitewater 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr is investigating whether Madison Guaranty improperly funneled money into 
then-Gov. Clinton's 1984 reelection campaign in Arkansas or into the Whitewater 
real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, both banking committees concluded hearings under Democratic 
leadership that were narrowly focused on White House contacts with Treasury 
Department officials over the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty's 1989 
seizure by the government. The RTC is an arm of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said he wants to avoid turning his committee into a vehicle for airing 
the dirty linen of the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. "I 
believe personally and I've felt from the very beginning that the main issue 
involved in Whitewater is full disclosure and public accountability," Leach 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that's established, it's an issue that can be put behind us. Given the 
new organization of the Congress, I feel very strongly that this is an issue 
that should be approached very cautiously and carefully and there will be no 
rush to judgment. And I will do my best to ensure that there is no 
mean-spiritedness. If there is disclosure and accountability, my instinct would 
be largely to embrace it and not to have a water-torture approach." 
</P>
<P>
 But D'Amato said he wants early hearings in the Senate. Appearing on ABC-TV's 
"Nightline" program Thursday night, the New York senator, one of Clinton's 
harshest critics on the issue, said Republicans will be professional and 
efficient in their investigation. "The Whitewater hearings will be resumed . . 
. but this will not be a witch hunt," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A White House official, who asked not to be named, commented: "D'Amato said he 
will come back to it, and I'm sure he will. We'll have to see how they (D'Amato 
and Leach) divide up what they want to look at, who is going to do what topics. 
And we're waiting to see what the independent counsel's position is going to be 
on the Arkansas phase."

 A man convicted of killing a Senate aide nearly three years ago was sentenced 
Thursday to 26 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Alprin called the January, 1992, slaying of 
Samuel Thomas Barnes "one of the most dastardly and despicable acts I've ever 
seen or heard of." Alprin said he wished he could have sentenced Edward Evans 
Jr., 21, to more prison time. 
</P>

 Barnes, a legislative aide to Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) died four days 
after being shot in the back of the head at close range near his home about a 
mile from the Capitol.

ELECTION CLOUDS OUTLOOK FOR WORLD TRADE PACT; COMMERCE: CONGRESS' VOTE THIS 
MONTH ON GATT ACCORD COULD INDICATE HOW CLINTON'S INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AGENDA 
WILL FARE IN NEW POLITICAL CLIMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Bill Clinton made trade policy a centerpiece of his economic program two 
years ago, he cited its broad bipartisan and economic appeal. Expanded trade, 
he declared, would protect American workers from unfair competition while 
opening foreign markets to the products of the nation's fields and factories.  
</P>
<P>
 But the upheaval unleashed by Tuesday's elections threatens to throw cold 
water on President Clinton's efforts to win congressional approval of a new 
world trade agreement. While most Clinton aides say that they expect the trade 
legislation to pass when a lame-duck Congress takes it up later this month, one 
senior Administration official said he fears that it could be in "deep 
trouble."  
</P>
<P>
 That outlook is a minority view, but other officials expressed concern that 
this week's electoral shake-up could threaten the Administration's goal of 
expanding the domestic economy by forging new ties to the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote on the trade plan, scheduled for late this month, could provide an 
early signal of how Clinton's international economic agenda will fare in the 
new post-election political environment. Since many of the current members of 
Congress will be returning, the vote could also presage whether the new 
Republican majority and the Democratic minority will be able to find common 
ground on politically sensitive issues, particularly those involving foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six months ago, no one was paying a lot of attention" to the trade plan, said 
Lyn Nofziger, a Republican with long years of Washington experience. "Now, a 
lot of people will be paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton on Thursday equated the vote with such historic congressional 
decisions as those on the League of Nations after World War I and the Marshall 
Plan after World War II, and said that a delay in implementing the trade plan 
"will jeopardize our leadership and our prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the key link to free trade, more open societies and economic growth all 
around this world," he said in a speech at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 But recognizing the concerns about the impact of low-wage foreign competition 
on U.S. jobs, Clinton said: "For too many of our people, trade still appears to 
be a gale-force wind, just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a 
stable job at a good wage, just another problem adding to the already unstable, 
uncertain condition of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, warned, meanwhile, that the United States' failure to ratify the trade 
pact by the end of the year would deal a "mortal blow" to the world trade 
system. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is the organization that has 
overseen global trade throughout the post-World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the trade agreement, which would redraw the rules of 
international commerce, worry that key Republican leaders will retreat from 
their promise to support legislation implementing the new pact. The Republicans 
pledged their support in October, just before a final vote was to take place, 
on condition that Congress postpone the vote until after the election. The 
agreement's opponents are already working to put off the once-delayed vote 
until the new Congress takes office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the election result could well reach beyond the immediate trade vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the longer run, the so-called hawks, who are fighting expansion of free 
trade, see the possibility of a powerful alliance raising serious obstacles. 
Conservative Republicans, suspicious of a growing international bureaucracy 
that would regulate global trade, might team up with the pro-labor wing of the 
Democratic Party, led by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, 
that has long been skeptical of free trade, and other opponents of free trade 
led in the Senate by Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 Such a political union, if joined by enough members of the House and Senate, 
could thwart Clinton's program in the next two years. The possibility of such 
an alliance worries those who see trade as the ticket to economic expansion. It 
would mark the crumbling of traditional Republican support for free trade and a 
shift toward greater concern that the international trade authority was 
threatening U.S. independence and costing it money. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden you have a huge voter tidal wave against big government, and 
government doing too much," Nofziger said. "I wonder if some Republicans are 
not going to have to say to themselves: 'Will it be hurtful to me to be out 
there pushing another huge, international government program?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is an additional trade problem, likely to surface after the vote. Most 
recent trade agreements have been negotiated under "fast-track" authority from 
Congress. This procedure prohibits Congress from amending a pact after it is 
completed -- a course that assures trading partners that a meticulously written 
agreement will not be torn apart by the House and Senate. But the current 
authority expires at the end of this year and the President is expected to ask 
for a renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 To get that, said former Rep. William Frenzel, a Republican from Minnesota 
with long experience in the political world of trade issues, Clinton will "have 
to go to Congress hat in hand, and that is a costly process for a President 
with a Congress that is not his pal." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the economic President," Frenzel said. "The best way for him to make 
1996 look good is to have a thriving economy. He could, I suppose, cut taxes by 
a nickel or two, and increase spending by a nickel or two. None of these would 
have anywhere near the effect of a simple trade agreement. There's so much 
punch in a trade agreement, he can't ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the financial impact that the global trade plan is 
expected to have on the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 It would boost the strength of the U.S. economy by billions of dollars -- $100 
billion to $200 billion, according to the Administration. Even less sanguine 
estimates -- in the vicinity of $65 billion -- predict an impressive boost to 
the economy. To a large degree this would result from cutting tariffs by an 
average of 40%, eliminating them in such important sectors of the economy as 
steel, pharmaceuticals, paper and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Services, which account for about 60% of the U.S. economy, would be brought 
under the rules of the international trading community and made more open, 
contributing to a likely expansion of international operations in accounting, 
engineering, advertising and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would open agricultural trade, bring high-tech industries into 
the trading regime and -- proponents argued -- by expanding foreign sales of 
U.S. goods, it would create 500,000 jobs in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said that, in agreeing to changed rules for international trade, 
the United States would leave itself open to the demands of an international 
bureaucracy running the new World Trade Organization, which would replace the 
47-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They also said that it 
would leave certain industries, among them textile and garment manufacturers, 
open to unprotected competition with companies paying much lower wages in poor 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement's supporters have begun to worry because Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), 
the likely Senate majority leader in January, has begun raising questions about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sunday, Dole has emphasized that he is getting more mail from Kansas 
raising doubts about the trade plan than he got a year ago over the 
controversial North American Free Trade Agreement that linked Canada, the 
United States and Mexico in a new tariff-free trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It causes me some concern," he said at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and others took such comments as nearly certain 
indications that Dole is having second thoughts about supporting the plan and 
may act on his proposal, made in September, that a vote be delayed until the 
new Congress is installed. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on Clinton to "get out front and tell people across the country" 
what the trade plan would do and, in particular, just what the World Trade 
Organization would be. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that 
the Administration had no more than about 10 days to pin down votes for the 
trade plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, White House Chief of Staff Leon 
E. Panetta, Panetta's predecessor, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, and Robert E. Rubin, 
the President's chief economic adviser, are pressing business executives to 
pressure their Republican allies in the House and Senate to support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the official said, the real fear is that the Republicans will try to put 
off a vote until next year, despite assurances by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
the likely Speaker of the House, that he will support the measure in the 
lame-duck session. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Republicans nor Democrats who favor the plan would gain by a delay, 
said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican adviser who was former President 
Ronald Reagan's last White House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't help the Republicans to block it or to delay it and it doesn't 
help Clinton to say 'OK, let's wait,' " he said.

 Democrat Parris N. Glendening was clinging to a slim lead over Republican 
Ellen R. Sauerbrey on Friday night and seemed destined to be declared 
Maryland's next governor if the current trend in the absentee ballot count 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauerbrey appeared to acknowledge as much."We might not close the gap," she 
said. "But the issue, regardless of how the absentee ballots turn out -- and 
I'm not conceding that -- there is a much more significant issue in terms of 
the election process. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, we're just continuing to work," she said. She vowed to 
fight on through legal means as a team of 16 investigators she hired began 
looking into complaints of voter fraud and election irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, Sauerbrey closed to within 1,569 votes of Glendening after 
trailing him by 6,187 out of nearly 1.4 million cast.

VETERANS UNDERREPRESENTED IN ADMINISTRATION, GROUP SAYS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veterans are seriously underrepresented in senior Administration positions, 
and those who fought in Vietnam have been ignored in the appointment of White 
House staff, says a study by veterans interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans activist John Wheeler, using Office of Personnel Management figures, 
said only 21% of the nearly 600 men appointed as of last June to offices 
needing Senate confirmation were veterans. Among White House staff, the figure 
was far smaller, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, 30% of a similar number of George Bush Administration 
appointees in December, 1992, were vets. Nearly half the American male 
population over age 35, 64% of male senators and 45% of male House members are 
veterans.

 Wheeler did the study with Lewis Puller Jr., winner of the Pulitzer Prize for 
his autobiography recounting his struggle with wounds, including loss of his 
legs, suffered in Vietnam. Puller committed suicide last May.

 White House spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said there were minimal differences 
between this and previous administrations in the hiring of veterans. She said 
the White House and the President "have been very attentive to reaching out to 
veterans when it comes to the hiring process and will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's White House differs from that of Bush and previous 
presidents in that many of its younger staffers grew up at a time when the 
United States had a volunteer Army and was engaged in no major wars. As a 
college student during the Vietnam War, Clinton joined anti-war protests and 
avoided the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, who has been pressing the White House for more than a year on the 
veterans employment issue, said the generational change was no excuse for the 
dearth of top slots going to people with national service experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton observed Veterans Day by saluting the nation's military for 
"standing watch for freedom and security." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at Arlington National Cemetery, he promised the nation would not 
forget those still unaccounted for as a result of the Vietnam War, and praised 
forces serving in the Middle East and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to share this Veterans Day with you in this magnificent place of 
rest and reverence," Clinton said. "We say, simply and from the bottom of our 
hearts, 'Thank You.' "

 Emil Kijek hit the first hole in one of his life.Then he dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of happy, but he wasn't jumping with joy and all that," said 
Morris Dumont, who was golfing with Kijek on Thursday. But then, at the next 
tee, the 79-year-old Kijek approached the ball, rolled his eyes, said: "Oh, 
no," and collapsed. The cause of death was not immediately released.

 The Coast Guard suspended a search for three Canadian scuba divers missing for 
seven days after their boat sank, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23,500-square-mile search in the Gulf of Mexico failed to find Omar 
Schearer, 26, Kent Munro, 25, and Dave Madott, 25, all from Mississauga, 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing trio and a fourth man, Jeff Wandich, 27, were on a diving trip 
about 55 miles from Ft. Myers, Fla., when their 25-foot boat went down. Wandich 
managed to swim to a lighthouse platform, from which he was rescued by 
helicopter.

invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The National D-day Memorial Foundation announced its decision Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford, which had 3,200 residents in 1944, lost 23 of its 35 soldiers in 
Company A of the 116th Infantry Regiment in the Normandy invasion. Nineteen 
died in the first 15 minutes. Bedford now has 6,000 people.

REV. H. K. RASBACH; MINISTER, ADVISER TO MOVIE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. H. K. Rasbach, pastor of Hope Lutheran Church of Hollywood for 35 
years and a pioneer in producing religious films, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Monday after a long illness, church officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasbach began his career in 1941 when he built the First Lutheran Church of 
Fullerton. He moved to the Hollywood church in 1947, and when he retired in 
1982 turned over that ministry to his son, Mark. 
</P>
<P>
 He also became a scholar and a figure in the film industry. He produced "The 
Good Samaritan" in 1937, which won the Ohio Picture Council award, and "The Way 
of Peace" in 1947, which warned of nuclear holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasbach served as an adviser to Cecil B. DeMille on "The Ten Commandments" and 
George Stevens on "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Stevens rewarded the minister 
by donating the central cross from the film set to Hope Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Always interested in promoting better understanding between Christians and 
Jews, Rasbach made a continuing study of DeMille's 1927 silent film "King of 
Kings" and wrote an unpublished book about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first movie maker to attempt to dramatize the last days of Jesus 
of Nazareth with the Jews in mind," Rasbach once told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor said one of DeMille's Jewish contemporaries, Sam Goldwyn, wrote to 
DeMille: "You have done more to eliminate race hatred than all the sermons and 
all the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasbach served on the National Council of Churches West Coast Commission on 
film and broadcasting, reviewing scripts to make sure they conformed to the 
Hollywood Motion Picture Code. 
</P>
<P>
 When the landmark Hope Church burned in 1983, Rasbach helped his son plan the 
new church and raise funds to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Rasbach is survived by his wife, Esther, three 
daughters, Sharon Goldsmith, Judy Swenson and Pat Rasbach, and five 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Hope Lutheran 
Church.

MICHAEL O'DONOGHUE; ORIGINAL 'SNL' WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Original "Saturday Night Live" writer Michael O'Donoghue, a two-time Emmy 
award winner who later wrote screenplays for Gilda Radner and Bill Murray, has 
died. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donoghue died at St. Vincent's Hospital on Tuesday after suffering a massive 
cerebral hemorrhage at his Manhattan home, said his wife, Cheryl Hardwick. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote many of the show's funniest sketches, including the "Wolverines" 
sketch that opened the first show in 1975. O'Donoghue's writing for the 
late-night comedy program earned him Emmys in 1976 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 He co-wrote Murray's 1988 film "Scrooged" and Radner's 1979 movie "Gilda 
Live." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donoghue's black humor helped him land jobs at the two cutting-edge homes 
for 1970s comedy: "SNL" and the National Lampoon. His big career break came as 
one of the founders of the "National Lampoon Radio Hour" in 1973, where he 
worked with Radner, John Belushi and Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his writing, O'Donoghue also appeared with the brilliant ensemble cast 
on "SNL." In the show's opening skit, he played a teacher giving an English 
lesson to an immigrant played by Belushi. 
</P>
<P>
 With Belushi repeating the words, O'Donoghue delivered the program's maiden 
line: "I would like . . . to feed your fingertips . . . to the wolverines." 
</P>
<P>
 His two most recognizable bits were Mr. Mike's "Least Loved Bedtime Stories," 
where he spun gruesome kiddie tales, and his "impressions" of celebrities -- 
Elvis Presley, Tony Orlando, Mike Douglas -- taking 18-inch knitting needles in 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any good humor is sophomoric," he once said. "Sophomoric is the liberal word 
for funny." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donoghue stayed with the program as a performer and writer through the 1980 
season. He returned for one season in 1985 when the show was retooled. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote, produced and directed his own television special, "Mr. Mike's Mondo 
Video," but it was yanked by network censors in 1979. O'Donoghue instead 
released it in theaters, billing it as "The TV Show That Can't Be Shown on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 The quirky O'Donoghue, a native of Sauquoit in Upstate New York, also appeared 
in Woody Allen's acclaimed "Manhattan" and wrote a song recorded by Dolly 
Parton, "Single Women." 
</P>
<P>
 In a typically strange 1992 stunt, he drew attention when his collection of 
paint-by-numbers art was displayed at a SoHo gallery to huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheap white wine, cheap American paintings. What could be better?" he joked 
at the time.

NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER MURDERED IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran news photographer has been killed and his body burned, the latest in 
a string of high-profile slayings that have focused new attention on crime in 
the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the death of Yuri Korolyov, a 69-year-old photographer 
for the business monthly Deloviye Lyudi, was connected to his work, police 
spokesman Gennady Melnik said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Korolyov's charred body was found earlier this week along a highway 10 miles 
west of Moscow, and his burned car was discovered a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Korolyov contributed to Life and Time magazines and to United Press 
International since the 1960s. He is the 13th journalist killed this year in 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, Itar-Tass news agency said.

NAACP ACT IS APPARENT CHECK ON CHAVIS ALLY 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NAACP has told young members they are not eligible to vote in upcoming 
branch elections, apparently to block a takeover attempt of one chapter by a 
supporter of fired Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP board of directors changed election rules to require members age 17 
to 20 to join as adults in order to vote in branch elections.Before the change, 
youth members could vote as long as they were in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was announced two days after Chavis ally Earl King signed up 
thousands of 18- to 21-year-olds with $3 youth memberships through a 
registration drive. King is running for president of the South Side Chicago 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 T.H. Poole, chairman of the NAACP board committee on branches, denied there 
was an attempt to shut out young members of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. He said the change was needed so that youth 
members won't vote both in branch elections and elections in youth councils.

PENTAGON MAY BE LOSING OPERATION CODE NAME BATTLE; MILITARY: TITLES THESE DAYS 
LACK THE INSPIRING QUALITY OF 'OPERATION ANVIL,' 'OPERATION TORCH' AND OTHER 
WORLD WAR II-ERA MONIKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They beckon from the past, the great military battles and their still-stirring 
code names: Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Europe. Operation Torch, 
the U.S. landing in North Africa. Operation Anvil, the Allied liberation of 
southern France. 
</P>
<P>
 Now fast-forward to the 1990s:  
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. intervention in Somalia was called Operation Restore Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. rescue effort in Rwanda was named Operation Support Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * The American intervention in Haiti is known as Operation Uphold Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * And last month's urgent U.S. mobilization to prevent Iraqi troops from 
invading Kuwait again was Operation Vigilant Warrior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the sort of thing they'll remember in the year 2021," a Pentagon 
strategist conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity points to a paradox: While the quality of U.S. forces and their 
weapons have risen to an all-time high, the art of finding inspiring code names 
for what they do has become an unexpected casualty of East-West peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Even former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin L. Powell, himself no 
stranger to the plain-vanilla turn of phrase, found Operation Productive Effort 
-- the name proposed for a U.S. humanitarian aid mission to Bangladesh in 1991 
-- too humdrum to let out of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department planners eventually changed it to Operation Sea Angel, but 
that was inspired by the Bangladeshis, who first used the term to describe the 
Marine helicopter pilots who delivered relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always this boring. Winston Churchill, the great communicator of 
World War II, placed special importance on the need for bold-sounding code 
names for military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 He favored monikers such as "Overlord" -- which he approved personally -- in 
hopes that they might inspire Allied troops (and presumably entice historians 
as well). In 1943, he even laid down guidelines that still serve as a standard 
for would-be battle-dubbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department maintains a military-wide computer database -- known, 
in typical Pentagon style, by the initials NICKA, for Codeword Nickname and 
Exercise Term System -- that seeks to prevent duplication by allocating 
specific initials to individual commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Cmdr. Edwin A. Shuman, who heads the NICKA unit, said combat 
commanders are assigned a series of double-letter blocks -- from EB through EW, 
for example -- with the first word (say, "Early,") already provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The commanders then fill in the second (Early Bird through Early Wake-Up, to 
continue the example). In a high-profile operation, the names are reviewed by 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Once taken, a name is not used again for another two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is just to develop two-word nicknames, which are designed to inspire 
the troops or to send some sort of message to the public. The actual code names 
used by the military are only a single word long and are classified as top 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman said the services use up to several hundred code names each year, both 
for combat operations and for training exercises. Some -- such as Team Spirit, 
the annual joint U.S.-South Korean maneuvers -- are given the same name year 
after year for greater visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain amount of risk in striking out too boldly in picking out a 
code name. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army Reserve unit that once tried to name a road-building venture in 
Honduras "Operation Blazing Trails" ran into trouble when a too-literal 
translation came out close to the Spanish-language name for Shining Path, the 
notorious Maoist guerrilla group in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 It was abruptly withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the evidence clearly demonstrates, too many of today's code names 
are (a) lackluster, (b) uninspiring, (c) not very stirring and (d) just plain 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
 One exception -- Operation Desert Storm, the name given to the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War -- isn't bad by historical standards. But the buildup that preceded it 
was labeled Operation Desert Shield, a name that, perhaps justifiably, already 
has been all but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 The name "Vigilant Warrior," for the most recent U.S. deployment to Kuwait, 
has not found a permanent slot in many memories either and that operation took 
place barely a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen H. Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar, pointed out that the trend 
toward more lackluster code names runs counter to today's emphasis in 
government on public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pentagon is becoming more and more sophisticated at public relations, 
with more in-house flacks, but somehow these names sound as though they were 
written by committee -- and the answer is, they probably were," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gen. Dwight D.) Eisenhower probably woke up on the morning of the operation, 
and said: 'I know -- we'll call it Torch.' Now the code name is probably 
decided by an interdepartmental study group. What a comedown from before!" 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one knows precisely when military forces began using code names 
routinely, the late New Zealand etymologist Eric Partridge reported that the 
practice already had become entrenched during Elizabethan days, when London 
recorded almost 200 military code names. 
</P>
<P>
 Partridge's own research showed that many of the code names of that era were 
applied to persons or institutions. Lord Burghley, for example, was said to 
have used signs of the Zodiac, such as "Cancer" and "Leo" for top officials of 
that day.  
</P>
<P>
 Partridge estimated that during World War II the Allies and Axis powers 
(Germany, Italy and Japan) together devised more than 10,000 such names. The 
space race has added several hundred more. Even big companies use code names 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Soldiers, a U.S. Army publication, suggested that Churchill may have set 
the standard. Acutely aware of the value of symbolism in maintaining fighting 
spirit, he rejected names that he thought too boastful, frivolous, depressing 
or mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is wide," he wrote, "and intelligent thought will readily supply an 
unlimited number of well-sounding names which . . . do not enable some widow or 
mother to say that her son was killed in an operation called 'Bunnyhug' or 
'Ballyhoo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Churchill also insisted on approving all code names 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes code names have been designed to deceive an enemy. In 1943 the 
Allies dumped a corpse off the shores of Spain, with papers describing a 
fictitious "Operation Husky" to take place there. It kept German intelligence 
occupied for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Code names for joint U.S.-British operations came from the Combined 
British-United States Interservice Code Word Index, which ranged from "Aaron" 
(the battle of Bulawatan in New Britain) to "Zouave" (an operation in White 
Horse, Yukon Territory, Canada). 
</P>
<P>
 In between were names such as "Baldhead," (the assault on Masibang, New 
Guinea) "Brassiere," (the battle of Ulamaingi, New Britain), "Fiddlestick" (an 
operation in Vogelkop, New Guinea) and "Yoicks" (fighting at Visayan Sea in the 
Philippines). 
</P>
<P>
 Today's list is generated entirely by computer, which may explain how the 
selection got to be so dull. In recent months, the NICKA program appears to 
have been stuck on the words provide and restore, as in operations Provide 
Comfort and Restore Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts suggested that what may be needed now is a new effort dubbed 
Operation Provide Better Choices, followed by Operation Restore Pizazz to the 
Pentagon's code names. Pentagon's Name Game

SURVEY FINDS DISCONTENT IN LEGAL FIELD; TRENDS: OF ATTORNEYS IN STATEWIDE POLL, 
48% EITHER REGRET OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THEIR CHOICE OF PROFESSION.

<P>
 Barely half of the lawyers who responded to a statewide survey say they chose 
the right profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they would choose to become lawyers again if they were picking a 
career, 52% said yes, 29% said no, and 19% were uncertain, the State Bar 
Journal reports in its current edition. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's president, Donald Fischbach, said he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us believe we're doing a good job and benefiting society, but nobody 
likes us," he said. "We have threats of malpractice. Other people tell us when 
and how we can do things. This all adds to a tremendous burden." 
</P>
<P>
 "As California bar members view the future, the picture they see is far from 
rosy," said Deborah Hensler, director of the RAND Corp.'s Institute for Civil 
Justice, which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,700 of 5,000 randomly selected lawyers returned questionnaires in the 
survey conducted for the State Bar and the Commission on the Future of the 
Legal Profession. The bar said the margin of error was plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers' mixed view of their career choices corresponded with doubts about 
their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 A large majority, 67%, said attorneys were compromising professionalism as a 
result of business and economic pressures. Only 15% disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 41% said the ethical standards of most lawyers were high, with 25% in 
disagreement and the rest undecided. Forty-three percent said lawyers' fees 
were too high, with 28% disagreeing. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the current tally at 142,000, 63% of the respondents said there were 
too many lawyers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those surveyed had an equally gloomy view of the future. Sixty-four 
percent said lawyers' collegiality and civility would decline, and 78% said law 
practice would become more stressful. A prediction that lawyers would engage in 
less public service was endorsed by 43% and rejected by 26%, with the rest 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer advertising got generally bad reviews. Only 27% thought ads had made it 
easier for average citizens to find lawyers. Of those responding, 39% said they 
worked up to 40 hours a week practicing law, 43% said they worked between 41 
and 55 hours, and the rest said they worked longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent said they made less than $25,000 a year, 42% said they made 
between $25,000 and $74,999, and only 18% said they made more.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE SENDS WORKERS TO HELP S.F. CHRONICLE DURING STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune has sent a handful of reporters and production workers to 
the strikebound San Francisco Chronicle, a Tribune spokeswoman confirmed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newspapers have also been asked to help the Chronicle since 2,600 
reporters, salespeople, printers and delivery drivers went on strike against 
the paper, as well as the San Francisco Examiner, on Nov. 1, Tribune 
spokeswoman Faith Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Tribune, which did the same thing during a 1990 strike at the New 
York Daily News, asked for volunteers and that a handful accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of eight unions walked out in San Francisco after negotiators failed 
to reach an agreement on the future of about 150 delivery drivers' jobs, a 
raise and other issues. They had worked for a year without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronicle columnist Herb Caen led about 150 strikers at a rally Friday in 
Union Square. Union members handed out copies of the latest issue of their 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The machinists union, the one group of strikers not represented by the 
Conference of Newspaper Unions, reached a tentative settlement late Thursday. 
It still must be ratified by the union membership.

MASTERFUL, INNOVATIVE JAZZ SINGER-PIANIST CARMEN MCRAE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmen McRae, one of this era's premier vocalists, whose subtle 
interpretations of complex tonalities made her a favorite among both jazz 
musicians and their fiercely loyal fans, has died at her Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss McRae died Thursday night at the age of 74, it was reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 She had fallen into a near-coma four days earlier, a month after being 
hospitalized for a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her work was often overshadowed by the popular successes of Ella 
Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, there was, said Dave Brubeck, "no one like her." 
</P>
<P>
 Benny Carter, the pioneer big-band leader who met Miss McRae at a Harlem 
nightclub when she was 18 and featured her as a singer six years later in 1944, 
was asked to assess her unique voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't try," he said Friday. "That's like asking me to define jazz. . . . 
She always had her own individual way with a song." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the National Endowment for the Arts named Miss McRae one of its 
masters of jazz, hailing her "instinctive feeling for rhythm, her skillful 
vocal technique, her innovative scat singing, as well as her relaxed manner of 
presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 That essentially was her final achievement and it came as she was bedridden. 
She had been experiencing respiratory problems since 1990, when she first had 
difficulty breathing during a performance at the Blue Note jazz club in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be her last public performance. 
</P>
<P>
 With Fitzgerald and the late Vaughan, Miss McRae formed the troika of female 
American jazz singers. 
</P>
<P>
 She resisted efforts to commercialize her art, staying true to her jazz 
experiences and interpreting classic show tunes and blues with dazzling 
improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she spun a masterful web of song while 
moving around a bandstand in a crouch -- cradling the microphone as if it were 
a saxophone and then pulling herself erect for a dramatic coda -- sometimes a 
single note she seemed to hold for an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 A pianist as well as a singer, Miss McRae performed a repertoire that included 
"God Bless the Child," a song closely associated with her biggest influence, 
Billie Holiday; Cole Porter's "I've Got You Under My Skin"; Billy Joel's "New 
York State of Mind," and Dave Brubeck's "Take Five." 
</P>
<P>
 Brubeck, known for his complex, contrapuntal arrangements, said Friday that 
Miss McRae was always easy to work with. They recorded often in the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the most convoluted of his tunes, she would say, "You just play it; 
I can sing it," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Teddy Wilson, Holiday's accompanist and arranger, Miss McRae had met 
the addicted blues legend when she was in her late teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I adored her before I ever met her," Miss McRae told the Washington Post in 
1983. Like Holiday, she learned to inhale a lyric and then breathe life into 
the words she exhaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss McRae said she encouraged Holiday at a time when the legendary singer's 
talent was becoming diluted by alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 They would be out of an evening, but Miss McRae would have to leave early, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halfway through the night I would be so stoned and out of it I'd have to 
leave and go home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday eventually was destroyed by drugs and liquor, but Miss McRae quickly 
abandoned that lifestyle. Occasionally, though, she would "throw a note" in the 
Holiday tradition, a remembrance of her old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss McRae was born in New York City's Harlem in 1920 (although some 
references say 1922). Her parents arranged for lessons so she might become a 
concert pianist, but "I'd keep sheet music of pop tunes hidden among the 
classical stuff in the piano bench, and when everyone was out of earshot I let 
go with the pops," she told the New York Post in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, Miss McRae won an amateur talent contest at the Apollo Theater and went 
on to sing with Carter, Count Basie and Earl (Fatha) Hines. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, she became a solo singer-pianist, first in Chicago and 
then in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 With her expressive features surrounded by an arrangement of finely curled 
hair, and her dreamy expression, she quickly became popular through her 
appearances, and then through recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first album came out in 1954, and in 1955 she tied with Ella Fitzgerald 
for best female vocalist in a Metronome magazine poll. She had won the Down 
Beat magazine award for best new star a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Miss McRae made more than 20 albums, including "I Am Music on Blue 
Note," "Sound of Silence," "Just a Little Lovin'," "Portrait of Carmen," "It 
Takes a Whole Lot of Human Feelings," "Carmen's Gold" and "You Can't Hide 
Love." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz is a feeling," she once said. "If it has to be explained, it don't mean 
a damn. If the performer gets it, that's it. If the audience gets it, that's 
it. . . . Jazz is an interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 She was married twice: to be-bop drummer Kenny Clark and to pianist Ike 
Isaacs. Both marriages ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no services, at Miss McRae's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want a memorial," she told friends. "I don't want a funeral. I don't 
want flowers. All I want to be remembered for is my music." 
</P>

GROUP CALLS FOR YAROSLAVSKY REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of San Fernando Valley residents and business leaders advocating 
appointment of an interim representative to replace departing Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky is picking up City Council support, a leader of the group said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently formed Coalition for a Voting Representative for the 5th District 
held a news conference Friday outside Yaroslavsky's Sherman Oaks office to ask 
that the council appoint someone to replace the councilman, who joins the 
County Board of Supervisors next month.An election to replace him will not be 
held until June, leaving the district without a vote on the City Council until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 The group seeking an interim replacement hung a huge yellow sign on 
Yaroslavsky's door reading: "Vacant as of Dec. 5, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence that their campaign has begun to make an impact, members of the 
group noted that Council President John Ferraro, who has adamantly opposed the 
idea of an appointed representative, has said recently that he would support 
the appointment if it is favored by a council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, which is made up of influential business and homeowners groups, 
also said that Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents nearby west Valley 
communities, has voiced her support for an interim representative. A Chick 
spokesman confirmed Friday that she backs the group's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing more and more support as we show them this coalition of people 
who want representation," said Fred Gaines, a member of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn., one of several business and homeowners organizations that make 
up the group. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have thus far opted to leave the seat vacant, naming Ron 
Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst, to run the day-to-day operations 
of the district. Deaton will not have a vote.

HOW MANY LAWSUITS ARE NECESSARY?; VOTERS BALK AT THE PREDICTABLE LITIGATION ON 
187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 60% of Californians who went to the polls Tuesday voted to pass 
Proposition 187, denying most public services to undocumented residents. 
Judging by the citizen response in the days since, many who backed the measure 
are now outraged that tax-financed public agencies are being used to challenge 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the private sector, only hours after Proposition 187 passed, civil rights 
groups filed suit in federal district court to thwart its implementation 
pending a determination of its constitutionality. A hearing on the request is 
scheduled for next week; meanwhile, enforcement of the measure is held in 
abeyance. If successful, this privately financed suit could result in the 
invalidation of Proposition 187, in part or entirety. The other legal 
challenges, those involving taxpayer funds, focus on more specific concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 LAUSD ACTION: Much of the public's anger is directed at the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, which has joined with Sacramento and San Francisco 
districts to challenge the provisions directing schools to expel children 
identified as undocumented residents. The California School Boards Assn., 
representing 650 of the 1,000 school districts in the state, is taking the lead 
in this suit. But individual districts, like Los Angeles, that will feel the 
brunt of this measure believe they should step forward individually. They seek 
specific guidance from the courts to clarify their unique obligations under 
state law, federal educational guidelines and past U.S. Supreme Court rulings.  
</P>
<P>
 The anger over the use of tax dollars for lawsuits is understandable. One 
caller to local officials said Thursday: "This is not right. We put this issue 
in. It's the law and they are trying to fight it with my money."  
</P>
<P>
 However, the legal challenges to 187 were both predictable and unavoidable. As 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman noted, " . . . the voters have spoken, 
but they may have spoken in an unconstitutional way." Serious and valid 
questions about the constitutionality, scope and clarity of Proposition 187 
have dogged the measure since it qualified for the ballot, and these were among 
the reasons this newspaper vigorously opposed the initiative. These questions 
must be answered before schools move to expel students and hospitals turn away 
pregnant women and others in need of medical services. In addition, state and 
local agencies need far more detailed guidance than is found in the measure 
itself.  
</P>
<P>
 EIGHT, FOR STARTERS: That said, however, it's questionable whether there need 
be so many lawsuits -- there are at least eight so far. Public agencies would 
be wise to approach very cautiously the decision of whether to undertake 
separate lawsuits, pending the outcome of suits already filed. The Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors was right to do just that Thursday. The L.A. City 
Council, by contrast, directed the city attorney to try to clarify Proposition 
187 by challenging its constitutionality. Public agencies would be well-advised 
to wait and shepherd increasingly scarce tax dollars instead of duplicating 
existing lawsuits.

WORKING WITH ALL CREEDS; FUNDAMENTALISTS ARE KICKED OFF A SCHOOL BOARD IN SAN 
DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We hear a lot of talk nowadays about "values," about politically active 
Christian fundamentalists and about the separation of church and state. A vote 
of the public -- in suburban Vista in San Diego County this week -- in which 
members of a Christian conservative bloc on the school board were recalled 
suggests something about the ordinary citizens in the middle of this debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a democracy, it is they -- not the courts, not the legislatures and not 
even the religious leaders -- who at key moments pass judgment on where 
religious beliefs cross the line into the realm of intolerance. We are not 
enamored of recalls as a rule, but this one did coincide with a regularly 
scheduled general election, thus adding no expense. The results suggest that 
voters are wise enough to distinguish between legitimate concern over public 
morality and a narrow ideological agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The height of Thomas Jefferson's celebrated "wall of separation" between 
church and state has been challenged aggressively in recent years. In several 
parts of the United States, the wide-ranging conflict has led to litigation 
involving strict separatists like Americans United for Separation of Church and 
State and, increasingly, politically active groups like the Christian 
Coalition. Somewhere between lie citizens like those who voted this week in 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the din of the "culture wars" over abortion, prayer in schools, questions 
of human sexuality and other issues, it is not always easy to identify exactly 
how high or low "the wall" is perceived to be, given the concerns shared by 
diverse Americans for the moral and spiritual health of the nation. Some recent 
polls have found that many are very worried about the moral fabric of society. 
However, those same surveys suggest that the public does not necessarily buy 
into the agenda of those on the so-called religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vista vote is another indication that Americans are uncomfortable with a 
narrow and intolerant approach to public education. One successful board 
candidate said that the job was to "work with the entire community." She is 
right. In our diverse society, leaders of key institutions like the schools 
must serve all the people.

HARASSMENT WATCH; MUTUAL RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citizens concerned about wasteful government spending should be sure their 
public agencies are up to date on what constitutes sexual harassment, why it is 
wrong and how much it costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, the Police Department was alleged to be a hotbed of 
harassment.A number of female employees sued the police chief and a captain two 
years ago. Both men denied any wrongdoing and have since left the department. 
But an investigator for the city concluded that a trial probably would find 
there was an atmosphere of sexual harassment in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the city, without admitting wrongdoing, settled the remaining 
charges out of court, paying $1.2 million to seven women. That boosts the 
city's cost for the lawsuits to $3.3 million, including attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 There are welcome signs that Newport Beach has learned its lesson. It has 
instituted three-hour classes on sexual harassment for all city employees. The 
women's attorney said the department work environment had improved 
dramatically. Unfortunately the out-of-court agreement dictated that the women 
involved would not work for the department again. Some have moved out of state 
to start new lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, several Los Angeles and Orange County communities have 
shelled out taxpayers' hard-earned dollars because of charges of sexual 
harassment within law enforcement agencies. Those who have not gotten the 
message that those shenanigans belong in the past should get new jobs -- if 
anyone else will hire them.

NEW HOPE IN BLOODY SRI LANKA; PRESIDENT-ELECT EXTENDS OLIVE BRANCH TO REBELS IN 
SEEKING TO END LONG CONFLICT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The savagery of Bosnia and the carnage in countries like Rwanda and Somalia 
make it easy to forget the troubles of the island nation of Sri Lanka. Yet in 
that country, off the southern tip of India, a decade of ethnic clashes has 
killed more than 35,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's election of Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga as president 
offers hope that the slaughter will end. Kumaratunga has wisely and 
courageously vowed to "forge ahead" with the peace process, probably in the 
form of peace talks with Tamil guerrillas, who started the warfare in an 
attempt to carve out an independent nation in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Her foe in the election, Srima Dissanayake, campaigned on a platform of no 
talks. That was understandable; Dissanayake's husband, his party's presidential 
candidate, was assassinated last month. Police blamed Tamil guerrillas for the 
suicide bomb attack, which also killed 50 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissanayake's United National Party used mob violence and murder to help it 
maintain power for 17 years, during which the nation formerly known as Ceylon 
went steadily downhill. Once an outpost of prosperity and literacy in South 
Asia, Sri Lanka was overdue for a change of government. Voters, recognizing 
this, made Kumaratunga prime minister in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga herself is no stranger to violence. Her father was prime minister 
until his assassination in 1959 by a dissident Buddhist monk; six years ago 
Sinhalese militants killed her politician husband out of anger over the olive 
branches he and she had extended to the Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president is the first national officeholder in years who has reached 
out to minorities. She will have to walk a tightrope between the Tamils, who 
make up only a small minority of the nation of 17 million people, and the 
majority Sinhalese. Religion complicates the issue, with the Tamils mostly 
Hindu and the Sinhalese mostly Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Tamil guerrillas should recognize that this is their best 
chance in years to stanch the blood, and perhaps to gain some autonomy, if not 
independence, after a decade of tragedy.

TERRORIST ACTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Arafat Jostled by Mourners of Slain Activist" (Nov. 4): Now the leader of 
the PLO himself is sharing with Israel the taste of Arab terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Freih abu Madeen, the Palestinian Authority's minister of justice, accuses 
Israel of assassinating Hani Abed, a known member of the terrorist Islamic 
Jihad organization.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is absolutely no proof, or even evidence, that Israel is 
responsible. Madeen is quoted, "This is their style," in accusing Israel of the 
assassination, and he implies that only Israel has the means and the motive to 
commit such an act. But this claim flies in the face of 40 years of Arab 
terrorist actions. We in the U.S. have the New York World Trade Center bombing 
as proof of their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 This killing is another obstruction to the peace process and is not in 
Israel's interests. Arab terrorists opposed to peace with Israel have purposely 
committed many similar acts in the past, just to blame Israel and keep the 
flames against peace burning.

<P>
 I have written innumerable times about the one-sided reporting of The Times 
regarding Israel. In your graphic "Redrawing the Borders in War and Peace," the 
first illustration shows Israel as it was in 1949 and the text reads "The 
borders of Israel after it declared independence and fought first war with Arab 
neighbors." Actually, my recollection is that the United Nations declared the 
State of Israel in 1948, not 1949, and that upon the declaration of the State 
of Israel its Arab neighbors attacked the small state. 
</P>
<P>
 Why for heaven's sake don't you put down the facts? In the 1967 map you forgot 
to state that Syria attacked Israel, as did Jordan. Every time you mentioned 
that Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan you never mentioned the fact 
that Jordan captured East Jerusalem from Palestine; it never belonged to 
Jordan, check your facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, in reporting of the terrible, tragic terrorist attack on a bus in the 
center of Tel Aviv, you actually almost glorified the Hamas who attacked only 
defenseless people. You also failed to explain to the public what the aim of 
the Hamas group is, which they have declared thousands of times and that is the 
destruction of Israel and setting up Palestine as a fundamentalist Iran-type 
state.

 * Every peace-minded person abhors terrorism. The recent bus bombing in Tel 
Aviv is no exception, but the Israelis will retaliate by blowing up the 
"suspected" bomber's home (Oct. 21), and this is not considered terrorism. The 
U.S. gives Israel over $4 billion a year to perpetuate this kind of rationale.

 Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Ezer Weizman, et al. should reactivate the 
commandos in Israel and put them to work against Hamas. Yasser Arafat either 
does not feel like acting against Hamas, or maybe his hands are tied by his own 
party. His "apologies and condolences" don't mean a thing, unless he acts on 
behalf of humanity and stops this senseless slaughter of human beings.

ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Partisan Politics Swamps Environmentalists" (Oct. 17) contains several 
glaring errors which place an inaccurate -- and partisan -- spin on actions 
taken by Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 First, it is asserted that Safe Drinking Water legislation "foundered when 
House Republicans demanded amendments that would have diluted the bill." A 
review of the facts show this to be completely false. With strong Republican 
support, H.R. 3392, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1993, was 
unanimously passed in subcommittee and reported by the full Energy and Commerce 
Committee by a vote of 43-1. H.R. 3392 was taken up on the floor, again with 
strong Republican support, under what is known as "suspension," which is a 
motion to suspend the rules and pass the legislation. Under suspension, 
amendments are not in order unless they are made by the majority party member 
who called the bill up for consideration. Not only were there no amendments for 
the Republicans to demand, but the legislation was passed by a voice vote on 
Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you state that "House leaders discontinued efforts to get a package to 
overhaul the Superfund program passed after Republicans insisted on floor 
debate and votes on amendments that would have splintered support." Again, this 
is simply not the case.  
</P>
<P>
 Early in its tenure, the Clinton Administration established Superfund as one 
of its top environmental priorities, yet dragged its heels in drafting the 
actual language of the legislation. A Superfund reauthorization bill was not 
sent to the House until last February.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Administration's tardiness, the bill was considered and approved 
by the House committees on Energy and Commerce, Public Works and Transportation 
and Ways and Means on a bipartisan basis. I believe the legislation would have 
also been approved on the House floor, but it never came to members for a vote. 
The Democratic-controlled Rules Committee never allowed the bill to be 
considered.  
</P>
<P>
 Why would the Rules Committee, with its 9-to-4 Democratic majority, fail to 
report the Administration's Superfund bill? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer comes down to an inability by the Democratic Party to get its act 
together. Superfund died because of a conflict within the majority party. An 
amendment adopted by the Public Works Committee to extend the Davis-Bacon Act 
to private cleanup contracts at Superfund sites pleased organized labor, but 
many environmentalists opposed the measure as destroying all chances for 
reauthorization this year. The Democratic leadership spent six unproductive 
weeks at the end of the session trying to find ways to prevent their members 
from choosing between two of their strongest allies. In the end, the Democrats 
decided it was better to sacrifice Superfund reform rather than offend 
organized labor on the eve of the 1994 elections.

 If Stewart is so upset that the archrivals of the Rams are not being telecast

 Stocks sank Friday in thin holiday trading as investors hunkered down ahead of 
an expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.52 to 3,801.47, posting its second 
consecutive loss and a weekly decline of 6.05 points. The closely watched 
blue-chip gauge headed lower at the opening bell and deteriorated throughout 
the session, losing as much as 26 points before recovering some lost ground in 
mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got little direction from the bond market, which was closed in 
observance of Veterans Day. But bond futures slipped about one-half point 
before closing early, helping depress stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was thin, with New York Stock Exchange volume an anemic 218.61 million 
shares changing hands, down from 280.90 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But declining issues had a substantial 12-to-5 lead on advancers on the Big 
Board. That suggested to Dudley Eppel, a stock trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette Securities, that bearishness was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a little discouraged," Eppel said. "If these bond rates go higher, 
sooner or later people are going to have to sell stocks and buy bonds. There's 
not much resistance on the down side." 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes eroded as well. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.10 
points to 253.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.02 points to 
462.35. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues slid 2.26 points to 
762.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates for the 
sixth time this year at its Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond people are focused on whether the November tightening will be 0.50% 
or more," said Richard Hoey, Dreyfus Corp.'s chief economist. "I think the 
stock people aren't as focused on that. They assume it's going to be 50 basis 
points. The issue is, is there more after that, and how much more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican shares rebounded somewhat from the previous day's heavy losses as 
Telefonos de Mexico regained some ground. The Bolsa index finished 34.67 points 
higher at 2,526.99 after falling 126 points Thursday, dragged down by Telmex, 
which dropped in response to a $1-billion joint venture between AT&T Corp. and 
Mexican industrial group Alfa that would compete with Telmex in long-distance 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary receipts rebounded 2 1/4 to 53 1/2 
on the NYSE after tumbling 4 3/4 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron Corp. ended up 11 3/4 to 71 1/2 in heavy trading of more than 11 
million shares on rumors of a takeover price of $100 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other bio-tech stocks were lifted by Chiron's gain. Biogen rose 1 1/8 to 39 
7/8, while Amgen added 1 1/2 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * PepsiCo jumped 1 5/8 to 36 7/8, boosted by upgrades from both PaineWebber 
and Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft Corp. shed 1-7/16 to 62 1/4 after Goldman Sachs cut its fiscal 
1995 earnings per-share estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cisco Systems rose 2 3/8 to 33 after reporting strong quarterly earnings at 
the top end of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, the German DAX 30-share average ended at 2,078.35, down 
4.05 points, but up 10.79 from a week ago, while London's Financial Times 
100-share average ended down 27.6 points at 3,075.9, off 22.3 from last Friday. 
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended up 19.51 points at 19,284.36, a 
fall of 527.2 from a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, ended mixed in muted dealings as currency traders also 
waited to see what the Fed would do next week. The dollar ended the week in New 
York at 1.530 German marks, up from 1.529 marks late Thursday and at 97.68 
Japanese yen, down from 97.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commodities markets, sugar futures rose sharply amid higher demand 
overseas and a world production estimate from the U.S. government that fueled 
concerns about a shortage. Sugar for March delivery rose 0.38 cent to 13.64 
cents a pound on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, a record high for 
the contract.

FILM ON GAY TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Totally F***ed Up" has to be one of the finest films to be released into 
theaters this year ("Charting Trouble Life of Gay Teens," Nov. 2). Although it 
is about gay teens, it really goes beyond its immediate subject matter to 
become a statement on society as a whole.Some might find this move by Greg 
Araki angry, but one could easily view it as a matter-of-fact statement on life 
for teen-agers in our society who happen to be gay.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it is somber, being about the unusually high rate of suicide among 
gay teens, it is a story that should be told. The rate of suicide is alarmingly 
high, and alienation is a real problem. The director-writer should be given 
much credit for not glossing over the subject matter with a happy Hollywood 
ending.

HOW TO DEFINE ONE'S FATE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a young African American writer, I journeyed to Los Angeles two years ago, 
determined to make my mark in the entertainment industry. Since then I have 
struggled as most others in this business have, always balancing the pitfalls 
against my belief that my talent would be the defining prerequisite of any 
success that I might garner. As I read David Milch's comments (" 'NYPD Blue' 
Figure Tries to Clarify Race Remarks," Nov. 10), the cold dose of reality 
doused my face. I was wrong. My blackness will be the defining prerequisite of 
my fate. And we all know what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 It astounds me that Milch, the co-creator of "NYPD Blue" and a three-time 
winner of the Humanitas Award, has so little knowledge of the effect of words: 
"I'm racist." "None of the black writing was any good." "A black has to 
experience more anger and self-division in order . . . to write about the 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 These are your words, Mr. Milch. It is arrogant to pronounce what life 
experiences another writer must accumulate before his work is considered good. 
It is especially arrogant for you to do so about a race and culture that is not 
your own. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me this, Mr. Milch, how does an African American writer come to work for 
you? You explain that you do not believe in affirmative action for writers. If 
a Jewish writer and a black writer came to you for the same job, you would 
choose the Jewish writer. Why? Simply because "Jews tend to do very well in 
this business." Your words, Mr. Milch. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not asking for a handout, but, by the same token, my race has nothing to 
do with the quality of my work. That is not called political correctness. It is 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
 What I find most ironic is that after all of his "honesty," Milch seems to be 
backtracking in the statement he gave The Times. He has even agreed to look at 
the work of other black writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Milch, if this is, as The Times suggests, an attempt to avert a possible 
protest: Don't bother. You've already admitted the truth and I've already 
decided to stop watching your show.

JAZZ WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the white males over age 50 who thoroughly enjoyed the four-day Jazz 
West Coast program, I want to commend Don Heckman for his comments about the 
inadequate participation by minority musicians, especially African Americans 
("Jazz West Coast Could Use a Little Color," Nov. 3). The overwhelming 
whiteness of the program was so apparent it would have been a real oversight 
had Heckman not made note of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the audience, I was reminded of two adults taking my jazz history 
class who stunned me when they said they had never before realized how 
significant African Americans have been in the development of this music. For 
all the fine accomplishments at this jazz convocation, an important opportunity 
was missed that I found ironic, considering the major contributions African 
Americans have made to jazz in general and on the West Coast in particular.

 Heckman misses the whole point. Audiences over 50 and mainly white went to 
reminisce about those days of "cool" West Coast big-band music. We went because 
we wanted to hear it exactly "like it was." We went because we are Stan Kenton 
fans. We went to hear and see the original band members playing the original 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended the Eric Clapton concert at the Forum recently. The audience was 
mainly white and over 30. I didn't hear anyone ask why there weren't any 
Latinos, blacks or Asians in the band.

 Regarding "Jurassic Park" and Alan H. Goldstein's assertion that its message 
is anti-science and anti-technology ("The Anti-Science Message in the Media," 
Saturday Letters, Nov. 5): 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect, Mr. Goldstein, I think you should realize, first of all, 
that those of us who are not research scientists are ignorant of the fact that 
the same technology that brought the dinosaurs to life in the film could also 
have been used to cure cancer, grow new limbs or develop disease-resistant 
crops. Concerns such as yours do not, for better or worse, trouble our feeble 
minds when we crack open a book or sit down with our popcorn in a darkened 
theater to enjoy what is quite simply a darn good story. 
</P>
<P>
 I also must wonder why it is Steven Spielberg and his colleagues that you take 
to task, when they actually are only the messengers who bring to life on screen 
the story created by someone else, in this case, Michael Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers of fiction have effectively achieved their craft by asking the 
mind-stretching question, "What if?" Crichton has done this brilliantly in his 
numerous novels, with results that thrill and chill millions who are willing to 
suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if this offends you, why not demonstrate the proper depiction of 
science in your own story? Hire a writer to pen a bestseller about the new 
technology for disease-free wheat. I'm sure it will give Crichton a run for his 
money. 
</P>

<P>
 It is a shame that Goldstein viewed a movie about science and showmanship and 
greed and nature and man's place in the world and decided that it was nothing 
more than anti-science. 
</P>
<P>
 For a film to be "violently anti-science," its unmistakable message should be 
that science is bad -- or, at least, that scientists are bad. Yet the 
protagonists of the story include two good-hearted paleontologists who 
recognize the dangers of what has been wrought on that remote island yet still 
are filled with wonder at the creatures around them whose lives science has 
made possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jeff Goldblum's character, a chaotician, is wise enough to warn of the 
presumption that one can control nature. The problem begins when scientists or 
anybody with power ignores such humbling lessons and commences playing God. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" could just as easily -- and with more justification -- be 
derided as anti-lawyer, since the lawyer, although a minor character, is 
without redeeming qualities. Or how about an "anti-fat-guy" message, given that 
the most loathsome figure in the movie -- who plots to smuggle the dangerous 
DNA off the island for money and deactivates the computer and security -- is 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood does not as a community treat scientists with "fear and loathing," 
at least on screen. It may operate from the most superficial understandings, 
and it certainly "exploit(s) . . . technology for a cheap thrill," but, hey, 
let's face it, that's what Hollywood's all about.

LANDSCAPING; THE TABOO ON BAMBOO LIFTS EASILY; THE GIANT GRASSES ARE VALUED FOR 
THEIR COLORED FOLIAGE, VERSATILITY -- AND FAST GROWTH, AS LONG AS IT IS 
CONTROLLED.

 Bamboo has a reputation -- undeserved, its fans say -- for running wild. Don't 
plant it in the home landscape, the admonition goes, because it will grow and 
spread and swallow not only your garden but also those of your neighbors. The 
myth is embellished with the warning that the marauding plant will also tear up 
sidewalks, driveways, even house foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hog twaddle," said Hermine Stover, an ardent bamboo supporter and co-owner 
with her husband of Endangered Species Nursery in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only running bamboo spreads vigorously, and there are ways of controlling 
it," she said. "But there are bamboos for every landscape use, and many species 
can be grown in home landscapes and mixed with other plants, like roses." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of misinformation about bamboo," said Ken Brennecke, president 
of the Southern California Chapter of the American Bamboo Society and owner of 
Tsing Ya Bamboo Gardens in Encinitas. "More than 350 different bamboo species 
will grow in the U.S., and the average home landscape in Southern California 
can easily contain three or four." 
</P>
<P>
 Bamboos are giant grasses with woody stems that spread by underground 
rhizomes. The way in which they grow defines bamboo as either running or clump. 
Running bamboo vigorously sends out underground stems that grow rapidly from 
the parent plant before producing vertical stems. Clump bamboo produces stems 
that grow underground only short distances from the parent plant. They form 
clumps that slowly expand around their edges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the dense system of roots and rhizomes, bamboo is used in most of 
the world to control soil erosion or flooding. Commercial uses include 
medicine, food, building and artistic materials. Bamboo is native to all parts 
of the world except Antarctica and Lapland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States until fairly recently, only scientists, collectors and 
artists and artisans were interested in growing bamboo. According to Brennecke, 
that's rapidly changing as homeowners learn its merits and growers improve 
their methods of propagating or growing it from seed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bamboo is going to replace trees in many landscapes," he said. "You can plant 
bamboo like giant timber (Bambusa oldhamii) and see the results in just five to 
seven years when the culms (canes) reach 30 or 40 feet. But you can't witness 
the maturity of most trees in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Stover agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bamboo goes from container size to a full landscape specimen faster than any 
other plant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamboo fanciers grow the plant for both artistic and practical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can achieve a loud and complete color palette in a landscape with only 
bamboo because these plants have a wide range of colored foliage," Stover said. 
"Many species also have fascinating striations or variegations on the culms." 
</P>
<P>
 Bamboos are being used as ground covers, moderate-sized hedges and gigantic 
screens soaring upward of 60 feet. But some species also adapt to treatment as 
bonsai or can be grown successfully in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key to growing bamboo successfully is selecting plants with strongly 
developed rhizomes for cane production and plant longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 Stover said that some bamboo offered for sale is nothing more than "culm 
cuttings," canes that have been propagated from mother plants but haven't had 
the time to develop extensive root systems, and the plants usually die. Another 
reason for failure is that if bamboo has been greenhouse grown or shipped from 
tropical climates, the plants haven't made the adjustment to the semiarid 
climate here. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to looking for plants acclimated to this environment, choose ones 
that are pot-bound. This is one of the few exceptions to the recommendation to 
avoid buying pot-bound plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bamboo does best if it is pot-bound," Brennecke said. "They've got to have a 
lot of rhizomes to produce canes." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennecke and Stover offer these tips for success with bamboo: 
</P>
<P>
 * Know your landscape and what height you need. Don't select running varieties 
unless you have a very large property or you're willing to place the physical 
barriers needed to contain them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be patient. Even the giant varieties need at least three or four years to 
reach close to mature size. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to prune or shape annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water regularly but not excessively. Most varieties are fairly drought 
tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fertilize sparingly -- half the recommended amount -- after you first plant 
them. The following year, feed monthly with a lawn fertilizer or acid-based 
fertilizer. Allow the plant to rest from November through March. A BAMBOO 
PRIMER Types 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some recommended bamboo varieties for home gardens in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
 Arundinaria akebono. Running variety that grows only to 18 feet. Can be used 
as ground cover or grown in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa chusquea coronalis. This evergreen variety produces stems that are 
claret-colored when young. Can be grown in tub or ground. Soars up to 20 feet, 
then arches.  
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa multiplex 'Alphonse Karr' -- Easily controlled by yearly pruning, this 
variety is recommended for hedging. Can attain 12 feet in three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa oldhamii. A very vertical clumping grower used for screening. Produces 
25-feet-high canes in two or three years, with ultimate height of 40 to 50 
feet. Leaves and branches produced from ground level to top of canes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa otatea acuminatea (Mexican weeping bamboo). Clumping, grows to 18 to 
25 feet in three years with canes spaced a foot apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa textilis (Weaver's bamboo). Clumping, grows to 30 feet. Bottom 
one-third of plant is clear of buds or branchlets, and the canes eventually 
turn yellow. Prized by artisans for use in handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bambusa ventricosa. Nicknamed "Buddha's Belly" because of large, bulging 
internodes. One of the fastest and most vigorous of all clumping bamboo, it 
grows to 20 feet. Phyllostachys aurea (Golden bamboo). This running variety is 
the most widely grown bamboo in the United States. Reaches 25 feet in height. 
Edible shoots and canes used for handicrafts and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllostachys dulcis (Sweetshot bamboo). Edible bamboo from central China. 
Running variety; reaches height of 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pseudosasa japonica (Arrow bamboo). This running variety spreads slowly, so it 
can be grown in the ground without barriers and controlled by pruning. It 
attains a mature height of 18 feet. It can be successfully grown in a 
container. Named for its use as arrow shafts in its native Japan and Korea.

BEST ALARMS ARE GREAT COMMUNICATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are only a few basic kinds of home security alarm systems. 
</P>
<P>
 All other things being equal -- such as the sophistication of internal 
sensors, the activation of local alarms and how they communicate within a house 
-- what separates them is whether and how they communicate distress to the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's most high-tech systems, called digital communicators, use the phone to 
alert a central monitoring station about a breach in security. This agency then 
notifies the appropriate emergency service. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial communication between the home system and the agency is automatic and 
voiceless. 
</P>
<P>
 These digital communicators send a burst of coded information to the central 
station, which then uses the open line to make voice contact with the home or 
otherwise assess the situation. This includes monitoring the sensors within the 
home -- live and on-line. Meanwhile, the central agency is in voice contact 
with local authorities, who will dispatch assistance as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical elements here are the system's ability to communicate beyond the 
home, automatically, and the monitoring agency's person-to-person contact with 
the emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 Systems that only activate internal or external sound and light alarms depend 
on being heard -- and heeded -- then on someone alerting the police or fire 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Screaming sirens and flashing strobes within a house might succeed in 
dissuading an intruder. Externally audible and visible signals might cause a 
neighbor to raise an eyebrow and the telephone.  
</P>
<P>
 But with systems that don't call for outside help, there's no guarantee that 
the cavalry will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Some non-digital home security devices do have the ability to make calls 
automatically to designated numbers that are stored in memory. Unlike digital 
communicators, these simply play a voice message that you've previously 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you might hire a 24-hour monitoring agency to be on the receiving 
end, usually these voice-message devices are marketed as a less-expensive 
alternative to monitoring services. 
</P>
<P>
 You can program the auto-dialer to make direct calls to a neighbor or perhaps 
another phone where you can be reached. The other party can listen in on the 
open line after hearing your message, but there's no digital reporting of 
system status or remote electronic monitoring of the situation.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have this type of system, do not program it to directly call police or 
fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 During an earthquake or other major disaster, this type of alarm will 
completely block incoming phone lines at police and fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not home when the alarm sounds off, there's no way to confirm or 
cancel the call. These systems usually cost $100 to $200, depending on packaged 
sensors and accessories. The most widely available of these is the Voice Dialer 
Console in the PowerHouse line from home automation giant X-10 USA. The same 
item comes in several brands, including Radio Shack's Plug'n Power line. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say any alarm system should include a fail-safe battery 
backup, fire-sensing capability (ionization sensors are best), readout ability 
to check the working of the system and a horn-sounding device. 
</P>
<P>
 Before installing any alarm system, consult your local law enforcement agency. 
Get several estimates before deciding which alarm company and system is best 
for your needs.  
</P>
<P>
 A system that phones out probably is better than a siren that falls on deaf 
ears, but one that isn't centrally monitored might create a sense of false 
security -- and false alarms.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; BLEACH KILLS MILDEW SPORES DEEP IN PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Although our bathroom is well-ventilated with a fan and a window, the walls 
get black mildew marks. We painted with a washable enamel after scrubbing the 
walls down, but the mildew returned. What can we do to keep the mildew from 
thriving? 
</P>
<P>
 T.B. Huntington Beach * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Before repainting, wash the walls with a mix of bleach and water, says 
Charlie Kaczorowski of Tustin Paint Mart. Make sure the bathroom window is open 
and the fan running while you work. Mildew is often rooted deep in the paint 
surface, so, while it may appear that you've wiped it out with soap and water, 
it can always return. Using chlorine bleach should kill the underlying mildew 
spores. When you repaint, use an oil-based enamel, which is more mildew 
resistant than a water-based paint. Also, have your paint store mix in a 
mildew-cide with your color to give you more protection. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We're planning a bathroom remodel. We like the look of high-quality brass 
fixtures; however, friends who have them tell us that the brass on expensive 
fixtures deteriorates just as quickly as it does on cheaper fixtures. Is that 
true? What should one look for in brass faucets and handles? 
</P>
<P>
 S.V., Brea * 
</P>
<P>
 A. There are three basic categories of brass fixtures, says Rich Haagsma of 
Faucets n' Fixtures in Orange. Some are made of plastic or a "pot metal" and 
are brass-plated. Others are made with a piece of sheet brass, out of which the 
piece is stamped. More expensive brass fixtures are cast from molten brass 
before being polished and machined. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the plated fixture tarnishes, there's no way to fix it, and it must be 
thrown away. The stamped fixture tends to last longer, but it can't be 
polished, and it will also be ruined by tarnishing. The advantage of the cast 
brass is that it can be repolished. All brass faucets have some sort of coating 
to protect them from tarnishing, but many people use abrasives or harsh 
chemicals to clean the brass. That removes the coating. Keep fixtures as dry as 
possible and clean with soap and water. After they dry, apply a car wax to help 
protect the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have carpet in one of our bathrooms, and a crack in the toilet's water 
line caused a great deal of leakage around the toilet. The carpet is soaked. 
I've tried sponging up the water with towels, but it's still wet and is 
starting to smell. What's the best way to clean this mess? 
</P>
<P>
 P.I., Buena Park * 
</P>
<P>
 A. If the problem is just soaking around the toilet, you may just need to give 
the area a good chance to dry out, says carpet cleaner Dave Rink of Santa Ana. 
There's usually a seam behind the toilet that's easily pulled up. Pull the 
carpet back and use towels to soak up water on the pad. If the bathroom has a 
window, keep it open; if there's a ventilation fan, keep it running to maintain 
good air circulation and prevent mildew. Once you get to the point where it's 
just damp, use a hair dryer on a warm setting to help evaporate remaining 
water. After the carpet is completely dry, rent a kicker from a rental yard and 
get the carpet back in place on the tack strips. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We had a rustic brick paver floor put in our family room and kitchen 
recently. Although three coats of sealant were applied, I'm noticing oily 
spotting on the grout and bricks. I've tried plain soap and water but haven't 
been able to remove them. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 M.D., Newport Beach * 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's possible that the sealer wasn't correctly applied, or whoever 
installed it may have used the wrong kind of sealer, says Ken Newland of Tustin 
Block. Try using a brush and a solution of TSP and water to the spots. That 
should remove the sealer in those areas and the spots. Once it's clean and dry 
again, reseal the areas with a sealer designed for use on masonry floors.

<P>
 Pure Living, a new home furnishings and accessories store in Laguna Beach, is 
a family endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-square-foot store, which features funky yet luxurious items, is 
co-owned by Michelle Larson of Lake Forest and her mother, interior designer 
Connie Apple, who lives in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides working with my mom, which I've always wanted to do, my dad designs 
furniture for us," Larson said. "My aunt is the buyer for our antiques and the 
rustic, primitive pieces, and my sister works on Saturdays, so she can buy some 
of the furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items in the store are chemical-free 100% cotton towels, sheets and 
bedding, paper and gift wrap made from recycled stock and one-of-a-kind 
furniture and fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson and Apple chose the store's name to reflect the natural cottons, steels 
and woods from which most of their items are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Pure Living is in the Village Faire Shops at 1100 S. Coast Highway, Suite 221. 
For information, call (714) 376-8867. BLOCK PRINTS 
</P>
<P>
 A block printing system offered by Liza Glenn of Laguna Beach and Jane Gauss 
of Hudson, Ohio, is a simple way to create individualized stencil designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorator Blocks are made of die-cast neoprene and come in more than 50 
designs -- such as leaves, flowers, fruits and stars. The blocks are used with 
water-based glazes that are thick in consistency and come in an array of 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The glazes work on walls, furniture, floors and fabrics," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 To use the block printing system, the glaze is brushed onto a block, then the 
block is pressed and held on to the surface. Varying the pressure on the block 
creates different intensities of design and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make a mistake, and anyone can create a stenciled effect within 
minutes," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blocks (about $4.50 to $5.50 each) and the glazes (about $4) are sold 
individually or in kits (about $25) that include four blocks, five glazes and 
two brushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorator Blocks are available in Orange County at the Cook's Garden in Laguna 
Beach, Somewhere in Time in Orange and We-R-Fabrics in Mission Viejo. RETRO 
CANISTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic kitchen canisters from Dallas-based Fitz and Floyd's hark back to the 
days of black-and-white linoleum, a kettle on the stove, a modest ice box and 
dishes soaking in the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces are hand-painted in pastels and can add a little humor or whimsy to 
any style -- be it traditional, gourmet or high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Omnibus Collection are other serving and condiment pieces 
fashioned as old-style appliances such as electric mixers, blenders, toasters 
and percolators, and diner-style cups, plates and saucers. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-piece ceramic canister set (about $85), is available in at Pottery 
Shack in Laguna Beach, Cristal Palais in Irvine, at department stores and from 
the Bloomingdale's by Mail catalogue, (800) 777-0000.

HOUSEKEEPING; GETTING ORGANIZED STARTS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS -- CLOSET DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is your closet a disaster area pleading with you to put it in order? Here are 
some tips from professional organizer Stephanie Schur on reclaiming a closet: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, sort through everything in your closet, and remove everything you 
never wear, as well as clothes that are too small, worn out or outdated (you'll 
be surprised how much room you'll gain). As you sort, earmark giveaways or 
charitable donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the remaining items, make three piles: one for clothes that need mending 
or altering, one for out-of-season pieces (store them in a labeled box 
underneath your bed) and one for current wearables (return them to the closet). 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrange current clothing by category (skirts, blouses, dresses, pants), then 
by length, then by color. (Underneath the short grouping, store your sewing 
basket, extra hangers in a bin or a laundry hamper.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase sturdy hangers (wood or plastic) that will last as well as hold the 
shape of your clothing. Face all hangers in the same direction.  
</P>
<P>
 * Hang books, shoe racks, peg boards or an organizer on the inside of the 
closet door. Install a high shelf for things that you use infrequently or for 
out-of-season items. If your closet is deep, add a second pole -- behind the 
original -- for clothing worn less often. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adequate lighting is a must -- so you can clearly see what you have. 
Painting the interior of the closet a white semi-gloss also brightens the 
space.  
</P>
<P>
 * Use covered plastic bins for long-term -- and airtight -- storage of photos, 
household deeds and personal memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the linen closet: Group towels by size, then by color; store sheets in 
sets according to bedroom. Put frequently used items on lower shelves. 
Designate one shelf as a whatnot area. * Label every box, bin and container.  
</P>
<P>
 * Once you institute these systems, make a point of putting things away as you 
go. Keep a basket by the staircase for accumulating daily clutter; at the end 
of the day, distribute the contents to the appropriate closets.

REPAIRS; FOR A SMOOTH OPERATION, KEEPS THINGS TOP-DRAWER 
</P>

 When a drawer sticks, the bottom might be warped. Remove the bottom, flip it 
over and reinstall. The bottom usually slides out for repairs, but on some 
drawers you have to disassemble and rebuild the drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 Humidity may swell the wood, causing parts to rub. Sand or use a plane to 
lightly shave some wood from the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
 On a drawer with wooden runners, look for shiny spots on the sliding parts and 
signs of uneven wear -- especially on the bottom of runners -- and for 
looseness, breakage or missing screws or nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Rub a sticking runner with candle wax or soap, or spray it with silicone 
lubricant. If it still sticks, lightly plane the runner's bottom. Then re-wax 
the runner. 
</P>
<P>
 If a runner is damaged, remove it. Then plane or sand the area flush with the 
drawer bottom. Cut a new runner of straight-grain hardwood. Glue it to the 
drawer with carpenter's glue. Clamp it along its entire length until the glue 
is dry. Then drill pilot holes for nails and secure it with finishing nails.  
</P>
<P>
 If the sliding mechanism is plastic or metal, check the alignment and look for 
signs of looseness, breakage or missing fasteners. Inspect rollers. If they 
don't operate smoothly, clean with ammonia. If they're damaged, replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 To repair a loose drawer glide, use a square to check that it's perpendicular 
to the front. Tighten or replace screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a drawer sticks because its joints are loose or no longer square. 
</P>
<P>
 To check for squareness, measure each side diagonally from inside corner to 
inside corner. They should be equal. If the drawer is out of square, 
disassemble it carefully. When separating the elements of the drawer, be 
careful not to chip or break the wood.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the drawer is disassembled, remove all old nails and scrape off the old 
glue. Then re-glue the drawer pieces and hold them together with bar clamps. 
Check the joints with a rule.  
</P>
<P>
 Flush-front drawers sometimes get pushed too far into the cabinet. To prevent 
this, glue and tack small wood blocks to the rear of the drawer runners to 
serve as stops. 
</P>
<P>
 To fix a split drawer bottom, glue a canvas strip across the underside of the 
split to reinforce the bottom.

MAINTENANCE; KEEP COOL TO PREVENT AN ATTACK OF DRY ROT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dry rot, or decay, can affect your home, your boat or even your camper. A 
fungus attacks wood and causes decay when conditions -- mainly moisture and 
warm temperatures -- are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair or replace rotted wood quickly so the fungus will not spread. What 
Rotted Wood Looks Like 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the fungus is visible. It grows out of the wood surface, appearing 
as mottled white or brown patches, strands or vine-like structures. The wood 
may be white and spongy or brown and crumbly. Wood with interior rot may sound 
hollow, feel spongy and yield easily to the probe of an ice pick. Where to Look 
for Rotted Wood 
</P>
<P>
 Look for rotted wood in wet basements, near plumbing and in wood that touches 
the soil or is exposed to weather or water. The fungus usually enters the end 
grain -- the base of a foundation post, the joint of a beam or a seam where a 
window frame butts against the sill. Pay particular attention to the windward 
side of your house or anyplace else where wind can force rainwater deep into a 
joint or crack. Flaking or discolored paint are symptoms. Prevention 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent rot, or at least slow its progress, keep affected or potential 
decay sites dry, cool and adequately ventilated. This is not always possible 
without elaborate drainage and ventilation arrangements that are best built 
into a structure when it is first constructed. But there are often simple 
measures to control moisture and increase airflow in crawl spaces and basements 
by adding vents and keeping water from puddling around the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Structures are usually difficult to replace; call in a professional. You may 
be able to fix parts such as windowsills, door frames, porch rails and siding 
by cutting away the affected area (plus six inches on either side) and splicing 
in fresh wood. But it is generally better to replace the whole piece. Repair 
</P>
<P>
 If the dry rot has infected a small area that does not bear weight -- windows 
and doorsills, floors and walls adjacent to sweating plumbing fixtures or very 
small spots and beams -- scrape down to good wood, apply a wood preservative 
and refinish. 
</P>
<P>
 You can often repair for deeper damage with an epoxy resin, available in most 
boating supply or hardware stores. The compound is sold in two containers that 
must be mixed. Drill several quarter-inch holes deep into (but not through) the 
affected wood. Then mix the two parts of resin in a plastic squeeze bottle and 
inject it slowly into the holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over several days, the resin will seep into the pores of the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete the job by coating the surface with an epoxy filler. Smooth and sand 
when thoroughly dry, then refinish as required.

COLLECTIBLES; DISHING UP HISTORY ON ALPHABET POTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before "Sesame Street" beamed a big yellow, alphabet-singing bird into 
homes across the country, children got their first taste of the ABCs from 
ceramic plates bordered in a raised alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters danced around the plate's rim, distracting rambunctious youngsters 
from the occasionally tedious task at hand -- eating dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The first alphabet plates were made in potters' paradise -- Staffordshire, 
England, around 1830 -- and quickly won the hearts of parents on both sides of 
the Atlantic, perhaps because they sold for pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 A transmogrified form even found its way into the 20th Century: Alphabet 
macaroni began floating around America's soup bowls in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than embossed letters account for the popularity of ABC plates. 
Illustrated riddles, Ben Franklin maxims ("Little strokes fell great trees") 
and famous places and faces surfaced as the food vanished. A friendly dose of 
Victorian morality entertained scores of pre-TV children, who were seen but 
seldom heard. 
</P>
<P>
 With hands powdered white from kneading dough, hard-working Victorian mothers 
served levity along with the plumb cake: Why would this pastry cook make a good 
soldier? Flip the plate over to find the answer: Because they seem to stand the 
fire so well. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful illustrations serve as historical documents revealing what rural 
life was like in 19th-Century England. We see children in play clothes flying 
kites and walking on stilts; London dog sellers and blacksmiths; Queen Victoria 
out for a stroll and men on horseback hunting foxes.  
</P>
<P>
 To attract the lucrative American market, Civil War scenes and portraits of 
presidents Washington, Lincoln and Garfield were among the illustrations copied 
from books, then slightly altered (to escape copyright infringement laws), and 
prepared for transfer printing, a decorative method invented in the 18th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Engraved with the "borrowed" image, copper plates were inked with paint, 
transferred to paper and pressed onto the ceramic surface, leaving a monochrome 
outline that a child would hand-color. 
</P>
<P>
 The naive brush strokes are a far cry from the clean, tidy lines of 
Renaissance painting, but the playful illustrations benefit from paint leaping 
over the outline. 
</P>
<P>
 To the eye of a youngster, a swish of green denotes trees, a blob of blue 
shows sky.  
</P>
<P>
 "Potteries were dashing plates off fast," explains Korby Britton of Six-Sept, 
a Manhattan antiques shop specializing in children's porcelain. "It doesn't 
matter if the paint splashes over the outline. They weren't meant to be fine 
porcelain." 
</P>
<P>
 Industrious English potters produced wagonloads of ABC plates but viewed 
children's earthenware as clumsy, unworthy of makers' marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of trademarks also helped makers fly below copyright radar. Some 
plate backs, however, carry a pottery's secret seal of approval: coded letters, 
initials or numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you find an anchor impress," says Britton, "which tells us that the 
plate is from the mid-1870s." 
</P>
<P>
 Believed to be part of a 1904 campaign on behalf of the deaf, rare 
sign-language plates show hands forming the manual alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 On the underside, look for the mark "Rd. No. 426673," which indicates the 
English manufacturer H. Aynsley & Co., whose plates are among the most coveted 
by savvy collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pottery marks began to appear on later plates when mechanical methods enhanced 
illustrations but decreased charm. Instead of names, inspect plates for cracks 
and scratches, which can help negotiate prices downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Plates with temperance themes and other adult concerns may have survived 
intact because they did not inspire children to action as did rough-and-tumble 
nursery rhymes such as Jack and Jill or Humpty Dumpty.  
</P>
<P>
 ABC plates without chips and scratches can fetch $150 to $500, while an even 
rarer species, ABC cups, can gulp down $800. Because plates were less likely to 
be broken than cups, more of them survived the century.  
</P>
<P>
 "Children don't easily throw plates," says Britton, "but they drink milk out 
of cups and boom -- they crash to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, a debate rages in the pottery field over whether the plates were 
intended for use. 
</P>
<P>
 British author Noel Riley suggests ABCs were mostly ornamental: "One mug 
survives for every 10 plates, which shows the mugs were used but not the 
plates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Britton disagrees. "Let's face it, ABC plates were cheap. People bought 
them at circuses and used them. It was not fine china."

DECOR; PREVENTING MIX-UPS IN PATTERN MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 New fabric is one of the best ways to give a room new life, but money will be 
ill spent if you simply reintroduce a similar pattern and color. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you find the right look? 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Lee, director of the Sheffield School of Interior Design in New York, 
offered some shopping tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at each fabric and ask: Will it go well with the other fabrics 
selected? How will it be distributed around the room? Will it stand up to its 
projected use? 
</P>
<P>
 * Rely on an experienced retailer if you aren't sure about the wearability. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit your search to fabrics in your price range. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give yourself enough time to do the job right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time-consuming to look at fabrics and select patterns that work well 
together, but it becomes easier with practice," Lee said. "I am a big believer 
in comparison shopping. I normally will go through the swatches from three to 
six sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there comes a time when you have to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've gone through more than six manufacturers' offerings, you may be 
trying to choose among similar fabrics," she said. "Or perhaps you just aren't 
ready to make a choice yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Burak, vice president of design at Schumacher fabrics in New York, said 
it's best to know what type of room you like. Anyone can be seduced by a 
terrific print, but it's not for the person who prefers a quiet room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft rooms have longer staying power; those where tone-on-tone and textural 
contrasts are dominant are easier to put together. But sometimes only a splashy 
print will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a little too much of a lively print, and you may be sorry. But take heart. 
You might just need to balance it with something equally strong elsewhere in 
the room. If you choose a floral for chairs or a sofa in one area, you need a 
strong pattern to balance it in another part of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no simple rule on how many prints are too many. In fact, you can use 
a different pattern on each upholstered piece and at the windows. But that's 
the advanced course. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, Burak said, if the major fabric is a floral, look for a plaid or a 
stripe in the same color family as a complement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easier to visualize fabrics with samples of up to two feet square 
instead of swatches. In the trade, the former are known as memo samples 
because, when a decorator borrows one, he or she usually receives a memo 
stating that there will be a charge unless it is returned within a specified 
time. If you don't have a decorator, your retailer often can borrow them once 
you've narrowed the choices down to a few. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're unsure of your ability to mix and match patterns, head for the 
coordinated fabric sample books. A number of fabric companies issue collections 
several times a year in which the same basic color values are used in a fairly 
wide range of fabrics that encompass solids, florals, geometrics, plaids, 
stripes, textures and wovens. Leaf through the fabric swatches and look at 
sample book photos of room settings to see how professionals mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fabrics in our collections are designed to go together, and if you find a 
print you like, there also will be stripes, plaids and solids," Burak said. "We 
look at the collections from the point of view of the decorator who needs to 
put together a complete room." 
</P>

 "Decorating With Fabrics," a 20-page booklet with tips on working with 
patterned fabric, is available for $3 from the Sheffield School of Interior 
Design, 211 E. 43rd St., New York, N.Y. 10017.

FLOORING; MIX WOOD, CONCRETE WITH RIGHT METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doomsayers will tell you that you can't install wood flooring over a concrete 
floor or basement slab. Despite the popular notion that wood and concrete don't 
mix, any kind of wood flooring -- parquet, laminated, and even solid strip or 
plank -- can be installed over concrete successfully by following the right 
techniques. Preparation 
</P>
<P>
 Dryness of the concrete is the key. Before ordering wood flooring, test for 
moisture by taping several pieces of polyethylene film (available from building 
suppliers), each about 18 inches square, to the concrete floor in various 
locations. Seal the edges of each piece with duct tape. Check the pieces after 
48 hours. If there is no moisture clinging to their undersides, the floor is 
sufficiently dry. Laminated Flooring 
</P>
<P>
 Laminated flooring -- thin layers of wood bonded together and shaped into 
tongue-and-groove panels -- can be glued with mastic adhesive (available in 
flooring and hardware stores) directly to a dry concrete floor above ground 
level.  
</P>
<P>
 Start by cleaning the slab and covering uneven areas with cement-base 
self-leveling compound, a liquid that hardens to fill minor dips and hollows. 
After pouring the compound, smooth it with a long, straight board. When the 
compound hardens, spread mastic adhesive with a notched trowel and embed the 
flooring according to the manufacturer's instructions. Below Ground Level 
</P>
<P>
 If a concrete slab is below ground level, install plastic film as a vapor 
retarder after cleaning and leveling the floor. Its purpose is to reduce any 
moisture reaching the flooring. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a notched trowel to apply waterproof mastic adhesive. Start at a far 
corner and work toward the doorway. When the mastic dries, unroll sheets of 
polyethylene film over it, beginning at a doorway and working toward the 
corners of the area being covered. Overlap sheets by at least 4 inches and seal 
the seams with contractor's sheathing tape. Press down firmly to embed the 
film; puncture any bubbles with a pin to release trapped air. Afterward, 
laminated flooring can be installed with mastic adhesive as described above. 
Solid Wood Flooring 
</P>
<P>
 For a solid wood flooring -- parquet and strips or planks -- and to provide a 
flat, smooth base above a damaged floor, install widely spaced 2-by-4s called 
sleepers, which serve as joists, followed by plywood underlayment panels, which 
serve as new subfloor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut sleepers 18 to 48 inches long from flat, straight 2-by-4s and place them 
on their wide sides at 12-inch intervals, perpendicular to the direction you 
plan to use for the finished flooring. Overlap the ends of the sleepers by at 
least 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Above ground level, fasten the sleepers to the floor with masonry nails. Below 
ground level, apply a polyethylene vapor retarder with mastic adhesive and 
embed sleepers in it with the same adhesive. In areas where humidity is high, 
cover below-ground sleepers with an additional layer of polyethylene. Slabs of 
rigid foam can be placed between sleepers to provide insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 For underlayment, use a single layer of three-fourths-inch-thick plywood or 
two one-half-inch layers. Fasten the material to the sleepers with ring-shank 
nails spaced 6 to 10 inches apart; leave a gap of about one-eighth inch between 
sheets -- one-half inch near walls -- and stagger arrangement to minimize long 
seams. Strip and plank flooring up to four inches wide can be nailed directly 
to the sleepers without an underlayment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attach parquet flooring to underlayment with mastic adhesive. Use nails to 
fasten strips or planks.

IN HONOR OF SERVICE PAST; THOUSANDS PAY HOMAGE TO U.S. VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Mounsey stared at the memorial plaque at her feet and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my son's name there, but I still don't understand why," she said. "If 
he were here right now he'd say, 'Why all this for me?' And then he'd laugh. He 
always laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Park was touched with fond laughter and sad tears Friday as more 
than 100 people -- including Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), 
representatives of the United States military and French veterans -- honored 
Erik Scott Mounsey, pilot of a Black Hawk helicopter shot down April 14 over 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering in Culver City was one of scores in Southern California as 
thousands of Americans turned out nationwide to honor those who served -- and 
gave their lives -- in military service. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounsey was one of those who did both. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of 26 people -- 11 of them foreign officers -- who died when an 
American F-15 fighter pilot shot down two U.S. Army helicopters in the mistaken 
belief that the aircraft were Russian-built Hind helicopters flown by the Iraqi 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a missing-man formation and 21-gun salute in Culver City seemed a 
fitting tribute to Mounsey and his comrades, that outpouring from the American 
military Establishment -- highly unusual for such a small, local event -- 
tinged the day with irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite charging the fighter pilot with negligent homicide, military officials 
in Washington have brushed aside the pleas of Mounsey's widow to increase her 
spousal death benefits and award Purple Hearts to the soldiers who died in the 
Black Hawk crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of those honored Friday, the tributes were given without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those remembered in other ceremonies were the Buffalo Soldiers of the 
Wild West and the Tuskegee Airmen of World War II -- two of this nation's most 
distinguished black fighting units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and Civil Assn. paid homage to both groups 
with a color-guard military ceremony, complete with a horse cavalry 
demonstration and a missing-man formation flyover. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19th-Century cavalry soldiers are long gone by now, but many of the 
fighter pilots survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Former fighter-escort pilot Carl Fountain, 72, remembers the racial 
segregation that kept him and his fellows from serving in regular units:  
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, people did not think a black man had the ability to power an 
aircraft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "noble experiment" -- during which the squadrons they escorted never lost 
a single bomber -- "proved that the black man is just as capable as any other 
person," Fountain said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, somber veterans found the names of lost comrades on a replica 
of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss them a lot," said Daniel Valesquez, fighting back tears as he read the 
names of five of his friends. "It just hits me. I'm here and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for an old vet," said Charlotte Best, who served in the Korean War, 
as she gazed at the movable replica parked outside Knott's Berry Farm. 
"Everybody who comes here has somebody here." 
</P>
<P>
 At Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills, about 300 veterans 
gathered to the patriotic strains of a high school marching band and the 
echoing volleys of a rifle salute. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to years past, when more than 1,000 showed up on Veterans Day, it was 
a relatively poor turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a younger generation now that doesn't remember all this stuff," 
said World War II veteran James Brickley. "They just shove it off as another 
holiday, another day off from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ocampo, another World War II veteran who spent Friday morning at Forest 
Lawn, remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers Guam -- what it looked like, what it smelled like, who was 
around. But mostly, he remembers Don Jones. And he remembers Jones' family in 
Texas, when he went to see them afterward. How they cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died right in front of us," caught in an ambush when a group of soldiers 
went out looking for souvenirs, Ocampo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another visitor at Forest Lawn, Clarence Betler, was born 100 years ago in 
May, into a nation beginning to heal from the nightmare of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was called to serve in World War I, the United States already 
had won Puerto Rico from Spain in the Spanish-American War, and his century of 
life has included four wars more. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these wars don't do any good," he said Friday. "They still have wars, and 
I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Sharon Bernstein and Ching-Ching Ni contributed to this 
story.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA; STUDENT 
COPTER PILOT DIES IN CRASH NEAR THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old student pilot who had taken off from Van Nuys Airport was killed 
when his helicopter crashed Friday afternoon for unknown reasons near Six Flags 
Magic Mountain, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 3:45 p.m. at the edge of a large plowed field west of 
the amusement park, said Lt. Bill Dunn of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's 
station.The nose of the helicopter apparently struck a 10-foot hillside at high 
speed, strewing wreckage up to 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preliminarily, it appears as though he may have been practicing landing and 
he didn't make it," Dunn said. Officials at the scene said it was also possible 
the helicopter had engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot's name was not made public pending notification of next of kin, Dunn 
said. The aircraft took off from Pacific Shore Aviation, a helicopter 
instruction school in Van Nuys.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAWYER 
GROUP ALTERS NAME TO REFLECT CONSUMER BENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Trial Lawyers Assn. announced this week that it is changing 
its name to Consumer Attorneys Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the 2,900-member organization said the name change was 
prompted by survey research showing that more than three times as many people 
believe a "trial lawyer" represents accused criminals, rather than being 
someone who represents aggrieved consumers suing corporations or insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always been champions for consumer protection," said the group's 
president, Bruce Broillet. "With our new name, we will be able to communicate 
our message to the public."

 Interview with the vampire-counter: Stephen Kaplan says Los Angeles has the 
largest vampire population in the world -- 36 -- and he's not referring to 
Hollywood agents. Kaplan should know, if anyone would, because he's the head of 
the Vampire Research Center in Elmhurst, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not making this up. The center is listed on Page 566 of the 1994 World 
Almanac & Book of Facts. Anyway, Kaplan says Angelenos needn't worry. "Most 
vampires are very pleasant individuals," he said. "And they require only a few 
ounces of blood, two or three times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, who teaches parapsychology courses, doesn't feel he's sticking his 
neck out with such pronouncements, even though scientists say there is no 
evidence of beings who need to drink blood to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been interviewed over 2,000 times on radio and 135 times on TV," Kaplan 
pointed out, removing any doubts we had. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are vampires drawn to L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 "Vampires are sexually charismatic, high-energy people -- and that's L.A. 
people," he said. "Besides in California, if you're unusual, no one will notice 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, by the way, disliked the new Tom Cruise movie, "Interview With the 
Vampire," and not just because of the plot. "They didn't even invite me to the 
premiere," he complained. Obviously the snub left a bad taste in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolf Man meet the Postal Service: From the 
vampire-counter, we move to the cinematic vampire's son -- Bela Lugosi Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 An L.A. attorney (no jokes about his choice of professions, please), Lugosi 
and two other descendants of scarifying actors are pushing for commemorative 
stamps to honor their kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were classic horror figures -- a big part of Hollywood history," 
pointed out Lugosi, whose father starred in the 1931 "Dracula." Joining him in 
the petition campaign are Sara Karloff, daughter of Boris ("Frankenstein") 
Karloff, and Ron Chaney, grandson of Lon ("The Wolf Man") Chaney Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Karloff said the petition drive has so far drawn about 6,000 signatures. 
Others who wish to show their support may write to her at P.O. Box 2424, Rancho 
Mirage, Calif. 92270. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dracula commemorative would be doubly appropriate, inasmuch as the Postal 
Service recently announced that for each piece of first-class mail, it soon 
will suck 32 cents out of customers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This really shouldn't follow a vampire item: Kathy Tannen noticed that an ad 
in the Wine House catalogue for a Hollywood Park event seemed to be directed 
toward females willing to bare parts of their bodies. We suspect the writer 
meant button-less blouses, but fashion isn't our department. We're still trying 
to figure out the reference to pants. miscelLAny Our photo of the new stamp of 
Groucho Marx and John Lennon issued by the province of Abkhazia in the former 
Soviet republic of Georgia moved Phil Proctor of L.A.'s Firesign Theater to 
write. He noted his satirical group made the Marxist-Lennonist photo link in 
1969 on the cover of the album "How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When 
You're Not Anywhere at All?" Sounds as though Abkhazia is trying to pull a 
dirty, non-Commie trick.

ROBBERY ATTEMPT; 2 TEEN-AGERS HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular Bell grocer was gunned down Friday during an attempted robbery, and 
two teen-agers were later arrested as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Bu Lee, 55, was hit once in the neck -- just above a bulletproof vest he 
always wore to work -- as his assailants fired four rounds into Vanessa's 
Market at 4728 Gage Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The store owner was pronounced dead at Santa Marta Hospital after the 12:30 
p.m. attack, said Deputy Angie McLaughlin.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities who pulled over a green pickup with a camper shell in the 4900 
block of Live Oak Street in Cudahy arrested a 17-year-old boy, said Lt. Joe 
Brown of the Sheriff's Department. A second suspect, David Gomez, 19, was 
arrested at a home in the 4800 block of Elizabeth Street in Cudahy.  
</P>
<P>
 Customers and neighbors living near the market were shocked by the violent 
death of the grocer. As detectives searched the store for evidence, neighbors 
placed flowers in front of the market. One customer left a balloon that read: 
"We'll Miss You!"

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; AID OFFERS 
POUR IN FOR MAN WHOSE 'VOICE' WAS STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Gershan may no longer have a voice, but that has not stopped dozens of 
San Fernando Valley residents from responding to his call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 From the man who offered the use of his late wife's voice-activated computer 
to those who just want to send money, offers of aid poured in Friday for 
Gershan, a Valley College student with cerebral palsy whose electronic keyboard 
was recently stolen, depriving him of the tool he needs to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My phone has not stopped ringing," said Los Angeles Police Officer Bob 
Mosley, who held a news conference with Gershan at police headquarters. "I've 
got all kinds of cops wanting to donate. Even the camera crews wanted to 
donate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gershan, 31, who has the mental capacity of a 13-year-old, was in the Valley 
College cafeteria last month when the device was stolen. On Friday, The Times 
ran an article about the theft, prompting dozens of calls to the newspaper and 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to know that people care enough to want to do something for a 
handicapped person," Gershan said Friday, using the Telecommunications Device 
for the Deaf during an interview.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: KOREATOWN; LIBRARY 
OFFERS CATALOGUE CARDS IN 3 ASIAN LANGUAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Public Library, which owns one of the nation's largest popular 
collections of Asian language books and materials, has introduced catalogue 
cards in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards are used at seven branches that serve a large part of the city's 
burgeoning Asian population.The branches are in the Koreatown area, Granada 
Hills, Northridge, Chinatown and Little Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 The catalogue department previously provided cards with Asian titles in 
Romanized script, a practice that confused many patrons and librarians.  
</P>
<P>
 "Romanized pronunciations usually correspond to more than one Asian character 
and can carry more than one meaning," said Violet Koroki, head of the catalogue 
department. "Given this ambiguity, the Asian community rarely used the card 
catalogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, use of the library system's Asian collections has risen sharply 
as the city's Asian population has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the library's technical services staff is working on updating the 
automated circulation system and computerized catalogue to display Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean characters.

EAGLE ROCK WOMAN, 50, GIVES BIRTH TO TRIPLETS 
</P>

<P>
 At an age when many couples are slowing down, planning for retirement and 
enjoying grandchildren, Milagros Olarve and her husband Florante -- both 50 
years old -- have had triplets. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 1/2 hours of labor, and a test-tube conception, Millie, as she is 
known, gave birth Thursday to 2-pound, 7-ounce Alexander, 2-pound, 2-ounce 
Veronica and 2-pound Stephanie. Although they were born about two months 
prematurely, all three and their mother were healthy and resting Friday at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time at this age, they're having menopause, not having babies," 
said Olarve's obstetrician, Dr. Ronald Wu.  
</P>
<P>
 Millie Olarve said she used no birth control during the couple's 22 years of 
marriage, and nothing happened. About 10 years ago, she and her husband became 
determined to have a child. After surgery to remove scar tissue from her 
abdomen and unblock her fallopian tubes, she still had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Eagle Rock couple turned to in vitro fertilization -- Latin 
for "in glass" -- the term for test-tube babies. Millie's eggs and Florante's 
sperm were combined in a test tube and implanted in her womb. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two tries, at about $18,000 each. In the first, doctors implanted five 
fertilized eggs. Another five were implanted in May; the large number increases 
the odds that at least one will survive. This time, three made it. 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Olarve said she pays no attention to debates about some mothers being 
too old to have children. She and her husband are in excellent health, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's unfair" to the children, she said. "It's going to make me 
feel younger." 
</P>
<P>
 Wu said he expects the premature babies to be ready to go home soon after the 
first of the year. Until then, the Olarves are counting their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milagros in Spanish means miracles, " Millie said. "Now I have three 
miracles."

PANEL SEEKS MORE SEISMIC TRAINING FOR BUILDERS; EARTHQUAKES: ARCHITECTS, 
ENGINEERS, CONTRACTORS AND CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE TARGETED FOR 
INCREASED EDUCATION. SHODDY PRACTICES IN THOSE FIELDS ARE BLAMED FOR MUCH OF 
THE DAMAGE IN THE NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Blaming shoddy design, construction and inspection for much of the damage in 
the Northridge earthquake, the California Seismic Safety Commission has called 
for new laws requiring additional training for architects, engineers, 
contractors and code enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting this week, the commission tentatively agreed on the education 
requirements and several other recommendations. But it postponed final action 
on an already overdue report that Gov. Pete Wilson requested on the adequacy of 
current seismic construction standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission stressed the need to retrofit schools and other public 
buildings to reduce the hazard from such non-structural elements as toppling 
light fixtures. But commissioners wrestled with how to safeguard lives and 
property in the face of the state's dire fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters are not interested in big-ticket items," said Frances E. Winslow, 
a commissioner and director of emergency services for the city of San Jose. "We 
have to ask ourselves what we can do administratively or without involving a 
lot of expenditures."  
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of debate Thursday, the commission shot down a potentially 
costly proposal to establish a new state agency or designate a so-called "quake 
czar" who would have been responsible for managing several seismic 
risk-reduction programs now divided among several existing agencies. The new 
department also would have been responsible for promulgating seismic safety 
training and building standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and local building officials contended that the agency would have 
been a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters made a statement about how they felt about big government 
Tuesday," testified Robert E. Raymer, technical director for the California 
Building Industry Assn. "This item alone could hurt the credibility of your 
entire document."  
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners argued that the new department could save the state money 
by consolidating fragmented programs. But others warned that even if it were 
cost-effective, it would be solidly opposed by the turf-hungry state agencies 
that currently regulate seismic safety, including the Division of the State 
Architect and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
Legislation to consolidate the various programs has failed to win passage in 
the past, partly because the state agencies opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission lacks the authority to enforce new rules it recommends, but is 
often considered persuasive on issues of seismic safety. It will meet again 
Dec. 8, and it is likely that the final report will not be completed until 
shortly before the first anniversary of the Jan. 17 quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission has tentatively concluded that the building code is largely 
adequate to protect lives, but found compliance lacking. Many of the 11,787 
buildings heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake showed evidence of 
shoddy construction, design or inspection, said Fred Turner, the commission's 
structural engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 "We would not have had a lot of the damage we had . . . if we had just taken 
what we had today and used it properly," said Paul F. Fratessa, commission 
chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission has recommended that building departments hire architects or 
engineers to review sophisticated blueprints, that code enforcement officials 
and others receive additional training and that updated seismic safety 
principles be included in contractors' licensing exams.  
</P>
<P>
 The panel also tentatively agreed to adopt a recommendation that would require 
the owners of the state's 1,300 dams and large river levies to update their 
inundation maps by Jan. 1, 1996. The dams appear to be structurally sound, the 
commission said, but local jurisdictions need the maps to evaluate future 
development and prepare evacuation strategies in the event of a cataclysmic 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission plans to ask the Legislature to allocate state and federal 
money for a seismic hazards mapping program that could also help cities plan 
development.  
</P>
<P>
 A draft report urged that automatic gas shut-off valves be required at the 
service entry point of all mobile home parks in California. Gas-fed fires from 
broken lines destroyed 184 mobile homes as a result of the Northridge 
earthquake, according to the commission. Some Los Angeles City Council members 
have proposed that the valves be required in all residences. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co., which has 4.7 million customers 
in the Southland, said the firm opposes mandates because the valves often shut 
down unnecessarily, leaving consumers without service and requiring the firm to 
make costly home visits to turn the gas back on. The company is seeking 
permission from the Public Utilities Commission to test a shut-off valve in the 
San Fernando Valley, Orange County and the Inland Empire that can be turned 
back on by the customer, the spokeswoman said.

BRINKS ROBBERY WAS A FAMILY AFFAIR, POLICE SAY; CRIME: GUARD WHOSE CASH BAG WAS 
STOLEN IS ARRESTED ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER, ACCUSED OF THE HOLDUP, AND THEIR 
MOTHER, WHO ALLEGEDLY DROVE THE GETAWAY CAR.

 An armored car robbery allegedly committed by a 49-year-old mother and her two 
sons sounds more like a bad TV sitcom: It's "All in the Family" meets 
"America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that Luis Fernando Roca, 30, grabbed a cash bag from a Brinks 
armored guard and fired several shots as he sped away in a getaway car driven 
by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the hook: The guard is the 28-year-old son of the getaway car driver 
and the brother of the man who robbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Roca and his mother, Maria Aracely Riveria-Cordero, 49, both 
of La Puente, shortly after the robbery Wednesday in Redondo Beach, said 
Redondo Beach Police Lt. Ken Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brinks guard, George Roca, 28, was arrested the next day. After the 
robbery, he failed to tell police the suspects were his mother and brother, 
police said. He said he was unable to get a good enough look at the robbers to 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 "George had a bad night sleeping . . . and told his boss the next day, 'That 
was my mother and my brother, and the reason I didn't tell police was because I 
was embarrassed,' " Redondo Beach Police Lt. Jeff Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, police said, they were on to the alleged scam. The home address 
the guard gave police after the robbery matched that of the getaway car's 
driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't too smart," Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 3 p.m. Wednesday at the Smith's Food King market at 
4001 Marine Ave. when Luis Roca allegedly walked up behind his brother as he 
was making his cash delivery to the store, Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Roca grabbed his brother's gun and a bag containing a substantial amount 
of cash, then jumped in the back seat of the getaway car, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the mother-son duo sped away, Luis Roca fired about four shots toward the 
Brinks truck, apparently for dramatic effect, police said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects might have escaped, but Redondo Beach Police Agent Jim Bell 
happened to be on patrol in the parking lot when the robbery occurred. Bell 
heard the gunshots and saw a man wearing a red bandanna and holding a gun in 
the back seat of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell gave chase through city streets, then on foot after Luis Roca allegedly 
jumped out of the back seat with the bag of cash and fled. Bell quickly nabbed 
Roca and recovered the money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roca's mother sped away, but was arrested soon after by another 
Redondo Beach officer, Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron said the family had reported experiencing financial problems, and was 
behind in mortgage payments at the time of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are being held in separate cells at the Redondo Beach jail in lieu 
of $50,000 bail, Cameron said. They are scheduled to be arraigned Monday.

AL MARTINEZ: ONE STRIKE WAITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricardo Resendez is the kind of guy who's always going to have a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, 25 years in prison have filled his memory with the kinds of 
nightmares that haunt graveyards and battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 They're with him every waking hour and pursue him through a troubled sleep in 
sounds and images: the foreboding presence of guards, the clanking of steel 
doors, the screams of fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the "three strikes" law that hangs over him on the sheerest of 
threads, warning that the kind of felony that might get another guy probation 
could send him back to prison for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, there's his oddly humanistic, faintly fatalistic willingness to 
help others. It's what got him into trouble 33 years ago and, more recently, 
almost turned him into a poster boy for the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 If good intentions pave the way to hell, Ricardo Resendez may be strolling 
down that very path . . . but that may be exactly where he's always been 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
 I met him just after he'd gotten out of prison and was on the streets telling 
gang kids what it was like to be behind bars, how much of an animal you become. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a compelling message delivered by a man whose IQ had been measured at 
142, but whose perceptions of acceptable conduct left much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to prison in the first place for jumping in to help a friend and 
killing the attacker. Strike one. In prison, he wrestled with a guard who was 
killed with his own gun. Strike two. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike three was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now 51, Resendez was living in a Skid Row hotel on a $600 monthly Social 
Security check when a woman tenant asked to borrow $40. He should've said no 
and that would have been that. The woman was a hooker and probably a drug 
addict. But he figured she needed help, so he loaned her the money. 
</P>
<P>
 She came around again later and offered him sex for $20. He accepted, but only 
had $10. He gave it to her and said, "Now you only owe me thirty." In the 
convoluted logic of the street, the hooker figured she'd been short-changed and 
left in a rage. It wasn't over. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned the next day and said a woman upstairs was being severely beaten 
by her husband and needed help. Resendez should've hesitated. He should've 
taken a minute to think. 
</P>
<P>
 But he told me once he knows what it's like to need help, so he always tries 
to give it. That's what he did this time. It was a mistake of almost awesome 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got to the room of the woman supposedly being beaten, he discovered it 
was a lie. Only then did it flash on him that he was being played for a fool. 
He ran downstairs and found the hooker, his wallet and his money gone. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the police, they checked his background and wouldn't even file a 
crime report. But then the hooker and a friend returned and taunted him outside 
his window and he chased them, cursing. They said he had a knife, he says 
they're liars. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops were called again and this time they arrested Resendez. He was 
charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of 
making terrorist threats, both felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike three was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first he defended himself, even participating in the jury selection, but 
then was joined by a public defender named Gustavo Bermudez, a kid raised in 
East L.A. who, like Resendez, always wanted to help people . . . but chose a 
different way of doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bermudez didn't want to put Resendez on the stand. He felt his past would 
defeat him. But the lawyer hadn't counted on the ex-prisoner's ability to put 
his life in the proper context of anguish and regret. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it turned out," Bermudez said, "it made him human. The jury understood his 
pain. When the D.A. asked if Ricardo were proud of his background, he pushed 
away the mike, leaned into his hands and cried, 'No . . . no . . . no!' There 
was a stunned silence." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the jurors, a firefighter named Brian Luce, said that at one point 
Resendez was a single vote away from conviction. Luce was that vote. He didn't 
believe the prosecution had proved its case to a "moral certainty," and the 
others ultimately agreed. The third strike went awry. Ball one. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to Resendez later and told him for God's sake stop trying to help 
everyone, but he said he couldn't do that. Because he hurts, he can feel the 
pain of others. He can't let them suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know that there will ever be a place in the world for guys who walk 
with ghosts and tamper with other lives. Resendez has spent his own life 
staring into an abyss and, to paraphrase the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, 
the abyss is beginning to stare back. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike three is still waiting to be pitched.

GAY RIGHTS ADVOCATE TO BE L.A.'S NEXT LUTHERAN BISHOP; LEADERSHIP: THE REV. 
PAUL EGERTSON, A NORTH HOLLYWOOD PASTOR WHO TEACHES AT CAL LUTHERAN UNIVERSITY, 
SAID HE WAS SURPRISED TO BE ELECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood pastor anduniversity professor who advocates opening the 
ministry to gays and lesbians will become the Los Angeles-based bishop next 
year of a Lutheran denomination that recently rejected such a proposal after 
bitter controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who can blame the Rev. Paul Egertson for describing himself as "surprised" 
when he was elected bishop of 152 congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America.  
</P>
<P>
 "My identification with a minority position in the midst of the nationwide 
controversy made me think that a majority of delegates would not vote for 
(me)," Egertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson, 59, has been well-known to Southern California Lutherans for his 
continuing education work at Cal Lutheran University, but he also has been a 
part-time pastor for two years at St. Matthew's parish in North Hollywood, 
which has welcomed gay and lesbian congregants since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked -- we thought there was no chance of his being elected 
because our (parish) is known for including gay people," said Michael Nelson, 
who chairs St. Matthew's evangelism committee. "We are sad to lose him because 
Dr. Egertson has brought us an expansive view of the Gospel, just lately 
getting us to start a ministry to the deaf." 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson told delegates during last Saturday's balloting that his oldest son 
was denied ordination after graduating from a Lutheran seminary because of 
Evangelical Lutheran Church policies barring non-celibate homosexuals from the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At that point Egertson was one of three remaining candidates in the convention 
to fill a post vacated by Bishop J. Roger Anderson, who became pastor of a 
church in Arizona. Egertson went on to win the six-year term as bishop on the 
seventh ballot, 222-201, over the Rev. William Bartlett of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of Cal Lutheran President Luther Luedtke, Egertson was elected 
neither because of nor in spite of his position on gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man of extraordinary compassion who has had long experience in 
ministry as a pastor and in continuing theological education," Luedtke said.  
</P>
<P>
 Egertson holds a doctorate from the School of Theology at Claremont and 
recently took law courses at Pepperdine University to become certified in 
"alternative dispute resolution," so he can assist in arbitration and mediation 
outside the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been pastor of three churches, including Faith Lutheran in South Gate 
and St. Timothy's in Lakewood, and from 1979 to 1992 directed Cal 
Lutheran-based theological extension curricula for ministers and lay people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luedtke said that the Southern California (West) Synod of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America could not be classified as either liberal or 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "What distinguishes this synod is a cultural and social diversity that has 
moved us far beyond the Northern European stereotype to a cosmopolitan 
community," said the former administrator at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop-elect Egertson said in an interview that he recognizes that divisions 
within the organization are too deep to change church positions on sexuality at 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident a year ago when angry parish reactions poured into the 
Chicago headquarters after a draft statement on sexual mores proposed 
recommending that sexually active teen-agers use condoms, that non-compulsive 
masturbation is healthy and that the church should re-examine traditional 
disapproval of committed gay and lesbian couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The response led to the preparation of a second, more traditional draft, 
released last month, which says the Bible teaches that sex between people of 
the same gender "is not in accordance with God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the draft also called for respect for gay and lesbian people and 
for their civil rights. While continuing present policies, the church will 
engage in study and discussion of the issues, the draft said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theological work necessary to undergird a change in our church has yet to 
be done," Egertson said. The first draft was written by a task force broadly 
representative of the church's membership, but the group did not have enough 
biblical and theological scholars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson said that he and his wife, Shirley, were confronted by the issue 15 
years ago when the oldest of their six sons, Greg, said that he was gay. "He 
changed the way we thought about homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 The son, now an administrator at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, 
studied for the ministry at Pacific Lutheran Seminary in Berkeley in the late 
1980s despite scant hope that the new Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 
the product of a three-way church merger in 1988, would suddenly modify its 
criteria for ordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson continues to conduct Sunday services at the 100-member St. Matthew's 
Lutheran Church in North Hollywood, where a support ministry for people with 
HIV infection and AIDS was organized last spring. He led a memorial service at 
the church Wednesday night for one such victim of AIDS.

ACTIVIST SEES NEED FOR JEWISH RENEWAL; IDEAS: JEWS HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THEIR 
FAITH'S CENTRAL MESSAGE OF TRANSFORMATION, SAYS CONTROVERSIAL THEOLOGIAN WHO 
ADVOCATES 'TAKING GOD SERIOUSLY ON A DAILY BASIS.'

<P>
 In an office barely larger than a walk-in closet, Jewish liberation theologian 
and activist Michael Lerner sits behind a desk overflowing with books, 
newspapers and more than one cup containing coffee of indeterminate age. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall behind Lerner is a photo of him with Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose 
adoption of his "politics of meaning" earned him the label "guru of the White 
House" in the Clinton Administration's early days. Above that is an Israeli 
flag, and the words "powerlessness corrupts." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a phrase that sums up Lerner's assessment of the situation confronting 
Jews and Judaism in contemporary America. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sees it, the pain of centuries of persecution has led Jews largely to 
abandon Judaism's "central insight" -- the "revolutionary and dangerous" 
proclamation that "the way things are is not the way things have to be." In its 
place they have embraced the promise of assimilation -- safety and material 
comfort in the American mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy has assured physical survival, but it has also stripped American 
Judaism of much of its spiritual power by reducing it to an "ethnic 
particularity" that fails to inspire, says the 51-year-old Lerner. And so Jews, 
particularly the younger ones, drift away -- from synagogue, from communal 
life, from concern about the religion's very survival. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new book, "Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation" 
(Putnam, $25.95), Lerner, founder and editor of the biweekly magazine Tikkun, 
argues that only a radical return to Judaism's message of transformation 
accompanied by a broad reinterpretation of Jewish practice can reinvigorate the 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner, a controversial figure in Jewish circles because of his provocative 
style, unabashedly left-wing politics and criticism of Israel's policies toward 
the Palestinians, recently discussed his book with Religion News Service in his 
office on Manhattan's Upper West Side: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The term Jewish renewal often implies Judaism with a New Age twist. 
What do you mean by it? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I'm talking about more than that. Renewal for me is the attempt to 
reclaim the revolutionary voice of God in Torah (the totality of Jewish law and 
tradition) and to rebuild a Judaism that is spiritually alive and that rejects 
the artificial separation between spirituality, ethics and political 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That sounds similar to what evangelical Christians also say. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The need for renewal is not restricted to the Jewish community. Renewal is 
happening everywhere in this nation because the ethos of cynicism and 
selfishness prevalent in American life is very unsatisfying. I have great 
philosophical differences with the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 But I agree with them on the need for spiritual renewal and inclusion of 
spiritual perspective in the public arena. There is no solution to the Jewish 
problem that is not also a solution to the world's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you reach the conclusion that American Judaism is in need of major 
overhaul? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For years I've spoken to Jewish groups across the country. In addition, I 
interviewed over 350 Jews between the ages of 25 and 45. Overwhelmingly, what I 
heard was that they were turned off by the materialism and lack of spirituality 
in the Jewish world, by a joylessness that came from an excessive focus on the 
Holocaust and Jewish suffering, by upset with the exclusive concern for Jewish 
welfare without adequate regard to the welfare of others, by the sexism, the 
cultural conformism and repression of dissent, particularly about Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all those things, the materialism was the most striking because I knew that 
Judaism itself is not materialistic. But they were not talking about what the 
rabbis said. They were talking about the ethos in the community. They did not 
feel part of a spiritual community or any sense of a spiritual reality. They 
left Judaism not because the Jewish world was so different from American 
society, but because it was so similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You say they left. Where did they go? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They divided into two subgroups. One group went to find spirituality 
elsewhere. They experimented with Eastern religions. They checked out 
psychological growth communities or politics as a way to find an answer to 
their need for meaning not met in the Jewish world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger group concluded that since they found no spiritual life in 
Judaism, all talk about spirituality was just pleasant sentiment having nothing 
to do with daily life. Judaism and all religious attachments lost all meaning 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does Jewish renewal look like in practice? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Jewish renewal is not just an attempt to push liberation theology. It's 
about taking God seriously on a daily basis, whether your level of observance 
is Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, Orthodox or something else. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, that means an insistence on being spiritually real. Don't say or 
do things you don't believe in. Don't say prayers if you don't really believe 
the words. But don't automatically throw out the prayers. For some it means 
rewriting those prayers in ways you can believe what you're saying. 
</P>
<P>
 For others it means re-appropriating the depth of truth in the prayer. There 
are many things in a prayer that are revealed as deeper truths as you struggle 
with that prayer over a lifetime. Don't be too quick to abandon the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 As I've said, it also means rejecting the division between spirituality and 
political, social and economic transformation. Take just as seriously "justice, 
justice shall thou pursue" as "don't eat pig." There is no division in Torah 
and there should be no division in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's inclusive but also grounded in the mitzvot (Jewish religious 
obligations). When we embody feminism we do it in a Halachic framework 
(traditional Jewish law). 
</P>
<P>
 It's taking environmentalism seriously, while rejecting New Age belief in the 
Earth being our highest guide. It's observing Shabbat, because a day not 
devoted to the marketplace is a day that is open to experiencing the sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 It's taking on communal obligations. Too many of us reject communal 
obligations because we are so steeped in individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does Jewish renewal translate politically? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, it's not just for the advancement of Jews, but for all 
people. It creates democratic processes that ensure real participation for all 
people. It seeks to nurture leadership and initiative and it would act to 
eliminate poverty and ecological threats and against privilege for one group 
over another. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also avoid victimology, homophobia, sexism and all claims that 
material needs are more important than spiritual or ethical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If American Jews are as disconnected from true Judaism as you contend, 
isn't it naive to think they can change in the radical manner you say is 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not talking about something that's going to sweep the nation overnight. 
But I do believe we're at the very beginning stages of a long process that I 
see going on over the next couple of hundred years and which I see a growing 
enthusiasm for, growing out of people's very real needs. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we are in a period like the beginning of Rabbinic Judaism after the 
destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem nearly 2,000 years ago. Judaism 
is reinterpreting itself and it's happening in all its different branches. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm very optimistic. Not in the short run, because it will probably get worse 
before it gets better, but in the long run because of all I see developing in 
Judaism today.

AUTHOR TO DISCUSS SEARCH FOR THE HISTORICAL JESUS; BIBLE: BURTON L. MACK SAYS 
PRECURSOR OF GOSPELS PRESENTS JESUS AS A SAGE IN TRADITION OF THE ANCIENT 
CYNICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burton L. Mack, whose recent book about a long-lost source that many believe 
the Gospel writers used to produce their accounts of Jesus, will speak about 
the quest for the historical Jesus at the University of Judaism on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor of religion at Claremont Graduate School, Mack is an authority on 
early Christianity. In his book "The Lost Gospel: the Book of Q and Christian 
Origins," Mack, like many previous scholars, notes that material common to the 
Gospels of Matthew and Luke (but not Mark) appears to have originated from a 
common source of Jesus' sayings. 
</P>
<P>
 This source became known as Q, short for the German word Quelle, which means 
source. To this day, Q has never been found. But Bible scholars say it emerges 
from a close examination of the similarities in the Gospels of Matthew and 
Luke. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges, however, defies traditional Christian understanding of the man 
believers see today as the Son of God and Lord of their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Mack has argued that these earliest sayings associated with Jesus have no 
connection with the symbols that dominate the versions of Christianity accepted 
by believers today. Rather, they present Jesus as merely a sage in the asocial, 
iconoclastic tradition of the ancient Cynics. He is seen as an itinerant 
philosopher who urged followers to live better lives despite social conventions 
and who found a wide audience in the Hellenic world during the tumultuous era 
in which he lived.  
</P>
<P>
 Jesus is not identified with divine wisdom, nor does he preach the 
eschatological (end time) renewal of Israel in light of God's judgment. Mack 
contends that Jesus did not embody the suffering of the righteous ones of 
Israel and was not exalted to God's right hand. Other scholars disagree.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mack said there was something more to the Jesus movement: Its followers 
were animated by the idea of belonging to a movement that transcended ethnic 
and political loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack will speak at 7:45 p.m. at Gindi Auditorium at the University of Judaism, 
15600 Mulholland Drive. His talk is one in a series on historical and mythical 
figures in the Bible sponsored by the California Museum of Ancient Art. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 22, William G. Dever, a biblical archeologist, will speak about "Bar 
Kochba and the Second Jewish Revolt: Archeological Evidence on the Man and the 
Myth." 
</P>
<P>
 For reservations, call (310) 476-9777 or (818) 762-5500.

 "Alternative holiday markets -- where people 'buy' gifts of charity -- are a 
good way to honor someone who doesn't need more material goods," says Harriet 
Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her nonprofit organization, Alternative Gift Markets Inc., has been helping 
congregations and schools organize them for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating organizations set up colorful displays featuring agencies that 
aid the hungry and homeless, offer education, preserve the environment, provide 
safe drinking water and administer medical assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Honorees receive information about the recipient charity in a holiday card 
saying that a gift has been made in their name. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard started her first market as a teaching device for children in a 
church she belonged to in Pasadena. Over the years, alternative markets have 
grown in popularity. This year, Pritchard estimates, 40 churches in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties will use her "how-to" manuals, workshops and staff members 
to help set up markets. Worldwide, she expects the total will be 260 markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago Pritchard launched a catalogue, "My Shopping List for the 
World," for which she researches the track records of Christian and secular 
relief and self-development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Each charity included in the catalogue must certify that money received 
through catalogue orders is spent solely on goods and services, not overhead. 
Her organization makes no money from the project, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's edition features 22 projects, including primary health care for 
villagers in Laos, administered by the Mennonite Central Committee. A $5 gift, 
she notes, can protect one Laotian against malaria for a year. Twenty dollars 
will purchase a goat to provide milk and cheese for hungry Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, $5 can buy a day's meals for one person through Food USA for 
Hungry Americans. And $15 can provide one night's lodging for a battered woman 
and her children through Safe Havens for Battered Women. Other gifts help 
Pasadena AIDS Service provide rent assistance to AIDS patients who are no 
longer able to work. 
</P>

 When George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door in Alabama in 1963, we 
Californians were outraged at his racist attempt to deny education to black 
children. Now we pass a law so Pete Wilson can stand in the schoolhouse door 
and deny education to brown children. I guess that not only makes us racist but 
hypocritical ones as well.

KNICKS WIN THE WAR, 101-99; NBA: IN BATTLE OF PREMIER CENTERS, MAGIC'S O'NEAL 
SCORES 41 POINTS, BUT EWING SCORES GAME-WINNING BASKET WITH 2.4 SECONDS 
REMAINING. 
</P>

 Two of the NBA's best centers, on two of the NBA's best teams, in one of its 
most storied buildings, playing on the stage of national television less than a 
week into the new season. It was almost too much to ask to have the two titans 
going mano-a-mano in the final moments of this wrenching, drenching drama of a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what the sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd, the national cable 
audience, the 200 accredited media and the world of skeptics got Thursday 
night. Shaquille O'Neal, less than 24 hours removed from a career-type game in 
an overtime win in Charlotte, nearly dragged his Orlando Magic team to an 
improbable last-minute comeback. He didn't fully complete his mission because 
Patrick Ewing completed an equally improbable last-second play, draining a 
14-footer from the right baseline with 2.4 seconds left. That gave the New York 
Knicks a 101-99 victory and first blood in a fight that might not end until 
early June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are 3-0 as they head west for a trip that begins Saturday in San 
Antonio. The Magic is 2-2, with both losses coming in the final seconds on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal thrashed the Knicks for 41 points, his second consecutive 40-plus-point 
game (he had 46 in Charlotte), many on his signature dunks, a surprising number 
on a silky baseline turnaround jumper. Ewing might have matched O'Neal's total 
had he stayed on the court more than 26 minutes: He hit his first seven shots, 
six of them jumpers, and knocked down 11 of 17 overall on his way to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, he had the bucket that stuck the knife in the Magic's heart. 
And the way he scored it couldn't have made the Magic's loss much easier to 
swallow. O'Neal began the sequence by muscling through a tangle of Knicks' arms 
for a layup with 10.8 seconds left, tying the score at 99 and completing a 
rally from a seven-point deficit with three minutes to go. O'Neal scored the 
Magic's last 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Either an overtime or a shocking finish in regulation was in the making. 
Certainly a Knicks timeout was in the making -- they had two left. But the 
Knicks did no such thing: John Starks took Charles Oakley's inbounds pass, 
bolted up the right side, left three defenders in his wake, spotted Ewing 
curling to the right baseline and passed it over. The rest might not be 
history, but it won't be forgotten for a while, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Supposedly, there was method to their madness. Ewing said he looked to Coach 
Pat Riley to see what to do on the last play, "and he said to push the ball up 
the floor. I saw John Starks moving the ball upcourt, so I ran with him and cut 
across the lane so he'd have an option if the shot wasn't there for him. He got 
me the ball, and fortunately it went in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there might be a timeout," Knick point guard Derek Harper said. 
"But with a timeout, they would have had time to set up. On a set situation 
with Shaq setting up inside, it would have been real tough for us to get off a 
good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Knicks guessed right. "Everyone was in limbo, waiting to see 
what they were going to do," said O'Neal, who got to the other end in time to 
wave a futile hand in Ewing's face. "I think that we expected them to call a 
timeout, and Starks came flying up the side and dished to Ewing, who made a 
great shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally I would have taken the timeout," Riley said. "But with 10 seconds to 
go and being tied, I think it was a good play, as random as it was."

NOTES; SHERMAN NAMED OTB PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than 11 months of deliberation, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani 
Thursday announced the mildly surprising appointment of Allie Sherman as 
president of the New York City Off-Track Betting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, 72, leaves a position as vice president and senior adviser to 
Time-Warner Communications, but is best known as the New York Giants coach from 
1961-69 and more recently an ESPN football analyst. He is now head of the 
financially beleaguered, labor-fat, patronage-larded public-benefit 
corporation, which has suffered mounting losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, twice the NFL Coach of the Year while with the Giants, launched 
Time-Warner's first pay-per-view and sports programming efforts and, according 
to Giuliani's office, was charged with creating alliances between cable 
operators, program providers, advertisers and the public. This is valuable 
expertise for the next NYC-OTB head, who will lead the corporation into its 
first joint venture with the New York Racing Association as plans for in-home 
simulcasting begin to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Polumbo, acting president since Hazel Dukes and much of her staff left 
office after Giuliani's election last year, will remain as executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the appointment of a new board, NYC-OTB has undergone no meaningful 
change in structure during the first year of Giuliani's administration, and a 
recent cost-cutting move to close unprofitable branches on Sundays was beaten 
back by labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Awaiting Sherman is the task of streamlining a middle-management-bloated work 
force, cutting costs and dealing with the question of a possible merger with 
the New York Racing Association or sale. A study of those questions 
commissioned by Gov. Mario Cuomo in August is expected to be completed by the 
firm Bear-Stearns early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's OTB will be exploring opportunities for privatization," Giuliani 
said in a statement announcing Sherman's appointment. "But it is also necessary 
to secure that revenue and collection are protected and improved." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a preemptive measure to shore up the winter meeting, NYRA made the five-day 
racing week official Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new schedule, with Mondays and Tuesdays dark, begins Dec. 5. There will be 
holiday-related alterations to the schedule to allow for racing on Mondays, the 
first of those on Jan. 2, and racing will be conducted on Christmas Eve, which 
originally was scheduled as a dark day. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day racing week, a response to the shortage of horses that has 
plagued racing here in recent years, is set for the winter and spring meetings 
at Aqueduct, but serious consideration is being given to its extension to the 
spring and autumn meetings at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gambling legislation in several forms met with pronounced voter disapproval on 
several fronts in referendums held Tuesday that were directly related to the 
futures of racing interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida voters resoundingly defeated a measure that would have allowed casinos 
at 47 sites, including racetracks and jai-alai frontons. Casino measures also 
were voted down in Massachusetts, Ohio and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minnesota, voters responding to the question were split, 50-50, on a 
Canterbury Downs-backed proposal to establish off-track wagering, but since 
unmarked votes are counted as negative responses, the measure was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Charles Town announced that the track would apply for no 1995 
racing dates and is for sale after West Virginia voters disapproved a proposal 
that would have allowed video gambling terminals at the track.

NOTRE DAME SAILS, GARNERS LEAGUE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notre Dame High used four Chris Sailer field goals and two Troy Garner 
interception returns for touchdowns to blow Chaminade off the field Friday 
night and capture the Mission League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-8 victory was never in doubt and left the Knights milling in front of a 
packed grandstand, their index fingers held aloft for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame clinched the title by rarely allowing Chaminade tailback Jason 
Giovannettone to turn the corner on pitch plays and by preying on Eagle 
quarterback Tom Racius. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing a 4-3 set and forcing everything inside," said Garner, who 
had three interceptions, returning two of them for scores of 96 and 27 yards. 
"We got a great pass rush and I was looking for a few picks." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame received Sailer field goals of 48, 43 and 27 yards on three of its 
first four drives and led, 9-0, early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been more, but Garner fumbled on the Chaminade 10-yard line 
after rambling 32 yards on a reverse. Chaminade's Dino Dinielli recovered but 
the Eagles' could move only 12 yards in six plays before Garner intercepted a 
pass by Racius, setting up Sailer's second field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 With two minutes to play in the half, Notre Dame put the game away when Robbie 
Brewster caught a 48-yard touchdown from Ryan Bowne. Bowne connected with 
Garner for the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade then mounted an 11-play drive that ended at the Knights' nine when 
Garner picked off a Racius pass in the flat and sprinted 96 yards for a 
touchdown. Sailer's conversion gave Notre Dame a 24-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowne completed 10 of 15 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. Tailback John 
Garcia gained 60 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Racius completed 11 of 26 passes for 90 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Giovannettone ran for 133 yards in 10 carries and scored the Eagles' lone 
touchdown late in the game on a 61-yard burst against Notre Dame's 
second-string defense.

NORTHRIDGE HURTING ITS OWN CAUSE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BOYCOTT PLACES EMBATTLED 
PROGRAM IN FURTHER DANGER OF BEING ELIMINATED TO EASE SCHOOL'S BUDGET CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the court of opinion, the Cal State Northridge football team isn't making 
any points in its quest to survive the budgetary knife, Athletic Director Bob 
Hiegert said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-field problems that have plagued the team this fall might ultimately 
be a factor when the school's looming athletic budget deficit is addressed with 
senior school administrators before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The football team could face elimination under at least one budget scenario 
for 1995-96, and the negative publicity hasn't exactly engendered support in 
the community or on campus, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actions of the team and some of its members aren't helping people look 
favorably upon the program's future," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a season marked by controversy, the team suffered another black eye when 16 
players boycotted practice Tuesday. The players returned the following day and 
none were suspended. Coach Bob Burt declined to reveal the reasons for the 
boycott or the resulting disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Players also staged a boycott of practice last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are understandably not helping their own cause," Hiegert said. "You hope 
that a decision on football won't be made based on those people's actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout is merely the latest hurdle for Burt, whose team is 3-5 and has 
lost three in a row heading into today's game against Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Northridge came under scrutiny when starting offensive 
lineman Jonathan Beauregard was charged with two counts of attempted murder. In 
a decision that caused considerable backlash, Northridge declined to suspend 
Beauregard, who is out on bail and continues to play. 
</P>
<P>
 When a controversial athletics fee referendum was defeated by student vote 
last month, players removed the Matador logos from their helmets and announced 
they were playing for themselves. The action took place before a homecoming 
crowd that included President Blenda J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to the latest setback, Burt said he would decide shortly before 
the game whether the 16 who boycotted would be allowed to play. Hiegert said he 
would not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm watching the whole thing and I have my own opinion on how it should be 
handled, but the course of action he's taking is well within his jurisdiction 
as coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, in his ninth season at Northridge, said he has grown weary of the 
negative publicity -- and his actions support his words. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt exploded angrily Wednesday, accusing reporters of "invading the privacy 
of my family." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a frustrating deal for a lot of folks," Hiegert said. "Athletics 
are not for the weak of heart."

TWIN TOWERS BRACE MOORPARK TITLE HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are back together, after a brief separation, and Nick and Paul Foster 
couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes double for Al Nordquist, men's basketball coach at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped to get them out of high school," Nordquist said. "When they 
decided to come back, I thought it was great." 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than a year, but Nordquist finally got his men. One at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 twins led Thousand Oaks High to three consecutive Marmonte League 
championships and to the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in 1992-93, 
their senior season. Paul was Marmonte player of the year that season and Nick 
was an all-league selection. 
</P>
<P>
 They received appointments to the Air Force Academy but their stay in Colorado 
Springs was short. They left only two months into their freshman year in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the place I wanted to be in," Nick said. "I went there for 
basketball but I found it was the wrong reason. The academy is for people who 
are into the military." 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned home, Paul enrolled at Moorpark and Nick at Ventura. Nick, 
who at 225 pounds is about 10 pounds heavier than his brother, redshirted with 
the Pirates last season but Paul averaged 19.9 points and 9.5 rebounds at 
Moorpark. He was named to the All-Western State Conference North Division team 
after helping the Raiders finish second in the division behind Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Nick decided to play at Moorpark for several reasons. One was to 
avoid the commute to Ventura and another was to rejoin his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure we'll go to different schools (after junior college) so I wanted to 
play with him again," Nick said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. On Thursday, Paul signed a letter of intent to play at UC Irvine 
next season. But for now, they'll wear the same uniform once more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are used to playing together, so I'm looking forward to it," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for Nordquist, the only men's basketball coach in Moorpark's history. 
Now in his 28th season with the Raiders, Nordquist has a talented cast that 
could halt Ventura's streak of eight consecutive North Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were 24-9 last season and won 10 consecutive games during one 
stretch. They reached the second round of the Southern California regional and 
Nordquist hopes a little extra muscle will take them farther this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside, we are going to be very physical and skilled around the basket," 
Nordquist said. Along with the Fosters, the Raider front line features 6-5 
sophomore forward Rod Stinson, who was mostly a backup last season, and Brady 
Mertes, a 6-8 freshman forward from Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 Returnees Jaime Jaquez, a 6-2 point guard, and 6-3 Jim Harbour will handle the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is relative to what other people have, so we need a few games to 
tell us what we are like," Nordquist said. "But we have good players." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordquist is looking for the Fosters to contribute greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play very well together," Nordquist said. "Paul is a better player 
coming from the outside in. He penetrates well. Nick is a better defensive 
player. They sort of complement each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown on the other local teams: CANYONS 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Lee Smelser, 26th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 15-17 
</P>
<P>
 After winning only one of their first eight games last season, the Cougars 
improved gradually and won the South Division of the Western State Conference 
with an 8-2 record, one game ahead of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Smelser anticipates another slow start for the Cougars but is not sure how 
well this club will recover. The team has only two returnees, forwards Kwesi 
Fulton and Les Sweet, to blend with six freshmen and several sophomores who 
haven't played competitively for a few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be one of our growing pains, trying to get those people 
playing as a unit," Smelser said. "It's causing me a lot of concern. We are 
going to suffer a little bit if we don't get things together quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton, who averaged 14.3 points and 6.0 rebounds in the regular season, will 
start on the front line with Norris Dorsey, Randy Roa or Marcus Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, from North Hollywood High, sat out last season and Miller played at 
Canyon High. Roa averaged 11.9 points at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Malik Clark, who played at Birmingham High a few years ago, will be 
the point guard and freshman James Manning from Canyon or sophomore Steve 
Tampus from Saugus will take over at off-guard for Randy Eason. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason, now at Concordia College in Portland, led Canyons in scoring in the 
1993-94 regular season with an 18.7-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 At center, the Cougars have Marrcel Crain, a 6-7 1/2 transfer from East L.A. 
GLENDALE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Brian Beauchemin, 16th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 15-15 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchemin thought the Vaqueros were ready for a competitive season when he 
got word three days ago that sophomore forward Mike Wright was leaving the team 
and freshman guard Eric Scott has a heart murmur and his status is up in the 
air. Wright, who scored 193 points and had 101 rebounds despite missing 11 
games last season because of injuries, was commuting to Glendale from Upland 
and told Beauchemin he is moving to Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to play bad enough, you find a way to play," Beauchemin said. 
"(Wright) has more problems than Dick Tracy. My program will survive without 
him, but now we've got to make adjustments and it's not fair to the other 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchemin said Scott, an All-City player from Dorsey High, is undergoing 
tests and the results won't be available until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, who finished 6-4 and tied for third with Santa Monica in the WSC 
North Division last season, now will look to veterans Maurice Sowells, Charlie 
Garcia and Maurice McIntosh to help Glendale reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sowells, a 6-5 swingman from Lakewood High, averaged 8.9 points and 4.2 
assists last year. Garcia, a 6-4 center from Eagle Rock High, and McIntosh, a 
5-11 guard from Monroe High, were reserves. OXNARD 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Ron McClurkin, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 12-18 
</P>
<P>
 The Condors got a new coach last season and this season they move into their 
new on-campus gym after playing home games at Santa Clara High for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under McClurkin, WSC North Division coach of the year in 1993-94, the Condors 
started 3-0 in the division before losing their last five. They reached the 
Southern California regional but were eliminated in the first round by L.A. 
City, 102-77. 
</P>
<P>
 With only four returning players and seven freshmen, they will have their 
hands full this season in the division against heavyweights Cuesta, Moorpark 
and Ventura. McClurkin, however, has several top recruits who he believes will 
help the Condors match up with those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a little more talent and we are a little more athletic than last 
year," McClurkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key recruits are 6-2 guard Anthony Talley from Dayton, Ohio, a 
Street & Smith preseason high school All-American last season; 6-6 power 
forward Amiri Johnson, a redshirt transfer from Lassen, and 6-6 power forward 
Brandon Lee from Glendora High. 
</P>
<P>
 The returnees include forward Larry Reed, who averaged 10.7 points in division 
play; Jerome Archie, a 6-10 center, and Israel Fuentes, a 6-7 forward. VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Doug Michelson, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 11-19 
</P>
<P>
 Two All-WSC South Division players, wings Kenyth Henry and Craig Griffin, 
return on a squad that features 12 freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole front line is being restructured," said Michelson, who took over 
the men's team last year after six seasons with the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for the two post positions are 6-7 Vernon Simmons from Simi Valley 
High, 6-5 Ricky Steele from Taft High, 6-6 LaMarr Thompson from Sylmar High and 
6-5 Jerome Elliot from San Fernando High. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson averaged 18.2 points, 9.9 rebounds and 4.2 blocks last season and 
Steele averaged 17.8 points and 9.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman point guard Vernard Harris from Ferndale High in Detroit will direct 
Michelson's up-tempo offense. Freshman Mack Cleveland and sophomore John 
Sanders, both from Chicago, are battling Griffin and Henry at the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pushing our veterans very hard," Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, from Simi Valley, averaged 15.5 points and 3.8 assists last season. 
He was sixth in the conference in field-goal percentage at 49.4% (157 of 318). 
Henry, from El Camino Real High, averaged 12.0 points and 6.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (3-7) finished fifth in the South Division last season. VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Philip Mathews, 10th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 36-3 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of one reserve, every player who helped Ventura reach the 
state final the past two seasons is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pirates, who have won eight consecutive North Division titles in the 
WSC, haven't exactly run dry on talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be quick, we'll rebound and we'll be able to shoot," Mathews said. "The 
only thing that's lacking is the experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who oversees one of the most successful junior college basketball 
programs in California, will redeploy his trademark "Orange and Black" units 
after a one-year hiatus. Each unit of five players takes turns on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Mathews plans to play defense, they will need the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to press the whole time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said the Orange unit will feature five freshmen from out of state -- 
Rafer Alston, a 6-1 point guard from New York; wings Shannon Taylor from Fresno 
and Gerald Zimmerman from Lakeland, Fla., and forwards Hakeen Ward from 
Passaic, N.J., and Curtis Gaines from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black unit will have Jamal Cobbs at point guard, Lance Fay at off-guard 
and forwards Charles Woodard, Damien Cantrell and Kenny Washington, son of the 
former UCLA guard of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay redshirted last season after averaging 16.1 points at Oxnard College in 
1992-93. Cantrell averaged 22.5 points and 8.4 rebounds at Santa Clara High and 
Woodard averaged 20.6 points and 9.3 rebounds at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, ranked sixth in the state preseason poll, has won 30 or more games in 
four consecutive seasons. ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Newton Chelette, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 20-12 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders finished second in the Foothill Conference last season at 12-4, 
four games behind Chaffey, but they won't have to contend this season with the 
Panthers, who some observers have picked to win the state title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill Conference has split into two divisions, with Antelope Valley in 
the North along with Barstow, Victor Valley, Desert and Cerro Coso, which moved 
from the Southern California Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey will be in the South Division along with San Bernardino Valley, 
Citrus, Mt. San Jacinto and Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
 In a season when Chelette has only two sophomores, the new alignment is like a 
gift for the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey is loaded. The Panthers, ranked third in the state preseason poll, 
have former USC center Avondre Jones along with returning forward Warren 
Rosegreen (14.7 rebounds per game) and guard Robin Kennedy (11.0 points per 
game). 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders, however, are not as experienced but Chelette said he is happy 
with the team's depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good size (four players 6-6 or taller) and we can score outside or 
inside," Chelette said. "I think the team is going to be good, but later in the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Troy Coutee (5.7 assists per game) and guard Orville Turner (21.1 
points) are the only returnees. Chelette said Waraire Boswell, from Pasadena 
Muir High, Bryan Crittenden from Rancho High in Las Vegas and Michael Collins, 
a member of the Panamanian national junior team, will start along the front 
line.

LOYOLA SHUTS OFF CRESPI AT THE PASS, 21-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night when it was tough enough keeping warm, Loyola High cooled off 
Crespi's red-hot passing attack by controlling the clock in a 21-7 Del Rey 
League victory Friday night at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a workhorse performance by junior tailback Mike Vanis, the Cubs kept 
the ball on the ground and the Celts' offense on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanis rushed for a game-high 156 yards in 35 carries -- 25 in the second half 
-- and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory pulled Loyola (7-2, 3-2 in league play) into a second-place tie 
with Crespi (5-5, 3-2). But with the victory -- the Cubs' eighth in a row over 
Crespi -- Loyola earned the league's No. 2 playoff berth behind Bishop Amat. 
Crespi also qualified for the playoffs as the league's third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when we've had a guy run 35 times," Loyola Coach Steve Grady 
said. "But we thought that if we could run the ball and chew up the clock, that 
would keep their explosive offense off the field. Our offensive line did a 
tremendous job." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi quarterback Dave Lins, who entered the game third among area passing 
leaders with 1,732 yards, finished with 18 completions in 36 attempts for 151 
yards and a touchdown. However, Lins was limited to only three series in the 
second half, two of which did not yield first downs and ended with 
interceptions. Lins threw only 10 passes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanis spearheaded second-half drives of 13 and 17 plays by Loyola. The 
5-foot-10, 174-pounder, who logged as many as seven consecutive carries, capped 
the second march of 80 yards with a three-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanis also scored on a three-yard sweep with 16 seconds left in the first half 
to give Loyola a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sure was slippery tonight," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. "We had a heck of 
a time tackling him." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi demonstrated some ball control of its own on the game's opening march, 
driving from its 20 to the Cubs' 20 in 12 plays. However, the drive went for 
naught when Greg Boskin's 37-yard field goal attempt was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Loyola took a 6-0 lead on a 69-yard touchdown pass play 
from Kyle Spielbuehler to Mark McDonald. The extra-point attempt was blocked. 
Spielbuehler finished eight of 16 for 192 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi marched 45 yards in eight plays to take a 7-6 lead early in the second 
quarter on Lins' 23-yard pass to Marcos Solorzano, who had nine receptions for 
90 yards.

SYLMAR, RESEDA EARN TOP SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite several disparaging remarks by rival football coaches about the 
strength -- or weakness -- of the competition in the Valley Pac-8 Conference, 
Sylmar and Reseda highs were seeded first in the City Section 4-A and 3-A 
division brackets at the football playoff seeding meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the conclusion of the regular season, six coaches -- one 
from each City conference -- and an athletic director met near downtown Los 
Angeles to determine which of the City's 49 teams would make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a second-place finish in league play guaranteed a berth. Not so 
this year. The committee of seven not only determined who made the playoffs, 
they also decided in what division each team would play -- in some cases 
regardless of a team's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (10-0), the only undefeated team in the City, is seeded No. 1 in the 
4-A for the third year in a row and will face University in the first round. 
The Spartans were top-seeded in 1992 when they beat Carson, 17-0, in the 
championship game. Sylmar lost to Carson, 22-21, in a semifinal game in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda (7-3), which finished second in the Valley Pac-8 at 6-1, requested and 
was granted a 3-A berth and will play Birmingham in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 By old standards, Reseda would have been placed in the 4-A based on its finish 
in conference play. Ditto for Wilson (8-2), which finished second to Franklin 
at 6-1 in the Northern Conference. Wilson also requested and was granted a 3-A 
berth and will play Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft (9-1), which went undefeated in Northwest Valley Conference play, was 
seeded second in the 4-A for the second consecutive year and is one of seven 
conference teams that earned playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Valley teams in the 4-A are Granada Hills (seeded 10th), San Fernando 
(13th) and Kennedy (14th). In the 3-A are Monroe (eighth), Cleveland (10th), 
Van Nuys (11th), Chatsworth (13th) and Birmingham (16th). 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions were mixed regarding the new playoff format, which emphasized 
strength of conference and preseason schedule rather than final conference 
record. Those criteria did not bode well for North Hollywood Coach Gary Gray, 
the Valley Pac-8 representative at the meeting who watched his Huskies' playoff 
bid get voted down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought a win (Thursday) would get us into the playoffs," said Gray, one 
of seven voting members on the coaches' committee.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got the best 16 teams in the 4-A, but I'm very disappointed with 
the 3-A." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the No. 1 berths for Sylmar and Reseda, the Valley Pac-8 took it on 
the chin. Of the six conferences in the City, only the Coastal and Valley Pac-8 
sent as few as four teams to the playoffs. The Southern Pacific matched the 
Northwest Valley with seven playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 32 teams earning playoff berths had worse conference records than 
North Hollywood (3-7), which finished 3-4 in Valley Pac-8 play. Birmingham 
(4-5-1), which won its first Northwest Valley Conference game Thursday, earned 
a playoff berth in the 3-A, despite its dismal 1-5-1 conference record and 
seventh-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the system is not perfect. Already several coaches have knocked the 
format. But for the time being, this is the system in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a good system," said Lee Joseph, consultant for the City 
football playoffs. "Basically this system, which is not a polished system, 
allows us more flexibility and input. We're not locked into a certain amount of 
rules. This is not concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood earned playoff berths the past two seasons with two conference 
victories. But with the new playoff format, North Hollywood's preconference 
losses to two 4-A playoff teams might have cost the team a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the case, I wouldn't have scheduled a Franklin or a Kennedy (in the 
preseason)," Gray said. "I learned my lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is trying to explain this to 50 football players. They'll 
be very disappointed."

HUENEME FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO BE PUNISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Miller, Hueneme High's first-year football coach, promises stiff 
punishment for members of his team following a brawl during the post-game 
handshake of Thursday's season-ending game against Dos Pueblos at Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in the final minute of the game, two Hueneme players fought among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Miller said he will recommend that at least two Hueneme players be 
suspended from school for an undetermined amount of time. One of those players 
will face a possible ban from Hueneme athletics for the rest of the academic 
year, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a stand against this," said Miller, whose team lost the 
Channel League game, 35-28. "We're trying to turn this (program) around and we 
don't want opposing teams or fans to think they can't feel safe at our football 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller estimated the scuffle lasted only three to four minutes, but added that 
"in a situation like that even a minute or two seems like an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller admitted there was talk among Hueneme players of starting a fight 
before the team even took the field. However, Miller said his players told him 
the postgame fight began when a Dos Pueblos player punched Vikings in their 
stomachs while in the handshake line. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller added that coaches and administrators from the schools separated the 
players, and that a police cruiser drove up and down the field to ensure no 
further hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the fight, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really just a big shoving match. How much can you do with equipment 
on?" Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 50 seconds left in the game, Hueneme's Mike Baker and Vainku Solloway 
were escorted from the field by officials for arguing among themselves, and the 
two seniors continued to fight on the sidelines, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller expressed relief that certain senior members of his team will not 
return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed . . . but the guys involved were seniors from a 
different regime," he said. "We expected them to be leaders and it didn't work 
out, so we're glad they're leaving. We're going to hold them up and make 
examples of them."

 Arcadia 21, Crescenta Valley 14 -- Jon Shepherd helped host Arcadia (8-2, 3-2) 
clinch a playoff berth when he intercepted a pass on the Arcadia 37-yard line 
with 1:31 to play to preserve the victory. Shepherd also rushed for 189 yards 
and one touchdown in 32 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-yard touchdown run by Ryan Baderian early in the second quarter gave the 
Apaches a 21-0 lead. They scored earlier on a seven-yard run by Shephard and a 
nine-yard touchdown pass from Jason Wagner to Jamall Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (6-4, 1-4) battled back when linebacker Rocky Barbaro picked off a 
pass by Wagner and ran 57 yards for a touchdown. After Arcadia was forced to 
punt on its ensuing possession, Jon Watts hit Jose Escalero with a 25-yard 
touchdown pass play to cut the deficit to 21-14 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley's Chris Hedrick rushed for 66 yards in 14 carries. Watts

ANTELOPE VALLEY USES SHORTCUT TO WIN TITLE; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: PAIR OF 
SHORT-YARDAGE PLAYS PIVOTAL IN ANTELOPES' 27-3 VICTORY OVER QUARTZ HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Antelope Valley High reflects on how it obtained sole possession of the 
Golden League football championship, the team can point to a pair of crucial 
short-yardage plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill trailed by four points midway through the third quarter and drove 
to the Antelope 30-yard line. But on fourth and one, fullback Brian Pereira was 
stuffed by Caleb Smith and Sean Cartaya for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Antelope Valley faced third and one. Tailback Jermaine 
Lewis took the handoff, bounced off a tackler and raced 60 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays broke open a close game and allowed Antelope Valley to pull away 
with a 27-3 victory Friday night. The Antelopes finished the regular season 
7-2, 5-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth-down play was totally our turning point," Antelope Valley 
defensive lineman Chad Shrout said. "We just decided we weren't going to allow 
them any more yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill (5-3-2, 2-2-1) qualified for the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs because Ridgecrest Burroughs defeated Highland Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 On Antelope Valley's next possession after Lewis' scoring run, five 
consecutive plays from a full-house backfield gained big chunks of yardage 
before quarterback Trymon Redick scored on a 10-yard run to make it 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels were held without a first down the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (full-house backfield) was a formation we were saving to use against 
Quartz Hill," Lewis said. "We ran it a lot and it was working so we kept with 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Lewis added a 11-yard run late in the game to cap the scoring. He finished 
with 181 yards and three touchdowns in 23 carries. Redick added 78 yards in six 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill played without leading rusher Jeremiah Harris, who was suspended 
for the game. Jeff Diamond finished with 50 yards in 17 carries. Pereira had 48 
yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-yard pass from Jeff Diamond to James Welch on a halfback option set up a 
32-yard field goal by Diamond midway through the second quarter for Quartz 
Hill's only score.

KENNEDY WEAKENED FOR PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kennedy High will not have the services of its top receiver for the City 
Section 4-A Division football playoffs, and the status of injured tailback 
Antwane Smith will not be determined until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore wide receiver Aaron Lewis and senior defensive back Ladell Shuler 
did not suit up in Kennedy's 32-12 loss to Taft Thursday night because of 
disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who had 27 receptions for 359 yards and five touchdowns this season, 
will not return to the team and Shuler's status will be determined next week, 
according to Golden Cougar Coach Bob Francola. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a junior who has rushed for 1,486 yards and scored 23 touchdowns, 
strained his left knee against Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the doctor (Friday) and he said I just stretched a ligament," 
Smith said. "I'll just do some easy running in practice next week and see how 
it feels." JOHN ORTEGA

 Running back Chris Azzinaro rushed for two touchdowns and quarterback Tim 
Bennett threw for another score as Simi Valley High upset rival Royal, 21-16, 
in a Marmonte League finale before 7,500 Friday night at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a three-game losing skid and kept Simi Valley (6-3-1, 4-3) 
in the hunt for an at-large berth in the Division III playoffs.Royal (7-3, 
5-2), the league's second-place team, already had clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Azzinaro rushed 14 times for 84 yards, scoring on runs of eight and 27 yards. 
Bennett completed nine of 21 passes for 155 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley led throughout the game. Azzinaro's first touchdown and a 35-yard 
scoring reception by J.J. Washington (three catches, 74 yards) staked the 
Pioneers to a 14-0 lead late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Broussard had a 99-yard kickoff return after Simi Valley's second 
touchdown to pull Royal within 14-7. The Pioneers, however, scored on their 
opening possession of the third quarter to extend their lead to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal moved to within 21-14 at the start of the fourth quarter, and Azzinaro 
was tackled in the end zone for a safety to make it 21-16 with 6 minutes 10 
seconds to play. But the Highlanders were unable to convert on their final 
possession, stalling at the Simi Valley 39 when Wes Lagatta's pass to Chris 
Fernandez was knocked down near the goal line by Robert Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagatta completed 17 of 33 passes for 184 yards with one interception. Junior 
receiver Brendan Gibson caught 10 passes for 90 yards. LAUREN PETERSON

VILLAGE CHRISTIAN, BRACHE KEEP PRIORITIES STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Village Christian football Coach Mike Plaisance has listed the priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 First, win the game. Then give kicker Ignacio Brache a chance to set a state 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now our objective is to win the Alpha League title," Plaisance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian can clinch the title outright with a victory tonight over 
L.A. Baptist in a league finale at 7:30 p.m. at Alemany High. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hanging in the balance are a couple of state kicking records. Brache this 
season has converted 13 field goals -- seven from 50 yards or more -- and is 
within reach of career and season records. Three more field goals would tie the 
season mark of 16, five more would tie the career mark of 33. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders (6-3) are 4-0 in league play. Kilpatrick and L.A. Baptist are 
each 3-1. If L.A. Baptist (3-6) beats Village Christian, and Kilpatrick (7-2) 
defeats Marshall Fundamental tonight, there will be a three-way tie for first 
place. Should that scenario play out, the league representative will draw out 
of a hat the school which will receive the league's top spot in the Southern 
Section Division X playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plaisance vows the hat trick won't be necessary. "We're going to win," he 
said. "We are not the same ballclub we were at the beginning of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 After posting a shutout over Santa Paula in their opener, the Crusaders lost 
consecutive games to Morro Bay, Mojave and Orange Lutheran. The Crusaders' 
resurgence in league play has been the result of solid defense. Since the 
Orange Lutheran loss, the Crusader defense has allowed only one touchdown a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Village Christian will be without running back Jake Funk, who 
suffered a sprained ankle two weeks ago. Brother Aaron Funk and Enrique Borja 
must pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist, the defending Division X champion, has rebounded from a dismal 
start. The Knights lost their first five games but their recent success centers 
on running back Chris Ross, who has rushed for 753 yards in 150 carries.

 St. John Bosco 17, Alemany 14 -- Richard Williams drilled a 29-yard field goal 
with 1:43 remaining to give St. John Bosco the victory and keep the Braves' 
playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (1-7-2, 0-5) tried a last-ditch comeback, but St. John Bosco 
linebacker Vincent Vigil sacked Alemany quarterback Danny Arguella at the 
Braves 27-yard line on the final play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Bosco (5-5, 2-3) jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter on a 
25-yard touchdown run by Ryan Williams and Chad Carpenter's 25-yard 
interception return. But the Indians stormed back in the second quarter aided 
by two St. John Bosco fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany linebacker Gus Lira forced and recovered a fumble at the St. John 
Bosco 20, and the Indians capitalized with a 28-yard touchdown pass from 
Arguella to B.C. Andreasen. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, linebacker Steve Hill recovered a fumble at the St. John 
Bosco 37 that set up a one-yard touchdown run by running back Gus Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguella completed eight of 17 for 141 yards for Alemany, but was sacked six 
times. PETER YOON

 Santa Barbara 43, Rio Mesa 6 -- Running back Kahlid Hurst's 94-yard touchdown 
run on Santa Barbara's first play from scrimmage set the pace for the route at 
Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst scored two more times on runs of 13 and six yards, and finished with 253 
yards in 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone bright spot for the Spartans (1-9, 1-6) came early in the fourth 
quarter when quarterback Farhaad Azimi hit Randy Hurt down the sideline for 27 
yards to the Don five-yard line. Running back Rashad Rose scored on the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Santa Barbara (6-3-1, 4-2-1) a chance at a possible at-large 
playoff berth. JASON SANDS

 The Master's College will start four sophomores and two juniors tonight 
against Southern California College in a National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Far West regional volleyball match. 
</P>
<P>
 But that won't stop Mustang women's volleyball Coach Dean Cronk from counting 
on his team's experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (27-12), seeded fourth, have played more matches this season than 
any team in the regional. Southern California College (17-10), which defeated 
the Mustangs earlier, is seeded fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like having experience," Conk said. "A lot of our early 
matches were in tournaments but it was something we needed. I hope to draw off 
that tonight."

CAL LUTHERAN EXPERIENCES FIRST NCAA PLAYOFF VICTORY; VOLLEYBALL: YOUNG REGALS 
DEFEAT OCCIDENTAL IN FIVE GAMES IN WEST REGIONAL AT SAN DIEGO.

 If the players on the Cal Lutheran women's volleyball team were nervous, it 
was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 They were playing in an NCAA Division III West Regional for the first time and 
there isn't a senior on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Regals overcame early jitters to defeat Occidental, 5-15, 15-9, 
14-16, 15-9, 15-9, in a first-round match Friday night at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (20-8) plays tonight against the the winner of Friday's late 
match between second-ranked UC San Diego and Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 As the score reflects, things didn't start well for the Regals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nerves were there," Cal Lutheran Coach James Park said. "Oxy had been in 
the tournament (the past three years) and there was a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 4-0, in the second game, the Regals finally began to click. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior captain Darcy White epitomized the team's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who had no kills in the first game, had eight in the fourth game and 
five in the fifth, including match point. She finished with a team high 20.  
</P>
<P>
 Freshman setter Liz Martinez had 42 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 During Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference play, the 
Regals split two matches with the Tigers (20-6), both of which also lasted five 
games.

<P>
 The Master's College and Westmont have been in this situation before.For the 
fifth time in six seasons, the teams will meet in the final of the National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Far West Regional soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of today's 1:30 p.m. match at Westmont advances to the NAIA 
Division I national finals at Mobile, Ala., later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont is ranked third and Master's 17th in the NAIA poll. Earlier this 
season, Westmont defeated Master's, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's has played only twice since Oct. 22. The Mustangs defeated 
Christian Heritage, 6-0, to gain a berth the regional final, and played a 
scoreless tie with Cal State Northridge.

MILLER'S SORE KNEE HOLDS KEY FOR CSUN RUNNERS AT REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ready or not, the Cal State Northridge women's cross-country team will compete 
today in the NCAA Region VIII championships at Randolph Golf Course in Tucson, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 A top-10 finish has been Northridge's goal since the start of the season, but 
that seems unlikely because of a nagging knee injury to junior Lori Miller.The 
top two teams will advance to the NCAA championships in Fayetteville, Ark., on 
Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was one of Northridge's top two runners during the first three meets of 
the season before missing the Arizona State and Cal Poly Pomona invitationals. 
She was Northridge's No. 4 runner -- finishing ninth overall -- in the American 
West Conference championships Oct. 29, but has been limited to light workouts 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Lori was totally healthy, I think we would definitely be able to achieve 
our goal," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. "But I'm not so sure with the 
way things are." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's other top runners are freshman Jamie Whitmore and senior Jennifer 
Andrews. Whitmore finished fourth in the AWC championships and Andrews was 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brian Godsey, ninth in the AWC championships, will be the lone 
Northridge competitor in the men's race. Strametz did not enter a men's team 
after a disappointing season.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: OREGON DUCKS ROSE BOWL TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Players and coaches are ignoring two words that have popped into the football 
vocabulary in Eugene, Ore.: 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 To Oregon, who is in a three-way tie for first place in the Pacific 10 
Conference but is the only school that can control its destiny, Rose and Bowl 
are a couple of four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk about the Rose Bowl around here," said backup strong safety 
Jaiya Figueras, a redshirt freshman from Glendale High. "We don't even say the 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon hasn't played in the Rose Bowl since a 10-7 loss to Ohio State in 1957. 
The Ducks have finished with a winning record only 11 times in the ensuing 36 
seasons, none since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to blame the players and staff for their subdued attitude, despite 
Oregon (7-3, 5-1 in Pac-10 play) having defeated both USC (5-1) and Arizona 
(5-1), its main competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Ducks face losing teams in Stanford (3-5-1, 2-4) and Oregon 
State (3-6, 1-5) in their final two games. A Rose Bowl berth seems attainable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here's hyped up," said sophomore Christian Anderson, a reserve 
tight end from Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many fans. It's funny. When we went to SC, the little 
corner of the end zone wasn't filled with our fans. Now I hear they've bought 
all their seats for our game at Stanford and they're calling up for more." 
</P>
<P>
 The hoopla amuses Figueras, who has been a strong special teams performer 
while backing up Chad Cota, who is considered the Pac-10's best strong safety. 
At the beginning of the season, Figueras noted, the student store sold a shirt 
that stated 10 things that will never happen at Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 On the list was the Ducks making the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our own school, man," Figueras said. "The same fans who'll want to tear 
down the goal posts wanted to flush us down the toilet after Utah and Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 After opening the season with a 58-16 blowout of Portland State, the Ducks 
suffered consecutive defeats to Western Athletic Conference teams, losing to 
Hawaii, 36-16, and Utah, 36-14, before winning six of seven. Figueras, who has 
made six tackles on special teams, would like to have a bigger role in Oregon's 
success. But he won't unseat Cota, who has two interceptions and 80 tackles, 
second on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson sees action when Oregon uses double tight-end formations. He has 
three receptions for 36 yards, all coming in a Pac-10-opening 22-7 upset of USC 
at the Coliseum on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about catching the ball," Anderson said. "I like to concentrate 
on my blocking. That's what I'm best at. When you spring someone loose and 
knock a guy on his butt, it's a good feeling. A good block is equivalent to 
scoring a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's first three college receptions, against USC, were not as memorable 
as a block that helped Dino Philyaw score on a 49-yard run that gave the Ducks 
a 10-0 lead. Anderson made his block on the linebacker then headed diagonally 
up field as Philyaw broke through the line. "Dino ran behind me for about 30 
yards before I got the safety inside the 10," Anderson said. "I'd rather do 
that than score a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson will talk about making blocks, but he doesn't want to talk about the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we're thinking about is we control our own destiny," he said. 
"We've got two extremely tough games the next two weeks. Nobody thinks we're 
gliding through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, which plays its final two games on the road, has lost its past three 
games against Stanford in Palo Alto. Against rival Oregon State, the Ducks are 
3-3 the past six meetings with their three victories decided by three, three 
and seven points. "By the way (Oregon State) acts, you wouldn't know they're at 
the bottom of the Pac-10," Anderson said. "They go all-out. My freshman year in 
Corvallis, you could just feel the intensity on the field." 
</P>

 Bernardi blues: UCLA needs to win its final two games at Arizona State and at 
home against USC to finish 5-6. The disappointing season has put a damper on 
Gary Bernardi's return to the college ranks. But Bernardi, who coaches tight 
ends and the offensive line, has been there before. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Bernardi coached a USC team that finished 3-8, partly because of 
injuries. This year, three starting Bruin offensive linemen suffered 
season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the offensive line, you want to be able to develop a situation where the 
players are a little older and more mature," said Bernardi, who coached last 
year at Burroughs High. "We haven't had that luxury. The kids have played real 
hard and done the best job they could. "There's more than one reason for the 
losses. There's a hundred reasons, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 In his only season at Burroughs, Bernardi inherited a team that was 0-10 and 
finished 5-6.

HUGHES SCRAPS PLANS TO MOVE UNIT TO ARIZONA; INDUSTRY: ABOUT 1,000 WORKERS WILL 
REMAIN IN FULLERTON WHILE HUNDREDS WILL WORK IN EL SEGUNDO AND LONG BEACH.

 Hughes Aircraft, releasing further details about the closing of its local 
electronics manufacturing operations, revealed Friday that it has abandoned its 
initial plan to move a major division and 350 workers to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesman Dan Reeder said the company decided against moving the naval 
weapon systems division to Arizona because that would have made its work harder 
to coordinate with Hughes' other Navy contracts, now handled in Long Beach and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the unit expressed relief on learning that their jobs will stay 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a long commute," said Allison Lengele, who works as a contracts 
manager for the group and will be transferred to Long Beach. "But when you have 
been hearing Tucson for so long, any place in California sounds good." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement also ended weeks of unsettling speculation among employees 
about their fate. "We heard last week that they were considering putting us in 
Canoga Park," Lengele said. "I am just glad the waiting game is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes announced in September that it would close most of the Fullerton plant, 
lay off 800 to 1,000 of its 6,800 employees and sell most of the 350-acre site, 
considered prime residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The company confirmed Friday that it will keep 1,000 employees in Fullerton at 
the information systems division, which develops software. The rest of the 
5,800 employees were notified in a newsletter distributed Friday morning where 
their jobs will be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar and communications units and their 800 workers will move to Hughes' 
El Segundo facility, the company said. The weapons systems division will be 
shifted to Long Beach, affecting about 400 people; the manufacturing division, 
with almost 800 workers, will be split among El Segundo, Long Beach and a 
Hughes plant in Forest, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 2,800 workers will be transferred to other Hughes facilities 
across Southern California. Hughes also confirmed that it will move about 100 
senior managers and support staff companywide to Washington, where other Hughes 
divisions have offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that most of the remaining jobs are staying in Southern California 
was one bright spot in an otherwise hard-luck economic story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving a job to Long Beach and El Segundo just means a longer commute for a 
lot of people who could now keep a home in Orange County," said Esmael Adibi, 
an economist at Chapman University in Orange. "It will show up in the county's 
payroll employment, but it's not as much of an income loss as it would have 
been for the region." 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers announced Friday represented the culmination of plans drafted 
early this year when Hughes announced that it would merge its aerospace, 
defense, missile and systems groups. The consolidation reflected continuing 
efforts by Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp., to streamline its 
business in the wake of post-Cold War defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus-style Hughes facility, built 37 years ago in the hills of 
Fullerton, employed 15,000 workers at its peak in the mid-1980s.

NLRB WILL SEEK NEW UNION ELECTION AT VANS, FIRM SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casual footwear maker Vans Inc., which beat back a union campaign earlier this 
year, said Friday that it faces a new union election in the wake of a complaint 
to the National Labor Relations Board that it violated federal labor law while 
battling a Teamsters representation drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor board's chief attorney issued the allegations late Thursday and, 
Vans officials said, informed them that the general counsel's office will seek 
an order overturning the April election and setting a date for new balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the charges has been scheduled for April 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor board and Teamsters officials could not be reached Friday for comment 
because of the national Veterans Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the April election, Vans employees voted 718-432 to reject the Teamsters' 
effort to represent workers at the company's manufacturing plant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Teamsters Local 396 in Anaheim subsequently filed a spate of 
unfair labor practice charges against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig E. Gosselin, Vans' vice president and general counsel, said Friday that 
the labor board dismissed some complaints but ordered a hearing on allegations 
that Vans officials threatened to fire pro-union workers and to move the 
factory to Mexico if the union won. 
</P>
<P>
 "We maintain that these charges are without merit, but the NLRB disagrees, 
apparently taking the position that it will take a (hearing) judge to make a 
decision about who to believe and who not to believe," Gosselin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dismissed charges, Gosselin said, were union allegations that Vans 
officials tried to influence workers by instituting a pay increase in March, a 
month before the election; that a pro-union worker was fired for his union 
activities and that Vans set up a sham employee group to circulate anti-union 
petitions before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The union had campaigned for more than three months at Vans, which has 
operated as a non-union shop for all of its 28 years. A central issue in the 
campaign was the union's claim that Vans' workers, who are paid an average of 
$5.75 an hour, could not afford to make co-payments for the company-sponsored 
health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans officials said that a union victory could jeopardize the financial health 
of the company, which manufactures canvas shoes and other casual footwear that 
is sold in more than 30 countries.

Treaty Organization. The plant also built surface and anti-submarine radar

CHIRON'S SHARES RISE 20% ON NEWS OF POSSIBLE DEAL; PHARMACEUTICALS: ITS SHARE 
PRICE JUMPS $11.75 ON A REPORT THAT CIBA-GEIGY MIGHT BUY A STAKE IN THE 
BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRM.

<P>
 Chiron Corp.'s share price soared as much as 32% Friday after the 
Emeryville-based biotechnology company said it was discussing a possible deal 
for another company to acquire a "substantial" minority stake in Chiron. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock peaked at $79 in Nasdaq trading before closing at $71.50 -- up 
$11.75, or nearly 20% -- on speculation that the talks might lead to Chiron 
being taken over by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss pharmaceutical and chemicals firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that this could be a large minority stake now with an agreement 
to buy Chiron later," said David S. Webber, a New York-based analyst for Alex. 
Brown & Sons of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies each own 50% of vaccine makers Biocine Co. in the United 
States and Biocine in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron, whose products include the drug Betaseron used in the treatment of 
multiple sclerosis, declined to say whom it is negotiating with, or when or if 
a transaction will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been in discussions for a while," company spokesman Larry Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotech industry has been consolidating in recent months, in part because 
of the failures of some highly touted products and a shortage of money to 
invest in new product development. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some large traditional pharmaceutical firms have been looking to 
buy successful biotech businesses to strengthen their own product development. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron is a likely takeover prospect, analyst say, because it has products on 
the market and promising ones, such as a drug to treat AIDS-related problems, 
in development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said Chiron could be following the trend of biotech companies 
that seek out alliances with large pharmaceutical companies to ensure their 
products access to a large market. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large cash infusion and a strategic partner increase the probability to get 
their products on the market," said Steve Burrill, chief executive and managing 
director of Burrill and Craves, a San Francisco-based private merchant bank 
that focuses on biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, said David K. Stone, the Boston-based managing director 
and biotech analyst with Cowen & Co. of New York, is that Chiron is attempting 
to raise money to acquire more vaccine products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds more like Chiron would be selling stock to raise cash for a venture 
that would be beneficial to both (Chiron and Ciba-Geigy)," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiron agreed Thursday to buy tetanus and diphtheria vaccine product lines 
from American Home Products Corp.

FOUL WEATHER FRIENDS; SKI RESORT OPERATORS ACROSS STATE CHEERING EARLY STORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Early snowstorms have allowed ski resorts across California to open early this 
season, triggering optimism throughout the industry that this winter will be 
among the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some resorts opened as early as last Friday and another big snowstorm on 
Thursday prompted others to make plans to open this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Valley, a ski resort in San Bernardino County that usually follows the 
traditional Thanksgiving opening, was scheduled to open today. 
</P>
<P>
 Resort managers did not anticipate conditions for the season to get under way 
so soon, said Margie LaPorte, a Snow Valley sales manager. But after the area 
received 4 to 6 inches of snowfall Thursday, she said, "Phones have been 
ringing off the hook. . . . We are anticipating one of the best seasons in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Mountain, in California's eastern Sierra, opened Sunday and was 
blessed with an extra 18 inches of snow from Thursday's big storm, allowing the 
resort to also move up the opening of its advanced trails, said a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our earliest and strongest start since 1982," said Bob Roberts, 
executive director of the California Ski Industry Assn., a trade group 
representing California's 38 ski resorts. Advance bookings at resorts have been 
very strong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting goods stores also reported brisk sales this week of skiing equipment, 
and especially robust sales for snowboards. In the past three years, 
snowboarding has become an increasingly popular alternative to downhill skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Mountain spokeswoman Wendy Helgrud said the resort had about 3,000 
skiers on the slopes Friday. And it is expecting about 10,000 visitors for the 
Thanksgiving weekend, she said. Probably about a quarter of the visitors will 
be snowboarding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snowboarding is a trend that has grabbed ahold of the ski industry and is 
becoming more and more popular," said Charles Goeldner, an expert on the skiing 
industry, who is a professor of marketing at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowboarders are usually the first ones through the door to buy skiing 
equipment, because they only need a light amount of snow to hit the slopes, 
said Lars Wackenstedt, a ski equipment buyer for the Big 5 sporting goods 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the largest-growing segment of the winter sports category," 
Wackenstedt said. But traditional skiers and snowboarders have both been buying 
early this season because this is the best snow they've seen in several years, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mountain High, a ski resort in Moonridge near Big Bear that opened Nov. 4, 
has set aside a snowboard park to keep snowboarders away from traditional 
skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ski industry in California suffered in the late 1980s from six consecutive 
years of drought, said Roberts, but conditions improved in 1991. Snowfall has 
increased dramatically, with a record year in the 1992-1993 season, above 
average snowfall last year, and an exciting start this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasts suggest that the eastern Sierra will be getting many more 
snowstorms in coming weeks, said Helgrud. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be a record-breaking year for the industry across the country, said 
Goeldner. At the annual meeting in September of the Ski Tour Operators -- a 
group which arranges skiing tours across the country -- the room was all smiles 
when asked about bookings for the upcoming year, Goeldner said. Heading for a 
Great Run? 
</P>
<P>
 Ski industry analysts report that this may be a record-breaking year across 
the country with snow storms arriving early. And ski resort managers throughout 
California say their reservation lines are ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Open 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California ski resorts include: 04,16,08,16,35 Resort Status Phone 
Current conditions Bear Mountain Open (909) 585-2517 4" new snow + 1' to 3' man

440-1041 Ski Sunrise Closed (619) 249-6150 What It Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Ski rental packages, which include skis, poles and boots can vary greatly in 
price depending where you rent them. Here are some sample average rates: 
</P>
<P>
 At the slopes: Ski package: $16 a day, adult price Ski boarding package: $28 a 
day Lift tickets (pre-season special): $28 a day, adult price 
</P>
<P>
 Near the slopes (independent rental shop): Ski package: $9.50 a day, adult 
price Ski boarding package: $20 a day 
</P>
<P>
 In the city: Ski package: $15 a day, adult price Ski boarding package: $30 a 
day Who's Doing It 
</P>
<P>
 Weather is a major factor in the fluctuation of skier visits in the Pacific 
area, which includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and 
Washington. For example, 1991 was a poor year for snow compared to 1989.

ADMINISTRATION, UNION BACKERS MAY FIND THE FUTURE EVEN WORSE.

 Even before Republicans notched their smashing congressional election 
victories this week, organized labor's agenda wasn't getting far under the 
Clinton Administration. But now, experts say, things will get even worse for 
union backers. 
</P>
<P>
 With newly won majorities in both the House and Senate, Republicans might be 
able to restrain workplace regulatory agencies that have become more aggressive 
under a Democratic President. Emboldened business groups may also push for 
legislation relaxing rules on labor-management committees, overtime pay and 
other wage issues. 
</P>
<P>
 And labor law reform, once a cornerstone of President Clinton's domestic 
agenda, looks dead. Unions had hoped that the Dunlop Commission, a Presidential 
panel named to recommend legislative reforms, would propose changes to help 
unions bring in new members. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, "any opportunity for reform has passed us by," said James M. 
Wood, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's final report will "be a nice book you can put on your shelf, 
but that's all it'll be," said Matthew Tallmer, a Washington-based editor of 
newsletters covering labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher to divine is what will happen at the National Labor Relations Board, 
the regulatory agency that rules on disputes between unions and employers. 
Under Chairman William B. Gould IV, a former Stanford law professor confirmed 
this year after a nine-month struggle, the board was expected to take a more 
pro-union slant. 
</P>
<P>
 But next month brings to an end the term of NLRB member Dennis M. Devaney, a 
Democrat and Reagan Administration appointee who currently is the swing vote 
between the pro-union and pro-management sides at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans block the appointment of a pro-union replacement for Devaney, 
it would be another major blow to unionists who hoped the five-member board 
would reverse what they considered its strongly pro-business stance during the 
Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the areas where the labor movement has scored gains under Clinton have 
been at the U.S. Department of Labor's wage and hour division and its 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California and other apparel manufacturing centers, labor 
officials have cracked down on sweatshops violating minimum wage and overtime 
pay rules. Regulators also have extracted big fines against employers found to 
be violating safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President and cabinet secretaries normally have broad discretion in 
running federal agencies, a combative Congress could hamstring their activities 
by cutting off, or threatening to cut off, appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA, in particular, could be pressured to moderate its long-awaited 
ergonomics standard to protect workers against repetitive-motion injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In its regulatory strategy, the Clinton Administration could do one of two 
things, said Jeffrey McGuiness, president of the Labor Policy Assn., a group 
representing big companies. "They could step up regulatory enforcement and 
please their constituencies or they could cool it for a while in hopes that 
would help get Clinton reelected in two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Democrats in Congress "kicked around the agencies" during the 
Bush Administration. Republicans, McGuiness said, could do the same now to the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the legislative arena, labor has taken a drubbing even with a Democrat in 
the White House. The union movement's most coveted legislation -- a bill 
barring employers from permanently replacing strikers -- was thwarted by Senate 
Republicans this year when the GOP still was the minority party. 
</P>
<P>
 California's labor leaders know what it's like to lose too. For the last 12 
years, Wood said, one labor-backed bill after another has died on Republican 
governors' desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Republicans have won at least 40 of the 80 seats in the Assembly, 
labor-backed bills might get shot down even before reaching the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wood said, if a bill is going down to defeat anyway, "it doesn't matter 
where your legislation dies, or how it dies."

 Britain's trade minister has personally intervened to withdraw a booklet 
sponsored by his department that recommended dirty business tricks such as 
going through competitors' trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine acted after reporters quizzed 
ministry officials on the contents of the booklet, a ministry spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the publication, Marketing Your Business, with the ministry's logo on 
the front, had been used in government-run business seminars since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers that saw copies of the booklet before it was banned reported it 
also advised entrepreneurs to befriend secretaries, or to pretend to be a 
newspaper researcher or a student writing a thesis, to gain access to rivals' 
secrets.

 Craig Corp. Boosts Its Stake in Citadel: The Los Angeles investment company 
said it increased its ownership of Citadel Holding Corp.'s voting shares to 
16.6% from 10% by purchasing 1.3 million new preferred shares issued by Citadel 
at $3.95 each. The new stock replaces $5.25 million in loans Citadel had owed 
Craig.Citadel's principal asset is a 16% stake in Glendale thrift Fidelity 
Federal Bank. Both Citadel and Craig are controlled by investor James Cotter. 
Earlier in the week, he was sued by a group of Citadel investors who are 
seeking to liquidate the company. The suit charges that Cotter is improperly 
boosting his ownership of Citadel and impeding other shareholders' rights. 
Citadel said Friday that Craig's latest equity infusion was needed to head off 
financial problems.

 Japanese Auto Makers Report Dismal Second-Half Earnings: Hurt by the 
strengthening yen, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Japan's third-largest car maker, 
reported a 19% drop in net profit, to $83 million, for the six months ended 
Sept. 30. Sales edged up 0.7% to $12.5 billion.As the yen's value increases, 
prices of Japanese goods exported to foreign currencies must rise in order to 
keep their value in yen stable. This has cut into the exports for Japanese car 
makers. Mazda reported that its net losses during the half almost doubled to 
$296 million. Sales were down 2% to $8.76 billion. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., 
maker of Subaru, said its half-year losses narrowed to $25.7 million and that 
sales were up 15% to $4.11 billion.

 IBM to Cut 1,000 Jobs: The world's largest computer maker said that over the 
next few weeks it will cut 700 jobs from its microelectronics division, or 
about 5% of the division's work force. In the software solutions division, 300 
employees were notified that their positions will be eliminated.The reductions 
are part of a turnaround program that has slashed Big Blue's costs by $5.6 
billion since the end of 1992. IBM's losses totaled almost $15 billion in 1992 
and '93, largely because of plummeting revenue from mainframes. IBM aims to 
trim its work force in 1994 to 222,000, a reduction of about 35,000 employees. 
IBM shares rose 37.5 cents to $72.375 a share on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Friday.

 Loss Expected on Vatican Investments: Falling returns from playing the 
financial markets will help put the Vatican $22.3 million into the red next 
year, a Roman Catholic cardinal said. Presenting the Holy See's consolidated 
budget for 1995, American Cardinal Edmund Szoka said income from the Vatican's 
investments in cash, securities and bonds was expected to drop by about a 
third, from $36 million in 1993. Szoka, head of a financial watchdog committee 
of cardinals, said Vatican holdings will be affected by currency fluctuations.

 U.S. stocks lost more ground Friday in action slowed by a bond market holiday 
and by fears of another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa stock index recovered somewhat from a steep plunge 
Thursday on concerns about bellwether issue Telmex. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average dropped 20.52 points to 3,801.47, 
for a full-week loss of 6.05 points amid volatile election-related trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers topped winners by 15 to 6 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Friday, though volume was light at 219 million shares. The Nasdaq 
market of mostly smaller stocks showed better breadth, with losers edging 
winners by just 14 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said many stock traders stayed away with the government bond market 
closed in observance of Veterans Day. But bond futures trading went on Friday, 
and renewed selling in that market -- signaling still-higher bond yields -- 
helped depress stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield had closed at 8.15% on Thursday, hovering near 
three-year highs and suggesting that investors see no signs of an economic 
slowdown that could allow rates to ease. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for both stock and bond markets now is in guessing how much higher 
rates may have to go to cool the economy. The Fed is scheduled to meet on 
Tuesday and is expected to raise short-term rates for the sixth time this year, 
by at least a half-point and perhaps by a full percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hoey, Dreyfus Corp.'s chief economist, said he believes that stock 
investors "assume it's going to be (a half-point)" on Tuesday, and thus that 
the market has already priced that into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But "the issue is, is there more after that, and how much more?" Hoey asked. 
With the economy expanding briskly, many experts are predicting that the Fed 
may have to raise rates into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 That is leaving many stock investors increasingly discouraged, said Dudley 
Eppel, trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. "If bond rates go 
higher, sooner or later people are going to have to sell stocks and buy bonds," 
he said, because the returns on bonds will simply become too attractive to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the stock market attempted to rally sharply early 
Wednesday, after the Republicans were swept to power in Congress, and again 
early Thursday. But both of those rallies failed in the face of continued high 
bond yields, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech stocks were in the spotlight as Chiron soared 11 3/4 to 71 1/2 on 
new takeover rumors. Investors also bid up other major biotech names, including 
Biogen, up 1 1/8 to 39 7/8; Amgen, up 1 1/2 to 58; Genentech, up 1 to 47 1/2; 
and Genzyme, up 3/4 to 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some technology issues were active for a second day. Computer networker 
Cisco Systems jumped 2 3/8 to 33 after reporting strong quarterly earnings at 
the top end of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft shed 1 7/16 to 62 1/4 after Goldman Sachs shaved its fiscal 1995 
earnings per-share estimate by 10 cents to $2.20, citing a delay in the new 
Windows 95 software product. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, builder Inco Homes sank 1/2 to 1 1/2 after 
announcing that it is in violation of certain financial covenants with its 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, takeover rumors boosted Spelling Entertainment 1 to 11 3/4. 
Spelling is majority-owned by Blockbuster Entertainment, now a part of Viacom. 
Viacom chief Sumner Redstone said Friday that the firm is considering buying 
the rest of Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mexican market, the Bolsa index rebounded 34.67 points to 2,526.99 
after falling 126 points Thursday, when Telmex shares plummeted on concerns 
about new competition from a future alliance between AT&T and Grupo Alfa. 
</P>
<P>
 Telmex's NYSE-traded shares, down 4 3/4 on Thursday, rose 2 1/4 to 53 1/2 
after Baring Securities upgraded the stock to buy from hold. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Frankfurt's DAX index eased 4.05 points to 2,078.35, 
while London's FTSE 100 index slid 27.6 points to 3,075.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index added 19.51 points to 19,284.36, though for the 
week it declined 527.2 points on renewed concerns about the strong yen.

SANTA FE PACIFIC CONSIDERING TAKEOVER OFFER; RAILROADS: BOARD URGES 
SHAREHOLDERS NOT TO 'ACT HASTILY' PENDING A DECISION ON UNION PACIFIC'S BID. 
</P>

<P>
 Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is considering the latest takeover offer from Union 
Pacific and asked its shareholders Friday to wait for a decision before turning 
over their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliberations of the board of directors are in stark contrast to Santa 
Fe's decision to reject Union Pacific's first offer the day after it was made. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Union Pacific offer, made Tuesday, may give the board something to 
think about. By setting up a trust for the Santa Fe stock, which could be sold 
if antitrust regulators nix the merger, Union Pacific is absorbing much of the 
risk of the deal's falling through. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier letters to Union Pacific executives, Santa Fe Chairman Robert Krebs 
said the board will give serious consideration to an offer at a fair price and 
with a provision for a trust. Union Pacific says its latest proposal does just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your board of directors is evaluating the Union Pacific proposal and will 
advise Santa Fe shareholders of its conclusions shortly," Krebs said in 
Friday's letter to stockholders. "In the meantime, you are strongly urged not 
to act hastily with respect to your investment in Santa Fe." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Philippa Dworkin said from Santa Fe's Schaumburg, Ill., 
headquarters that the company will not comment further. She said she had no 
information on when the board will meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In a week, Santa Fe shareholders are due to vote on a proposed merger with Ft. 
Worth-based Burlington Northern, which is offering less than $16.50 per-share 
worth of its own stock for Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, based in Bethlehem, Pa., on Tuesday revised its bid for Santa 
Fe to $3.3 billion. It now is offering $17.50 in cash per share for 57% of 
Santa Fe and would pay for the rest of the company with its own stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, the nation's No. 1 railroad in terms of revenue, is trying to 
stop No. 2 Burlington Northern from getting Santa Fe's tracks from Chicago to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe, the nation's seventh-largest railroad, and Burlington Northern have 
argued that the Interstate Commerce Commission would not approve a Santa Fe 
merger with Union Pacific on anti-competitive grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe now has no choice but to consider Union Pacific's offer since it 
meets the criteria Santa Fe set forth to negotiate, said Susan Chapman, an 
industry analyst with Forbes, Walsh and Kelly in New York.

PACT MAY KEEP GREYHOUND FROM BANKRUPTCY; RESTRUCTURING: FOR 45% OF THE BUS 
LINE, BONDHOLDERS WILL CANCEL $98 MILLION IN DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An agreement with creditors has allowed Greyhound Lines Inc. to dodge 
bankruptcy court -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound and a subcommittee of its bondholders agreed to a financial 
reorganization that would give the debt holders about 45% of the company in 
exchange for forgiving $98.9 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondholders also would be allowed to nominate two of the firm's nine 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said they were pleased with the deal, reached late Thursday after 
several weeks of tough negotiations that included an attempt to force the 
company into bankruptcy. Greyhound missed a $4.2-million interest payment Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to have my next bus ride," bondholder attorney Robin Phelan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The involuntary bankruptcy petition, which bondholders credited with speeding 
the negotiations, will be withdrawn when the reorganization is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The creditors agreed to give Greyhound until about Jan. 10 to complete the 
restructuring, which the company wants done by the end of the year to avoid $15 
million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their intention is to resolve this without the need for the Bankruptcy Court, 
and we don't have an objection. But if they have to use the bankruptcy process, 
we have no objection to that either," said another bondholder attorney, Michael 
Solow. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan still needs the approval of the bondholders and 
shareholders, which the company said it expects to get next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur Ross, senior managing director of Greyhound financial adviser 
Rothschild Inc., noted that Greyhound's stock and bond prices rose Friday after 
the deal was announced. "I think that people have really already voted," Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound stock opened 25 cents higher on the American Stock Exchange Friday 
morning, but by the close of trading it had fallen back to $2.19 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the bondholders' investment rose $10.75 per $100 in face amount 
on Friday to $40.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement, existing shareholders will keep their original 
14.7 million shares of common stock, or 26% of the restructured company, and 
$35 million in new equity will be raised by selling 16.3 million shares, 
initially offered to current shareholders, for $2.15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound originally offered a 28% stake in the company to bondholders, who in 
turn demanded 85%. The negotiations narrowed that to between 40% and 50% this 
week.

 Vans Inc. Faces New Union Election: The maker of casual footwear, which beat 
back a union campaign earlier this year, said it faces the election in the wake 
of a complaint by the National Labor Relations Board that it violated federal 
labor law in battling a Teamsters representation drive.The labor board's chief 
attorney told officials of the Orange-based company that the general counsel's 
office will seek to overturn the April, 1994, election and set a date for new 
balloting. A hearing on the charges is set for April 1, 1995. Labor board and 
Teamsters officials could not be reached for comment on the Veterans Day 
holiday.

training available whenever children are present, Red Cross spokeswoman Judy 
Iannaccone said.

MOTHER GRIEVES FOR THE SON SHE ALMOST SAVED; SHOOTING: THE LOS ALAMITOS WOMAN 
SAID THEY WERE TURNING THE CORNER IN HIS BATTLE WITH DRUGS WHEN HE WAS KILLED 
BY POLICE.

 Choyce Tucker still cannot fathom the chain of events that led to her son's 
shooting death by police this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He was strung out on drugs, she said, but he was desperately trying to kick 
the habit. After weeks of trying to help him, Tucker, a former psychiatric 
nurse, was hoping they had turned a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Wednesday, all their efforts fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I thought about that night (before he was shot) was that if I could just 
get him through the night, tomorrow would be a different day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For her son, tomorrow never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos police said her son, Michael Brown, 19, went on a rampage after 
being taken to a hospital for an apparent drug overdose. He was shot to death 
when he lunged at police officers with a pair of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my son had problems but he wasn't a bad kid," Tucker said. "He had to 
harbor a lot of grief and just didn't have the coping mechanism to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said her son's problems seemed to start with a series of painful losses 
that culminated in her divorce from her second husband in 1993. With the loss 
of his father figure, Brown turned to marijuana and crystal methamphetamine to 
help cope, paying for the drugs with money from odd jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said Brown's biological father walked out on the family in 1981, and 
his older brother, Richard, whom he was close to when they were children, had 
left home some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "As kids, whenever someone thought of me, they'd think of Michael, and vice 
versa. That's how close we were," Richard Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have his dad, and later on he didn't have his brother," Tucker 
said. "Then, my second husband left." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Brown decided he wanted to straighten out his life so he could 
some day start a family and buy his own store. But he knew he couldn't do it 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning before leaving for work, Tucker said she found a note on the 
family's kitchen table from him saying that he needed her help. 
</P>
<P>
 "That day, he cleaned the house, washed his clothes and even went to the 
grocery store to buy a loaf of bread," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker warned her son that rehabilitation would be rough. He would have to 
follow orders, even if that meant staying away from certain friends. Mother and 
son set out some limits and goals. She gave him 30 days to get a job, and he 
decided he would enroll at Laurel High School as a full-time student, Tucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like I had my son back again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend, Montague Bailey, said he noticed the change in Brown during 
the past few weeks. But the change didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of drugs out there in the streets. It's hard to be around it 
and not do that stuff," said Bailey, 20. "Some days, he would call me up and 
ask me to stay with him during the day because he knew I didn't touch that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said her son was doing fine until Wednesday. About 1 a.m. he came into 
her room and asked to call a friend who also had drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then he wasn't lucid anymore," she said. "So I told him if he wants 
to, he could sleep in my room." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown dragged a mattress beside his mother's bed and the two talked themselves 
to sleep. As he dozed off, Brown told Tucker, "I'm just a kid, Mama," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he woke up again just before 4 a.m., he shouted "something about the holy 
Bible and him going to heaven," Tucker said. She dialed 911 and summoned 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said she wanted to hospitalize her son to help him through the drug 
withdrawals he seemed to be going through. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center, where he stayed a few hours 
before leaving against doctors' orders, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tried to break into several houses before kicking in a door at one home, 
police said, where he struck a woman on the face and head. When officers 
approached him at the woman's house, Brown thrust an eight-inch pair of 
scissors at them. Officers ordered him several times to drop the scissors, and 
when he lunged at them, an officer fired two shots, hitting Brown twice in the 
chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said the officers could have shot to wound her son instead of shooting 
him in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they did that because they didn't want any stray bullets to hit 
innocent people," she said. "Well, the family was secured in the bedroom. There 
was no innocent person in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative 
leave, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her living room, as she recounted her son's troubles, Tucker glanced at her 
son's football trophies from middle school. She was reminded of something a 
longtime friend said to her the day before her son died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing the typical mother thing: I was complaining about my kids," 
Tucker said. "She looked at me and said, 'But you know, at least they're 
around.' I thought about it and my God, she's right. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was supposed to be the turnaround for us," Tucker said. "But he was shot 
before he could make that turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services for Brown will be at 1 p.m. Friday at Friendship Baptist 
Church in Yorba Linda.

WOODY HAS HIS DAY; AFTER 10 YEARS OF HELPING KIDS, A DEDICATED DOG RETIRES

<P>
 Woody, the dog who has comforted, protected and entertained thousands of 
physically or mentally abused children, will retire next week after 10 years of 
service at Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woody's been a big part of our life here," said John Aliberti, a training 
coordinator who often patrolled the home's grounds on City Drive late at night 
with Woody. "He's very friendly to every child here. He'll bark at people who 
aren't supposed to be here, but he's never barked at any child." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodrow (Woody) Theemling, a 10-year-old, 90-pound yellow Labrador mix, was 
brought to the home in 1985 by a staff member who found him on the side of a 
freeway, Aliberti said. Since then, Woody has become notorious for his 
gentleness around children, his ferociousness toward strangers and his 
lightning-quick cat chases around the 235-bed shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woody has mauled some of the best balls that ever came into this facility," 
said Rick Bazant, community programs specialist. "He's like any other dog. 
Don't leave a baseball or anything like that lying around because it will 
disappear. He will gnaw it up and hand it back to you." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Woody's favorite activities at the shelter was snack time. With 151 
children eating snacks at the same time, Woody often got his fill of cookies, 
apples and candy. He ate so many graham crackers that staff members figured he 
was sick of them when he switched to fruit, said Tammy Higuera, a counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 "A child would be standing out in the field, eating his snack, holding an 
apple in the other hand and Woody would come up behind him and take the apple," 
Higuera said. "It was so cute. When he started eating fruit, we thought, 'Oh my 
gosh, this dog is getting healthy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woody, whose name is short for Orangewood and whose last name comes from 
Robert Theemling, the home's former director, will move in permanently with 
Higuera, her daughter and their black Labrador at their home in Cypress, where 
he has been living for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Woody likes to play, he has a gentleness that makes even the most 
frightened child take to him, "like a fish to water," Bazant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The home shelters more than 3,000 abused toddlers to teen-agers a year. Over 
the years, Woody has comforted thousands of sexually, physically and mentally 
abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd bring small children in who were really upset and crying and when the 
children see him, it's just, 'Doggy! Doggy!' and they would run to him," 
Higuera said. "He wouldn't run away from them. It was like he had a sense they 
needed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Woody was more therapeutic than some of the psychologists, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one girl sometime back who was sexually abused and having a lot of 
nightmares," Higuera said. "She would come out and find Woody at night and sit 
with him, and pet him and cry. She found peace in talking to him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his younger days, children would crawl all over Woody. Some of the 
preschoolers would climb on his back and ride him like a horse. Others would 
dress him and sneak him vegetables under the table, Bazant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see there's a dog there takes a lot of the edge off of being someplace you 
don't want to be," Bazant said. "He just seems to be very proud of what he 
does. He'll nuzzle up to kids who need to be talked to. He'll pop his head up 
like, 'OK, I'm here, pay attention to me now.' You get 20 kids running up and 
hugging him. He'll have two or three kids lying on him and that just doesn't 
faze him." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the home decided it was time for Woody to retire when he began 
showing signs of arthritis and digestive problems. Instead of candy bars, 
cookies and snacks, he is now on a special high-protein kidney diet, Higuera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting so we had to protect him more and more from the children," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his stay at the home, Woody slept on his own pillow in the junior 
boy's cottage. He also had an area by a tree behind the last cottage where he 
buried his bones, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Woody will receive a special send-off from more than 250 children, 
staff and county officials.  
</P>
<P>
 For his years of service at Orangewood, Woody will receive free medical care 
from his friends at the animal shelter next to the home, Higuera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood's new mascot will be O'Henry, a 4-year-old chocolate Labrador 
donated to the home by a family that moved out of state.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be real tough to see Woody go," Bazant said. "Woody's done his 
duty and it's time for him to get his relaxation."

VETERANS DAY: A TIME TO MOURN, A TIME TO HEAL; A REPLICA OF THE VIETNAM 
VETERANS MEMORIAL EVOKES STRONG EMOTIONS AT KNOTT'S BERRY FARM. ABOUT 200 
ATTEND A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL TO HONOR THOSE WHO DIED.

 It's about half the size of the original, made of metal instead of granite, 
and can be taken apart like a giant Lego set. But to the hundreds of people who 
flocked Friday to the traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the 
feelings it evoked were genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings back a lot of memories, a lot of unfulfilled dreams of a lot of 
kids," said Michael Deegan of Fountain Valley, who served 11 months, 22 days 
and five hours in Vietnam and spent Friday evening running his fingers over the 
name "GEORGE S. JOHNSON." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very patriotic," a wet-eyed Deegan said of Johnson, a high school 
buddy who died during the war. "He was an athlete and a good student. He 
graduated mid-term and went into the Marines. He died and never saw 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of these," he added, gesturing at the more than 58,000 names of 
dead or missing servicemen and servicewomen on the memorial, "is a young kid 
with a lot of dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people joined Deegan and his wife, Suzanne, for a Veterans Day 
candlelight vigil at "The Moving Wall," which is parked this week in front of 
Independence Hall at Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Vigueria belted out a powerful "Amazing Grace," and then the crowd, 
which included scores of Vietnam War veterans, held their candles aloft as 
Billy Joel's "Goodnight, Saigon" blared over the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around here. We've got Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard -- 
we're all family," organizer Larry (Bear) Hughes of Fullerton told the somber 
audience. "This is our family. If we all stay together and bond together like 
we did in the 'Nam, nothing can take us apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Several veteran nurses and soldiers sobbed at the side of the podium, 
clamoring to hug each other as the memories flooded back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a mother losing their children," cried Hope Oswald of Culver City, 
who served five years in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can just see them coming in when there's not enough room to lay them on the 
ground," said Carla Bendele of Redlands, who spent seven months in Vietnam, 
where her husband was killed. "It's been a long time, but it's so fresh in my 
mind, like it happened yesterday or today." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the crowd, veterans and family members of slain soldiers, said they 
never have seen the massive memorial wall, designed by architect Maya Lin, in 
Washington. The replica, made of 74 panels, stretches nearly 253 feet and is 
six feet at its tallest point. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the base of the wall was littered with single carnations, roses, 
wreaths, miniature flags and personal notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know you, but I will always know your name . . . your name is on a 
big, black wall," wrote Mosi Jamila Blane on a piece of flowered stationery. 
"So now everyone will know you were brave and everyone will know you were 
strong . . . and everyone will remember your name." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne and Michael Deegan stood a long time staring at the wall, thinking of 
their 14- and 17-year-old sons, and remembering their own coming of age during 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call this 'The Moving Wall' because it moves from place to place," 
Suzanne Deegan said with a sigh. "But there's a double meaning to that, 'The 
Moving Wall.' It's very moving."

VETERANS DAY: A TIME TO MOURN, A TIME TO HEAL; CADETS AT AN ANAHEIM MILITARY 
ACADEMY HONOR VETERANS WITH A SPECIAL MASS AND LUNCH. AND THE STUDENTS ARE 
REWARDED FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS.

<P>
 After listening to a Navy veteran explain during a Veterans Day lunch that his 
pin signified he had been a submarine diver, Eric Rios pointed to a bar on his 
own uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is for doing my homework," Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be years before Rios, 12, is eligible for medals for bravery in 
combat, but Rios and his fellow students at St. Catherine's Military School are 
recognized for achievements ranging from academic excellence to getting 
themselves dressed in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, approximately 160 uniformed students honored area veterans with a 
special Mass and lunch. The Veterans Day event was followed by a formal 
presentation at which students received bars and certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell who was more impressed with whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans from all branches of the armed services watched as 7- to 12-year-old 
cadets gathered in ranks after Mass. They nodded as student officers called out 
familiar orders and responses: "Sir, Charlie Battalion present and accounted 
for, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "These boys are sharp," said Steven C. Vargas, the former submarine diver. 
"During my time in the Navy in the 1980s, we didn't always get treated so well. 
It's a real honor to be here with kids who look up to members of the armed 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
 The cadets, in turn, flocked around the several active-duty soldiers who 
attended in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you gotten a Purple Heart yet?" one boy asked Andras M. Marton, a first 
lieutenant in the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Marton graduated from St. Catherine's in 1985. When he started as a 
first-grader at the school, Marton said, he was overwhelmed by the military 
atmosphere at first, but grew to love the structure and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember this school as a tremendous opportunity to get an education that 
combined Catholic values and a military environment," Marton said. "My family 
upbringing was always to do what's best and do what's right. St. Catherine's 
reinforced that." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Catherine's was started as a girls school in 1889 by the Dominican Sisters 
of Mission San Jose. Five years later it was switched to an all-boys orphanage, 
and in the 1920s it became a military boys school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sisters felt the boys needed a male influence so they invited the 
military to establish a presence here," said Chris Ragon, director of 
development and alumni affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Horn, a 1968 graduate and parent of a seventh-grader at St. 
Catherine's, said the military presence is what makes the school different from 
other Catholic or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schooling I got here helped me when I first joined the service," the Army 
veteran said. "I had a real advantage over the other recruits because I knew 
how to march and had some military training, so I was put right into a 
leadership position in boot camp. This school teaches military leadership that 
helps students whether they go into the service or not."

FEARS ABOUND OVER PRENATAL CARE AT CLINICS; PROP. 187: GOV. WILSON'S ORDER 
MAKING SUCH PROGRAMS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ONE OF HIS FIRST TARGETS SPARKS 
CONCERN AND OUTRAGE AMONG WORKERS. FOR NOW, PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE SEEKING 
MEDICAL HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "I'm so scared, I am so nervous," said the 25-year-old illegal immigrant 
woman, worrying about Proposition 187, the initiative that would cut off her 
medical care, after a prenatal checkup at the Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she had two previous premature deliveries and is having complications 
with her current pregnancy, the woman said she is considering stopping her 
prenatal care, and is thinking about having her baby at home, in the 
one-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say we can't go to the doctors if we don't have all the papers," said 
the woman, who was moved from Mexico City to Los Angeles by her mother when she 
was 15. "If I have to, I will have my baby in my house. I will do what I have 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which requires a halt to all non-emergency health care to 
illegal immigrants and requires health care workers to report them to 
immigration authorities, is expected to have broad public health ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere are the stakes quite as dramatic as they are for prenatal and 
well-baby programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, in a post-election executive order, made prenatal programs 
for illegal immigrants one of his first targets. The executive order, issued 
Wednesday, represented the start of the 60-day notification period required by 
law before cuts can be implemented in the state-financed Access for Infants and 
Mothers (AIM) program. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts could block the order, but for now the Wilson Administration is 
drafting emergency regulations. A spokesman for the governor said all required 
paperwork should be in place within 60 days so that the order can be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Such basic services as blood tests, physician consultations, diet advice, 
ultrasound tests, and, after the baby is born, well-baby checkups will be cut 
off if the order is enforced. Physicians and health care experts have long 
considered basic prenatal care to be essential in guaranteeing healthy babies, 
and studies have linked lack of prenatal care with the delivery of premature 
and underweight babies and with learning disorders, even fetal alcohol 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first term, Wilson was instrumental in expanding prenatal services 
to low-income women. In 1989, he told The Times that the $1,200 cost of 
prenatal health care was well worth the money. "It is the best investment . . . 
if we are to determine if there are problems . . . and I am convinced that 
would eliminate many of the learning disorders," he said then. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Wilson, said Friday he saw no contradiction 
between the governor's earlier comments and his aggressive stance on 
Proposition 187. Walsh said that so much money is going into health services 
for illegal immigrants that the AIM program cannot afford to take care of all 
the legal residents of California who need prenatal care. He said Wilson has 
asked the Legislature to put all savings from the crackdown on health care for 
illegal immigrants into the AIM program. 
</P>
<P>
 Health administrators contend that the drop-off in patients seeking prenatal 
care will result in more emergency room cases -- a much more costly situation 
for taxpayers. Under Proposition 187, emergency medical care would continue to 
be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without prenatal care, a lot of high-risk cases will end up with 
complications and have to go to the emergency room," said Dr. Son Nguyen, a 
physician at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles, which has 
seen a steep drop in patients since Election Day.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's order Wednesday generated widespread alarm among health workers and 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old woman at the Venice Family Clinic, who asked not to be 
identified because of her fear of immigration authorities, said that returning 
to Mexico, as Wilson and other sponsors of Proposition 187 are suggesting, is 
not an option. Both she and her daughters, ages 8 and 3, identify as Americans 
and would feel lost in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, she said she trusts the promises of people at the clinic that 
she is in no immediate danger of being reported to immigration authorities. 
"You have to trust somebody to tell the truth," she said. "If they tell me to 
come back, I will come back because my daughters need health care." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said if Proposition 187 is enforced, that will change and she will be 
forced to try to take care of herself. Six months pregnant, she said she has 
had to go to an emergency room once because of premature contractions. "What am 
I supposed to do?" she asked. "I think maybe I have my baby at my house. But 
what if my baby dies?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fear expressed by the woman was resonating throughout the Los Angeles 
area, health care workers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Queen of Angeles-Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, prenatal clinic workers 
said 26 women did not turn up the day after the election for scheduled 
appointments. On Thursday, 15 women failed to show up. By Friday, most of the 
patients were coming in, though clinic workers said they were full of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic usually sees 60 to 90 women a day, about 90% of whom are Latino. 
Although the clinic services a predominantly Latino clientele, the hospital 
reported that alarm had also spread to Korean and Armenian immigrants in the 
Hollywood area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were afraid to come out because they thought we would report them to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service," said Ana Posey, director of the 
clinic. "One lady said she was afraid to come out of her house because she saw 
a gray van in the neighborhood that looked like an immigration van. We had to 
send a taxi for her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The taxi was just one means used to try to coax fearful families into clinics. 
The hospital also was sending out mail, making phone calls to patients' homes 
and using Spanish-language radio and television stations to make announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'Come in for prenatal care, you have nothing to fear,' " Posey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carol Jennings, who works at the South Central Family Health Center near 
Downtown Los Angeles, said some patients, about 90% of whom are Latino, have 
called saying they are afraid to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask if we are asking for documents," she said. "Morale has been really 
low. The staff and the patients are feeling bad because of how strongly 187 
passed. It's like a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many clinics, the health center relies on payments from the state for a 
significant part of its operating budget. That means the facility, which 
provides care to about 4,000 low-income clients, could be forced to close if it 
cannot make up for the lost money through federal grants or private 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman has told Sue W. Scott, the clinic's director, that she would stop 
bringing her son in for his treatments for lead poisoning, treatments which if 
stopped could lead to long-term brain damage and limited physical development. 
Although the boy is a legal citizen, the mother is not and she said she could 
not risk deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated when I heard that," Scott said. "I am feeling an incredible 
amount of anger."

WOMAN HAS TEST-TUBE TRIPLETS AT 50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At an age when many couples are slowing down, planning for retirement and 
enjoying grandchildren, Milagros Olarve and her husband Florante -- both 50 
years old -- up and had triplets. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 1/2 hours of labor, and thanks to the wonders of test-tube 
conception, Olarve gave birth Thursday to 2-pound, 7-ounce Alexander, 2-pound, 
2-ounce Veronica and 2-pound Stephanie. Although they were born two months 
prematurely, all three and their mother were healthy and resting Friday at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time at this age, they're having menopause, not having babies," 
said Olarve's obstetrician, Dr. Ronald Wu. 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Olarve, as she is called, said she used no birth control during the 
Eagle Rock couple's 22 years of marriage, figuring that if she got pregnant, 
that would be fine and if not, that would be OK, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 10 years ago, she and her husband became determined to have a child. 
After surgery to remove scar tissue from her abdomen and unblock her Fallopian 
tubes, she still had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Olarves turned to in-vitro fertilization -- Latin for "in 
glass," the technical term for conceiving a test-tube baby. Milagros' eggs and 
Florante's sperm were combined in a test tube and then implanted in Milagros' 
womb. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two tries, at about $18,000 each. In the first, doctors implanted five 
fertilized eggs, but none took. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more were implanted last May -- the large number increases the odds that 
at least one will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, three did. 
</P>
<P>
 And although most in-vitro pregnancies are delivered by Cesarean section 
because of the babies' small size and tendency to arrive prematurely, doctors 
said Olarve had no need for the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Olarve said she pays no attention to debates about some women being too old to 
have children. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband are in excellent health, the former marathon runner said. 
"Now I don't have to run those races," she said. "I'll have to run after my 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, Millie Olarve said, she and her husband can love their 
children as much as any younger parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's unfair" to the children, she said. "It's going to make me 
feel younger, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wu expects the premature babies to be ready to go home soon after the first of 
the year. Until then, the Olarves are counting their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milagros in Spanish means 'miracles,' " Olarve said. "Now I have three 
miracles."

VALLEY LEADERS BEGIN TO FEEL CONGRESS SHIFT; POLITICS: AS THE GOP READIES TO 
CONTROL THE HOUSE, LOCAL DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS PREPARE FOR VERY DIFFERENT 
ROLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the impact of this week's election results began to sink in, some of the 
San Fernando Valley's senior Democratic congressmen were glumly stashing away 
their gavels while eager Republicans eyed the prized committee chairmanships 
that may come their way in the new GOP-controlled House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley saw no changes in the membership of its congressional delegation, 
but Election Day brought dramatic shifts in the power balance as three 
influential Democrats with a combined half-century of Washington experience 
slipped into the minority party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley wins some and loses some," political consultant Marc Litchman 
said. "The Democrats are going to have a tougher time, but there are 
Republicans like Carlos Moorhead who are going to benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilled with ascendancy of their party, the local Republican delegation -- 
including Moorhead (R-Glendale) and up-and-comer Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita) -- vowed to fill the void with the newfound power they will 
wield on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon aide Armando Azarloza described his boss as "like a little kid in a 
candy store" as he talked with House leaders this week and eyed a subcommittee 
chairmanship and a seat on the powerful Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The big winner may be Moorhead, the senior member of the Valley's delegation, 
who is a contender for the chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee or 
the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Both jobs could help the region: Energy and Commerce handles 
telecommunications, aerospace and cable television, while Judiciary grapples 
with copyright issues that are essential for the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's appointment, however, is a not sure thing as Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), the next House Speaker, has said he intends to bypass the seniority 
system in choosing some committee chairs and as some party leaders have 
criticized Moorhead for not being aggressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entrenched incumbency by Democrats has made it really difficult to make 
changes," said Moorhead, eagerly awaiting the start of his 12th term. "Now we 
have an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 That opportunity will come at the others' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), elected in 1976, 
will lose his chairmanship of a powerful Rules subcommittee, which acted as the 
gatekeeper for much significant legislation. He is expected to face a tougher 
time in his aggressive support for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll all hold back a little bit and see what the Republicans do," 
said Beilenson, who won reelection in a hard-fought contest with GOP challenger 
Richard Sybert. "We'll be reacting a lot more. We're going to have to relearn 
our roles as the loyal opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) will lose his chairmanship of the 
powerful House subcommittee on health and the environment, which he used to 
take on the tobacco industry and push for a ban on smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 In line to succeed him is Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), a supporter of 
tobacco interests who intends to call off investigations of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't have the staff resources or the ability to call hearings or schedule 
bills for votes, but I will still be able to fight for what I believe in," said 
Waxman, first elected in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties were preparing for a political climate unlike what the country 
has experienced in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the dynamics are going to change dramatically for both Democrats and 
Republicans," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). "There is not one 
Republican in the House of Representatives who has ever been in the majority 
party. We've never been chairmen of committees. We've never gotten to control 
the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly is seeking the chairmanship of the subcommittee on international law, 
immigration and refugees, an ideal location to rewrite the nation's immigration 
laws. Just elected to his fifth term, Gallegly intends to push for an end to 
automatic citizenship for undocumented immigrants born in the United States and 
the creation of tamper-resistant immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the musical chairs, some House committees may be eliminated 
entirely because Gingrich has vowed to radically reorganize the committee 
structure. In addition, he intends to slash congressional staff by one-third to 
one-half, which would disproportionately affect Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides smaller staffs and less power, some Democrats can expect smaller 
offices as Republicans move into the more spacious suites offered to committee 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by the sudden changes, local Democrats had little time to relish their 
reelection victories as they prepared for a new, more humble role in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to find a way as a member of the minority party to help my 
district," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who will lose his 
chairmanship of the subcommittee overseeing the State Department. "While it 
will be humbling, I'll have to find other ways to push my agenda."

DOWNTOWN HOUSING PLAN READY FOR COUNCIL; OXNARD: TWENTY-EIGHT TOWNHOUSES WOULD 
BE BUILT AND PRICED TO SELL. SOME OPPOSE THE IDEA AS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Looking for a good deal on some downtown real estate? Try Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday will consider selling a half block downtown 
for $100 -- with the condition that the developer build 28 townhouses and sell 
nine of them to low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the three-bedroom homes would be priced to move fast: 
Between $94,000 and $127,000 apiece. If they sell for more, the developer, 
Heritage Park Partners, would share 50% of the excess money with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials were unable to say Friday how much the land was worth. But 
Fred Ferro of Grubb and Ellis Commercial Real Estate said the property was 
valued at about $660,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're investing in this project because we want to have more residents 
downtown," said Councilman Andres Herrera. "It's part of our effort to bring 
people to the area and make it more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Low-cost housing advocates, however, say the project would benefit few people 
for the money it would cost Oxnard. In addition to handing over the land for 
practically nothing, the city would pay for roughly $257,000 in sewer- and 
water-system improvements, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the undeveloped 1.9-acre parcel between 6th and 7th streets and west 
of B Street is the current site of the Oxnard Farmers' Market. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is approved, the market would be moved near Plaza Park on North 
5th Street, said Oxnard Community Development Director Richard Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has always been a temporary location for the Farmers' Market," Maggio 
said. "It has only been there three years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heritage Park Townhomes, as the development would be named, would be next 
to the renovated homes that make up the Heritage Square office complex and 
would have similar architecture, said City Manager Tom Frutchey. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Oxnard is handing over the land to Heritage Park Partners to make the 
homes more affordable for the city's poorer residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Macri-Ortiz of Channel Counties Legal Services Assn. has said that 
more units should be designated for the poor if building low-cost housing is 
the goal of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city is going to subsidize a housing project, there should be more 
affordable housing," Macri-Ortiz said earlier this month when the project was 
set to go before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed agreement, Heritage Park Partners would provide the minimum 
nine low- and moderate-income housing units required by law in a redevelopment 
zone like downtown Oxnard's. Heritage Park Partners is a venture between Dennis 
Howarth and Associates of Ventura and Orange County architect David Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he would not be able to take part in Tuesday's 
discussion because of a possible conflict of interest: He owned the land with 
several partners before the city took it over through a condemnation proceeding 
several years ago. But he said the plan made sense for Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes along with the idea of having high density downtown," Lopez said. 
"It's good use of land. The infrastructure is already there."

MAN ARRESTED AS SLAYING SUSPECT IN GANG SWEEP; LAW ENFORCEMENT: A COUNTYWIDE 
FORCE OF 175 OFFICERS RAIDS 18 HOMES. RUDY LEO MARTINEZ OF SATICOY IS TAKEN 
INTO CUSTODY IN CONNECTION WITH LAST MONTH'S SHOOTING OF A FATHER OF FOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In one of the largest gang sweeps in recent county history, 175 police 
officers raided 18 homes early Friday and arrested a Saticoy man on suspicion 
of fatally wounding a Cabrillo Village man last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Rudy Leo Martinez, 21, at his home and booked him at County 
Jail, where officials said he was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
Arraignment is set for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement released Friday evening, Ventura police Sgt. Bob Anderson 
said only that Martinez was suspected of killing 37-year-old Jose Guadalupe 
Gutierrez, who investigators have described as an innocent victim of gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's sweep, coordinated by the Ventura Police Department, also led to the 
arrest of a Meiners Oaks man for possessing a billy club, and to the seizure of 
two firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police Lt. Steve Bowman said it will take several days for lab tests 
to determine whether either of those guns was used in the slaying of Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, a father of four, was killed the night of Oct. 1 as he stood 
chatting with a friend outside a small building where he had led an Alcoholics 
Anonymous meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say a single, small-caliber bullet, fired from more than 100 feet away, 
pierced Gutierrez's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they heard several shots, and detectives believe the bullets 
were fired by gang members from railroad tracks just outside Cabrillo Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who is leading the homicide investigation, said Friday morning that 
police had no information that anyone intended to hit Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Anderson had said after the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez's death left his two daughters and two sons, ages 5 to 18, without a 
parent. Their mother had died of cancer several years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said all of the individuals targeted in Friday's raids are members of 
the street gang believed responsible for the shooting. Bowman said police would 
not name the gang because they do not want to give the group notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a large number of officers was needed to serve all 13 search warrants 
simultaneously at 6 a.m., and because of the potential that the gang members 
would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do that so word doesn't filter out that we're there," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were a combination of probation searches and search warrants that 
were signed by Municipal Court Judge James Cloninger. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating were officers from every police department in the county along 
with deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, probation officers 
and investigators from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said more than 40 Ventura officers, some of whom were on overtime, took 
part in the operation. Officers on the SWAT team forced their way into several 
homes when residents did not immediately open the doors. No one was injured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the targeted homes were in Saticoy, two in Ventura and two in Santa 
Paula. Officers also searched homes in the cities of Camarillo, Oxnard and Ojai 
and the communities of El Rio and Meiners Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meiners Oaks arrest came when officers rousted Sandro Mendez, 18, at his 
home and found a billy club, an illegal weapon. He was booked into County Jail 
and was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two arrests, detectives questioned four other alleged gang 
members at the Ventura police station after the raids. Anderson was not 
available Friday evening to say if Martinez was one of the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said police would release little information about the investigation 
because of the difficulty in solving gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-agency raids have become a common law enforcement tactic in Ventura 
County, since a "zero-tolerance" policy for gang-related crimes was announced 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the raids are intended to send a message to all gang members, even 
if few arrests are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since gang units came into being in the last five years, we're doing a pretty 
good job at closing out these types of cases," Bowman said.

HOME SALES DROP 16% IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 October home sales in Ventura County dropped 16% from the previous month, 
indicating a seasonal slowdown and the cooling of a housing market that has 
soared for much of 1994, according to a report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the 13-month real estate recovery is actually losing steam is unclear, 
analysts said, adding that sales historically dip with the beginning of the 
school year and with the distraction of the holidays just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in October transactions, home sales so far this year were 
16.4% higher than during the same 10-month period in 1993, according to TRW 
REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 County sales last month also reflect a slight increase -- about 3.5% -- over 
those in October, 1993. The figures show notable increases in sales in Thousand 
Oaks, Ventura, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slowdown in October sales was anticipated and is due to the usual 
seasonal factors," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW REDI. "Long-term 
trends in sales activity, however, show clearly that Southern California's 
housing market is experiencing a modest recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The year's overall sales increase, fueled by depressed housing prices and 
still-low mortgage interest rates, averaged about 17% throughout the six 
counties in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the upward surge of interest rates, more than two percentage points in 
a year, Nattagh said: "What remains to be seen is whether they're going to keep 
going up for the remainder of this year. If that does happen, I think you will 
find it will have a dampening effect on sales activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 730 houses were sold in Ventura County, a sharp drop from the 869 
homes sold in September. The average sales prices also dropped, from $233,599 
to $232,490. 
</P>
<P>
 Of October's drop in sales, Ventura Assn. of Realtors President Judy Hoag 
said, "I'd rather wait and see where we are in November. . . . I really don't 
think that (this) is any indication that the sky is falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Baird, president of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors, said Thousand 
Oaks area agents have not reported a slackening of sales. He added that the 
inventory of homes for sale seems to be down, a drop he said should bode well 
for sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll start to see an increase in the prices of properties that are 
listed in the months to come," Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
 While there may be fewer listings in Ventura, houses there seem to be selling 
quicker, perhaps because sellers are pricing them lower, Hoag said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, too, that sellers might be responding to buyers who are spooked by 
the specter of rising interest rates. "I think maybe there is a little fear in 
the market," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Harrison, broker at Coldwell Banker-Town & Country in Ventura, offered a 
slightly different spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the threat that interest rates are possibly going to rise may be 
encouraging more buyers into the market," he said. Analysts have predicted a 
boost in the federal prime lending rate next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the increase of sales since September, 1993, Nattagh said he sees no 
evidence of housing prices actually going up.  
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that the steadiness results partly from the high volume of 
below-market foreclosure sales, the lingering hangover of the four-year real 
estate recession, which is still dragging down housing prices.

PRICE OF FREEDOM; CROWDS GATHER TO SALUTE THE COUNTY'S WAR VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Standing under blue skies, buffeted by crisp winds, thousands of Ventura 
County residents celebrated Veterans Day on Friday with patriotic anthems, 
passionate speeches and tributes to those who died for their country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty-two years ago today, at 11 a.m., I was sworn into the United States 
Navy as an aviation cadet," Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said during a celebration 
at Constitution Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I am abroad and I see the American flag raised, I get lumps in my 
throat. Our flag represents freedom, and with freedom -- which was fought for 
by so many of you -- comes responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar ceremonies throughout the county allowed veterans and their families 
to hear speeches of thanks from local politicians and dignitaries, including 
state Sen. Cathie Wright and county Supervisor Vicky Howard, who spoke in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people -- including veterans from World Wars I and II, the Korean 
War and the Vietnam War -- gathered at Constitution Park by a black marble wall 
built last spring in honor of the city's war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hourlong celebration, sponsored by American Legion Post 382 of 
Camarillo, the audience heard speakers praise the men and women who fought.  
</P>
<P>
 Speakers also asked the audience to show the same kind of courage today that 
American soldiers have shown in wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to recapture the courage which turned wilderness into cities and 
bound them together under governments. We can turn slums into comfortable homes 
and uncertainties into certainties," said Daryl G. Johnson, a veteran of World 
War II and the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 In the audience, Vietnam veteran Mel Umberger, wearing an American flag 
T-shirt, solemnly listened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to go to as many celebrations as I can today," said Umberger, who had 
taken the day off from work. "I feel very strong and proud about my country, 
and I appreciate people in the community putting together a celebration like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day in Ventura, hundreds showed up at the south lawn of the 
Ventura County Government Center to view a half-size replica of the Vietnam 
Memorial Wall, which has returned to the county for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a worn green Army jacket studded with medals, Richard Brandl of Oak 
View traced the name of a Vietnam buddy who died during battle at the age of 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives me an opportunity to thank the good Lord for being back in my 
country," Brandl said. "I'll take this home and put it by my bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, 14-year-old Paula Chavez of Oxnard cried as she listened to Vietnam 
veteran Tom Van Putten tell of the 13 months he spent in prison and his 21-day 
trek through the Vietnamese jungles to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It breaks my heart to hear him," Paula said. "I know it hurts a lot because 
my grandfather was in Vietnam and he is so traumatized that he can't come here 
and look at the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, as 100 candles burned, members of the Ventura County 
Vietnam Veterans solemnly read the names of the 250 California service members 
whose bodies have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, about 80 people gathered at Plaza Park, where the names of two 
World War II veterans were added to a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, members of the Military Order of the World Wars gathered at 
Conejo Creek Park for a flag ceremony and a flyover by restored World War II 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Simi Valley, Supervisor Howard summed up the sentiments of her fellow 
speakers during an hourlong ceremony at Rancho Tapo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must remember that our very precious freedoms were purchased with the 
lives and sacrifices of our veterans," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meade Phillips, commander of the local chapter of the Marine Corps League, 
also reminded the audience that Veterans Day had once been known as Armistice 
Day, to commemorate the end of World War I on the 11th hour of the 11th day of 
the 11th month 76 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the war to end all wars," Phillips said. "And what a day this would 
have been if that were true."

2 KILLED, 3RD CRITICAL IN ORANGE STREET SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were shot to death and a third was critically wounded Friday night on 
a residential cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police said the victims were sitting in a car outside an apartment 
complex in the 2000 block of North Highland Street, at 9:30 p.m. when several 
people approached on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 One or more of the people on foot opened fire on the car, police said. The 
attackers then fled in a car and remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the victims were all Latino adults. One body was found in the car 
and one outside it. The critically wounded man also was outside the car. None 
of the bullets pierced the windows, suggesting the two men had been trying to 
flee when they were hit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Trey Sirks said: "We don't feel it's gang-related -- it's related to 
something else," although police don't know what. The victims did not appear to 
be local gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No gun was found at the scene, suggesting the victims were not armed. Police 
are looking for a black, late-model Monte Carlo, with the partial California 
license plate number 2CV . . . 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police officers converged on the street, scouring the area with 
flashlights. But they had no suspects as of late Friday night.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: REAL ESTATE DATABASE AIDS HOME HUNTERS 
</P>

<P>
 Recognizing that one of the most arduous tasks of buying a new home can be the 
drive from house to house, San Fernando Valley Realtors have pulled onto the 
information superhighway by creating a computerized listing of 32,000 
properties for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The database can be used by more than 8,000 Realtors across the Valley to 
display pictures and information about homes on a computer terminal rather than 
driving from one property to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more convenient for the buyers and sellers, especially with the 
people coming through their houses," said Mary Lou Williams, assistant vice 
president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. "It cuts down on the 
amount of driving time for buyers and agents, and if someone comes through (to 
look at a house), you know they are a serious buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Realtor association has teamed with Pacific Bell and IBM for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Information in the database also can be fed into a computerized version of 
Thomas Bros. maps, so potential buyers can see schools, parks and other points 
of interest near homes they are considering, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the database is not yet available to the public, but she added 
that the association would like to make it so soon. MAKI BECKER

 The election is over and firefighters say there is no reason for campaign 
signs to be up. 
</P>
<P>
 They want candidates to know a special trash bin just for campaign placards is 
waiting for their arrival behind the Commonwealth fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's cluttered with signs," Capt. Al Meacham said. "We want to make 
sure the signs come down before they become an eyesore. The signs serve a 
purpose before the election, but afterward we want to help clean up the city 
because they're junky looking." 
</P>
<P>
 The dumpster will be at 312 E. Commonwealth Ave. until Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Meacham said only campaign signs should be thrown in the dumpster. He said 
other trash will not be accepted. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: STANTON; NEW COUNCILMEN PLAN TO TARGET 6% UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two challengers elected to the City Council said they will try to usher in a 
reform attitude that consists of cleaning up the city and repealing a 
controversial utility tax that has raised the ire of hard-working residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Donahue, 56, a former council member, and David John Shawver, 47, a 
director of the Regional Occupational Program in Whittier, were the top two 
vote-getters in Tuesday's election, which saw the ousting of incumbents Don 
Martinez and Linda J. Pappas Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said he hoped there weren't going to be too many split votes when the 
new council takes its first vote together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we can be a united front," said Donahue, who received 2,260 
votes, second behind Shawver's 2,745 total. "In order to survive and progress, 
the city is going to have to make unanimous decisions," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawver, a wrestling coach at a Long Beach high school, received 24% of the 
vote while Donahue received 20%. Incumbent Harry Dotson, 68, a retired energy 
conservation officer, won a second term, garnering 19%, or 2,174 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, a one-term incumbent, and Pappas Diaz, who was appointed to replace 
Joe Harris in October, 1993, received the fewest votes in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson said he and the rest of the council, which includes Mayor Sal Sapien 
and councilman William C. Estrada, were going to try their best to work with 
the newcomers. However, he said repealing the 6% utility tax levied a year ago 
is an issue that will have to be looked at seriously before any action is 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a portion of the $1.4 million that was raised from the tax has 
strengthened law enforcement by paying to put extra deputies on the streets.

 When Mario Bustos started elementary school, he faced long odds against 
succeeding: He spoke only Spanish and his father died when he was a baby, 
leaving his mother alone to raise him and nine siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today however, Bustos is first in his class at Santa Ana High School, where he 
is also student body president.He now writes poetry in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of his achievements, Bustos was recently honored by the 
California School Administrators Assn. as one of 18 youngsters statewide who 
typify student success stories, said association spokesman Tom DeLapp. 
</P>
<P>
 The association recently took out a full-page ad in its newspaper, EDCAL, 
featuring a photo of Mario under the headline, "School gave him two languages 
to call his own." 
</P>
<P>
 His success story will also be highlighted during a narrated slide show at the 
association's annual conference later this month, DeLapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos said he was as pleased by the award as he was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know I was up for it and all of a sudden my principal called me 
out of class and said, 'Look you're in the newspaper,' " he said. "It feels 
great that you receive recognition for all your hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Bratcher, principal of Santa Ana High, praised Mario as a natural leader 
who is universally respected by school staff and his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a super kid. He's not an outspoken young man. He's quiet and 
reserved, but when he speaks people listen." JON NALICK

 Justin Newton wanted to be the "Great One," but instead he was just the 
"sent-to-the-office one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bryant Ranch second-grader was disappointed on Halloween when he was 
summoned to the office and ordered to remove his costume, a Los Angeles Kings 
jersey sporting the number of his favorite hockey player, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 But an assembly featuring the Kings' head coach, Barry Melrose, at the school 
next week should help Justin get over the sting of learning his hero's uniform 
is considered gang attire by school district officials and banned. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over Justin's costume started when school officials sent home a note 
asking students to dress as their favorite sports hero for Halloween. The boy, 
whose room is decorated with Kings posters, donned a black-and-silver jersey 
with the number 99 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials with the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, 
someone at the school mistakenly ordered Justin to take the jersey off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake," said Karen Bass, public information officer for the 
district. "There was miscommunication at the school and we feel bad that it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Kings officials felt bad when they learned that Justin thought Gretzky's 
jersey was banned because the hockey star was a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty horrified when we heard that," said Rick Minch, director of 
media relations for the Kings. "We got on the phone right away to arrange an 
assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Minch said Melrose will give two 15- to 20-minute motivational speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll touch on the issue of gangs, but mostly it will be about the 
importance of staying in school and doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Minch said Melrose will bring something for Justin and that the boy has been 
invited to attend a Kings game when the season resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, we want Justin to feel better about being a Kings fan," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 4 AGENCIES TO DECIDE FATE OF BICYCLE PATH 
</P>

<P>
 Four governmental agencies will help decide what to do with the crumbling 
oceanside bicycle path near Seaside Park in Ventura, Assistant City Manager 
Steve Chase said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The path has been eaten away by the ocean and tangled in jurisdictional 
disputes among the city, state parks, California Coastal Commission and the 
County Fair Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase told Ventura's environment committee Thursday that the planning and 
environmental review process will begin in January and will include a series of 
public workshops in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 He said staff members of the four groups had agreed to seek $50,000 from the 
city of Ventura, $50,000 from the Fair Board and $50,000 from the California 
Coastal Conservancy for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have an opportunity here for a living laboratory on coastal 
erosion processes," Chase said. He said the planning and review process would 
consider a range of options, including keeping the bike path where it is and 
moving it inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase also told the committee that the city would appear before the California 
Coastal Commission in December to ask to be released from liability for the 
bike path, which it does not own or manage. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission told the city and Fair Board in October that 
they had two years to remove a rock wall protecting the path from the ocean. 
Chase said Thursday that the city and Fair Board had already fulfilled another 
of the California Coastal Commission's special conditions by detouring the bike 
path into a parking lot. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; NEIGHBORS ARE PLEASED OVER END OF EYESORE 
</P>

<P>
 The once so-called "Lake Hayvenhurst," an eyesore at Ventura Boulevard and 
Hayvenhurst Avenue, has been transformed into a $20-million shopping center in 
less than six months, and both the developer and local homeowners will 
celebrate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted to see it opening," said Gerald A. Silver, president of 
Homeowners of Encino, which had doggedly fought every other developer of the 
site until Rick Caruso offered what they wanted last year -- a single-level 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that the developer will continue to be sensitive to the neighbors 
just north of the site," Silver added. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores at the Encino Marketplace -- which Caruso of Caruso Affiliated Holdings 
described as the largest completed project in Los Angeles since the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake -- will open to the public Thursday. But an 
invitation-only party for 400 people will be held at 6 p.m. Tuesday with Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and such celebrities as Phil Hartman, John 
Goodman, Gary Owens and Steve Allen in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso speeded up the construction schedule for the 95,000-square-foot 
shopping center, which would have normally taken a year, so that the businesses 
could be open for the holiday season. Local homeowner support helped push 
through city approvals for the project within a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shopping center has a Ralphs supermarket, Barnes & Noble bookstore, 
Starbuck's coffeehouse, and Blockbuster video and music store. The center is 
the first development to occupy the site since removal of contaminated soil 
from leaking underground gas tanks in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said the large hole -- which filled with water during rains -- was also 
the remains of a subterranean parking garage. It took 90,000 cubic yards of 
dirt from the Sepulveda Basin to fill in the hole last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several developers lost big bucks until Caruso said, 'I'm coming to the 
community first, not last,' " Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center was built in a Mediterranean style with red roofs, 
hand-carved stone columns and low-fired brick from Mexico, as well as a stone 
fountain. The community had rejected other plans for the site, including a 
six-story hotel and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The designer did a superb job of putting in a single-story facility that is 
compatible with the neighborhood," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my favorite," Caruso said of the shopping center, "because it's just 
been a great experience." ED BOND and KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BUSINESSES OPPOSE LAUSD'S 187 STANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley have joined the opposition 
to the Los Angeles Unified School District's decision to fight Proposition 187 
in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which would deny many state services including schooling for 
illegal aliens, was approved by nearly 60% of voters in Tuesday's election. 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed an executive order Wednesday to carry out the measure, 
but several school districts including the Los Angeles district have filed 
lawsuits in an attempt to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be a breach of trust for these elected officials to go out and 
spend public funds to oppose this measure," said Robert Scott, a spokesman and 
immediate past president of the United Chambers of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school board president Mark Slavkin has argued that the district 
is fighting for the right for free public education as a constitutional 
principle. But Scott counters that the school district should not use public 
funds to fight a measure approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer to Slavkin is to go out and listen to the people that elected him 
and find out what they want him to do," Scott said. "The schools' obligation is 
simply to check the status of kids coming into school. That's something you 
have to do anywhere you go in life." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Chambers of Commerce, made up of representatives of the San 
Fernando Valley's local chambers, voted before the election to support 
Proposition 187 by a 15-10 vote. ED BOND

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RIVER BOTTOM LEADER PACK-RAT ACCEPTS OFFER 
AND PACKS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After living the better part of the last 30 years in a camp beneath the Main 
Street bridge in Ventura, Pack-Rat, the self-proclaimed "Chief of the River 
Bottom," will soon try life in a comfortable midtown Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 55-year-old Pack-Rat became the guest of Mark Conroy, who 
turned over a bedroom of his home to help ease the growing problem of people 
living along the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I are doing this from our hearts," said Conroy, 37, a local 
oil-field worker. "I hope that by taking this action, other people will 
consider getting involved. I know what it's like to be poor, and it's not a lot 
of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pack-Rat, whose real name is Ray Mahala, living in Conroy's home will be 
welcome relief from the harsh environment of the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I want to do is to take a very long, very hot bath," said 
Pack-Rat, a familiar face around Ventura's downtown who is known for his 
head-to-toe leather garb and fur cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, I hope that others living on the river bottom will consider 
getting help and moving out. It's a very rough life. I hope they'll say that 
'if Pack-Rat can do it, I can do it,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack-Rat's moving day was heralded by a news conference called by the social 
service agencies and individual supporters who helped coax the grizzled man 
from his encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the event, Pack-Rat was presented with a cake that was inscribed: "I 
did it my way -- bye bye river bottom -- my home of 30 years." About a dozen 
river bottom residents attended to wish Pack-Rat farewell and to collect 
several bags of donated groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano (Junior) Garcia, founder of the Ventura-based homeless assistance 
organization Helping Hand, said that officials of the Ventura County Commission 
on Human Concerns and Ventura Councilman Jim Monahan also played a part in 
luring Pack-Rat from his camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that helping Pack-Rat move out first was important, because he has 
the respect of so many people that live on the river bottom," Garcia said. "We 
hope that others will see that there are alternatives to their living 
situations and that people do care about their welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack-Rat, who gained his nickname for his skill at rooting valuables from the 
trash, said he now wants to help others leave the river bottom, where 
authorities estimate 200 people live. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOTOR OIL RECYCLING INCREASES IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The list of Ventura County stores willing to buy used motor oil for recycling 
has tripled this year, as the state-sponsored push to reduce waste and prevent 
illegal dumping has taken off, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions by several major companies to begin purchasing recycled oil 
products have contributed to a jump in statewide sales, from 6,000 gallons in 
January to more than 50,000 gallons in October, according to the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program to reclaim used oil began in April, 1993, Ventura County 
residents have recycled 74,000 gallons. And in the past six months, officials 
said, county stores participating in the buy-back program jumped from six to 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking people to sell back their oil to prevent them from dumping it 
illegally," said Liza Smith, a management board spokeswoman. "In addition, it 
helps save our valuable oil resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Stores acting as oil collection centers will pay 16 cents per gallon of used 
oil, a management board official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those centers in Ventura County are Adamson Auto Repair, 214 S. Bryant St., 
Ojai; Chief Auto Parts, 2375 Sycamore Drive, Simi Valley, and 150 W. Laurel 
St., Oxnard; Dowler's Tune-Up & Smog, 820 E. 5th St., Oxnard, and Easy Oil, 77 
Park Lane, Unit F, Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 More are Gabriels Independent Auto Repair, 65 W. Baldwin Road, Ojai; Jiffy 
Lube, 2905 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, 274 Arneill Road, Camarillo, and 
1098 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura; Lube Pit Stop, 2170 1st St., and 4560 Los 
Angeles Ave., both in Simi Valley, and Ojai Valley Imports, 996 E. Ojai Ave., 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include Parnelli Jones Inc. locations at 2787 Daily Drive, Camarillo; 
355 Ventura St., Fillmore; 108 E. Harvard Blvd., Santa Paula; 955 S. A St., 
Oxnard, and 918 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Pep Boys, 2099 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks; Poole Oil Co., 3885 
Vineyard Ave., Oxnard; Tune-Ups Plus, 801 E. Main St., Santa Paula, and Ventura 
Oil Co., 3815 Vineyard Ave., Oxnard. MATTHEW MOSK

 Conrad DeWitte will get to vote to repeal the city's controversial utility tax 
next week and then he will be history. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte's defeat in Tuesday's council election etched his name in city annals 
as the council member with the shortest term. Although he failed to get 
reelected, DeWitte said he is satisfied that he will get to cast a vote next 
week on the 2% tax he promised to repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte was the only candidate endorsed by the Fullerton Recalls Committee to 
win a council seat in last month's special election, which was called to 
replace the three council members who last year voted to levy the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the three recalled officials, Don Bankhead, was elected 
just weeks after stepping down from office. DeWitte will give up his seat in 
December and Bankhead will replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, DeWitte, 46, said he will have done his part to help realize the 
recall committee's main goal: repealing the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of citizens' thoughts and intelligence were just thrown aside when 
the council voted for that tax," he said. "We just couldn't sit still, so we 
had to take action and we succeeded in identifying the issue, crystallizing for 
the voters that the tax was wrong, and changed the way the city does its 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that department managers are following his suggestion to list all the 
services they provide and prioritize them so that the council can see where 
money can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my short presence on the City Council helped a lot," DeWitte said. "I 
don't think anybody is going to come back and say, 'Gee, there's just no way to 
cut costs without keeping the tax.' That's baloney, and everybody knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the tax, which is scheduled to expire in September, 1995, be repealed, 
it would expire in February. The majority of the council is expected to vote to 
repeal it. MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to make themselves more user-friendly, Ventura City Council members 
will consider Monday beginning their weekly meetings earlier and hearing public 
comments at the beginning of the meeting at least once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Council meetings now start at 7:30 p.m. every Monday.In a special workshop 
this fall, council members proposed beginning the meetings at 7 p.m. in the 
hope that the meetings would end earlier. Council meetings now often end 
between 10:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same workshop, council members also suggested changing the time of 
public comments. Now the public can comment on matters on the council's printed 
agenda as the issues are discussed. But comments about other topics cannot be 
made until the end of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, on the first Monday of each month the council would take 
public comment at the beginning of its meeting. CONSTANCE SOMMER

<P>
 A 23-year-old suspected burglar was stabbed in the neck early Friday by a 
Ventura man who confronted the suspect in his house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Byron McCullar of Ventura was stabbed during a fight with the resident 
after McCullar broke through a window in a house in the 1000 block of South 
Saticoy Avenue, Ventura Police Sgt. Roger Nusted said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nusted said the resident was awakened by the sound of glass breaking as 
McCullar entered the home around 1:30 a.m. He confronted McCullar, and a fight 
ensued in which McCullar was stabbed on the left side of the neck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After sustaining the injury, McCullar fled the house on a bicycle, apparently 
bleeding profusely from his neck wound, Nusted said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullar bicycled to a house on the 10000 block of Darling Road, where he 
asked a resident for help. Nusted said the resident called authorities and 
McCullar was arrested on suspicion of burglary and transported to Ventura 
County Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A nursing spokeswoman at the hospital said McCullar was in fair condition late 
Friday. J.E. MITCHELL

 Oxnard police Friday were looking for two males suspected of shouting gang 
slogans at a teen-ager in south Oxnard and then shooting him in the foot as 
they drove by. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 1:45 p.m. Thursday as the victim, a 16-year-old 
youth whose name was not released, walked across Rose Avenue south of Pleasant 
Valley Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two occupants of a light blue pickup truck yelled at the juvenile and shot 
several rounds at him as he ran away, authorities said. The youth was treated 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center and released, police said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PROJECT TALKS NOT STALLED, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Calabasas city official who is negotiating with the developer of the 
proposed Calabasas Park Centre said he has not given up hope that the city will 
reach a compromise with the developer to reduce the size of the controversial 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Lopata also disputed published reports that talks have 
broken down between the city and Kilroy Industries. The two sides on Wednesday 
held an "amiable meeting" to discuss the project, Lopata said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote on the project Dec. 7. Council members, 
who originally were scheduled to vote on the project in August, postponed the 
matter after all five members told the developer they would reject the project 
unless it was scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then formed a committee to work with Kilroy on a compromise to reduce 
the project's size. Lopata represents the council on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries received approval from Los Angeles County, before Calabasas 
incorporated, for a 1.5-million-square-foot office and retail center at the 
corner of Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas. As approved, the project 
includes a 50,000-square-foot retail center that would serve employees of the 
office center. The rest would be office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer now wants to increase the retail center to 200,000 square feet, 
but this cannot be done without the city's approval. Lopata said the developer 
wants the change because there is no market for office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ossola, vice president of Kilroy Industries, did not return phone calls 
this week. But he said in October that talks had broken down and that the 
developer was considering suing the city to resolve the disagreement over the 
project's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talks have never broken down," Lopata said. "To this point, the city has not 
talked about lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossola threatened to sue after he apparently realized that council members 
would not approve the compromise, Lopata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, officials from Kilroy Industries have said they would accept 
no less than a 2,400-seat movie theater as part of the project. The officials 
recently indicated that a 2,000-seat theater would be acceptable under certain 
conditions, according to a source close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries also has agreed to reduce the overall size of the project by 
300,000 square feet for a total of about 1.2 million square feet, Lopata said.  
</P>
<P>
 The theater has been a point of contention for many city residents, who say 
they worry that the theater would bring crime and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always ask for more than you really want," said Ted Rosenquist, a member 
of Save Our City, which is opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the people in the community want the project significantly 
reduced, and many don't want any theater whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would really like is to have the project be consistent with the 
Western historical style of Old Town. . . . The offer to reduce the project by 
300,000 square is insincere because people are not building office space right 
now. That's an illusionary, meaningless offer in today's real estate market."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; JEWISH GROUPS PLAN HANUKKAH FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A candle-lighting ceremony, a children's play and contemporary and traditional 
Jewish music will be among the highlights of the West Valley Hanukkah Festival 
on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for the last day of Hanukkah, the festival will be the first of its 
kind sponsored by the West Valley Community Center, the San Fernando Valley 
Alliance Jewish Federation Council and three local temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Taubman, a singer-songwriter known for his American-style Jewish music, 
will be the featured performer at the free festival, which will be held at 
Temple Aliyah in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Taubman, a choir of canters will perform Hanukkah songs, 
according to Selma Sladek, spokeswoman for the West Valley Jewish Community 
Center. For teen-agers, the festival will host a workshop in tikkun olam , the 
Judaic concept of healing the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project will be making hats and caps for children who have undergone 
chemotherapy for cancer," Sladek said. "The decorated hats will be donated to 
these children." The festival is scheduled for noon to 5 p.m. For more 
information, call (818) 587-3300. MAKI BECKER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; JUST 2 DAYS TO TAKEOFF FOR WWII 'FLYING BOAT'; 
COUNTYWIDE

<P>
 It stands alone at John Wayne Airport, near Campus Drive and MacArthur 
Boulevard -- a majestic, blue and white, 15-ton aircraft that helped turn the 
tables on the Japanese during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But catch a glimpse of it while you can, because it's taking off Monday, 
headed for Phoenix, its winter home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say if it weren't for the PBY-Catalina, the great Japanese fleet -- which 
was en route to Midway, a strategic island in the middle of the Pacific -- 
never would have been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aircraft's pilot did spot the enemy, leading to the first U.S. victory 
in 1942 over the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, residents from across the county turned out in droves to catch a 
glimpse of the plane, nicknamed "The Flying Boat" for its dual capability to 
fly and carry out search and rescue missions at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Many marveled at the aircraft, the same type as the one that led to the 
destruction of four Japanese aircraft carriers and earned Americans their first 
advantage after a terrible defeat at Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love keeping it up," says Larry Mullaly, a member of the 
Confederate Air Force, which has invested a considerable amount of money 
restoring the amphibious plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 22 PBY-Catalinas are left in the United States, of the estimated 3,300 
that were built between 1939 and 1945. The rest were either left overseas after 
the war, destroyed in battle or sold to other countries such as Russia, Brazil 
and England. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most beautiful sight is the aircraft taking off, said Fran Cantor, a 
receptionist in the Martin Aviation building near the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of a tour before the plane rumbles down the runway for the winter is 
$3. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; IRVINE CO. PLANS FOR GATED COMMUNITY CLEAR 
1ST HURDLE 
</P>

<P>
 An Irvine Co. plan to build a 119-home gated community off Dover Drive in 
Newport Beach cleared its first hurdle Thursday by winning approval from the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the commission approved the plan, the Irvine Co. was required to put up 
a bond to be used for widening Dover Drive between Westcliff Drive and 16th 
Street if it becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairwoman Norma Glover and others objected to the street widening and said it 
would invite traffic and may not be necessary even after the Upper Castaways 
development opens. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting up the bond, the Irvine Co. ensures that money will be available 
for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to traffic concerns, residents of the area and adjacent Newport 
Heights told the commission that widening Dover Drive threatens destruction of 
the wetlands below the bluff, and said they wanted assurances that the wetlands 
would be restored if they are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the replacement plan is part of the development agreement, residents 
feared that any destroyed wetlands would be replaced in another area through a 
land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no plan. There is no plan as to how the wetlands are to be 
re-created," 16th Street resident Jan Vandersloot said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he had no quarrel with the Irvine Co. or the development, but 
with the city's plan to widen Dover Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A planned 12-foot-wide bicycle and pedestrian trail around the development, 
which would connect with existing trails in the area, also was a focal point of 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover and other residents of nearby areas objected to the width of the 
proposed path. "I do not think it should be a 12-foot trail," Glover said. "By 
the time we get all this paving up there it's going to be an asphalt city."  
</P>
<P>
 The commission finally determined that the width was necessary because the 
path will also be used to allow police and other emergency vehicles access to 
the area. HOLLY J. WAGNER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; LIBRARY HOURS MOVE TO 5 DAYS A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Library, which was the first free public library in the San 
Fernando Valley, has been so strapped for cash in recent years that it reduced 
operating hours to three days a week and stopped buying new materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a county Board of Supervisors decision earlier this month to 
fund the library deficits, the San Fernando Library announced it will again be 
open five days a week, beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, restoration of the library's budget means that librarians can 
begin purchasing new materials again. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Manager Judith Babka has begun ordering new books, magazines, 
audiocassettes, compact discs and videos. The new materials, Babka said, will 
be selected to cover the needs and interests of a wide variety of local 
residents, in both English and Spanish languages. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the good news, and the library's 80th anniversary, a cultural 
diversity tea will be held at 3 p.m. on Tuesday at the library, located at 1050 
Library St. The San Fernando Middle School's mariachi band will perform and a 
mix of ethnic dishes will be served. 
</P>
<P>
 New operating hours will be: Mondays-Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., 
Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Fridays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. The library 
will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. For further information, call the 
library at (818) 365-6928. TIM MAY

<P>
 The Planning Commission gave approval Thursday to a Taco Bell franchise across 
Pacific Coast Highway from the Balboa Bay Club -- but its future appeared far 
from assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the bluff above the proposed site, primarily on Kings Road, had 
opposed the project for months and some vowed to appeal the decision to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents initially opposed the project because the restaurant would be 
open 24 hours a day. Even the commission's decision to limit operating hours 
from 5 a.m. to 2 a.m. did not appear to satisfy them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The highest point to us as residents and to me personally would be crime and 
security," said John Sturgess, who lives on Cliff Drive above the restaurant 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Other complaints cited potential noise, light and smells. Residents complained 
that on some nights, they can hear customers making orders at a McDonald's a 
half-mile away on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission had put approval on hold for a month to find out if there are 
other restaurants operated 24 hours in the city and whether they generate 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the Police Department recommended tighter limits on the hours 
and that the chain provide a uniformed security guard from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., 
if the 24-hour operations were allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission dropped the security guard provision but ordered that the 
dining areas and parking lot be closed from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., so the 
restaurant will only offer drive-through service from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 4 to 1 to approve the plan. Because of potential 
conflicts of interest, commission Chairwoman Norma Glover and Commissioner Tod 
Ridgeway did not take part in the discussion or vote. Commissioner Anne Gifford 
voted against the restaurant. HOLLY J. WAGNER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NEW TASK FORCE ON HOMELESS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that existing social service programs leave some needy families in 
the lurch, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Elois Zeanah has proposed assigning a 
task force to uncover new ways to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks already hosts a dozen social service agencies in its 
"Under One Roof" building on Hillcrest Drive, Zeanah said she believes the 
network is "overworked and underfunded." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Zeanah hopes to address the needs of families who find 
themselves temporarily homeless. The winter shelter program, which provides hot 
meals and dry beds at local churches and synagogues, serves mainly single men, 
although women and children are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than sleeping in the bushes, but sleeping on the floor with 20 
men . . . is not a permanent solution," said Eileen MacEnery, who eats 
regularly at the winter shelter with her two young daughters. "It's not even a 
temporary solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's proposed task force would look at that issue. The group -- including 
politicians, religious leaders, service providers and citizens -- would also 
examine how to provide more substance-abuse counseling and more help for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Schillo, who helped create the "Under One Roof" social 
services building, said he believes a task force would be redundant. "We've 
been doing these things all along" through various committees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the county has opened more social services offices in Thousand 
Oaks, most recently a public health clinic. And the city has launched an effort 
to help low-income families find affordable child care, Schillo said.

 To MacEnery, who has been homeless five times in the past five years, the 
existing structure is not enough. "We need to rethink what's happening," she 
said, "because nowadays, the homeless are our sisters, our brothers, our 
mothers, our daughters."

 Zeanah will discuss her proposal at Tuesday's council meeting. STEPHANIE SIMON

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PLAN FOR DOWNTOWN

<P>
 The Glendale City Council is scheduled Tuesday to consider setting long-range 
plans in motion for the revamping of its downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote on the proposed Greater Downtown Strategic Plan, a 
document that paves the way for the development of new business districts, a 
town center, a theater district, new parks and open space. 
</P>
<P>
 If and when the plan is adopted, the council will select and appoint the 
members of an implementation committee to prioritize the many recommendations 
in the plan, according to cost and need.  
</P>
<P>
 The strategic plan includes measures for improving traffic and parking, and 
increasing rail, bus and shuttle transit. It also identifies the parts of 
downtown best suited for new offices, retail, entertainment and a proposed 
public-private town center. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategic plan, which took more than a year to complete, was prepared by 
Alex Cooper, an urban planner and architect from New York. The $350,000 price 
tag was paid jointly by the city and Glendale Partners, a business group. STEVE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LIBRARY SEEKS GRANT FOR JOB-SEARCH 
TOOLS

<P>
 To enhance the Simi Valley Library's collection on career development, a 
Ventura County official is urging the Board of Supervisors to accept a federal 
grant to purchase $8,695 in materials for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant would enable the Simi Valley Library to purchase career tests, 
vocational and job-search aids and business directories in both print and 
CD-ROM formats, said Dixie D. Adeniran, library services director. 
</P>
<P>
 The new materials would replace outdated editions and add new titles to the 
library's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the grant would not cover staff salaries or equipment, the county 
would have to contribute about $1,575 to absorb those and other indirect costs, 
Adeniran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, with a population of over 100,000, qualifies for the Major Urban 
Resource Library grant that is administered by the California State Library. No 
matching funds from the county are required. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four of the five county supervisors must vote to receive the funds. 
The board meets Tuesday. GREG RIPPEE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PLAYHOUSE SALE TO RAISE MONEY FOR HOMELESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine handcrafted children's playhouses will be sold to the highest bidder this 
afternoon in a Fashion Island parking lot to raise money for the most desperate 
of children -- those without a home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 p.m. auction -- to be held next to the Hard Rock Cafe -- begins Homeless 
Awareness Week in Orange County, sponsored by four county nonprofit 
organizations.On Monday, a panel of advocates for the homeless will meet at 
noon at the Lakeside Senior Center in Irvine to report on the state of 
homelessness in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The week's activities are coordinated by HomeAid, a five-year-old nonprofit 
organization founded by the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry 
Assn. HomeAid Executive Director Mike Lennon estimates there are between 12,000 
and 15,000 homeless people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of those are children under 17, and half of those are kids under 5," 
Lennon said. "There are some real desperate situations out there." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid has built 19 shelters in Orange County that provide temporary housing 
for homeless families, battered women and the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday's panel discussion, there will be an 11 a.m. groundbreaking 
ceremony at the Lakeside Senior Center for construction of a new, $1.3-million 
safe house in Irvine for battered women. The shelter will be built at an 
undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, HomeAid will hold a dedication ceremony for the ESA Beacon House 
in El Modena, a 12-bed shelter for the homeless mentally disabled. During 
Homeless Awareness Week, all Orange County fire stations will accept donated 
clothing through Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hopeless," Lennon said, "if people will just step forward and help."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER 12-MILE BIKE 
ROUTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to encourage commuters to use different wheels, Thousand Oaks council 
members Tuesday will consider building a new bike route connecting residences, 
jobs and sports centers in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructing the scenic 12-mile loop by re-striping some roads and posting new 
signs will cost less than $7,000, according to a public works report.The route 
will wind down Lynn Road to Reino Road, connect to the Rancho Conejo Industrial 
Park and Amgen building and swing past shopping centers on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members are working on a bike route map that would point out 
landmarks along the loop. They also plan to develop several rest areas 
featuring benches, bike racks, drinking fountains and shady trees -- not to 
mention a posted route map. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the Newbury Park loop would be the city's second major bike 
trail, joining a central-city circuit established two years ago. The council is 
also planning a Westlake-area bike loop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This second loop is long-awaited," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "It's 
fantastic -- a big step in the right direction." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; CITY TO WEIGH PLAN FOR QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will decide on Tuesday whether to establish in Sherman Oaks 
an emergency recovery area. If approved, it would be the first such area to be 
created in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In an official emergency recovery area, the approval process for a 
redevelopment plan is greatly streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $18.8-million redevelopment project for the area would funnel 
funds into the community for rebuilding earthquake-damaged residential and 
commercial properties and for making infrastructure improvements. The money 
would come from bond sales that would be repaid by an expected increase in 
local property tax revenues due to the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The 570-acre area is roughly bordered by the Ventura Freeway, the San Diego 
Freeway, Ventura Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other proposed redevelopment areas -- located in areas surrounding 
Northridge, Reseda, North Hollywood, Pacoima and East Hollywood -- will be 
considered by the City Council beginning next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks project has pitted the area's homeowners, who oppose the 
redevelopment plan created by the Community Redevelopment Agency, against 
merchants who favor it.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday at 9:30 a.m., the influential Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. will 
hold a press conference at which members plan to deliver a petition opposing 
the proposal to City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. Scott Harvey, co-chairman of 
the association's CRA Study Committee, said his group would spend the weekend 
gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Zev is laboring under the misimpression about what the community 
response is, because it's filtered through his staff," Harvey said. "So we're 
having the press conference to provide to him data which we have collected."  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has not yet stated his position on the proposal, but this week he 
suggested that he is leaning toward backing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving in the direction of implementing it and supporting it," 
Yaroslavsky said this week. "We haven't made a final decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman has said he will approve a redevelopment project only if the 
community wants it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two segments of the community, so far, have expressed divergent views. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners group feels the proposal does not have adequate limits on the 
redevelopment agency's powers of eminent domain and could allow too much money 
to be spent on infrastructure improvements at the expense of residential 
rebuilding. The group also wants a cap added to the plan on the administrative 
overhead portion of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce believes the proposal provides sorely 
needed funds to rebuild housing in the community while adequately limiting the 
agency's powers of eminent domain and planning. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MAYOR PRAISES CITY'S ECONOMIC PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Mayor Bill Wiggins praised the city's economic progress in the past 
year during a brief state of the city address on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the Burbank Airport Hilton, he pointed with pride to a balanced 
budget of more than $330 million for the 1994-95 fiscal year and a growing 
number of businesses opening in the Burbank Village area in downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the California recession and massive layoffs by the Lockheed Corp. in 
recent years have dealt powerful blows to a city that is still struggling to 
recover from them, Wiggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that the state and federal budget crises have affected local 
government," he told an audience of city officials and business 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been forced to fend for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford, literally and figuratively, to go back to business as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of videos that began with the mayor mimicking Johnny Carson by 
walking onto "The Tonight Show" stage as a host, Wiggins showcased the most 
notable business expansion efforts in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Studios such as Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Co., for example, have 
constructed eye-catching buildings that opened this year or will open soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, with Mickey Mouse at his side, made an 
appearance in one video, declaring pleasure over his company's base being in 
Burbank. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; LACK OF SUPPORT CLOSES TEEN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of the month, a simple filing of paperwork will make legal an 
unpleasant reality for youth in Glendale: The Glendale Teen Support Center is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the first programs, I felt, that asked the youth what they 
thought they needed," said Don Sweetnam, president of the center's board of 
directors, who voted last month to end the program because of a lack of funding 
and community support. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which opened almost exactly two years ago in a refurbished former 
dental office on Lexington Drive, had Ping-Pong and pool tables, a television 
room, soda fountain and study room where teen-agers could hang out, relax and 
make friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of money forced the center to close in February, and although 
organizers had hoped to reopen in August, a $100,000 fund-raising drive only 
brought in $48,000 in pledges and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the group has written letters saying that pledges will not be 
collected and its leaders continue to meet with those who made cash donations 
to determine whether the money will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Those donations, only a small part of the $48,000, could go to the Glendale 
YWCA or to a community foundation fund for youth programs in Glendale, 
depending on the donors' wishes, Sweetnam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it to linger on," Sweetnam said. "We needed to measure the 
community support of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors voted to disband on Oct. 10. The formal paperwork 
dissolving the support center is to be filed with the state by the end of 
November, Sweetnam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're back to where we started," said Sweetnam. "I'm very concerned 
that the teens of Glendale don't have anywhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center closed its doors, there have been reports of teen-agers 
hanging out more at local libraries and shopping centers, causing complaints 
from businesses, Sweetnam said. But at least some of the ideas started by the 
support center will continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is a peer conflict management program in which teen-agers were 
taught to understand the root causes of conflict such as racial bias and 
prejudice. That program has spread throughout the city's school district, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's problems with ethnic and racial conflicts could be worse than they 
are now had it not been for the influence of the support center, Sweetnam said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is unsure about why the group lost community support. "I don't know 
that answer," he said. "But teens are not a very popular population." 
</P>
<P>
 When the group started, it surveyed teen-agers and found out that they 
especially needed a place they could call their own and where they could be 
listened to without being judged. The center was created to meet that need, 
Sweetnam said. ED BOND

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 3 COUNCIL WINNERS PLEDGE COHESION

<P>
 All three winners in the City Council race said this week they will work to 
preserve the rustic flavor of the community while trying to revitalize 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are going to have a pretty good dynamic," said David M. Swerdlin, 
who finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt T. Hart, a retired sheriff's captain, and incumbent Gil Jones easily 
took the top two spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rest assured, we are going to be a cohesive group," Hart said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 For the third seat, Swerdlin had to outpace Carlos Negrete, who mounted a 
last-minute mailer barrage and finished only 267 votes behind, according to 
unofficial results. 
</P>
<P>
 Swerdlin said he would seek to shore up city code enforcement. He said he 
views himself as a consensus builder between downtown pro-development interests 
and historical preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said his first goal would be to arrange a way for developers to meet 
with the council in a workshop setting to discuss cooperating on proposals 
early in the planning stages and going over the city's strict building 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want developers to understand at the outset that there will be a difficult 
road, but we will try to help them get their project through the process if 
they have a project that is acceptable," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council winners also said they intend to move forward on approving a 
conceptual plan for a downtown inn and retail complex on five acres of 
city-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete, who sent about 15,000 mailers the weekend before the election, 
campaigned on a platform of cutting government waste and being a watchdog 
against what he called an "old-boy network." 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete said he would continue to monitor city government, but added he was 
pleased that Swerdlin had won a seat. JEFF BEAN

 Two men who bought homes in the exclusive Marbella development have been 
awarded $1.14 million in a jury trial in which they contended that inadequate 
grading work made their custom lots unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brakke and Al Carollo Jr. won the award last week after an eight-day trial 
in Santa Ana.A Superior Court jury deliberated for about six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men filed suit against Sukut Construction Inc. after their homes were 
damaged by land slippage. 
</P>
<P>
 The gated Marbella community was built in the late 1980s. Brakke paid $1.6 
million for his home, while Carollo paid $900,000, said attorney Philip W. 
Green with the Newport Beach firm of Hamilton & Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury award -- $752,102 for Brakke and $396,006 for Carollo -- is for house 
repairs, compensation for relocation expenses and expert investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, soils engineer and landscaping contractor, who were also named 
in the suit, earlier settled out of court for $362,500.

 George Dale, an attorney for Sukut, could not be reached for comment.JEFF BEAN

 The San Juan Historical Society today will commemorate the renovation of a 
house that was under threat of the wrecking ball a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hankey/Rowse cottage, at 28232 Ortega Highway, was built around 1883, 
according to historical society members. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the City Council did not want the house razed as part of a proposal 
for a housing subdivision because the cottage is on the city's list of historic 
and cultural landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 A local contractor and his wife bought the cottage and one of the subdivision 
lots, where they relocated the structure and renovated it. 
</P>
<P>
 During a noon ceremony, a bronze plaque will be installed at the house. The 
public is invited.

 With her leadership days dwindling, City Councilwoman Lida Lenney, for eight 
years a champion of environmental preservation, is proposing that about 445 
acres of city-owned open space be deemed parkland to lessen the chance that it 
will be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenney will recommend Tuesday that the city take the initial steps to amend 
planning documents so "our open-space resources would be protected in 
perpetuity," a memo to her colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there are no assurances that those properties will remain as 
natural open space forever," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city has been fiercely protective of the environment for most of the 
past two decades, the council's majority voting block -- Lenney, Robert F. 
Gentry and Ann Christoph -- will all step down Dec. 6. Lenney and Gentry did 
not run for reelection and Christoph was defeated at the polls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have feared that the newly elected, more conservative 
leadership, would be less diligent about protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But new council members have said that they too intend to preserve undeveloped 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to see the selling off of open space," top vote-getter Steve 
Dicterow, said after his election. "You're not going to see development." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed parkland includes 11 acres known as the "Phillips property," near 
the Top of the World community; about 325 acres in Laguna Canyon north of El 
Toro Road, which includes the largest of three natural lakes in the area; and 
the "Brooks parcel," a ridgeline of about 110 acres between Top of the World 
and the Arch Beach Heights neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine future city councils chopping it up for development," City 
Manager Kenneth C. Frank said Friday. "Lida just wants to make it as airtight 
as possible." LESLIE EARNEST

GROUP SAYS VALLEY MAY GET AN INTERIM COUNCIL MEMBER; CITY HALL: COALITION SAYS 
THERE IS SUPPORT TO APPOINT A REPLACEMENT FOR ZEV YAROSLAVSKY FOR THE SEVEN 
MONTHS THE 5TH DISTRICT WILL BE WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A coalition of San Fernando Valley residents and business leaders said Friday 
that the City Council may be willing to appoint an interim representative to 
replace departing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky until a replacement is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently formed Coalition for a Voting Representative for the Fifth 
District met outside Yaroslavky's Sherman Oaks office to ask that the council 
appoint a voting representative during the seven months that the district will 
be without representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hung a large yellow sign on the door that read: "Vacant as of Dec. 
5, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence that their campaign has begun to make an impact, members of the 
group noted that council President John Ferraro, who has adamantly opposed the 
idea of an appointed representative, has said recently he would support the 
appointment if it is favored by a council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, made up of influential business and homeowners' groups, also 
said Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents nearby West Valley communities, 
has voiced her support for an interim representative. A Chick spokesman 
confirmed Friday that she backs the group's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing more and more support as we show them this coalition of people 
who want representation," said Fred Gaines, a member of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn., one of several business and homeowners' organizations that make 
up the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, however, has yet to offer names of any prospective appointees, 
saying only that they are drafting a list of criteria that an interim 
representative must meet. Most importantly, they said the representative cannot 
be a candidate for the vacant council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, whose district stretches from quake-battered Sherman Oaks to 
Westwood, said he supports the appointment of a temporary replacement but 
admits it would be a difficult idea to sell to his council colleagues without 
an announced candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council should listen to the will of the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky leaves office Dec. 4 to become the newest county supervisor. 
Unless an interim representative is appointed, his council seat will remain 
vacant until a successor is elected in a special election in June. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have thus far decided to leave the seat vacant, naming Ron 
Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst, to run the day-to-day operations 
of the district. Deaton, however, will not have a vote on matters before the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, when Yaroslavsky won the supervisor's seat left vacant by Ed 
Edelman, community leaders in the district, particularly in the Valley, have 
asked for the appointment of an interim representative who can vote at council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the coalition said the need for a voting representative was 
heightened by the Northridge earthquake and the fear that the quake-damaged 
district will be neglected by the other 14 members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to rebuild Sherman Oaks from a quake," said Richard Close, 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "We need a leader to represent 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress their argument, Gaines noted that during a recent meeting a South 
Los Angeles councilman persuaded the council to cut Valley communities out of 
some much-needed housing repair funds while Yaroslavsky and two other Valley 
council members were absent. The action was reversed later when the Valley 
representatives returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of being afraid it will happen," he said. "It has 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The influential Ferraro has vehemently opposed the appointment of an interim 
representative, saying Deaton has proven experience and knowledge to serve as 
caretaker of the district until a permanent council member is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, Ferraro appears to have softened his position, saying he 
would not object to a replacement as long as it is supported by a majority of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to an Encino resident who asked about the possibility of making 
such an appointment, Ferraro sent out a letter Friday, saying, "The fact 
remains that if someone is successful in marshaling eight votes, that person 
will become an interim council member of the district."

AFTER TOUGH FIGHT, ZEANAH TO OFFER IDEAS FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM; THOUSAND OAKS: 
THE REELECTED COUNCILWOMAN DECRIES THE HIGH SPENDING AND UNCIVIL TONE OF RECENT 
RACES. SHE HERSELF SPENT $21,000 AND SHARPLY ATTACKED HER RIVALS. 
</P>

<P>
 After surviving a brutal reelection battle, Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said 
Friday that she will ask the community to consider campaign reforms aimed at 
restoring small-town civility to Thousand Oaks races. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disgusted by this year's expensive and nasty campaign tussle, Zeanah said she 
would like to discuss several reforms, such as imposing spending caps on 
candidates and creating an ethics commission to monitor mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 But she emphasized that she is not yet ready to formulate concrete proposals. 
First she wants to hear from her colleagues on the dais and her constituents on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do see a need for campaign reform," Zeanah said. "The price of running for 
office has exploded, and negative campaigning has reared its ugly head in our 
city. . . . I'm asking, is there anything we can do about it? And if so, do we 
want to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah herself spent more than $21,000 on her successful reelection bid, 
including $14,500 in loans from her husband, James. And her lone campaign 
mailer contained sharp attacks on five rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, she did it, too. She did flyers just as bad as everyone else," said 
Michael Friedman, a financial services manager and unsuccessful council 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In her pamphlet, Zeanah accused Councilwoman Judy Lazar of abandoning her 
environmental platform after her election four years ago. She tagged retired 
businessman Marshall Dixon as a candidate who "puts developers first." And she 
identified Michael Markey as a "policeman in Compton, a city unable to control 
its crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending her own mailer as factual, not dirty, Zeanah said she would rather 
not rehash the exhausting campaign. Instead, she said, she wants to focus on 
the future -- and on preventing a fresh round of vicious, costly propaganda 
from spoiling the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers suggested that campaign reform alone will not do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said, council members must set an example for the '96 candidates 
by conducting themselves with dignity in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the new council members can get along better and be more harmonious, that 
will set the tone for the next election," said Marilyn Holton, a trustee of the 
Board of Realtors Political Action Committee, which doled out $2,600 to four 
candidates in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Thousand Oaks council candidates already commit to a so-called Code of 
Fair Campaign Practices, promising to focus on issues and renounce personal 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the recent campaign featured much-publicized smear sheets, 
anonymous hit pieces and an overall knock-down, drag-out atmosphere that 
appalled many longtime residents. The result, Zeanah said, was "more typical of 
Chicago-style politics" than the traditional Thousand Oaks campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 To stamp out "dirty tricks," Zeanah said she would like to set up a watchdog 
ethics commission.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to appoint intelligent, nonpartisan people to ensure that if 
this type of negative campaigning and character assassination goes on, we can 
hold the people responsible for it accountable," Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eagerness to consider campaign reform won instant approval from one former 
candidate and considerable skepticism from three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman, who earned just under 3% of the vote 
this week, said he plans to form a political reform committee to push for 
spending limits in council races. He was able to raise only about $3,000 -- not 
enough for mailers or television ads -- and complained of being out-muscled by 
candidates with richer treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "To spend the kind of money that was spent on this campaign means buying an 
election. And for a city the size of Thousand Oaks, that's ridiculous," 
Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, the candidate who spent the most money, dentist Greg Cole, landed 
in ninth place, winning less than 6% of the vote despite spending $37,000. 
Lagging well behind Cole was Friedman, who dedicated at least $27,000 to the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a case in point," Cole said, "that just because you spend the most amount 
of money doesn't mean you're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The highest vote getter in this week's election, firefighter Andy Fox, did 
spend a big chunk of cash, pouring more than $22,000 into television 
commercials, newspaper ads and campaign flyers. But he said he believes his 
ability to raise that much money proved he was a viable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox angrily refuted Zeanah's assertions that "special interest" groups, such 
as auto dealers and real estate brokers, have tried to buy council candidates 
with hefty contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A special interest is an individual or group that has special expertise on an 
issue, and that in itself is not bad," Fox said. "You should try to get as much 
information as you can from them. What's bad is if you allow them to influence 
your decisions based on (reasons) other than information. That would be plain 
dishonest."

EQUESTRIAN CENTER IN LAND FEUD; HANSEN DAM: ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS USING 
HALF OF FACILITY'S PARKING LOT TO REPLANT NATIVE VEGETATION. OPERATOR THREATENS 
TO SHUT DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's been a long, hard ride, says 65-year-old ex-jockey Eddie J. Milligan, who 
won a contract from Los Angeles in 1989 to develop the decrepit Hansen Dam 
Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Using profits from the sale of another equestrian center, Milligan, backed by 
a wealthy San Francisco investor, built the old 20-acre Hansen facility into a 
handsome enterprise, complete with 200 horse stalls, 16 paddocks, arenas, 
clubhouse and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays the city $2,500 a month in rent and says he's never wrung a profit 
from the center, wedged between the Big and Little Tujunga washes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milligan again has become embroiled in a another land-use dispute with the 
U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land because it is in a protected 
flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he's thrown down the gauntlet before, the most recent action by 
the corps has prompted Milligan to threaten once again to close down the 
popular facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, corps staff spiked a line of wooden stakes down the center of a 
dirt lot used for trailer parking in the equestrian center, declaring the area 
a "biological mitigation buffer zone." In plain English, this means the area 
must be replanted with native vegetation to make up for the facility's 
incursion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They annihilated 50% of my parking," Milligan said, his blue eyes ablaze. "I 
sure as hell can't hold events without a place to park the trailers. That lot 
was in the plans sent to the corps years ago, and now they're telling me it 
can't be there. I can't do business anymore with these people. I can't trust 
them."  
</P>
<P>
 Milligan sent a letter this week to Los Angeles city parks commissioners and 
the City Council demanding compensation for the $3 million he and his partner 
have invested in the center. He contends that the city is not making good on 
its pledge to lease him all the acreage he needs to run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the feisty jockey is open to negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city quits jerking me around," he said, "gives me the land I bid on 
and gives me a 30-year lease, I'll think about staying. But it had better do 
something fast."  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Army Corps of Engineers owns the land and has authority over its 
development, it leases the property to the city Department of Recreation and 
Parks. Milligan rents the land from the city and thinks it should pay him back 
for his investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract between Milligan and the city has been extended on a monthly 
basis since 1989. Since then, Milligan has paid for numerous improvements, 
including planting more than 400 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of local equestrian groups and others said that if Milligan leaves, it 
will be a huge loss to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Hoover, owner of Foothill Saddlery, a tack shop near Hansen Dam, boards 
her thoroughbred at the center. "Eddie had plans to hold big shows there once 
everything was settled. It's already a boon to the area," Hoover said. "If it 
goes, you're going to have a lot of displaced horses. There's no other boarding 
place nearby, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Tatum, general manager for the city parks commissioners, did not return 
several phone calls this week. But Tom Petrique, a management analyst for the 
department, said the city is aware of the corps's recent action and Milligan's 
threatened departure. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not comment on Milligan's compensation request. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buffer zone we staked out in his parking lot is called an 'after-the-fact 
environmental assessment,' " said Richard Vaughn, ecologist for the corps's Los 
Angeles district. "It's usually not done this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental studies generally are completed before development takes place 
on federally owned land, Vaughn said. But, corps officials said, Milligan so 
rapidly developed the site that the all studies were not completed before the 
facility was up and operating. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including Ted Carr, director of operations for the corps Los Angeles 
unit, disputes the work and dedication Milligan has put into the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's created a well-maintained, fantastic facility," Carr said. "But he's so 
aggressively developed it that he proceeded without prior written approval. The 
law says we have to mitigate whatever is lost during development. . . . The 
city accepts the buffer zone. It was put out for public comment, and Milligan 
never commented." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said that while the zone eats into the parking lot, it won't stop 
Milligan from operating. "He might have to have some remote satellite parking," 
Carr said. "This is nothing new, though." 
</P>
<P>
 But some, including Rose Castaneda, a former aid to Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) were surprised by the corps' recent action, which comes one 
year after a truce of sorts was reached between Milligan and the corps. In the 
past the Milligan and corps have sparred over similar issues of development 
versus land preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had everything taken care of," said Castaneda, who on Berman's 
behalf earlier had arranged a meeting between the corps and Milligan. "Eddie 
has bent over backward to comply. I can't explain this recent action." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the corps nor the city could say whether an agreement would be reached 
with Milligan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the way it's going to be, then fine. We've been here for five years 
without a contract," Milligan said. "Horses are the love of my life, but this 
is more than one human being can take."

TRUSTEES WANT THEIR MEETINGS TELEVISED; SCHOOLS: THOUSAND OAKS BOARD MEMBERS 
SAY THEY LACK FUNDING TO COVER THE ESTIMATED $50,000 ANNUAL COST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks school board members want their meetings televised on a local 
cable channel to increase community awareness of the school district's 
activities, trustees said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But to do so, the Conejo Valley Unified School District must find a way to pay 
the estimated $50,000 annual price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to be investigated," said board President Dolores Didio, who 
suggested the idea during Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to televise school board meetings, which are held twice a month, 
have been raised periodically in past years but were usually scrapped because 
of cost, Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea resurfaced recently during the school board election campaign, when 
parents and candidates criticized trustees for not communicating with 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been pursued and dropped," Didio said. "Maybe it is time." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said the key to making the proposal a reality is finding funding 
sources such as grants, contributions from local businesses or a cable company 
willing to produce the meeting broadcasts for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a study is what we should begin with," trustee Richard Newman said, 
explaining that the board needs to evaluate community interest and alternative 
funding before making any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said live televised meetings would inform the community, but he said he 
was not willing to take money away from classroom programs to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimate it would cost about $50,000 to buy and install 
cameras and videotape equipment to televise the meetings. In addition, the 
district would have to pay annual maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage in the game, any money we take away from the classroom isn't 
well-spent," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community interest in televised school board meetings has been mixed. A recent 
survey of Conejo Valley families found that only 40.9% would be interested in 
viewing board meetings on local television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea," said parent Mary Beth Eisenhard. "It makes it more 
accessible. . . . TV is the way into our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley school board meetings are regularly broadcast live on cable 
television, and Moorpark school board meetings are occasionally televised. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Robin Westmiller, who was a school board candidate this fall, has 
pushed for televised meetings in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something the community needs," she said. "Parents can't get out at 
night to go to a meeting. They are taking care of their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected board member Elaine McKearn, who will take the fifth seat on the 
board in December, said she opposes spending district money to televise 
meetings, but agrees that it would educate parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea, but I wonder about the cost," she said. McKearn suggested 
that trustees seek volunteers, possibly even students, to record the meetings 
on videotape for rebroadcast on a local cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Didio agreed, but said she was optimistic that money could be found to 
broadcast the meetings live. "If you really want something to happen," she 
said, "you can find ways to make it happen."

ACCUSED GRAPPLING WITH OFFICER'S DEATH; TRAGEDY: 'I'VE GOT A BROKEN HEART,' 
SAYS MARCO VILLEGAS RAMIREZ, 51, WHO IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY IN THE CRASH THAT 
KILLED LA HABRA POLICEMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Marco Villegas Ramirez sat behind a plexiglass window in a jail visiting room 
Friday wondering how in his middle age he could be caught up in a tragedy that 
threatens to wreck his life. 
</P>
<P>
 With shoulders bent and head bowed, and his eyes frequently filling with 
tears, Ramirez, 51, talked about how it feels to be accused of killing a young 
police officer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a broken heart, a break in my soul," he said. "My mind is marked 
with this tragedy. . . . I would ask his family for forgiveness for all the 
pain I caused them involuntarily. I'd ask them for compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is accused of being drunk when he allegedly ran a red light on 
Halloween and smashed into La Habra Police Officer Michael Osornio's cruiser, 
pinning Osornio inside. Osornio, 26, died an hour after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio had joined the department 14 months ago after putting himself through 
the police academy and was recently engaged to be married to his high school 
sweetheart. He is the first La Habra officer to be killed on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a La Mirada sheet-metal worker and father of three, was by all 
accounts a quiet, hard-working man who acquaintances say often warned against 
drinking and driving. Family members say he never drank to excess. His 
colleagues say he never joined them for drinks after work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he faces a four- to 10-year prison sentence if convicted of gross 
vehicular manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty Thursday and is being held at the 
Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he cannot remember the accident, how he got into the car, where 
he was going or why. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police said that this thing happened. What can I say?" Ramirez said. "My 
mind doesn't hold this. It has disconnected from the reality. Maybe for others 
this thing would be nothing, but for me, it's too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you might have a fight with a friend and you do or say something 
you regret," said Ramirez, choking back tears. "But when something happens 
where you didn't have any intention . . . where you didn't even know the person 
and the person represents the law . . . I respect the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said his Buick station wagon was traveling 60 m.p.h., weaving and 
bouncing off a curb, when it broadsided Osornio's cruiser at the intersection 
of Beach and La Habra boulevards. Authorities said Ramirez's blood-alcohol 
level later registered at .18, more than twice the legal limit of .08. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a legal immigrant from Mexico, said he has received support from 
friends and family. His wife and two of his sons, ages 25 and 22, are living in 
Hidalgo, Mexico. A third son, 18, recently visited him at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where he had been recovering from the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers at Lindblade Metalworks Inc., where he has worked for the past four 
years, said that in recent months Ramirez had been beset by personal problems. 
Ramirez had told colleagues he had been evicted from a Monterey Park apartment 
about six months ago because of problems with his son's friends, who were 
considered troublemakers by the landlord. Since then, Ramirez had been sleeping 
on a couch in a vacant office at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said any problems he has had in the past are nothing compared to the 
problems he faces now. If he is released someday from custody, Ramirez said, he 
plans to go back to work, back to earning money for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what message he would convey to others from his jail cell, he said, "I 
recommend with all my soul, with all my heart -- never drink and drive."POLICE

ALZHEIMER'S OUTREACH MISSES MANY MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Although former President Ronald Reagan's recent announcement that he has 
Alzheimer's is expected to heighten public awareness of the disease, a San 
Diego State University researcher told a medical conference here Friday that 
little is now being done to reach and help the disease's minority victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a phrase that Alzheimer's is an equal opportunity disease," said 
Ramon Valle, a genealogy instructor in San Diego State's School of Social Work. 
"Yet, most of the multicultural outreach is in its infancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is a lack of adequate funding, said Valle, who spoke to 
more than 200 people at the Orange County Alzheimer's Assn. annual conference. 
Volunteer Alzheimer's groups, such as Orange County's, end up translating 
English materials into Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and other languages, Valle 
said. Beyond that, resources are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle also warned the audience that Tuesday's passage of Proposition 187 could 
have an impact on Alzheimer's patients in the Spanish-speaking community. 
</P>
<P>
 While a Superior Court in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the measure's 
implementation, Valle said the proposition may make it even harder to reach and 
help older immigrants who have lived in the United States for long periods, but 
never became legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand that a family may be here legally, but they have 
mothers and fathers or grandfathers who just never got proper immigration 
documents," Valle said. "And some of these families may think that Alzheimer's 
outreach people, because of the questions we ask about family history, are 
enforcing (Proposition) 187." 
</P>
<P>
 When Reagan announced he had Alzheimer's disease, the Los Angeles Alzheimer's 
chapter logged 30,000 telephone calls, conference organizers said. In Orange 
County, "our phones were ringing off the hook," said Linda Scheck, associate 
director for the Orange County Alzheimer's Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the announcement failed to trigger similar reaction from the 
Spanish-speaking community, said Sonia P. Garcia, executive director for the 
Orange Adult Day Services Center in Orange, and a volunteer member of the local 
chapter's Multi-Ethnic Committee Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I answer all the phones when inquiries come into the chapter in Spanish," 
Garcia said. "And we've had no one asking about Alzheimer's in the wake of 
President Reagan's announcement. I just don't think President Reagan was a 
figure the Latino community could identify with." 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's is believed to impact about 10% of the general population. But the 
fact of the matter is "no real data exists for Latinos or other minority 
communities," Valle said after his speech on "Multi-Cultural Outreach: 
Preparing for California's Future." 
</P>
<P>
 "With Alzheimer's," Valle said, "the response of the families is unique in a 
cultural way. But under the microscope, the brain looks the same with respect 
to the neurological destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the 15-member Orange County advisory board was formed a year ago 
and includes residents of the Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese 
communities. They have spent the past 12 months translating English materials 
into different languages. Nonwhites represent 35% of the county's total 
population of 2.4 million, according to the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has been trying to come up with funds to help nonwhite patients, 
as well as a list of physicians and medical care providers who speak different 
languages and are willing to help them, Garcia said.

TV SHOW TO RE-ENACT YORBA LINDA HOLDUP; CRIME: POLICE HOPE 'AMERICA'S MOST 
WANTED' WILL HELP SOLVE ALPHA BETA ROBBERY, STORE MANAGER'S SLAYING LAST JULY.

<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy wanted in the fatal shooting of a 
grocery store manager here in July will be a subject of tonight's episode of 
"America's Most Wanted."  
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect Stephen Moreland Redd in the shooting of Timothy Eugene McVeigh 
during a holdup of the Alpha Beta on Yorba Linda Boulevard.The former deputy is 
also wanted in connection with two other robberies.  
</P>
<P>
 Ivey Van Allen, publicist for the show, said, "One of the interesting parts 
about this case is that Redd is an ex-cop. We consider an ex-cop more dangerous 
because of their knowledge of firearms and how to get around the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-minute segment will include a re-enactment of the robbery and shooting, 
which was filmed on location at the store. The segment also will feature 
interviews with a cashier and a security guard who were there that night. 
Pictures of Redd, who police say is known to disguise his appearance, will be 
shown at the end of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives with the Brea Police Department, which patrols Yorba Linda, 
contacted the producers of the show about filming a segment on Redd, who was 
identified as a suspect two weeks after the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange police said the other two robberies for which Redd is sought occurred 
in the same shopping center. In both of those, the robber wore a long, dark 
wig. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Allen said viewers of the show have called in tips that have lead to the 
capture of 325 fugitives.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope our viewers can help police out," Van Allen said.

STUDENT PILOT DIES IN HELICOPTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old student pilot who had taken off from Van Nuys Airport was killed 
when his helicopter crashed Friday afternoon for unknown reasons near Six Flags 
Magic Mountain, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred at about 3:45 p.m. at the edge of a large plowed field west 
of the amusement park, said Lt. Bill Dunn of Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station. The nose of the helicopter apparently struck a 10-foot hill at high 
speed, strewing wreckage up to 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preliminarily, it appears as though he may have been practicing landing and 
he didn't make it," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the scene said it was also possible the helicopter had some kind 
of engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot's name was not made public Friday, pending notification of next of 
kin, Dunn said. The aircraft took off from Pacific Shore Aviation, a helicopter 
instruction school in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter burst into flames after the crash, igniting a small brush fire 
nearby and burning the pilot beyond recognition, said Mark Siegal, a helicopter 
pilot for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Most of the aircraft, except 
for the crumpled frame, was consumed by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters 20 to 25 minutes to reach the crash site because some of 
the dirt roads leading to the remote field were impassable due to recent rain. 
Siegal said he could see six-foot flames and "a lot of black smoke" when he 
sighted the wreckage from the air about 10 minutes after the crash. But he said 
the sparse vegetation kept the fire from spreading more than a few hundred feet 
from the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were continuing to investigate the cause of the crash 
Friday night. Sgt. Patrick Hunter said the pilot apparently did not make 
distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegal said the remote area is commonly used by student pilots allowed to make 
solo flights. The pilot was flying a Hughes 300, a three-seat helicopter 
commonly used for flight instruction.

GENETIC DISORDER BELIEVED CAUSE OF STUDENT'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A College of the Canyons student who was found unconscious behind the campus 
bookstore this week died of a ruptured blood vessel apparently caused by a 
genetic disorder and not from an accidental fall as originally thought, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertine Oxciano, 21, of Santa Clarita was discovered lying face down in the 
road moments after her brother dropped her off at the community college Tuesday 
morning.She died minutes later at a local hospital. Police said it appeared she 
had slipped on the rain-slicked road and hit her head. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a coroner's official said Friday that Oxciano died from an aortic 
aneurysm caused by a hereditary disorder called Marfan syndrome. The aorta is 
the main artery that circulates blood through the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically what happened is it ruptured," said Patti Fleetwood, a spokeswoman 
for Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. "More often than not, 
it's fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 Marfan syndrome causes people to be abnormally tall and often leads to 
problems with joints, the respiratory system and connective tissues, Fleetwood 
said, adding that respiratory problems may have caused Oxciano's ruptured 
artery.

STALKER GETS LIFE FOR SLAYING EX-O.C. WOMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man has been sentenced to life in prison for the stabbing death of a former 
girlfriend, whom he pursued from Laguna Beach and stalked for weeks before the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Hilton Smith, 31, was sentenced Thursday to prison for "the rest of his 
natural life" by King County Superior Court Judge Brian Gain. The maximum under 
the state's standard sentencing range was 29 years, and Deputy Prosecutor Robin 
Fox recommended a 58-year term, citing the brutality of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gain said his sentencing decision was based on Smith's cruelty to the victim. 
He described the defendant as a lifelong manipulator with "no moral compass" 
and said he would be a threat to society if he was ever released. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Shifflet, 35, was ambushed on a bike path as she walked to work April 
2, and stabbed five times. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Smith at a Laguna Beach health-food store and for a short time they 
were romantically involved. Smith was homeless at the time and Shifflet let him 
stay with her, but he soon began hitting and choking her. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to Seattle a year ago to get away from him, staying with a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith followed, hitchhiking there in March. He cultivated a relationship with 
the cousin and at one point was staying in the same house as Shifflet -- 
unknown to her. She awoke one morning to find him sitting on her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifflet got a no-contact order from police March 16, but Smith continued 
calling her at work and showing up at her house. He told the cousin he would 
kill himself without Shifflet, but later talked of blinding Shifflet with ink 
and threatened to kill her, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Shifflet's neighbors witnessed the stabbing and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith made a rambling statement to the court in which he apologized to 
Shifflet's family.

10 CHEMICAL DRUMS ARE FISHED FROM BACK BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine 55-gallon drums containing potentially toxic chemicals, and another open 
drum from which chemicals may have leaked, were discovered Friday in the 
Newport Back Bay, according to the Newport Beach Fire Department fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the drums washed into the bay from a construction site as a result 
of the recent storm, Fire Marshal Dennis Lockard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockard said the nature of the chemicals and any harm they may have caused to 
the bay were still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockard added: "At first glance there is no evidence of any environmental 
damage, and there doesn't appear to be any wrongdoing. It looks like an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the drums were filled with a flammable liquid believed to be of a kind 
used in cement work. He said a construction site located north of the bay and 
beside a storm drain has been identified as the probable origin. But he said 
investigators will have to wait until Monday to contact the construction 
operator.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockard said the Harbor Department discovered the first drum floating in the 
bay about 10 a.m. Friday. A further search using helicopters, he said, enabled 
authorities to find nine more drums. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard contracted with IT Corp., an industrial cleanup company, 
to remove the drums and identify the chemicals, Lockard said. Also, he said, 
the Coast Guard and state Department of Fish and Game are determining if any of 
the chemicals flowed into the bay and did any ecological damage.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; A SURPRISING NEW LUTHERAN BISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Hollywood: Pastor who supports opening the church to homosexuals will 
oversee 152 congregations in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 A North Hollywood pastor and university professor who advocates opening the 
ministry to gays and lesbians will become the Los Angeles-based bishop next 
year of a Lutheran denomination that recently rejected such a proposal after 
bitter controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who can blame the Rev. Paul Egertson for describing himself as surprised 
when he was elected bishop of 152 congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America (ELCA). 
</P>
<P>
 "My identification with a minority position in the midst of the nationwide 
controversy made me think that a majority of delegates would not vote for 
(me)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson, 59, has been well-known to Southern California Lutherans for his 
continuing education work at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, but he 
has also been a part-time pastor for two years at St. Matthew's parish in North 
Hollywood, which has publicly welcomed gay and lesbian congregants since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked -- we thought there was no chance of his being elected 
because our church is known for including gay people," said Michael Nelson, who 
chairs St. Matthew's evangelism committee. "We are sad to lose him because Dr. 
Egertson has brought us an expansive view of the Gospel, just lately getting us 
to start a ministry to the deaf." 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson told delegates during last Saturday's balloting that his oldest son 
was denied ordination after graduating from a Lutheran seminary because of ELCA 
policies barring non-celibate homosexuals from the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Egertson was one of three remaining candidates in the 
convention to fill a post vacated by Bishop J. Roger Anderson, who became 
pastor of a church in Arizona. Egertson went on to win the six-year term as 
bishop on the seventh ballot, 222-201, over the Rev. William Bartlett of Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of Cal Lutheran President Luther Luedtke, Egertson was elected 
neither because of nor in spite of his position on gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man of extraordinary compassion who has had long experience in 
ministry as a pastor and in continuing theological education," Luedtke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson has been pastor of three churches, including Faith Lutheran in South 
Gate and St. Timothy's in Lakewood, and directed Cal Lutheran-based theological 
extension curricula for ministers and lay people from 1979 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Luedtke said the Southern California (West) Synod of ELCA could not be 
classified as predominantly liberal or conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "What distinguishes this synod is a cultural and social diversity that has 
moved us far beyond the Northern European stereotype to a cosmopolitan 
community," said Luedtke, a former administrator at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop-elect Egertson said in an interview he recognizes divisions within the 
denomination are too deep to change church positions on sexuality at present. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident a year ago when angry parish reactions poured in to the 
Chicago headquarters of ELCA when a draft statement on sexual mores proposed 
recommending that sexually active teen-agers use condoms, that non-compulsive 
masturbation is healthy and that the church should re-examine traditional 
disapproval of committed gay and lesbian couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The response led to preparation of a second, more traditional draft, released 
last month, that says the Bible teaches that sex between people of the same 
gender "is not in accordance with God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the draft also called for respect for gay and lesbian people and 
for their civil rights. While continuing present policies, the church will 
further study and discuss the issues, the draft said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theological work necessary to undergird a change in our church has yet to 
be done," Egertson said. The first draft was written by a task force broadly 
representative of the church's membership, but the group did not have enough 
biblical and theological scholars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson, who may be installed as bishop about Feb. 1, said he will address 
the subject "at those times when it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson said he and his wife, Shirley, were confronted by the issue 15 years 
ago when the oldest of their six sons, Greg, said he was gay. "He changed the 
way we thought about homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 The son, now an administrator at Golden Gate University in San Francisco who 
confirmed the bishop-elect's account, studied for the ministry at Pacific 
Lutheran Seminary in Berkeley in the late 1980s despite scant hope that the new 
ELCA, the product of a three-way church merger in 1988, would suddenly modify 
its criteria for ordination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five of my boys are heterosexual, but nobody's interested in that," the 
bishop-elect said good-humoredly, referring to news interviews this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson continues to conduct Sunday services at 100-member St. Matthew's, 
where a support ministry for people with HIV infections and AIDS was organized 
last spring. He led a memorial service at the church Wednesday night for a 
victim of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Mary Jensen, pastor of the Church of Hope in Canyon Country, said the 
election of her friend of 15 years was "a terrific choice." 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that Egertson, who holds a doctorate from the School of 
Theology at Claremont, recently took law school courses at Pepperdine 
University to become certified in "alternative dispute resolution" to assist in 
arbitration and mediation outside the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's training that is certainly going to help him as a bishop too," Jensen 
added.

CHURCHGOERS SEEK CONTROL OVER OFFERINGS, STUDY SAYS; FINANCES: NATIONAL LOOK AT 
FIVE DENOMINATIONS INDICATES THAT PARISHIONERS ARE INCLINED TO BE MORE GENEROUS 
WHEN THEY HAVE A SAY OVER HOW MONEY IS SPENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let the churches say what they want about sex -- financial accountability is 
the issue that arouses more passion among American Christians when the 
collection plate is passed, according to a major new study of religious giving. 
</P>
<P>
 The national survey of nearly 11,000 Christians in 625 congregations found 
that denominational leaders' headline-grabbing pronouncements on sex have 
little effect on how much people give each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what makes churchgoers reach deeper into their pockets on Sunday is 
the sense that they have a say in how the money is spent and are kept informed 
of the financial affairs of their congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Roman Catholic Church, the study punches a hole in the theory that 
parishioners' relatively low rate of giving reflects discontent with church 
teachings on birth control and abortion. The study instead reveals a strong 
desire for a more democratic approach to parish finances. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than two-thirds of the Catholic parishes surveyed, the pastor had the 
final say over the budget. However, 78% of Catholics surveyed said lay people 
and clergy should handle financial matters jointly. Only 9% wanted to leave 
finances to priests only. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, it felt natural that the clergy ran the whole show," said 
sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University of America. "But it doesn't feel 
natural to the American Catholic laity anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers Michael J. Donahue of the Minneapolis-based Search Institute, 
Patrick McNamara of the University of New Mexico, Charles Zech of Villanova 
University and Hoge reported the findings of the 1993 study at the annual 
meeting of the Religious Research Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lilly Endowment-funded project, which Hoge called the most comprehensive 
look at church giving yet, examined 125 congregations in each of five 
denominations -- Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic, Southern Baptist 
Convention, Evangelical Lutheran and Presbyterian. In addition, 10,902 members 
of the congregations were surveyed by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a finding consistent with past studies, Catholics gave far less than 
members of other churches, even though their incomes were higher than all but 
Presbyterians. 
</P>
<P>
 The average contribution per household reported by congregations ranged from 
$386 for Catholics to $1,696 for Assemblies of God members. Baptist households 
gave an average of $1,154. Presbyterians were next with $1,085 per household, 
followed by Lutherans at $746 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the mail survey of church members, which was not a random sample because 
those queried were among the most active and the highest givers in their 
congregations, Assemblies of God members reported giving $2,985 per household, 
with Baptists giving $2,479, Presbyterians $1,635, Lutherans $1,196 and 
Catholics $819 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, regular churchgoing and high incomes were predictors of larger 
levels of giving. Giving also generally increases with age, with the biggest 
givers 45 to 75 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also found that controversial positions on issues of sexuality 
or public policy did not hurt church giving. The only correlation found was 
that Catholics who agree with the church's stand on abortion tended to give 
slightly higher percentages of their incomes to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 What church members responding to the study did indicate, however, is that 
churches that want them to give more should be prepared to give them a say in 
how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics expressed the greatest dissatisfaction with being left out of 
financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while approximately three-quarters or more of Protestant 
respondents reported a democratic process for reaching important decisions, 
fewer than half of Catholics said such decisions are made with open discussion 
by church leaders and members. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, more than two-thirds of Protestant respondents said members have 
enough influence in how church money is spent, compared with 48% of Catholics 
who said they had enough influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics who strongly approved of the decision-making processes in their 
congregations reported giving $1,220 a year, while those who strongly 
disapproved gave $742 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In parishes where members felt strongly that there were opportunities for lay 
leadership, Catholics gave $1,145 a year, compared with $569 a year among 
Catholics who did not perceive clear opportunities for lay leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence Iannaccone, an economist from Santa Clara University, said it is 
unclear why Catholics don't contribute more, but added that changing their 
habits may also be difficult. "I'd be surprised if something as straightforward 
as changing the sense of ownership would do the trick," he said.

HUNTINGTON BEACH COUNCIL PONDERING SILVA'S SUCCESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that four new City Council members have been elected, the big question is: 
Who will be appointed to fill a fifth seat? 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy is being created by Councilman Jim Silva, who was elected Tuesday 
to the 2nd District seat on the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Connie Brockway said that the council has 60 days to make an 
appointment once Silva resigns. If an appointment is not made, a special 
election must be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he will serve on the council until he is sworn in on the Board of 
Supervisors on Jan. 3.  
</P>
<P>
 Silva, like other observers, believe that Susie Newman, who came in fifth in 
Tuesday's election for four open seats, should be appointed to complete the two 
years left of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Susie Newman should have been appointed to take Jack Kelly's 
place two years ago," Silva said. "I support Susie Newman to take my place -- 
not because I agree or disagree with her philosophy, but because that is the 
only fair thing to do for the citizens of Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph H. Bauer was appointed to the council to fill the vacancy created by 
Kelly's death in 1992. Bauer was elected this week to keep his seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Newman had served as Kelly's appointment on the Planning Commission and had 
come in fourth out of three open seats in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 After narrowly losing this election, Newman said, "It's not a very good 
feeling. . . . Lightning has struck twice in the same spot." 
</P>
<P>
 New Councilman Dave Garofalo also supports Newman's appointment or a special 
election. Peter Green, who was also elected to the council Tuesday, said the 
appointee should be selected from this election's candidates.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RETRIAL TO BEGIN IN TAE KWON DO DEATH; CRIME: 
MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT IS ACCUSED OF STRANGLING A CO-WORKER OUT OF PROFESSIONAL 
JEALOUSY. A FIRST PROCEEDING ENDED IN DEADLOCK IN SEPTEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The retrial next week of a Canyon Country martial arts expert accused of 
strangling a co-worker out of professional jealousy may prove more stressful 
for many of those involved in the case, who say uncertainty and hardships from 
the first trial have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in Los Angeles in the retrial of 
Stuart Edward Milburn, 28, who is accused of murdering 29-year-old Veronica 
Estrada as she walked home along a dark road last December. A hung jury ended 
the first trial Sept. 14, with jurors voting 8 to 4 to convict Milburn of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's sister, Theresa, said she has been having nightmares as the new 
trial approaches and feels more stress this time. Part of the anxiety comes 
from knowing that her family -- including her parents, who own a restaurant in 
the Apple Valley -- will not be joining her in the courtroom for the second 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father lost a lot of money, and he's not going to be able to close it down 
again," she said, adding that her father may be forced to sell the business in 
the near future because of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of a second trial has also been distressing for Milburn, who has 
been held without bail since his arrest March 9, his attorney, Darryl Mounger, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn will enter the retrial without facing a special circumstance charge of 
committing sodomy during the murder, which was dropped by Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Charles Horan last month. With the scaled-down charge, Milburn 
would be eligible for parole in 25 years if convicted, instead of receiving a 
life sentence without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Estrada was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked woman 
competitor in the second-level black-belt division and was named instructor of 
the year at Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where she and Milburn both worked. 
She was last seen walking home Dec. 15, 1993, along Soledad Canyon Road. Her 
body was discovered in brush near the road the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors argued that Milburn felt he deserved the instructor award instead. 
Three witnesses testified that they saw a man resembling Milburn near the 
murder scene about the time of Estrada's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the identifications of Milburn were not certain, and a defense witness 
testified that she saw Milburn at the tae kwon do studio at the time of the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for four weeks -- twice as long as testimony in the trial 
lasted -- before telling Horan they were deadlocked. The jury acquitted Milburn 
of a forcible sodomy charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Several jurors said they considered the prosecution's evidence on the murder 
charge weak. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz admitted that the evidence was 
"problematic at best," but said it is enough to obtain a conviction in a 
retrial.

MIGHTY MIGRATION; DUCKS BRANCHING OUT DURING WORK STOPPAGE

<P>
 Nearly a month and a half of the NHL season has passed without hockey, and 
there is none in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Mighty Ducks quickly scattered to Canada and points east. Others have 
remained in Anaheim, where they skated together three times a week at first. 
But as the lockout drags on, "it's hard to stay motivated," forward Garry Valk 
said. And with the expense of ice time -- as much as $300 an hour -- they 
recently gave up trying to stay in playing shape and quit skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum and Stu Grimson spend time tending to business as NHL Players Assn. 
representatives. Grimson and Todd Ewen are among those active in charity work. 
While a few look for odd jobs in what they predicted all along would be a 
protracted labor dispute, at least three players have filed unemployment 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kurvers completed Lamaze classes with his wife, Suzy -- classes he 
otherwise would have missed -- and now stays close by as she spends the final 
month of her pregnancy on bedrest after the couple's car accident last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Only two Ducks, Patrik Carnback and John Lilley, are playing -- Carnback in 
his native Sweden and Lilley with the San Diego Gulls of the International 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 The others try to stay in shape at the gym, and Kurvers, David Williams and 
Don McSween have focused their competitive natures on weekend 10-kilometer 
races. McSween dusted his teammates with a 39-minute time in a Newport Beach 
race, their first. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players admit to boredom or frustration, but they've done pretty 
much what Corkum said they would when the lockout began. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to go sit on a beach somewhere and drink pina coladas," he 
said. "We know the season will start whether it's now or a month from now or 
two months from now. We just want to play." John Lilley 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks, John Lilley collided with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes of a quick resolution to the labor impasse melted at that point, and 
Lilley realized he might be stuck in San Diego for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, when I came down here I went through the motions hoping it was a 
short-term thing," Lilley said of his assignment to the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks sent Lilley, a young, scrappy right wing, to the Gulls so he could 
keep playing. He had only 13 NHL games experience, joining the Ducks late in 
the season after playing for the U.S. team at the Lillehammer Olympics. And 
because he isn't a high-paid player, it doesn't cost the Ducks too much to pay 
his minor league salary -- and frankly, at 22, he could use the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Gull right now," Lilley said. "It seems more like a long-term thing 
now. I'm fortunate to be playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck teammates have stopped by occasionally to watch a Gull game. Joe Sacco 
comes to watch his younger brother, David, play in his first full professional 
season. Coach Ron Wilson has visited the San Diego Sports Arena from time to 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had conversations with a few of the guys," Lilley said. "When guys are 
driving (more than) an hour to watch a hockey game, you know they're dying to 
be playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, Lilley has begun to accept his fate. He recently went looking for an 
apartment, deciding it was time to move out of the hotel he called home for the 
first month. His goal was a month-to-month lease. You never know when the labor 
dispute will be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a lockout and you get sent some place there are worse places to be 
than San Diego," Lilley said. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

LAKERS' BOARD GAME IS WON BY NUGGETS; PRO BASKETBALL: LED BY DIKEMBE MUTUMBO'S 
26 REBOUNDS, DENVER SCORES 124-117 OVERTIME VICTORY AT FORUM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Lakers came back from an 18-point deficit at the start of the fourth 
quarter and a terrible night on the boards to force overtime Friday night, only 
to lose to the Denver Nuggets, 124-117, at the Forum before 16,950 in the home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Dikembe Mutumbo's 26 rebounds led a 67-38 advantage for the Nuggets in that 
department, and he also had 19 points and nine blocked shots. No Laker had more 
rebounds than the eight by Eddie Jones -- the shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter charge got serious when Vlade Divac hit a running hook in 
the lane with 3:32 to go to cut the Laker deficit to 97-93, the closest they 
had been since 8:30 remained in the second quarter. Another hook with 1:22 
left, kept them within striking distance at 104-99. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt's straight-away three-pointer over a charging Mutumbo closed 
the gap to 104-102 with 55 seconds to play. Two possessions later, a near 
repeat: Threatt, this time on the right side, over Mutumbo from behind the line 
with 19.9 to go, giving the Lakers a 105-105 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets called time out, then got the ball to Dale Ellis, alone along the 
left baseline. One of the game's best outside shooters, but only two of seven 
from the field on this night, he passed up the jumper and drove to the lane. 
Antonio Harvey was waiting and blocked the shot just after it was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac grabbed the loose ball. Timeout Lakers, with 11.5 remaining. Their 
attempt to win in regulation ended when Nick Van Exel's 20-footer with two 
seconds left hit the front of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Any extra adrenaline the Lakers may have gotten from finally playing their 
first game at the Forum -- the second-latest home opener in the league -- 
disappeared early. Actually, the Nuggets may have grabbed it away, because 
Denver was getting practically everything else that was available in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors outrebounded the Lakers in the first quarter, 18-4, with Mutumbo 
getting eight of those, en route to a 10-point lead about 10 minutes into the 
game. When the Lakers closed to 32-29 in the second period, the Nuggets 
responded with a 12-2 run for another cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 It only got worse for the Lakers inside. When Reggie Williams was not boxed 
out after missing a free throw in the final minute of the half, he came down 
into the lane for the rebound, was fouled and made both attempts from the line 
for a 57-43 advantage. Fittingly, the quarter ended with the Nuggets getting 
two offensive boards before Mutumbo converted the third shot with 2.9 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 By intermission, the Lakers trailed, 59-47, were being outrebounded, 34-10, 
and had a second shot on the same possession just twice. The Nuggets had as 
many offensive boards, and Mutumbo had 14 on his own, along with five blocks 
and seven points, in only 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To think it could have been worse for the Lakers. The Nuggets played without 
three of their best inside players -- LaPhonso Ellis, Rodney Rogers and Brian 
Williams -- because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably why Denver had only a 48-24 rebounding advantage heading into 
the fourth quarter, not to mention a 90-72 lead where it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course that changed too. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement of 33-year-old James Worthy makes the Lakers the sixth-youngest 
team in the league, with an average age of 25.8. Their starting lineup averages 
24 years old. But most telling of all is that the new captains, Cedric Ceballos 
and Nick Van Exel, are 25 and 23, respectively, and have a combined five years' 
experience. . . . Worthy would have been the only other small forward on the 
roster. Now, when Coach Del Harris wants to substitute for Ceballos, he will 
choose between power forward George Lynch and shooting guard Eddie Jones. 
Because Jones is a little undersized at 6 foot 6 and 190 pounds, the nod 
probably will go to Lynch, who made 44 of his 46 starts last season at small 
forward. "It's not a major problem to circumvent," Harris said. . . . Agent 
Frank Wheaton, on owner Jerry Buss agreeing to uphold Worthy's contract and pay 
the remaining $12.35 million over the next two years: "It was an angelic and 
Godsend-like way." . . . Three Lakers are on the all-star ballot: Vlade Divac 
at center, Cedric Ceballos at forward and Nick Van Exel at guard. 
</P>

 * NBA ROUNDUP 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks, who didn't win their second game last season until Dec. 
23, got 16 points from Long Beach State's Lucious Harris and their second 
victory in three games, 107-100, over the Philadelphia 76ers. C8

STAGE SET FOR NEXT SHOWTIME; LAKERS: WEST MUST MOLD A NEW TEAM AFTER THE 
DEPARTURE OF WORTHY, THE FINAL LINK TO THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP SEASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the player introductions at the Laker home opener Friday night at the 
Forum, they turned down the lights. The party was over a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Beams from spotlights swept the stands, then the players were introduced. As 
pregame routines go, the old one was better. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, Laker home openers went like this: The players showed up and 
they got their championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a perfect world. Hang time had nothing to do with jumping, but meant 
the Lakers were ready to put up another championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home openers, man, they were so, so special," said Magic Johnson. "For us, 
most of the time it was special because we would get a ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only that, it was the kickoff night for another championship season." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Laker championship season may be longer than just a kickoff away. More 
like an entire punt, pass and kick contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you believe, the Lakers are sure they're getting closer to instead of 
farther away from another ring ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 So when James Worthy announced he was quitting this week, General Manager 
Jerry West didn't allow himself to feel too melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it wasn't as though the process was new to him. He had been through 
it with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reality," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody plays forever, said West, who went on to point out its corollary: 
"Nobody stays on top forever." 
</P>
<P>
 This is evident when you look at the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 West couldn't curb some wishful thinking Thursday, shortly before he walked 
into a news conference to announce Worthy's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I glanced around and saw Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and James Worthy 
standing outside and I wished real hard those guys were 22 again," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, no actors remain from the original production of Showtime. Worthy 
was the last, and his exit was duly noted by his teammates, including Cedric 
Ceballos, who was lamenting his departure on the court before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even get to play one official game with him," Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the next Showtime, or whatever they might call it, whenever it might 
occur, there is no question what the Laker experience is being called right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Its common name is rebuilding, but Del Harris said the Lakers won't simply 
rebuild. It's too common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't even talk about rebuilding," he said. "They want to make rebuilding an 
event rather than a process. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Indiana or Milwaukee were more willing to watch something grow a 
bit than in a large market like here. That's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes in Lakerland. It used to be a wonderful place, where you could 
get a great player like Jamaal Wilkes, then replace him with a great player 
like James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Nixon became Byron Scott. Bob McAdoo became Maurice Lucas became Mychal 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as symmetrical as a basketball. Of course, the whole thing is deflated 
now. But listen to what Johnson told the players in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You know, hang in there because you're going to want to be here when 
this thing turns around,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like playing on a team when you're hummin', there's nothing 
like playing basketball in L.A., when everybody wants a ticket and the feeling 
is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Osborne sang the national anthem for the home opener again. He did 
that for years, and the Lakers would go on to win 60 games and get to the NBA 
finals and win five championships. 
</P>
<P>
 This is nice, but it's ancient history. The players who helped make that 
possible aren't wearing their jerseys anymore. Those shirts are hanging at the 
Forum. Worthy's uniform number soon will join Johnson's and Abdul-Jabbar's on 
the north wall. 
</P>
<P>
 These Lakers are not coming back. West said it's probably best not to think 
too much about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that players play 10 years and they're gone," he said. "The 
great ones, maybe 12, but that's it. This is not a game for the mature, elderly 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were winning championships, people would always ask me what the 
biggest challenge we had ahead, like it would be winning that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said it then, I said it 20 times, all the time: 'What happens when all 
these guys leave?' " 
</P>
<P>
 We're seeing it right now.

UCLA ATTACKS DIFFERENT KIND OF THREE-PEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Arizona State's goal tonight against UCLA: a third consecutive victory 
over the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also how many points UCLA has scored against the Sun Devils in the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-0 Sun Devil victory in 1992 at the Rose Bowl broke a 245-game UCLA 
scoring streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen years," said Bruin Coach Terry Donahue, wistfully regarding his 
portion of the 22-year run. "I'll never see that again." 
</P>
<P>
 A 9-3 Arizona State victory last season, also in Pasadena, made UCLA's road to 
the Rose Bowl game a bumpy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Three points in two years. But it will be surprising if it happens again 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that both offenses, going into the game, would think that they 
can move the ball, think that they're going to generate yards and points," 
Donahue said. "As soon as you make that statement or have that feeling about a 
game, sure enough it goes the other way on you. But the reality of it is that 
both secondaries have given up yardage and pass completions." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (3-6, 2-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference) has given up an average 
of 277.8 yards passing per game, easily last in the league. UCLA (3-6, 1-5) has 
given up an average of 193.2, but the Bruins have also given up 223 yards 
rushing per game. Arizona State has given up 141.4. 
</P>
<P>
 A shootout is indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think . . . it's going to be a fun game," Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder 
said. "Obviously, people will see J.J. Stokes, who is a great player now and is 
going to be in the future. I don't think Craig (Newsome) will be healthy enough 
to play against him, but that would be nice to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Arizona State's problems have also involved numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA lets schools award 85 football scholarships, but because of transfers 
and other factors in a rocky transition from Coach Larry Marmie to Snyder, the 
Sun Devils have 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that, seven are injured and out for the season and three more -- including 
top-flight cornerback Newsome -- are out for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining 65, 15 are freshmen who are being red-shirted and eight have 
walked on to a scholarship, including kicker Jon Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves 42 recruited scholarship players, not even a two-deep chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA is the road team and they will have more players than we do," Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams have similar results, both having started the season with two 
victories, and both have had injury problems. The difference is that Arizona 
State's are mounting. UCLA is getting stronger, having benefited from a week 
off after beating Stanford, 31-30, to end a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Stokes is 100%, showing that in a Wednesday practice when he 
caught a quick, short Wayne Cook pass one-handed at the goal line, then dunked 
the ball over the crossbar of the goal posts, a la Alvin Harper of the Dallas 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 His return gives Cook two main targets: Stokes and Kevin Jordan, who has 63 
receptions for 1,015 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows me to read defenses like I was trained to do," said Cook, who has 
zeroed in on Jordan all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have this game to bridge the gap between the season and closing 
games against traditional rivals. UCLA plays USC next week in Pasadena. Arizona 
State plays Arizona on Nov. 25 at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd much rather go into the USC game with wins over Stanford and Arizona 
State than with a 3-7 record and coming off a loss," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arizona State quarterback Jake Plummer: "This gives us a chance to finish 
on a high note, with a win over a UCLA team that is playing better, and then go 
down to play our archrival." 
</P>
<P>
 A high note, and maybe a fun note. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a heck of a game because I think we are evenly 
matched," said Snyder. "But I've learned a long time ago not to say it's going 
to be a defensive struggle or an offensive shootout, because it tends to be 
just the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a three-point game? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that would be an upset. UCLA BRUINS

ROSE BOWL RACE DOWN TO LAST LAPS; USC: TROJANS PLAY HOST TO ARIZONA, BUT 
ATTENTION WILL ALSO BE ON OREGON-STANFORD GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl playoffs, as USC Coach John Robinson calls them, begin the gun 
lap at the Coliseum today. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona and USC, at 12:30 p.m., will be trying to knock each other out of the 
race. And at the same time, both will be hoping Stanford can knock Oregon out 
of the driver's seat in a 3:30 game at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, USC and Arizona are all 5-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. If Oregon 
beats Stanford today and Oregon State next Saturday, today's Coliseum matchup 
is strictly for place money. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's Trojans (6-2) are on top of their game, gunning for their fifth 
consecutive victory. The Wildcats (7-2) have beaten them in three of the last 
four seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 And for the second consecutive Saturday, Robinson's team is up against a 
high-ranking defense. The Trojans dismantled Washington State's secondary last 
week with three touchdown passes from Rob Johnson to Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona stumbled again offensively last Saturday but beat Cal, 13-6, after 
having lost to Oregon the previous weekend, 10-9.  
</P>
<P>
 Dick Tomey's Wildcats haven't scored an offensive touchdown in eight quarters, 
but his defense against the run continues to be the nation's best -- 57.2 yards 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona ranks sixth nationally in total defense, giving up 258 yards a game, 
and is tied for second in scoring defense, yielding 11.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's team isn't frightening anyone with statistics, it is simply 
winning. And another triumph today would equal USC's longest winning streak 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 His players seek atonement for their 38-7 loss at Tucson last season, a game 
in which the Trojans trailed at halftime, 28-0, and made a sophomore 
quarterback, Danny White, look like an NFL first-round draft pick.  
</P>
<P>
 It ranks as the worst beating of Robinson's college coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it appears as if USC will have more offensive horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's offense is operating efficiently -- it has scored 21 touchdowns and 
eight field goals in its last 31 trips inside the opponent's 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other statistics reflect the two teams' offenses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wildcat kicker Steve McLaughlin has been called upon to try 27 field goals 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's Cole Ford has been called on only 11 times, and only four times in 
the last fourgames.  
</P>
<P>
 And here's how well USC's defense has played lately: The Trojans have 
surrendered only two first downs on their opponents' previous 30 third downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday against Cal -- a team USC beat, 61-0 -- Arizona needed big 
fourth-quarter plays to win, 13-6.  
</P>
<P>
 On one, linebacker Sean Harris stopped a screen pass for a five-yard loss on a 
Cal second and 10 at Arizona's 20 with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Then tackle Jim Hoffman got two consecutive sacks, and Arizona took over and 
killed the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's Ontiwaun Carter, the conference's No. 2 rusher with 1,071 yards, 
figures to break an old Wildcat record early today. He needs seven yards to 
become Arizona's all-time leading rusher. The record, 3,371 yards, was set by 
Art Luppino in the mid-1950s, and was for years the NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC challenge today will be to protect quarterback Rob Johnson, who starts 
for the second consecutive week after sitting out the equivalent of four games 
because of an ankle sprain.  
</P>
<P>
 Arizona had six sacks against USC in last year's game and had five against Cal 
last Saturday. The Wildcats lead the Pac-10 in sacks with 39, averaging 4.3 a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson didn't appear to have lost a thing last Saturday. He sent Keyshawn 
Johnson into patterns where he was often matched with shorter cornerbacks and 
Johnson outleaped them for eight catches and 145 yards, and all three Trojan 
touchdowns in the 23-10 victory.  
</P>
<P>
 And Ed Hervey, injured for most of the last two seasons, is finally back and 
had a five-catch day at Pullman.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 6-4, and Hervey, 6-3, will also be in search of short Arizona 
defensive backs today, and there are three, listed as 5-9 or 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
 But special teams, Robinson believes, will win today.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our next three games are dead even, in my mind, and I think special teams 
will decide the rest of our games," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our special teams have played well for the most part, but I'm still upset we 
let that kid run through us and block a conversion last week." 
</P>

NOT YOU AGAIN!; AS USUAL, STAKES ARE HIGH FOR MATCHUP BETWEEN NFC'S BEST, THE 
COWBOYS AND 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They know each other's secrets, understand each other's dreams. They see every 
strength, recognize every fear. They can make each other squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 This being the fourth time they have met in the last three years, the Dallas 
Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers will arrive at Candlestick Park Sunday bearing 
all the characteristics of aging rivals -- admiration, respect, jealousy, 
spite. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is like their NFC championship game last season, there will be fists 
thrown -- during the pregame warmups. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is like their regular-season game last year, one team will wilt under 
the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is like their NFC championship game two years ago, the winning 
quarterback will become a national hero, the losing quarterback a local 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it could be like their NFC championship game 13 years ago, the day 
somebody made a catch that will be remembered forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys and 49ers. For the last three years, theirs has been the most 
important game of the NFL season whenever it was played, no matter how many 
times it was played. So it will be Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have the league's best record. Upon the 49ers' shoulder pads rest 
the league's biggest chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have won three consecutive times against the 49ers,twice for the 
NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have spent millions on eight new players in hopes of ending that 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now. 
</P>
<P>
 With aging personnel and an overweight payroll, it may be a decade before they 
get another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we have done so far points to this game," said Ken Norton Jr., a 
49er linebacker who defected from the Cowboys. "On Sunday, we will find out if 
this organization has bridged the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game with as many angles as Cowboy enrollees in traffic school, only a 
few things seem certain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The teams will meet again this season. How about for a third consecutive 
NFC championship game on Jan. 15? 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cowboys leading the 49ers by one game in the conference standings, 
the winner of Sunday's game will probably be the home team in that matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's why the Cowboys will be playing so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The losing coach will be one step closer to coaching his last game for that 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 George Seifert of the 49ers must prove he can win a championship on something 
other than Bill Walsh's inheritance. His bosses figure that if he can't win it 
with this collection of stars, he never will. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cowboys don't go to another Super Bowl, Barry Switzer might decide to 
go back to Oklahoma after only one pro season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has done a splendid job of keeping America's Most Wanted team 
focused, Switzer had no idea of the stress that has been put on his constantly 
sore back and incredibly shrinking ego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nobody will guarantee a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This happened before last year's NFC championship, when then-Dallas coach 
Jimmy Johnson stunned his team and infuriated the 49ers by promising the 
Cowboys would win. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in that business," Switzer said this week. "I haven't had five or six 
Heinekens yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else is up for grabs. Some of the interesting matchups: MICHAEL vs. 
DEION 
</P>
<P>
 This duel will be watched by everyone. Maybe even Switzer will notice it. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Irvin of the Cowboys is the best big-game receiver in the league. 
Deion Sanders of the 49ers is the best big-play defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin makes his living running over smaller cornerbacks or running past the 
big ones. But what does he do with a guy who is both big and fast? 
</P>
<P>
 "Deion has everything," Irvin acknowledged this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In two previous games against Sanders with Troy Aikman throwing the ball, 
Irvin caught 11 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But in only seven games with the 49ers, Sanders has already returned two 
interceptions for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they should just call it a draw, clean out their lockers, and open a 
jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: Michael. STEVE vs. CHARLES 
</P>
<P>
 This is the duel that will be noticed by nobody, as long as 49er tackle Steve 
Wallace can stop that nutty Cowboy defensive end, Charles Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley was once a 49er, but not a happy one, judging from the time he confused 
a teammate's car with a toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 He plays the 49ers hard and loves using quarterback Steve Young as a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 SH OLD UNIFORMS vs. NEW UNIFORMS 
</P>
<P>
 By special decree of the commissioner, the 49ers will be wearing their 
throwback uniforms for a seventh game. They are 6-0 in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert says he is not superstitious, nor does he believe in good-luck charms 
or hexes. He says he is just a creature of habit. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys will be wearing their 1994 uniforms. Funny, but, in them, they are 
also unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The team that has not been ordered to spend Saturday night watching 
reruns of "Bewitched." GEORGE vs. BARRY 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert's biggest advantage over Switzer is that Seifert actually coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert will have an additional edge this weekend in that Switzer will have to 
remain with his team on Saturday night instead of flying off to see his son, 
Doug, play college football. 
</P>
<P>
 What, Missouri Southern State's season is already over? It is for Doug, who 
quit the team after throwing for four touchdowns and 12 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavens, Switzer might actually attend a pregame meeting. Who knows what havoc 
will ensue? 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: George EMMITT vs. KEN 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith is most responsible for the Cowboys' domination of the 49ers in 
the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is most responsible for the 49ers' signing of Norton in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never able to tackle him in practice," Norton said. "Now I guess I'll 
see just how good he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith stunned the 49ers in last year's NFC championship game by coming out of 
the backfield to catch seven passes for 85 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 122 yards total against them in last year's regular-season matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wore them down in the 1992 NFC title game by totaling 109 yards in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton has struggled this season in a new scheme with teammates who are 
smaller and slower than the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who say I've been a bust don't know a lot about football," Norton 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The one who hasn't been a bust. INJURIES vs. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers were missing all five offensive lineman at one point, but only guard 
Ralph Tamm is still out. And defensive end Dent could be making his first 
appearance since injuring his knee on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The real pain belongs to the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Harper, who has driven the 49ers crazy with his leaping catches over 
Eric Davis, will be tentative at best if he tries to play after suffering a 
knee injury Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy fans will be heartened to know that Irvin was planning to have a long 
talk with Harper this week. He was going to tell him he shouldn't risk the knee 
for just one game. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The team that is approaching this as if it were far more than just 
one game. STYLE vs. STYLE 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are an image-conscious organization. Their best player, Jerry Rice, 
is known for carefully pressing even his blue jeans. Their team president looks 
like a banker, their quarterback is a lawyer, and their headquarters address is 
perfect: 4949 Centennial Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Deion has shut his mouth and put his boom box in storage.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys? Well, their coach calls female reporters "Honey," interceptions 
"Oskies." 
</P>
<P>
 Their quarterback dips snuff, their tight end is a real Cowboy, and their 
safety nearly attacked an opposing player during a game last week with a camera 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three weeks, four of their players were involved in car wrecks. 
Only three of them stuck around for the police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The team that won't mind getting dirty. JERRY vs. KEVIN 
</P>
<P>
 If any defensive back can get under the skin of 49er receiver Rice, it is the 
Cowboys' Kevin Smith. Because Smith doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the fistfight last year by goading Rice, and later baited the star 
into an uncommon personal foul. In two games last year, hard-hitting Smith held 
the NFL's all-time touchdown leader scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 No more, says Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be able to come out and bully us like that," Rice promised. "It's 
like you're going to school and there's this bully that's going to take your 
lunch money every day. What are you going to do? Eventually you're going to 
have to make a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The great one. A WHOLE MESS OF FOLKS vs. TROY 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman has completed 68% of his passes for 742 yards, five touchdowns and no 
interceptions in the last three games against the 49ers. Even though he has a 
rattled head and a newly scarred chin, there is little reason to think that the 
49er defense can take away his weapons, or his ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: The player Steve Young would most like to imitate. STEVE vs. A 
WHOLE MESS OF FOLKS 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys lost three stars to free agency, but many believe that the team's 
top-ranking defense has never been better. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also believe that Young, the 49er quarterback, has never been tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has been battered behind a depleted line that has allowed 23 sacks -- 16 
more than the Cowboys have given up -- yet he is the league's only passer with 
a rating of more than 100 (101.8). 
</P>
<P>
 To shatter his reputation of backing down in big games, he needs a victory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: Young, who finally will have the sort of big game the football 
world has waited years to see. DESPERATION vs. THE BOYS WHO JUST WANT TO HAVE 
FUN 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers need this game to prove they have not spent the last 10 months 
wasting their time, money and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys need this game to prove . . . what is it they need to prove again? 
Oh, yeah. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage: In a high-scoring game, the team with the most to lose will finally 
find a way to win. The 49ers will have exactly eight weeks to enjoy it.

OPTIMISM SUBSIDES IN NEGOTIATIONS; HOCKEY: CLUB EXECUTIVES SAY PLAYERS' 
COMPROMISES ARE INSIGNIFICANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Club executives on Friday dismissed salary concessions that players had called 
significant efforts to end the NHL lockout, quashing hopes they might reach an 
agreement in time to open the season in early December. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much ado about nothing, that's the best way to describe it," said Tony 
Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks. "The only encouraging thing is they're 
talking. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You can look at it two ways. The first is the optimistic: they're 
negotiating. The second is the pessimistic: For all the hoopla, there wasn't 
much there." 
</P>
<P>
 A management source told the Canadian Press, "It was the most insignificant 
concession in the history of labor negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman discussed the overture with the league's executive 
committee during a conference call Friday, but there was no vote on it. Bettman 
is expected to present a counterproposal to union chief Bob Goodenow Tuesday or 
Wednesday in Toronto. They spoke twice Friday but could not agree on a weekend 
meeting date. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, players agreed to restrictions on entry-level salaries and gave 
up arbitration for any player on his first contract, on the condition that 
owners drop their proposed payroll levy. Players also agreed to accept two-way 
contracts, which impose a lower pay scale if they are sent to the minor 
leagues, and maximum and minimum minor league salaries for all rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very insignificant from everything I can see," Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ron Salcer, a player agent, said the offer would satisfy owners' 
desire to slow salary escalation even though it eliminated payroll and gate 
levies that would have helped subsidize small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked with a number of (club) presidents and their feeling was if you 
have these restraints and then if you can't control your budget and work with 
these constraints, maybe you should move," Salcer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the owners are going to have to move off the salary cap because the 
players are going to say, 'Next time you cancel games, you might as well cancel 
the entire season because this is as far as we're going to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL has canceled 14 games from each club's schedule, even though 230 games 
overall have been missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be difficult to have hockey before Dec. 1," King General 
Manager Sam McMaster said. "Maybe Jan. 1 if we get down to negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Lisa Dillman and Robyn Norwood contributed to this story.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOR FUTILITY, PRAIRIE VIEW CAN'T BE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a Prairie View A&M football player was not easy this week. It isn't most 
weeks, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you looked at the whole picture, you probably wouldn't play 
anymore," linebacker Jerrold Crowder said. "That's too depressing. If you 
played anything and lost 44 games, you'd probably quit it after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 But Crowder won't quit, even after last week's 70-20 loss to Tarleton State 
that tied the Panthers with Columbia (1983-1988) for the longest losing streak 
in NCAA Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie View, without scholarships and under severe budget restraints, could 
break the record today against Jackson State. 
</P>
<P>
 Add losers: Treboh Joe, the worst horse in harness racing history -- 167 
consecutive losses -- has run his last race, according to the gelding's owner, 
Willie Mitchell Jr., who raced him mostly at Pocono Downs near Wilkes-Barre, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Treboh Joe) had one speed -- slow," said John Zimitch, public 
relations director for Pocono Downs. "I think if he was the only horse in the 
race, he'd have come in second." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many quarterbacks have played in the Rose Bowl and Super 
Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case: Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam now has an insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't guarantee touchdowns, but it does cover him if he suffers a 
career-ending injury. The maximum value of the policy is $1.8 million, and it 
carries a $14,040 premium, which must be paid within a year of his signing a 
pro contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1920, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was named the 
first commissioner of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociology lesson: Dick Motta knows what it's like to try to revive a losing 
NBA team, such as the Dallas squad he took over this year after it had posted a 
24-140 record the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take a battered child, give them a shower, a hot meal and a good 
night's sleep," Motta said. "But in the morning, it's still a battered child." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston way: After a water cannon went off in the Alamodome's fire system 
and doused the crowd before the San Antonio Spurs' home opener, assistant coach 
Dave Cowens was asked if anything like that had ever happened when he was 
playing in the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even have those things in the Garden," he said. "They'd just let 
it burn down." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Five. Earl Morrall, Michigan State-Baltimore Colts; Joe Kapp, 
California-Minnesota Vikings; Bob Griese, Purdue-Miami Dolphins; Mike Rae, 
USC-Oakland Raiders; Jim Plunkett, Stanford-Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 A little early?ABC's Dan Dierdorf on Sunday's big NFL game: "If the Dallas 
Cowboys go to Candlestick Park and win this football game, the season is over. 
The Super Bowl is won." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Jeff Bagwell and Frank Thomas, baseball's two MVPs this year, were born 
on the same day, May 27, 1968.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; THE CHANGING FORTUNES OF CHANGING QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone rang in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been an off-season filled with what agent Leigh Steinberg believed was 
the worst sort of player movement. 
</P>
<P>
 When he sleepily reached for the handset, he figured the caller could be only 
one type of person. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quarterback who had recently signed with a new team. 
</P>
<P>
 And the quarterback was panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leigh," shouted the man. "What was I thinking! " 
</P>
<P>
 What was the entire league thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months' worth of talk about rebuilding and rebirths and lively arms 
and leadership has been followed by an autumn of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the results of a free-agency overhaul in which 19 of the 
league's 28 teams' starting quarterbacks changed jobs, coaches and officials 
have come to a sobering conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no quick fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 Court a new quarterback and -- unless the guy is a future Hall of Famer like 
Warren Moon or Joe Montana -- you are courting disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are finally realizing that an out pattern in Dallas is not the 
same as an out pattern in Minnesota," said Pat Haden, former quarterback and 
current national TV and radio commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, who represents 22 quarterbacks, put it another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In baseball, if a player can hit a home run in Candlestick Park for the 
Giants, the assumption is that he can hit one in Dodger Stadium for the 
Dodgers," he said. "People who try to make that same sort of assumption about 
quarterbacks are wrong. Nothing is more important at that position than 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Lions know that now. For $11.1 million, they bought a player who 
has thrown more interceptions, 11, than touchdown passes, 10, with no 
completion having traveled farther than 34 yards before his season mercifully 
ended last week because of a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mitchell will spend the off-season trying to forget his last three 
games, in which he completed 27 of 62 passes, three for touchdowns, and threw 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a former backup in Miami, could never quite the learn the plays, the 
personnel, where in the heck to throw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coach Wayne Fontes, Mitchell's presence was actually a detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to blame the quarterback for not moving the ball, but I told you guys 
going in, I thought this was a good offensive football team," said Fontes after 
the Lions finally showed some spark last week with veteran backup Dave Krieg. 
"We just never got it going, never got in sync. With a guy 15 years (in the 
NFL), I think we will get a little more in sync." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has been the worst. But he has not been alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other teams that made quarterback changes in the last two years because 
of free agency or the salary cap have watched the experiment fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Kramer has been benched in Chicago. The same for Jim Harbaugh in 
Indianapolis. Steve Beuerlein has not helped in Arizona. Cody Carlson has been 
a joke in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer Esiason is still trying to bring the New York Jets to another level. 
Chris Miller has been no help in lifting the Rams out of the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff George is still throwing tantrums in Atlanta. And the New York Giants, 
who thought they could manage without Phil Simms, now must manage without a 
trip to the playoffs, thanks to failure by Dave Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected all of them to start slowly, but it's been sort of a surprise that 
so many have continued to struggle," Haden said. "This just shows, you have to 
give new quarterbacks a lot of time to learn not only the receivers, but the 
offensive line, the running backs, everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Except if those quarterbacks are named Montana and Moon. What Montana did for 
the Kansas City Chiefs last year, Moon is doing this year for the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Moon is second in the league with 2,476 yards passing. 
That last-second, game-winning touchdown pass last week to Qadry Ismail Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 That was his fourth option on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon has a legitimate chance of becoming only the third quarterback to lead a 
team to the Super Bowl in his first year with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to send Houston a basket of roses, champagne or whatever," said 
receiver Cris Carter, who is on a pace for a league-record 128 receptions. 
"Everything centers around Warren." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, Moon's agent, said he spent hours trying to talk the Oilers out of 
parting with Moon, who was traded last spring for salary-cap reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He used words like catalyst, and touchstone, and leader.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers made the mistake of looking at the quarterback position as one 
looks at an automobile. It was a mistake made by many other NFL teams and it 
might not soon be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me Carlson was younger, and that was that," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, Carlson has thrown 132 passes this year. One for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 ANOTHER LIST 
</P>
<P>
 Rating the league's 28 starting quarterbacks this season, and notice where the 
quarterbacks with the longest tenure rank: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Dan Marino, Miami Dolphins. He ranks fourth in the league quarterback 
rating, but nobody has thrown for more touchdowns, 19. Nobody else has survived 
a tougher schedule with a weaker supporting cast. He deserves another Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Steve Young, San Francisco 49ers. This year he establishes himself as a 
tough guy. He's averaging a league-leading 10.27 yards a pass on third down, 
when blitzes have collapsed his injury-weakened offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Troy Aikman, Dallas Cowboys. Nobody makes better decisions in important 
situations. He's one of only two starters in the league without a 
fourth-quarter interception. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Moon, Vikings. By stealing him, the Vikings have finally atoned for their 
other big trade in the last 10 years. Perhaps you remember Herschel Walker? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Stan Humphries, San Diego Chargers. Although he has slowed in the second 
half, nobody in the AFC has thrown more touchdown passes on third down, five. 
And perhaps nobody means more to his team. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Montana, Chiefs. Guess who leads the AFC in passer rating? The older he 
gets, the more he resembles the little girl with the curl. When he's bad, he's 
horrid. But when he's good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 7. Randall Cunningham, Philadelphia Eagles. He still has to prove he can win a 
big game. But he and receivers Fred Barnett and Calvin Williams may be the 
league's best trio. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Jim Everett, New Orleans Saints. Those who have bashed him for years will 
bash him now, but he has quietly revived his career while ranking third in the 
NFC in passing yardage and fourth in touchdowns. Face it, Ram fans, Miller is 
no substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 9. George, Falcons. OK, so he has put up some interesting numbers while tying 
for the league lead with six fourth-quarter touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Brett Favre, Green Bay Packers. Officials there are wondering if he will 
ever be the sort of leader they once envisioned. But, hey, he has more 
touchdowns passes, 13, than interceptions, eight, for the first time in nearly 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Drew Bledsoe, New England Patriots. OK, so he has thrown a league-leading 
18 interceptions and probably put Coach Bill Parcells in the hospital. With a 
league-leading 2,605 yards, nobody is more fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 12. John Elway, Denver Broncos. Has the ball ever slipped out of his hands 
this much? 
</P>
<P>
 13. Jim Kelly, Buffalo Bills. Has the ball ever stuck to his hands this much? 
</P>
<P>
 14. Neil O'Donnell, Pittsburgh Steelers. The quarterback on a playoff team 
that needs a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Esiason, Jets. We seem to remember a time when he could throw the ball 
more than 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Rick Mirer, Seattle Seahawks. Nothing a new coach and offense couldn't 
fix. 
</P>
<P>
 17. Jeff Hostetler, Raiders. Jay Schroeder has written to Art Shell and 
demanded a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 18. Steve Walsh, Chicago Bears. Still unbeaten after four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Vinny Testaverde, Cleveland Browns. He'd better recover from his 
concussion soon before owner Art Modell orders that Mark Rypien become the 
permanent starter. 
</P>
<P>
 20. Krieg, Lions. Major points for the beard. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Beuerlein, Cardinals. We still blame Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 22. Chris Chandler, Rams. We hear he's a heck of a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Trent Dilfer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Hard to rate him when you can't even 
recognize him through the bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 24. Harbaugh and Don Majkowski, Colts. No magic left in either one. 
</P>
<P>
 25. Gus Frerotte, Washington Redskins. If baseball and hockey weren't having 
labor disputes, football fans wouldn't have been bored enough to anoint him 
king after two games. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Jeff Blake, Cincinnati Bengals. See No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 27. Carlson, Oilers. Oh well. Most of the Oiler coaching staff probably would 
have been fired even if he weren't so inept. Wouldn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 28. Kent Graham, New York Giants. Unlike the Giant quarterback who started the 
season, at least this guy is not using an obvious alias. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * WE LOVE IT WHEN THEY CALL EACH OTHER NAMES: Add New Orleans Saint 
quarterback Jim Everett to the list of folks accusing the Minnesota Vikings' 
fourth-ranked defense of dirty play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," Everett told reporters. "And they coach it too. Everyone knows 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Teerlinck, Viking defensive line coach, worked with the Rams and Everett 
in '91. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everett knows how I coach, and he don't like it," Teerlinck responded. "He's 
a punk." 
</P>
<P>
 * STRANGE, STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: Bill Kenney, a quarterback for the Kansas City 
Chiefs from 1979-88, ran for a Missouri State Senate seat in the recent 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, his opponent ran this ad: 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember the small crowds and empty parking lots at Arrowhead? Bill Kenney 
wants you to forget those years. During Kenney's best season, only 11,000 
Chiefs fans attended the Denver game. Kenney's leadership resulted in the 
longest losing streak in Chiefs' history, a decade without a playoff win, and 
two player strikes costing businesses millions. Now Bill Kenney wants to play 
games with your tax money." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney, a Republican, defeated incumbent Democrat Margaret Rennau by a 57% to 
43% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 * WE KNEW SOMETHING SPECIAL WAS HAPPENING DOWN THERE: Sam Wyche, coach of the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is about to make history. Any week now, he becomes the 
first coach to suffer double-digit losses in four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * WELL, IT'S ONE WAY TROY DRAYTON CAN GET THE BALL: Fred Barnett, Philadelphia 
Eagle wide receiver, has started an interesting custom. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, after scoring a touchdown in a Monday night game against the Houston 
Oilers, he handed the ball to ABC sideline reporter Lynn Swann. He said it was 
his way of showing his appreciation to Swann for "setting the standard for all 
wide receivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after scoring his second touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals, 
he ran over to former Eagle receiver Mike Quick, who was on the sideline, 
hugged him and gave him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 As for future recipients of touchdown passes? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Barnett said. "I'll just have to check the sideline and see 
who's there and play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
 * IN TUNE: Producers for Pat Haden have confirmed that while serving as 
analyst on TNT's Sunday and Thursday night games in the first half of the 
season, Haden correctly predicted seven plays that resulted in touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite call occurred three weeks ago, when he warned the Vikings to look 
for the quarterback draw from Green Bay Packer quarterback Mark Brunell, who 
had just entered the game. Seconds later, Brunell ran the play for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden, who has even correctly predicted a blocked punt, will spend the second 
half of the season on CBS radio. But we all know he belongs on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANOTHER REASON WE ARE GLAD WE DON'T LIVE IN DALLAS: After driving Michael 
Irvin's Mercedes into the rear of another car earlier this week, the Cowboys' 
Alvin Harper was stunned by the reaction of the other driver. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked back to Harper, and said, "How's your knee?" 
</P>
<P>
 And then let him drive away without properly informing police or filing an 
accident report. 
</P>
<P>
 * THIS GETS SEA WORLD OFF THEIR BACK: Apparently the Chargers' defensive front 
-- which ranks fourth in the league against the run -- is going to stick with 
the nickname, "The Border Patrol" despite protests from local Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Good for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides refusing to bend to the political correctness police, the Chargers 
also avoid using the second-best nickname submitted in a recent contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Killer Whales." 
</P>
<P>
 * JIM BROWN, LEROY KELLY . . . LEROY HOARD? When the Cleveland Browns' Leroy 
Hoard ran for 123 yards against the New England Patriots last week, it was only 
the team's second 100-yard-or-more rushing day in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * BOILING OILERS: After the Steelers' Gary Anderson had kicked the winning 
field goal in overtime against the Oilers, Houston defenders Ray Childress and 
Al Smith engaged in a shouting match in the locker room and had to be separated 
just before the team prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had somebody said, "Amen," when the squabbling players were back at 
it.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; BATES IS EXPECTED TO REPLACE HOSKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting strong safety Derrick Hoskins did not practice this week because of 
an ankle injury and may not play Sunday against the Rams. Hoskins, a third-year 
veteran from Southern Mississippi, has emerged as a solid hitter in the 
secondary with 52 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell said that a decision on Hoskins would not be made until 
Sunday, but look for Patrick Bates to start. Bates played well last week 
against Kansas City after replacing Hoskins early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bates has come along very well (since the start of the season)," Shell said. 
"Everybody grows as the year goes on, with more practice time and game 
experience. Patrick is very confident about his ability to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 If Hoskins does not play, the Raiders would face the Rams without two 
secondary starters. Cornerback Albert Lewis is out with a knee injury and will 
be replaced by Lionel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In order to defeat the Rams, middle linebacker Greg Biekert realizes that the 
Raiders must slow down running back Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about him that makes him so tough is that he runs hard for an 
entire game," Biekert said. "He looks just as strong in the fourth quarter as 
he does in the first." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second annual softball game between the Ram and Raider cheerleaders to 
benefit children with AIDS will be held at 2 p.m. today at Mira Costa High 
School in Manhattan Beach. Admission is $5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the league in travel through exhibitions (five road games) and 
the first nine weeks of the season (five road games), the Raiders will not 
leave the state for the next four weeks starting Sunday at Anaheim. . . . Jeff 
Hostetler needs 15 yards rushing to reach 1,000 in his career. . . . Tim Brown 
is second in the AFC with 742 receiving yards in 50 catches. . . . Center Don 
Mosebar has started 86 consecutive games. LONNIE WHITE

GOLF ROUNDUP; LOVE AND COUPLES GIVE U.S. BIG WORLD CUP LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Couples and Davis Love expanded the United States' lead at the World Cup 
of Golf on Friday at Dorado, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Love, in search of a record third consecutive World Cup title, 
started slowly, but a string of seven birdies over five holes turned a 
one-stroke lead into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans finished 15 under par and 27 under for the tournament, 11 
strokes ahead of Malaysia with 36 holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said this week that we would just go out and have fun and let the rest 
take care of itself," Couples said. "In the back of our minds, we are aware 
that to win for a third straight time would be outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zimbabwe team of Mark McNulty and Tony Johnstone, second at the start of 
the day, could not sustain an early charge. Zimbabwe finished the round at 
five-under and 14-under for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus birdied the final hole to gain a share of the second-round lead in 
rain, wind and cold at the Senior Tour Championship at Myrtle Beach, S.C. Albus 
was tied with Rocky Thompson at 135 at the halfway point of the season-ending 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus, with a 71, and Thompson, with a 70, were two of the three players in 
the field of 28 to break par 72 on the Dunes Club course that yielded sub-par 
scores to 15 in the opening round.

BOXING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; DON'T QUESTION FOREMAN'S GREAT VICTORY BY CRYING FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It says something about the state of boxing when one of the sport's most 
exhilarating moments -- George Foreman's 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer 
-- can be undermined by knee-jerk cries of "fix" by a fixated few. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet respected radio sports-talk hosts and newspapermen actually tried to 
perpetuate the "we was jobbed" theory last week and sullied what rightly should 
be hailed as a time-capsule sporting achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough about boxing that is unscrupulous without demeaning its 
legitimate moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but when Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays hit a home run to win the 
World Series title, no one suggested that pitcher Mitch Williams had grooved a 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 When Scott Norwood missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt that cost the Buffalo 
Bills a Super Bowl victory, no one proposed that the kicker was on the take. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing will always pay a credibility price for its sordid past -- and present. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who actually watched the Foreman-Moorer fight and thought it was 
crooked probably needs a new spit bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum, one of the fight's promoters, has his theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who gamble are sore losers," he said. "It was so astounding to some 
that somebody who is 45 years old could do this, they say there must be 
something up. I was there. Foreman hit him flush. (Talk of fix) is not even 
worth dignifying. If there was one thing about this fight, it was not 
controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind, conspiracy theorists, that Foreman set Moorer up with a left-right 
combination in the 10th and decked him with a clean left-right combo moments 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The straight right that clipped Moorer's chin might not have looked like much, 
but it was hardly a phantom punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Foreman is one of the sport's legendary knockout artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Foreman had been able to "soften up" Moorer in previous rounds 
because of Moorer's curious willingness to slug it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened here was a number of earthquakes that led to a big one," HBO 
boxing analyst Larry Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the physical evidence? 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer was glassy-eyed and groggy long after he was counted out. What about 
the blood streaming from Moorer's mouth, and the 14 stitches required to close 
the gash? 
</P>
<P>
 Great acting? 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody who can't enjoy this for what it is should find something else to 
get their kicks in," Merchant said of the unconvinced. "I've been around the 
game long enough to understand there's skepticism and cynicism, and rightly so. 
But most of that is behind the scenes, not in the ring. The athletes themselves 
are trying. There's too much at stake, too much pride." 
</P>
<P>
 As for possible behind-the-scenes chicanery, well, don't give boxing promoters 
that much credit. They can't agree on much of anything other than their disdain 
for one another. 
</P>
<P>
 So now they're in cahoots? 
</P>
<P>
 And who does this so-called "fix" benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer? Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please tell me why a guy would give up something that's worth tens of 
millions of dollars," Merchant said. "Was somebody going to pay him twenties of 
millions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe? Hardly. His road back to a title shot went through Moorer, not 
Foreman, who is not likely to take on Bowe anytime soon, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Don King? An easy target, but he does not promote Foreman and is already 
frantic about what the new champion will or -- more important -- will not do 
with his World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it is a sham that a 45-year-old is heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But it happened, fair and square. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was a travesty, blame it on a lousy crop of young heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on Michael Moorer's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman's victory in Las Vegas threw the heavyweight division into a tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's a tizzy without King? 
</P>
<P>
 The man who promoted Foreman's 1974 title fight against Muhammad Ali in Zaire 
congratulated the new champion on his victory and then begged Foreman to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody that can fight is going to go in and beat George Foreman," King said 
by phone from Mexico City, where he is promoting tonight's junior-flyweight 
title fight between Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez and Michael Carbajal. "The 
danger is that he may be incapacitated. Anybody that would encourage Foreman to 
fight is not a friend of Foreman." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same King, mind you, who is promoting a January World Boxing 
Council heavyweight title fight between 45-year-old Larry Holmes and World 
Boxing Council champion Oliver McCall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the kicker. . . . If Foreman chooses not to retire, King said, he must, 
by rule, grant King's fighter, Tony Tucker, a bout within 120 days of Foreman's 
victory over Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading from Rule 5.4, the defense of title statute in the World Boxing Assn. 
rule book, King screamed across phone lines, "In the event that a world 
champion (Moorer) loses a title against a contender (Foreman) who was not the 
available (top-ranked) contender, the new world champion must defend his title 
within no more than 120 days from the date on which he obtains the title 
against the leading available contender of his category." 
</P>
<P>
 That leading available contender is Tucker, in both the WBA and IBF rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 King fears the new champion may ignore the mandatory defense rule and dare the 
sanctioning bodies to strip Foreman of his titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, worse yet, Foreman will keep the title in the Arum stable and grant a 
rematch to Tommy Morrison, who defeated Foreman in a 12-round decision 17 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy Morrison is the only fighter ever to be knocked out by everyone but 
George Foreman," King said.  
</P>
<P>
 Arum said Foreman isn't ready yet to think about the immediate fight future. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are already speculating about a match between Foreman and Mike Tyson, who 
is expected to be released from prison in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman said he would take on Tyson in a heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he is against the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be cruel and inhuman punishment," King said. "You know what you'd 
be seeing? I'll go on record saying this. You'll be talking about murder, man, 
talking about getting another death in the ring, putting Tyson in the ring with 
Foreman." 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say King wouldn't agree to the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can always force me to do it, because it's their decision," he said. 
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Comeback Kid: Dan Duva, main man at Main Events, returned to work last Monday, 
not even two weeks after undergoing brain surgery to have a tumor removed. 
First up on Duva's agenda was plotting the future of Michael Moorer, dethroned 
as heavyweight champion by George Foreman. Duva spent the morning writing 
letters to the three sanctioning bodies, requesting that they rank Moorer at 
their next meetings. Duva's family, however, won't allow Dan to work past 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Don King says Mike Tyson will be ready to fight 60-90 days after his release 
from prison in May. The plan is to have Tyson fight a few tomato cans before 
setting him up with a WBC title bout, probably against Oliver McCall. It has 
been determined that the winner of January's Larry Holmes-McCall bout will 
fight Peter McNeeley, of Medfield, Mass., around St. Patrick's Day at the 
Boston Garden, which will be demolished soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Carbajal seeks revenge tonight when he meets Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez for Gonzalez's WBC and IBF junior-flyweight titles in a pay-per-view 
bout in Mexico City. This is the third fight between the 108-pounders. Gonzalez 
(39-2) handed Carbajal (32-1) his only defeat eight months ago. "It's going to 
be like a fight in a phone booth," Carbajal said this week. The card also 
features Genaro Hernandez, WBA junior-lightweight champion, who faces Jimmy 
Garcia in a mandatory defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's snowstorm in Big Bear did not deter Oscar De La Hoya from his work 
as he prepares for his 10-round fight against Carl Griffith on the James 
Toney-Roy Jones undercard Friday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. De La Hoya got 
his road work in before the snow hit and had sparred 111 rounds through 
Thursday.

NBA ROUNDUP; NEW-LOOK DALLAS GETS VICTORY NO. 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks have assembled an impressive group of young players, and 
perhaps finally their fortunes will improve. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked that way Friday night in Philadelphia as the Mavericks defeated the 
76ers, 107-100, for their second victory of the season. Dallas did not get its 
second victory last season until Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was especially pleasing to Coach Dick Motta because the Mavericks 
won despite an eye injury to their leading scorer, Jim Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, Jackson received a cut above the left eye that 
required three stitches. He was replaced by Lucious Harris, the former Long 
Beach State star who is part of Dallas' new vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris made seven of eight shots and scored 16 points to keep the pressure on 
the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in with a mind-set that I wanted to pick up (Jackson's) slack," Harris 
said. "The key was, I hit my first shot. Then everything seemed to fall into 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson returned in the second half and finished with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Motta: "We've got to get solid performances from Jackson, (Jamal) 
Mashburn and (Jason) Kidd every game for us to be effective. And tonight, they 
certainly played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn had 22 points, and Kidd, the rookie point guard, added 19 points and 
nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 102, Boston 82 -- The Rockets, who began last season with 15 
victories, improved to an NBA-best 5-0 as Hakeem Olajuwon scored 26 points at 
Boston Garden. Houston won its 19th in a row in November since losing to Utah 
on Nov. 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics, who have played three of last season's semifinalists, are 0-3 for 
the seventh time and the first since 1977-78. Their worst start was 0-5 in 
their first season, 1946-47. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 129, Phoenix 123 -- Shawn Kemp scored 26 points and Detlef Schrempf 
got 12 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter as the SuperSonics looked 
impressive at Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Perkins also had 22 points and Gary Payton 20 for Seattle, which led, 
118-109, with 5:57 left before the Suns rallied with three consecutive 
three-pointers, two by Elliot Perry, to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning scored 27 points and Dan Majerle 23 for Phoenix, which played 
without starters Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson as well as Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 104, New Jersey 91 -- Calbert Cheaney scored 22 points and five 
other Washington players reached double figures as the Bullets, off to their 
best start in five seasons, won at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hasn't been 3-1 since opening the 1989-90 season by winning five of 
six. After the Bullets' 11-point halftime lead was cut to five, 78-73, early in 
the fourth quarter, Don MacLean made two consecutive baskets to ignite a 9-2 
run that made it 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only four games into the season, but you can already see a big 
difference this year in the way we're playing together as one," said Tom 
Gugliotta, who had 10 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 112, Utah 104 -- Playing with a patchwork starting lineup, 
Warrior Coach Don Nelson did not figure to start with a 4-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our record, but we're not a 4-0 team," he said after the Warriors 
defeated the Jazz at Salt Lake City. "We're going to take it, but I don't know 
how we're winning. I'm as surprised as anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State did it against Utah by making 12 of 27 from three-point range, 
including six of 10 by Tim Hardaway, who had 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Latrell Sprewell also had 30 points for the Warriors. Ricky Pierce added 21 
points, and Rony Seikaly had nine rebounds. Karl Malone led Utah, which lost at 
home for the first time this season, with 25 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 123, Milwaukee 115 -- Dell Curry made five three-pointers and had 28 
points as the Hornets won for the first time this season. Alonzo Mourning had 
24 points and 13 rebounds for the Hornets in the game in Milwaukee. Rookie 
Glenn Robinson scored 12 points for the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 112, Minnesota 100 -- Scottie Pippen scored 22 points and the Bulls 
used a smothering defense in the third quarter as the Timberwolves fell to 0-5 
for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota has lost 15 in a row dating to last season. Chicago, which had six 
players reach double figures in scoring, has not lost to Minnesota in 11 games 
since the Timberwolves entered the league in 1989.

COMMENTARY; O'NEAL POISED TO INHERIT MANTLE FROM JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a moment early in the game when Shaquille O'Neal tried to spin to 
the baseline against Patrick Ewing, but Ewing took the baseline away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing would not let O'Neal come into Madison Square Garden and treat him like 
some aging sparring partner. Now O'Neal gave up his dribble and Ewing seemed to 
surround him. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not matter. O'Neal turned slightly away and pushed his own soft version 
of a hook shot toward the basket. It went in. Ewing has been the big man at the 
Garden for a long time, but O'Neal made him look small. More and more, 
Shaquille O'Neal does that to the rest of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth row of seats, Red Holzman smiled. Suddenly, it was not the Garden 
of 1994 for Holzman, it was the old Garden, and it was 1959, and Holzman was 
not looking at O'Neal, he was was looking at the young Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman was a scout for the Knicks 35 years ago. He was asked what he'd 
thought the first time he saw Wilt Chamberlain play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was having a nightmare," Holzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball came back to O'Neal's end of the court. They gave it to him on the 
left side; he turned and hit a soft jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman nodded. "I feel the same way watching this kid," he said. "I feel like 
I'm having the same nightmare all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 He is 7-feet 1-inch tall and weighs more than 300 pounds and can run and jump. 
This is only his third season, and even before the Orlando Magic have done 
anything in the playoffs, O'Neal seems to have become the biggest star in the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson is gone, Larry Bird is gone, Michael Jordan is a minor league 
baseball player. The stage has been left wide open, and Shaquille O'Neal, Shaq, 
has come crashing through the curtains to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no real art in his game. There may never be. Wilt, at the beginning, 
was dunk shots and fall-away jump shots, and he missed even more free throws 
than O'Neal misses. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time in sports when the progression, even for people who became 
huge stars, went something like this: Talent, achievement, recognition, 
unbelievable riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Now talent and recognition are enough to make you an international celebrity, 
before your team has ever won a playoff game. O'Neal sells his awful rap music, 
soft drinks, sneakers, anything with his name and number on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Things change fast in sports. A couple of weeks ago, there was an 
embarrassingly bad farewell television special for Jordan. The longer he stays 
in baseball, the quicker he will fade. In a few years, O'Neal will be as big 
with the kids as Jordan ever was.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SAVANNA HANDLES WESTERN, THEN HEARS 
MORE GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Savanna football team had one simple request after defeating host Western, 
23-7, in an Orange League game Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 "Couldn't we just stick around to hear the Brea-Olinda-Valencia final score?"  
</P>
<P>
 Savanna Coach Fred Di Palma just shrugged. How could he say no. His players 
had rolled around on the muddy field for almost two hours, what harm could they 
do in another 10 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
 When the news came that Valencia knocked off Brea-Olinda, giving the Rebels 
the league championship, the celebration began. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna finished the regular season 8-2, 4-1 in the league. Valencia finished 
in a second-place tie with Brea. Western (7-2-1, 2-2-1) finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We preached to the kids all week that we had to win to get into the 
playoffs," Di Palma said. "You can't depend on anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna needed help from Valencia, which defeated Brea, 10-7, in order to win 
the title. No matter the evening's results, Savanna would have qualified for 
the Division V playoffs with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels, fourth-ranked in Division V, promptly fell on their faces to start 
the game. They fell behind, 7-0, in the first quarter, had three turnovers by 
halftime and generally looked out of kilter. 
</P>
<P>
 By the half, Savanna had rallied for a 7-7 tie, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter -- after reminders from Di Palma that turnovers could 
prove disastrous -- Savanna seized control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Listen, we have to stop turning the ball over,' " Di Palma said of 
his halftime speech. "It's not that we made a lot of adjustments, we just 
stopped turning the ball over." 
</P>
<P>
 Western running back Justin Starkey, who had 110 yards in the first half, 
managed only nine more in the second. The Pioneers couldn't gain a first down 
until early in the fourth quarter. It was their one and only in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers had five second-half possessions. Two ended in punts, two ended 
with interceptions and the fifth ended at the game's final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna running back Daven King, held in check in the first half, suddenly 
found room to run. He scored on runs of 23 and 33 yards and gained 108 of his 
138 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 And Barry Michael, who caught six passes for 77 yards, kicked a 37-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael also had an interception.

VALENCIA LEAVES ITS MARK ON ORANGE LEAGUE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia refused to give up the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, left for dead in the Orange League, showed once again that there 
is no race without their participation. They insisted on that, with a 10-7 
victory over Brea-Olinda Friday at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Valencia," defensive end Bryan Cork said. "You don't go through the 
Orange League without going to war with Valencia." 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna received the league title because of Valencia's victory. It's only the 
second time in 12 seasons that Valencia didn't win the league title. But the 
Tigers (4-5-1, 3-1-1) will take a second-place tie with Brea-Olinda, ranked 
seventh in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (7-2-1, 3-1-1) had designs on that title, but came up inches 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Owens lunged for a first down on a fourth-and-three play. Cork dived 
head first and knocked him back. The measurement was inches short and Valencia 
took possession with 2 minutes 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to finish him off," Cork said. "Our whole season came down to that 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' season was pretty much written off a few weeks back. They 
forfeited two victories and a tie because of an ineligible player. They started 
league play winless and things didn't get much better. 
</P>
<P>
 A tie against Anaheim and a loss to Savanna put the Tigers on ice. Not only 
were they out of the title run, they were going to miss the playoffs for the 
first time since Mike Marrujo was hired as coach in 1981. Or so people thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who wrote us off didn't know Valencia," Marrujo said. "It's 
amazing what you can accomplish when you have kids who have the same purpose 
and don't care who gets the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Joe Secoda got it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He kicked a 38-yard field goal in the second quarter. That was set up when 
Jermaine Gray changed direction and chased down a Secoda floater for a 31-yard 
pass reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda improvised in the third quarter, scrambling 53 yards for the Tigers' 
only touchdown. It gave them a 10-0 lead. The rest was left to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, the Wildcats' 1,000-yard running back, was hemmed in for the most part. 
Linebackers Ryan Reilly, Steve Flores and Richard Ojeda spent much of game 
chasing Owens down. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens finished with 73 yards, most of which came on 67-yard touchdown drive in 
the third quarter. The rest of the game belonged to Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Flores: "We're Valencia and this is the Orange League. It's rightfully 
ours."

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ORANGE LUTHERAN KNOCKS OFF VALLEY 
CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the 900 fans who came to witness a little history Friday night at 
Brea-Olinda High got their wish. 
</P>
<P>
 The upstart Orange Lutheran Lancers bolted to a 21-point halftime lead, and 
went on to pound Cerritos Valley Christian, 30-17, to grab a share of the 
Olympic League championship with Valley Christian. The Lancers should get the 
higher playoff seeding because they won in head-to-head competition, the first 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Joe Juliano threw three touchdown passes and ran for another 
touchdown for the Lancers (8-2, 4-1). He passed for 181 yards and was Orange 
Lutheran's leading rusher with 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe it. I'm shocked," Lancer Coach Jim Kunau said. "Tonight 
was a tribute to 32 kids who had tremendous heart and commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian's size was a constant worry to the Orange Lutheran staff. An 
offensive line that averages 211 pounds per player would only make Mater Dei 
yawn. But, coupled with 220-pound tailback Mike Cunningham (who was moved from 
fullback six weeks ago after an injury to starter Jason Van Duyn), it looked 
like the second coming of Nebraska to the smaller Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very precise, and run or pass evenly to the right or left," said 
Dean Vieselmeyer, Orange Lutheran's defensive coordinator. "They don't give you 
many tendencies. This is the kind of team we hope some day to be at their 
level. They have a great tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lancers stomped all over Valley Christian's tradition in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran scored on its first two possessions, and each time it was on 
the first play. After receiving the opening kickoff, Juliano tossed a swing 
pass to Che Holloway, who ran untouched down the right sideline for a 91-yard 
touchdown. After forcing a punt and starting from the Valley 39, Juliano raced 
around left end for another touchdown, and the Lancers were up, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders appeared ready to make a game out of it when they recovered a 
fumble at the Orange Lutheran 44, and worked themselves into position for a 
27-yard field goal by David Hoekstra. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian could not hold the ball in the second quarter, however, as 
Holloway stole a fumble in the air from Cunningham at the Lancer 48. Juliano 
guided Orange Lutheran on a 52-yard, seven-play drive, punctuated by his second 
touchdown pass, a 13-yarder to Mike Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 70-yard punt return by Dan Young, the Lancers scored again, getting a 
34-yard field goal from Matt Stratton with 11 seconds left in the game.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; MATER DEI KEEPS TWO STREAKS ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were few surprises Friday night as undefeated Mater Dei beat winless 
Dana Hills, 42-13, in South Coast League action at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch quarterback John Flynn was near-perfect in a little more than two 
quarters of play, throwing for four touchdowns and completing 11 of 12 passes 
for 256 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's main target was sophomore wide receiver Rod Perry, who caught three 
touchdown passes -- of 50, 57 and 17 yards -- and finished the night with eight 
receptions for 236 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 Monarchs (10-0, 5-0) scored on every possession in the first half 
and on their opening drive of the second half before Coach Bruce Rollinson put 
in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (0-10, 0-5) were able to hold Mater Dei scoreless for the 
remainder of the game, with the Monarchs' only first down coming on a 53-yard 
run by reserve running back Zachariah Pricer. Pricer took the ball to the 
Dolphins' four-yard line, where the defense kept them out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the Dolphins' two scoring plays came on a five-yard run by Jon 
Trottier early in the fourth quarter. After senior Matt Peters recovered an 
on-sides kick, Dana Hills moved the ball 53 yards on six plays and Scott 
Maynard connected with senior running back Robert Lathan on a 19-yard touchdown 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs also got two touchdowns from senior Steve Bodnar, who finished 
the night with seven carries for 112 yards.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; LAGUNA HILLS FOILS COSTA MESA WITH 
TIMELY PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's game plan was easy: Stop Brendan McGraw. Do that and the Mustangs 
will win. That's what the coach had said, and that's what his team had to do. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Mustangs stopped McGraw. For 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the guy Costa Mesa could care less about, Laguna Hills' Corey Pardoe, 
completed a 24-yard pass. Then McGraw busted a 23-yard run. And then Pardoe 
passed 20 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, Laguna Hills had momentum, a psychological advantage and a 
whole new ball game. By the time the Hawks were finished, they had four 
consecutive touchdowns and a 27-14 victory that gave them the Pacific Coast 
League title, their first since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the game, McGraw was Orange County's second-leading rusher with 
1,947 yards, trailing Costa Mesa's Charles Chatman (2,247). They were 1-2 in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his 23-yarder, McGraw had carried 13 times for 21 yards. But after 
Pardoe completed a pass, giving the Costa Mesa defense something to think 
about, McGraw was 17 for 115 yards. He finished with 30 carries for 136. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman, the county's second-leading scorer, rushed 18 times for 70 yards and 
no touchdowns, though he moved past former teammate Binh Tran into second place 
on the county single-season rushing list with 2,317 yards; Tran had 2,303 last 
year. Dewayne Crenshaw carried 10 times for 125 yards, but 48 came on Costa 
Mesa's final drive, trailing 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't move the ball when the game was on the line," Costa Mesa Coach 
Myron Miller said. "We had to stop McGraw and we're vulnerable to the pass. But 
the big thing was that they were too tough for us on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills defense never allowed Chatman to break a long gain -- his 
longest run from scrimmage was his last, 15 yards -- and prevented Crenshaw 
from breaking through the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was an unlikely hero for Laguna Hills (8-2 overall, 5-0). Adam Roman 
caught that first touchdown pass, of 20 yards, over his shoulder, with 28 
seconds left in the first half, and Sako Yakinian's extra point tied the score, 
7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Roman returned the second-half kickoff 52 yards, to the Costa Mesa 35. 
After McGraw ran for one yard -- surprise -- Pardoe's third and final 
completion went over the middle to tight end Jay Johnson for a 34-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman later returned a punt 29 yards, to the Costa Mesa 16, and McGraw got all 
16, capping it with a two-yard run to make it 21-7 with 10:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa (7-2-1, 3-1-1) was stopped on its next drive on fourth and eight 
when Ben Massimino dragged down Chatman for a three-yard loss. One play later, 
with 4:45 to go, McGraw high-stepped into the end zone on a 31-yard score -- 
his 35th touchdown of the season, two short of the county record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just real excited," McGraw said of the high step. "I wasn't trying to 
show anybody up. But it's not very often you get a chance to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win a league title, that is."

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SCORECARD: COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 
10; LOST IN A CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leading 21-7 over Costa Mesa Friday night, Laguna Hills had hoped to run out 
the final 5:16 of its game when officials stopped the clock. That action 
infuriated Hawk Coach Steve Bresnahan, who was told by referee Bill Hudson that 
the crowd near the end zone on the Laguna Hills' sideline was too close to the 
field and if it didn't stay back, Laguna Hills would be penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know any of those people," Bresnahan explained forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
 The "fans" he didn't know? The Laguna Hills' freshman football team. EYE OF 
BEHOLDER 
</P>
<P>
 After Century won a share of the Empire League championship Thursday with its 
victory over Kennedy, during which the Centurions nearly gave the game away via 
fumbles in the fourth quarter, Coach Bill Brown received congratulations and 
hugs from many of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 As one player embraced Brown, he said, "It's beautiful coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown replied, "No, it wasn't beautiful, but it was a win." A PLAYOFF GLIMPSE 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County teams that have qualified for the Southern Section playoffs, by

Trabuco Hills. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Brett Paton's football career ended at Newport Harbor in 1982, when he broke 
his leg while playing for El Toro against the host Sailors. The injury left him 
with a permanent limp. 
</P>
<P>
 Paton was on the sidelines Thursday in the first game between the two teams on 
that field since that night 12 years ago. He's the coach of the Chargers' 
linebackers. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough. A little bit of me is always going to be on the other sideline, 
but all of my heart is here with this Dolphin team."

CARSON (2-8) SELECTED FOR PLAYOFFS; PREP FOOTBALL: REACTION MIXED AFTER 
FORFEITURES FOR USING AN INELIGIBLE PLAYER. 
</P>

<P>
 Can a team with a 2-8 record win the City Section Division 4-A football 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, which has won nine City championships, will try to be the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, who forfeited three conference games for using an ineligible 
player, on Friday morning were selected to the 16-team 4-A playoffs despite 
their record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, seeded 12th, will play fifth-seeded Franklin in the first round at 
7:30 p.m. Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated for the kids," Carson Coach David Williams said. "They have had so 
much adversity. All they wanted was a chance to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive season, Sylmar was selected the top-seeded 4-A team, 
and Reseda was chosen the No. 1-seeded team in 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the prospects of facing Carson in the semifinals, Sylmar Coach Jeff 
Engilman supported the team's inclusion in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see a 4-A playoffs without Carson," Engilman said. "We talked about 
who was going to match up with whom and we were concerned that we would have to 
play Carson in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches disagreed, especially after Carson broke City eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I question whether they should be in there," Venice co-Coach Kirk Alexander 
said. "I know they're one of the top teams in the city. But this is the second 
time in a calendar year that Carson had to forfeit games for using an 
ineligible player." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Colts had to forfeit victories over Crenshaw, Wilmington 
Banning and later Harbor City Narbonne for using an academically ineligible 
sophomore transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ineligibility problems are not new to Carson. Last March, the school's boys' 
basketball team was disqualified from the 4-A semifinals for using an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 During the four-hour playoff pairings meeting Friday, an eight-member 
committee considered the implications of including Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts qualified as one of the section's top 32 teams with a 2-5 conference 
record, fifth best in the Southern Pacific Conference. Teams were selected 
based on the strength of their record and the strength of the teams in their 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six teams -- one from each of the city's six conferences -- received 
automatic bids to the 4-A playoffs. Ten at-large teams rounded out the 4-A 
field and the next best 16 teams were placed in the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs begin Friday with the first round and continue with the 
quarterfinals Nov. 23, the semifinals Dec. 2, the 3-A championship Dec. 9 and 
the 4-A championship Dec. 10.

BISHOP AMAT DOMINATES TO PERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the same old story for the La Puente Bishop Amat High football team. 
Daylon McCutcheon runs, the defense dominates and the Lancers mow down another 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sante Fe Springs St. Paul became the Lancers' 10th victim Friday night, 
falling, 21-6, before an estimated crowd of 8,000 at Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon turned in another stellar effort, rushing for 177 yards and three 
touchdowns in 30 carries, as the Lancers, ranked No. 1 by The Times, finished 
the regular season at 10-0 and 5-0 in Del Rey League play. Ninth-ranked St. 
Paul finished 7-3 and 2-3, and still clings to hopes of reaching the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs, which begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat will play next week as the division's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' defense appears mightier than ever after allowing St. Paul only 
107 yards on offense, including a scoring drive late in the fourth quarter that 
covered 80 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, the Swordsmen had managed only two first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense did a super job tonight," said Bishop Amat Coach Tom Salter. "We 
played well, but we will have to play even better next week. Everything starts 
over again in the playoffs." MARK STRODER

BASEBALL COVERS OLD GROUND; LABOR: TALKS ARE CORDIAL, BUT NO NEW PROPOSALS ARE 
OFFERED IN LATEST ROUNDS OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No new proposals or concessions were made Friday as representatives of the 
baseball owners and striking players met for five hours in Rye Brook, N.Y., and 
continued to educate special mediator William J. Usery on their respective 
views regarding the salary cap and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks will continue today, but it became clearer Friday that the owners 
are watching the calendar and, barring an unexpected agreement, plan to 
implement the cap unilaterally before Dec. 20, the last date to tender 1995 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Harrington, chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox and now 
lead negotiator for the owners: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to get to the point where we're voting on implementation. 
Whether it's Dec. 6, 7 or 20, the owners don't really want to see it happen. We 
need a long-term agreement, but we're also reaching a point at which important 
decisions have to be made on both the baseball and business sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leader Donald Fehr, who has contended from the start that the owners 
intend to implement, said Harrington spelled it out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is that they believe there is a calendar that has some imperative 
dates in early December," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the talks of Thursday and Friday, while covering old ground, 
have been constructive, but said he could not predict if they would produce a 
breakthrough. The sides will renew talks on payroll tax concepts today, but the 
owners continue to insist on cost containment and a mechanism equivalent to a 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure a whole lot has changed, but the discussions have been 
considerably more candid," Kevin Brown of the Texas Rangers said.

LOS ALAMITOS; DOWN WITH DEBT SHOWS CHAMPIONSHIP FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Down With Debt moved a step closer to winning a 1994 world championship with 
her stunning victory in the $100,000 AQHA Challenge Championship Friday night 
at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking from the outside post position in the 10-horse field, Down With Debt 
was never seriously challenged in the 440-yard race. Under the confident 
handling of jockey John Creager, Down With Debt posted a winning time of 21.53 
seconds, paying $3.20, $2.80 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound Dash, one of Down With Debt's main rivals for the champion aged mare 
title, finished second, three-quarters of a length behind, and paid $5.00 and 
$3.20. Specially Fast, a multiple stakes winner this year, paid $3.20 for the 
show position. 
</P>
<P>
 Down With Debt, trained by Charlie Bloomquist for owner George Haddad, is 
undefeated this year. Her victories include the Las Damas and Go Man Go 
handicaps and the Vessels Maturity. The next start for the 4-year-old mare is 
expected to be the prestigious Champion of Champions on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In other stakes action Friday night: 
</P>
<P>
 A disqualification in the $50,000 Wrangler Juvenile Challenge Championship 
resulted in RJ Not Easy winning his first California start for owner-breeder 
Randy Higginson and trainer Lin Melton. The gelding was awarded the victory 
after Runaway Streaker was disqualified and placed fifth for interfering with 
favored High Priorities. RJ Not Easy paid $81.20, $26.00 and $14.40. Victorious 
Moon was placed second, followed by early leader Slick Willie Fisher in third. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt, who won the first race of the evening with 
Inspiring Dash, saddled his second stakes winner of the night in the $50,000 
Sooner Trailer Derby Challenge Championship. Ridden by John Creager, who also 
won the Challenge Championship aboard Down With Debt, Lil Bita Brunch dueled 
with Ronas Deal before prevailing by a nose in the 400-yard race, winning in 
19.96 seconds. Nip Them In The Bud ran third. Lil Bita Brunch paid $9.40, $5.80 
and $2.80 for his winning efforts.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; TIME RUNNING OUT ON JOCKEYS' RIDING 
CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next sport that could be shut down because of a labor dispute is horse 
racing, which might have a severe jockey shortage on Jan. 1 if the tracks and 
the riders don't reach an agreement on health and accident insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the jockeys will ride without a contract," said John Giovanni, 
national manager of the Jockeys' Guild, whose members ride 85%-90% of the 
horses in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanni, who rode about 1,800 winners during a 20-year career, is scheduled 
to meet Tuesday in Chicago with the Thoroughbred Racing Assn., a national trade 
group that submitted a new proposal on behalf of the tracks to the jockeys last 
Sunday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild's reaction to that proposal, which the TRA says will increase the 
jockeys' accident benefits by 25%, is already known. "This raises the question 
of whether they want to negotiate in good faith," Giovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year contract that expires Dec. 31 was hammered out just before the 
last deadline, on New Year's Eve in 1991. The new negotiations, which started 
only a few months ago, have been brief and acrimonious. Sunday's meeting lasted 
less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The eternal issue is money -- how much the tracks are willing to pay for the 
jockeys' expensive coverage in a high-risk profession -- but there are other 
differences as well. 
</P>
<P>
 One focuses on television rights, which the jockeys have waived in their 
contracts for almost 30 years. Mainly, this means that the jockeys give up 
their perceived share of the multimillion-dollar rights fees that the networks 
pay for televising the Triple Crown races and the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1966, the tracks came to us and told us we had those rights," Giovanni 
said. "We didn't even know we had them until they told us. Now, after all these 
years, they're telling us that we don't have them. How can that be?" 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA says that the jockeys are now compensated for the TV rights in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "(There have been) increased purses generated by the simulcasting of races," 
the TRA said in a statement. "More than $30 million of the estimated $60 
million in fees paid directly to jockeys by horse owners in 1993 was derived 
from simulcast purse distributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the TV rights issue is as big a stumbling block as the salary cap is 
for the striking major league baseball players, Giovanni said, "Yes, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bailey, the president of the guild, rode Concern to victory in the 
$3-million Breeders' Cup Classic, and his 10% share of the purse was $156,000. 
Bailey can afford the reported $13,000 in annual premiums that he pays for 
private insurance, but he is an exception. The guild says that the average 
jockey earns about $25,000 a year, and as independent contractors they have 
expenses that baseball and hockey players don't have. 
</P>
<P>
 To start with, jockeys' agents, who book their mounts, typically charge 25% of 
what the rider earns. When a jockey leaves home to ride during the summer at 
Del Mar or Saratoga, or when a New York jockey rides in Florida during the 
winter, he pays his own living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks say that jockeys' annual health insurance premiums have increased 
96% in the last 10 years, to $2.4 million in 1993. The tracks say that the fees 
they have paid for each rider's mount, money that eventually goes into the 
insurance program, were $1.6 million last year, up 139% from 1984. The accident 
insurance for jockeys has been costing the tracks $4.5 million under the 
current contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks have pooh-poohed a guild proposal that the bettors be taxed a penny 
on every $10 wagered, to be used to pay for health and accident insurance and a 
pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guild's plan calls for an additional taxation on the fans approximating 
$11 million," the tracks' statement said. "The TRA strongly opposes this 
concept of raising the takeout, particularly when the racing industry is in a 
period of economic distress and declining demand. Raising prices would only 
further deteriorate the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanni scoffed at the tracks' proposal that the jockeys' accident policy 
increase medical benefits from $50,000 to $62,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time in 20 years that that benefit has gone up," he said. 
"But they'll be doing it for the same rates. We're the ones who have fought for 
protective vests and safety rails. We've kept the injuries down, and now 
they're telling us that they're giving us something extra." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita is one of the tracks scheduled to be running Jan. 1. Fans are 
advised to have backup plans. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Serena's Song's season may not be over. Second by a head to her stablemate, 
Flanders in to the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Serena's Song may run in the 
$250,000 Hollywood Starlet on Dec. 17. She broke her maiden, winning by 10 
lengths, at Hollywood Park this summer, then won the Landaluce there and the 
Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita. . . . Flanders, who cracked a bone in her lower 
right foreleg during the race, had two screws inserted Monday to repair the 
break. "We'll take three or four months to assess her recovery, and then decide 
whether she can run again," trainer Wayne Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, who finished first among the non-3-year-olds in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, might make a rare grass appearance in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup 
on Dec. 11. The first four finishers in the Classic were 3-year-olds -- 
Concern, Tabasco Cat, Dramatic Gold and Soul Of The Matter. With Best Pal 
earning $60,000 and stablemate Dramatic Gold collecting $360,000, their owners, 
John and Betty Mabee, made up for the $360,000 it cost them to supplement Best 
Pal, who finished only three lengths behind Concern, even though jockey Chris 
McCarron didn't think Best Pal was comfortable running on the Churchill Downs 
track. Best Pal, a 6-year-old gelding, has run on grass twice in 37 starts, 
both times at Hollywood. He was second to Bien Bien in last year's Hollywood 
Turf Handicap and ran second behind Fly Till Dawn in the 1991 Citation 
Handicap.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CRITICAL LOSS, COIN FLIP LEAVE SONORA'S 
PLAYOFF FATE IN LIMBO 
</P>

<P>
 For the the second consecutive year, all the Sonora Raiders had to do was win 
their final game to control their playoff destiny. And for the second year in a 
row, their fate is in the hands of others. 
</P>
<P>
 By losing to Sunny Hills, 17-7, on Thursday, the Raiders kicked away their 
chance to win the Freeway League title outright. Instead they are in a four-way 
tie with Sunny Hills, Fullerton and Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After the games Thursday, the principals of all four schools gathered for a 
coin flip to determine the odd team out from the three automatic Southern 
Section playoffs. Sonora lost. Sunny Hills will be seeded first, followed by 
Fullerton and Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, 5-5 overall and 3-2 in league, now must wait until Sunday to see 
if they are awarded an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will turn in wild-card papers Saturday to CIF," Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen 
said. "Do we have good case? I don't know; there will probably be one team at 
6-4 and another at 5-5. But we'll present that we are co-champs and our fate 
was not decided on the field but by coin flip." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to Sunny Hills, however, was still on Takkinen's mind Friday. "I'm 
not yet over the game. It's the first time we've gotten a piece of the league 
title in last 21 years, and we still might not go to playoffs. But by losing 
our last two games, we cut our own throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Julian Smilowitz was on the other end of spectrum, savoring 
his team's first playoff bid since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad to be there. It's been a dry spell; now it's the kids' turn to 
make things happen.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; MISSION VIEJO 
REACHES PLAYOFFS BY BEATING SAN CLEMENTE, 24-21

 The drought is over. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it only lasted one year. But that was one year too long for the folks 
at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 First-year coach Bill Denny gave Diablo fans what they wanted, a 24-21 
playoff-clinching victory over San Clemente in a South Coast League game Friday 
night at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 That ensures the Diablos (4-6, 3-2) of third place and a berth in the 
playoffs, which Mission Viejo missed last year for the first time since 1977.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ask for anything more as far as a high school game. I'm proud of 
these kids," Denny said. "At the start of the year we didn't think wins or 
losses. We wanted to go back (to the playoffs). That was our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Diablos did it with a big-play offense. Of their four scores, two came on 
the first play of the drive and another on the second play. Ryan Ballas started 
it with a 70-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game, and Todd 
Fielding finished it with a 70-yard scoring run with 1 minute 46 seconds 
remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo took advantage of two turnovers by San Clemente to build a 17-7 
halftime lead, then turned to its defense after the Tritons closed to within 
three with 7:39 left on a 19-yard pass from Jeff Carlin to Trevor Insley, his 
second touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente (4-6, 1-4) was stopped twice with less than three minutes 
remaining. MICHAEL CASEY

 Los Amigos used a balanced attack to stymie Pacifica's playoff aspirations 
with a 35-19 Garden Grove League victory Friday night at Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would have secured the league's third playoff spot for the Mariners 
(5-5-, 3-3), who are now at the mercy of the result of a coin flip with 
Santiago and Garden Grove.

<P>
 Eighth-ranked Los Amigos (9-1, 5-1) has already secured the league's second 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos struck first with 3 minutes 7 seconds left in the first quarter on 
Greg Fausto's two-yard run. Each team committed two first-half turnovers, and 
although Pacifica's lone score of the half was set up by a fumble on a botched 
reverse, it was the Mariners who made the costlier mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ryan Johansen passed to Casey Huffmire for a 23-yard score, the Mariners 
lost track of Lobo fullback Niu Satele. On a third-and-six play on the ensuing 
possession, Neval Tuato spotted Satele alone at the 25. The 6-foot, 230-pounder 
then barreled over two tacklers to complete the 39-yard scoring play, giving 
the Lobos a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Lobos' next drive, Tuato connected with Satele on a similar play, this 
one covering 51 yards for a 28-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Satele finished with five catches for 120 yards. AHMED V. ORTIZ

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; BEDARD POWERS SERVITE PAST SANTA ANA

<P>
 David Bedard scored five touchdowns and gained 140 total yards as Servite 
routed Santa Ana, 40-0, in a Golden West League game Friday night at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard accumulated 139 of his yards and four of his touchdowns in the first 
half.He also had a 35-yard touchdown run in the first half erased by a holding 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the opening drive on its 36 (its worst field position of the 
night), Servite (8-2, 5-0) started on Santa Ana's side of the field seven of 
their remaining nine possessions. The Saints' (1-9, 1-4) never started a drive 
on Servite's side of the field. Servite also turned Santa Ana turnovers into 21 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard started early, scoring on a 58-yard touchdown run on the game's second 
play to give the Friars a 6-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Saints failed on a fourth-down opportunity, Bedard scored on an 
11-yard run three plays later. The two-point conversion failed and the Friars 
led, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard then scored from three yards out with 9 minutes 58 seconds left in the 
first half to give Servite a 19-0 lead. A 31-yard pass from David Martin to 
Bedard made it 26-0. Bedard had more total yards in the first half than Santa 
Ana (139-138). 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard carried the ball only once in the second half, and that produced a 
one-yard touchdown run to make it 33-0. TONY ALTOBELLI

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: DON'T CELEBRATE YET, OHIO, THE WINLESS STILL 
DOMINATE 
</P>

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati, you surely know, leads the world in the manufacture of soap 
products. But it wasn't until last weekend that the city was able to wash away 
some of the ignominy of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an incredible coincidence, the University of Cincinnati and the 
Cincinnati Bungles recorded victories--the first of the season for each. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Bottom Ten selectors, Ohio has plenty of other winless teams, 
including Akron and Ohio U., which became joint leaders of the prestigious 
rankings on the non-strength of losses to Eastern and Western Michigan. Or was 
it Southern and Northern Michigan? Well, no matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, John Mackovic, No. 13 Texas' beleaguered coach, said a key factor 
in the Longhorns' recent 1-3 streak was an injury: his own. Since an Oct. 1 
sideline collision, Mackovic explained, he has been "watching the team play and 
watching things happen and I just wasn't able to respond as quickly." No wonder 
he hasn't made a single tackle in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings: 03,24,22,14 School, Record Last Loss Next Loss 1. Akron (0-9) 
18-42, E. Michigan Ball State 1. Ohio (0-9) Its coach E. Michigan 3. Iowa St.

(merger of Tulsa and Tulane) (3-14); 16.-19. Pentagon (Coast Guard, Army, Navy, 
Air Force) (16-19); 20. Notre Dame (one victory in last four weeks). 
</P>
<P>
 It's (Pardon the Expression) Academic, Now: Attorneys for some Washington 
Huskies players withdrew their motion for an injunction to temporarily end the 
probation that bars the team from a bowl game. The reason? The Huskies' third 
loss on the football field--a 28-46 pasting by previously hapless Stanford. THE 
PROS 
</P>
<P>
 You have to feel sorry for Houston offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride. Last 
year he was punched on national TV by defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan 
(whatever happened to Ryan, anyway?). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, General Manager Floyd Reese makes Gilbride look like an incompetent by 
ordering the playing of gimpy quarterback Cody Carlson the entire game against 
the Pitts. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? A 9-12 loss in which Carlson threw eight consecutive 
incompletions, was sacked six times and admitted afterward, "I'm out of shape, 
no doubt about it. I haven't been able to run since the beginning of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Seashocks, meanwhile, had the roof fall in on them during their 
seasonal debut at the Kingdome--a humiliating 17-20 loss to the Bungles. The 
game drew 46,630, Seattle's second-smallest non-strike crowd. Many fans 
apparently stayed away from the Kingdome out of fear of being hit either by 
falling roof tiles or wild Rick Mirer passes.

 Expert analysis: After two Cowboy linemen were involved in separate late-hours 
crashes after a wild party, wide receiver Michael Irvin had an explanation. 
"There's just too many cars on the road right now," he said.

 Get serious: ESPN's Chris Mortensen said Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman wants

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ORANGE LEAGUE; DROUGHNS, ANAHEIM BEAT 
MAGNOLIA, 35-18

<TEXT>
<P>
 A disappointing season ended on a high note for Anaheim on Friday night and 
the Colonists certainly can hang on to one positive thought: Reuben Droughns 
will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists started the 1994 season 5-0, but finished fifth in the Orange 
League despite Friday's 35-18 homecoming victory over Magnolia.Droughns put 
forth a typical effort, rushing for 182 yards in 15 carries and scoring four 
times, including touchdown runs of 35 and 47 yards the first two times he 
touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns is on pace to become the leading rusher in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim struck quickly in the first quarter, needing only four offensive plays 
to score three times. Rudy Herrera connected with Travis Pena on the game's 
opening play for a 75-yard touchdown. Interceptions by Charlie Reyes and Carlos 
Hernandez set up two Droughns scoring runs and the Colonists led, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels employed a full-house backfield and Tony Iliescu (101 yards), 
Sean Roy (59 yards), and Carlos Martin (53 yards) each scored a touchdown and 
paced a 233-yard rushing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin scored first, finding a hole through the middle and going 27 yards for 
a touchdown early in the second quarter. Iliescu recovered an Anaheim fumble on 
their next play from scrimmage, and Magnolia embarked on a 39-yard scoring 
drive, capped by a two-yard Roy run to make it 21-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists put it away with two touchdowns in a span of 1 minute 15 seconds 
early in the final period. Droughns made it 28-12 with a six-yard touchdown 
run, and brother Robert intercepted a Josh Reding pass two plays later, 
returning it 33 yards to the Magnolia 12. Reuben Droughns scored on the next 
play. ERIC MADDY

three-yard run with 8:48 left in the first half. McCleary then ran in the 
two-point conversion, cutting the lead to 14-8.

<P>
 But Ontario Christian came back to up the lead to 17-8 when Goedhart kicked a 
24-yard field goal with 2:29 left in the first half.

yards for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage.

 A touchdown run and two touchdown passes by Waylan Kruse helped Calvary Chapel 
past Brethren Christian, 34-15, Friday night at Artesia High. By winning, the 
Eagles finish in a tie for third and gained a probable playoff spot as a wild 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (1-9, 0-5) took the early lead when Ryan Babcock scored on a 
three-yard dive on the first possession of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles did not waste time on their next drive (11 plays), which featured 
running back David Kuhn, who carried nine times for 61 yards. An eight-yard 
touchdown reception by Josh Young from Kruse tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Warriors failed to convert on an Eagle fumble, Calvary Chapel took 
the lead on an 56-yard touchdown pass to Joe Jones from Kruse with 2:04 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (6-4, 3-2) buried Brethren Christian with two third-quarter 
touchdowns. Kruse scored the first on a two-yard run with 9:28 left in the 
third quarter. Eight minutes later, Kuhn, who finished the game with 89 yards 
rushing, scored on a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 An interception by Calvary Chapel's Eric Thulander set up three rushes by Ken 
Nash, the last a one-yard touchdown run, to make it 34-7 with 4:01 left to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock, who completed 10 of 32 passes for 210 yards, rushed six yards for a 
touchdown with a minute left. JASON HILL

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE; ALISO NIGUEL ENDS 
UNIVERSITY THREAT AS CLOCK RUNS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior Mike Campbell kicked two field goals to lead Aliso Niguel to a 12-7 
Pacific Coast League victory over University Friday night at Irvine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel, which finished the season 4-6 overall and 2-3 in the Pacific 
Coast League, held off a late rally by University (4-5-1, 2-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 University, which finished third in the Pacific Coast League, clinched a 
playoff berth with a 30-30 tie last week against Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel moved out to a 12-7 lead on Campbell's 28-yard field goal with 1 
minute 16 seconds remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But University drove to the Aliso Niguel 12-yard line with 10 seconds left. 
However, on a second down play, Scott Nemeth intercepted Alan Price's pass as 
time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's 35-yard field goal gave Aliso Niguel a 3-0 lead with 4:04 remaining 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On its next possession, Aliso Niguel had the ball at its own 23-yard line, but 
on a first down play, the ball was snapped over the head of Nemeth, the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 University defensive end Sepher Sharifi recovered the ball in the end zone to 
put University ahead, 7-3, with 1:47 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel went ahead, 9-7, on an 18-yard touchdown run by Trent Perley with 
11:15 left in the fourth quarter. The kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perley led Aliso Niguel, rushing for 119 yards in 16 carries.

<P>
 It was not Foothill's sharpest outing, but the Knights still had more than 
enough to carve up El Modena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-8 victory over the host Vanguards in front of a crowd of about 1,500 gave 
Foothill its second consecutive Century League championship.Three touchdowns in 
a six-minute span of the second quarter gave Foothill its 13th consecutive 
league victory and second consecutive unbeaten league season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lopsided score, Foothill Coach Tom Meiss said his team could have 
played better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like we were in sync offensively," Meiss said. "I wasn't happy 
with our kicking game or our (passing) game. But maybe I'm too greedy.' 
</P>
<P>
 He had no reason for concern. El Modena became charitable midway through the 
second quarter, and the Knights (6-4, 5-0) took advantage, turning a scoreless 
game into a blowout. Nick Sveslosky's 90-yard touchdown run gave Foothill a 6-0 
lead, then two El Modena turnovers led to two more scores. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-yard touchdown run by Tyler Lang after an interception by Travis Freeman 
made it 12-0. Lang then hit Danny Monarch with a 48-yard touchdown pass after 
an El Modena fumble in the final minute of the half for a 20-0 Foothill lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sveslosky, who rushed for 93 yards in six carries, and Lawrence Mariner, who 
transferred to Foothill from El Modena about a month ago, each scored a 
touchdown in the second half for the Knights (6-4, 5-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's defense played up to Meiss' standards, limiting El Modena (3-7, 
1-4) to 145 total yards. Foothill held El Modena to less than 100 yards in 
offense before a 49-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Danny Goodwin to Jason 
Said spoiled the shutout late in the game.

BAVASI OUTLINES PLAN TO RETOOL THE ANGELS; BASEBALL: PLAYERS HAVE BEEN TARGETED 
IN THE FIRST OF SEVERAL MEETINGS OF TEAM MANAGEMENT.

<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi stops by the concession stand, loads up for 
dinner with a foot-long hot dog and a bag of peanuts, and sits alone in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 He studies the Angel prospects playing in the Arizona Fall League this 
particular night, but it adds little to what he already knows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are to have any chance of competing in 1995, they need a 
stopper, another power-hitter and a right-handed starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to improve this club," Bavasi said, "and we'd like to do it quickly. 
We're certainly willing to do something before we leave here." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the Angel front office had the first of its organizational meetings 
and made several critical decisions that will affect the team's future: 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of giving designated hitter Chili Davis a three-year, $11.25-million 
contract, they will go year by year. They have decided to take their chances in 
arbitration, conceding that Davis could earn $4.25 million to $4.5 million in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Center fielder Chad Curtis, signed to a three-year, $4.5-million contract 
last spring, is available. Trading Curtis would free his $1.9-million salary 
next season, and enable the Angels to put Jim Edmonds in center field and 
Garret Anderson in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 * First baseman J.T. Snow is someone the Angels are intent on trading. They 
would like to replace him with free-agent power hitter Mickey Tettleton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Starting pitcher Chuck Finley, who will earn $4.5 million in 1995, will stay 
for at least one more year before he's eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Closer Joe Grahe, who earned $910,000 last season and is again eligible for 
arbitration, most likely will not get a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * The return of Jim Abbott to the Angels is a fantasy. The Angels have minimal 
interest in Abbott, particularly because of an anticipated salary of $4 million 
or more. They prefer someone such as right-handed free-agent Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outfielder Bo Jackson will be offered a contract for less than $500,000, but 
the Angels don't count on him accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Greg Myers will inherit the bulk of the catching duties, although the Angels 
want to acquire a veteran right-handed hitting catcher as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eduardo Perez will enter spring training with every opportunity to be the 
everyday third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest debate in the meetings, sources say, is whether it's more 
important to acquire a power-hitter or a bullpen stopper. The Angels have 
finished last in scoring for the third consecutive year in the American League. 
And their bullpen finished last statistically in 1994, finishing with an 11-18 
record and producing only 21 saves in 32 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's a tough choice," Bavasi said. "As ugly as it looked last year 
without a stopper, you can point at too many things that took away the chance 
of us winning games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make a move for a closer, we won't pass it up, but we also have to 
look at ways to score more runs." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, of course, will be fitting the Angels' needs into a $24.5-million 
budget. They have nine players under contract for about $20 million, depending 
on Davis' arbitration hearing, leaving only about $4.5 million for the 
remaining 16 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult adding someone on," Bavasi said, "without taking 
someone off." 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, although the Angels will resurrect talks again with the Minnesota 
Twins for closer Rick Aguilera, they will insist the Twins pick up a portion of 
Aguilera's $4.2-million salary in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels say they also plan to talk with the Montreal Expos about closer 
John Wetteland and the Kansas City Royals about closer Jeff Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, at the right price, they again will pursue closer Mitch Williams. 
Williams dropped out of baseball last season after being released by the 
Houston Astros. The Angels made several attempts to persuade Williams to join 
the club, but he refused, saying he wanted to take off the remainder of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can promise you," Angel President Richard Brown said, "is that we'll be 
very, very aggressive at these meetings. Believe me, people will quickly find 
that out."

IT ISN'T BIG TIME, IT'S A GOOD TIME; PRINGLE GRINNING AND GAINING YARDS AND 
RECORDS IN THE CFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the Canadian Football League, not the NFL, and he's playing for a 
no-nickname team in Baltimore that the courts won't let be called "Colts" 
because of a suit filed by the team in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Television coverage? Sure, there's an occasional appearance on ESPN2, where 
you can catch a CFL game now and then along with the calf roping and jet ski 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Pringle doesn't care. At 27, he's still playing football, and that's 
the important thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a good college career at Cal State Fullerton a few years before the 
school suspended the program. And Pringle had his shot in the NFL too, but 
things just didn't work out. It's been too long now for Pringle to think much 
about the might-have-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 And frankly, he's starting to like this CFL thing anyway, especially the way 
the current season has been going. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be only the CFL, but Pringle is the most successful running back in it 
this year. He finished the regular season last weekend with 1,972 yards in 308 
carries, a league record for single-season rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 And getting that many yards is even more of an accomplishment because of the 
CFL's three-down rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different, but it's still good football," Pringle said. "The 
only thing is that a lot of running backs in this league get turned off by 
having only the three downs. That makes it more difficult. You have to get most 
of your yardage on first down. There's more chance the quarterbacks will be 
throwing the ball on the other downs. But I've been getting the chance to run 
the ball 20 to 25 times a game, which is out of the ordinary for a running back 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle had a good shot at surpassing 2,000 yards last weekend. Had he done 
that, he would have been one of only a handful of players on the pro level to 
scale that mountain. Only two NFL runners have done it: Eric Dickerson, when he 
gained 2,105 with the Rams in 1984, and O.J. Simpson, who had 2,003 with 
Buffalo in 1973. Herschel Walker gained 2,411 in 1985 when he played in the 
USFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle gained 71 yards against Sacramento last Saturday, falling 28 yards 
short of 2,000. It was especially disappointing because he appeared to be home 
free with 62 yards in the first half. Baltimore, however, fell behind and went 
to an all-out passing game the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I was capable of getting it, and that's the important thing to 
me," he said. "It turned out to be out of my control, and I hardly touched the 
ball in the second half. I'll just leave it at that. I'm not usually that much 
into stats, but I'll admit that bothered me a little." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't diminish what Pringle did accomplish for a team that is 12-6 
and begins the playoffs today against Toronto. He also caught passes for 442 
yards, set a CFL record for yards from scrimmage (2,414). He missed the league 
record for all-purpose running, including kickoff returns, by 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best season I've had," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
 His final collegiate season in 1989 certainly wasn't shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle, who played for Granada Hills Kennedy High, will be remembered at 
Fullerton for his 357-yard rushing effort in 31 carries against New Mexico 
State. It tied an NCAA single-game rushing record, but it was broken the next 
weekend. He finished the season with 1,727 yards, an average of 157 per game. 
That still ranks as the 23rd-best effort in NCAA history. His 2,690 all-purpose 
yards that season is the fourth-best in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "That season was a whole career for a lot of running backs," said Gene Murphy, 
who was the Titans' coach at the time. "The thing that marked Mike is that he 
might have been the toughest player I ever coached. I really didn't know he 
would last this long in the game the way he'd hit people. He was a north-south 
runner, and he would take anyone on. He was very aggressive. I'm happy that 
he's still doing well in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons, the second player chosen in the 
sixth round of the NFL draft. He made the team as a rookie in 1990, and led the 
Falcons in kick returns during the exhibition season, but cracked ribs forced 
him to sit out much of the year. He came off injured reserve for three games 
late in the season, but had little success. He failed to make the roster the 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle played the next two seasons in the World Football League for 
Sacramento, and led the team in rushing in 1992, when it won the league 
championship. The World League folded, but the CFL expanded into Sacramento in 
1993. That again gave Pringle new life in football. 
</P>
<P>
 He was traded to Baltimore when the CFL expanded there this season. "It was 
really a no-brainer kind of deal for us as an expansion team because all we had 
to give up was some future considerations," said Jim Popp, Baltimore director 
of player personnel. "But they had been using Mike primarily as a blocking 
back, not a lead runner. We knew we were getting a good running back, but it 
was a stroke of luck on our part for it to have turned out this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle is even more delighted. "Baltimore is a first-class organization," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home attendance has averaged 38,300 in nine games. "The fans really support 
us," he said. "They call us Colts even though the NFL and Indianapolis got an 
injunction to keep us from using the name." 
</P>
<P>
 The public address announcer at Memorial Stadium has a gimmick so the fans can 
sound off about it. He pauses and allows the fans to loudly inject the nickname 
"Colts" in the introduction of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle says he enjoys what he calls "the faster pace of CFL football," 
compared to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have 20 seconds between plays instead of 45," Pringle said. "I 
remember the first CFL game I played. I was wondering how I was going to play 
in this league at that pace. I thought I was in good shape, but everything 
happened so fast. You've got to be in good shape for this league . . . Most of 
the offenses are like the run-and-shoot offenses in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle says he refuses to regard the CFL as a step down from the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step behind in media coverage and in money paid most of the players 
compared to the NFL," he said. "But ESPN2 carrying some games will help, and 
there are some local stations and cable companies carrying games at different 
places too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of trying to rival the NFL, but the NFL can't suit up all 
the football talent coming out of the colleges every year. It's just going to 
take more people being interested in watching it. The only problem is that it's 
the best-kept secret in football. But this is not a league that's going to 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 After this season, does Pringle think there's any chance an NFL team might 
show some interest in him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had tryouts before, and it just didn't happen for one reason or 
another," he said, "so I don't worry about it. It would be nice to have more 
options, but it's not something I think that much about. This season has been 
fun, and I'm just enjoying that."

RAMS ARE NEARER TO ST. LOUIS; NFL: OBSTACLES REMAIN AND DEAL IS NOT IMMINENT, 
BUT RAM PRESIDENT JOHN SHAW SAYS, 'WE MADE PROGRESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-hour meeting between St. Louis officials and the Rams on Thursday yielded 
some progress but did not produce a deal, despite recent broadcast reports 
speculating the Rams have already decided to move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made progress, but there are still a number of unresolved (stadium) lease 
issues," Ram President John Shaw said. "We have no deal, and no deal is really 
imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw also said "several large unresolved issues" remain with Stan Kroenke, a 
Columbia, Mo., businessman who was in Los Angeles this week to discuss 
purchasing a minority interest in the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger issue: Is Rams owner Georgia Frontiere really willing to uproot 
a franchise that has been in Southern California for 49 years and move it to 
St. Louis or Baltimore? Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Oriole owner who will meet 
with Shaw in Los Angeles this weekend to resume his pursuit of the Rams, isn't 
so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw are Los Angelenos, they love the area, 
they're part of it, and it's difficult to move," Angelos said. "In addition, I 
believe that, deep down, John has some trepidation about the viability of St. 
Louis as an NFL town. I think he'd rather come to Baltimore, but that's not 
California, either." 
</P>
<P>
 That won't stop Baltimore and St. Louis from trying, though. Angelos will take 
another crack this weekend and officials from Orange County's Save the Rams 
task force are expected to meet Shaw next week, but the Rams' focus this past 
week was on St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Eagleton, the former U.S. senator who headed the St. Louis delegation 
Thursday, said the city and the Rams are "still in disagreement on some major 
items," but resolved other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "A principal, if not the principal category that has to be resolved deals with 
the stadium and the operation of the stadium once it is completed," Eagleton 
said Friday at a St. Louis press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton would not elaborate on the problem, but it is believed the Rams would 
like more access to the new, 70,000-seat domed stadium that is part of a 
$260-million downtown convention center project. Under the current lease, the 
Rams would only have use of the stadium from noon the day before a game through 
game day. 
</P>
<P>
 Other unresolved issues apparently include who would pay for the estimated 
$400,000 per-season, game-day operating expenses, and who would receive money 
from selling stadium naming rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to go into the other items," Eagleton said. "The Rams don't 
want to negotiate in the paper, and I'm going to continue to try to keep that 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis had reason to be optimistic about at least one item: The Rams, if 
they move to St. Louis, are apparently willing to play in 52,000-seat Busch 
Stadium until the new stadium, under construction, is completed on Oct. 25, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams are not asking us to accelerate the construction of the stadium, and 
there will be no acceleration," said Eagleton, referring to a process that 
would have cost St. Louis $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton was also pleased that Shaw did not question the zealousness of St. 
Louis football fans, a topic that came up during Eagleton's last trip to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our first meeting, they more than once mentioned that they had some 
worries about St. Louis as a football town, that Baltimore was a better 
football town," Eagleton said. "There was no reference to that in this meeting, 
no negative comments about the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said the sale of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who officially went on the 
market Thursday, did not come up in the meeting with Shaw but admitted that 
Angelos' expressed interest -- and Kroenke's expected interest -- in the 
Buccaneers could impact negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't change the pace of negotiations -- Dec. 1 is still a target date," 
Eagleton said. "But it does change the environment a bit. Here's an NFL team 
that is now on the market. We're not particular, we'll take any NFL team."

TVERDOVSKY MIGHT PLAY IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oleg Tverdovsky, the Mighty Ducks' top draft choice in 1994, is expected to 
play junior hockey in Canada -- if the NHL lockout remains unresolved -- once 
he receives medical clearance from the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great, especially since he didn't play in training camp," said 
General Manager Jack Ferreira, who approved the move once agent Don Meehan said 
the team would not have to pay the Russian defenseman while he plays with the 
Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, 18, signed a three-year, $4.2-million contract after being drafted 
second overall. But he aggravated a groin injury during training camp and 
didn't play exhibition games. Ferreira said he didn't know when Tverdovsky 
would be ready to travel to Anaheim for an exam by team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa's Alexandre Daigle and the Kings' Jamie Storr and Matt Johnson are 
among the other young NHL players playing junior hockey during the lockout. The 
Canadian Hockey League, which comprises the WHL, Ontario Hockey League and the 
Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, is the major developmental ground for 
players younger than 21. It recently extended its deadlines to allow NHL teams 
to assign locked-out players. ROBYN NORWOOD

<P>
 Todd Ewen, a tough guy who doubles as the Ducks' poet laureate, is at it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing that is, not fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he's working on a guide for hockey novices, a how-to book for 
parents whose children suddenly catch puck fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in California, Dallas and Florida now have kids who say, 'I want to 
play,' " Ewen said. "Parents don't know what they need to get started. I'm 
looking out for them. I know they're not completely naive, but they need the 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a personal book, as if I'm talking to somebody who has a lot of 
questions for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The book still is in the planning stages, but Ewen said it's moving along 
nicely. Brian Hayward is adding assistance on goaltending and Ewen hopes to 
illustrate the front of each chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen's forte is drawing. He is renowned for his caricatures of teammates. His 
first book, an illustrated children's story of characters he dreamed up, is 
back on track after clearing some red tape with the league. All he needs now is 
a publisher for "A Frog Named Hop." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's the hardest part," said Ewen, who led the Ducks with 272 
penalty minutes. "Dealing with the NHL was one phone call. Now I'm back trying 
to locate a publisher." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not writing or drawing, Ewen spends hours at his personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Robert Dirk came by one day and they played Risk for about eight 
hours. "I haven't had much chance to golf lately," Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He skates every other day with a dozen or so teammates, appears at school 
assemblies occasionally and spent Halloween giving away candy at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm busier than if I were playing," he said. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert might be the only NHL player happy to be locked out. His 
father, Paul, suffered a heart attack in September and Guy rushed home to Troy, 
N.Y., to be by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened right in front of the doctors at the hospital," Hebert said by 
phone from his parents' home. "It was the best place to be. Before any damage 
was done, they were able to get him under hospital care. He ended up not having 
any surgery, which he was happy about. He had an angioplasty. He's had to 
re-think how he's living his life, watching his eating and getting some 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 With Paul Hebert on the mend, the family's thoughts have returned to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father keeps asking me when I'm going back to work," Guy Hebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't been home at this time of year since high school. The leaves have 
turned a brilliant gold and red and fallen to the ground. Winter's chill has 
blown in and the first snow surely can't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert rides a mountain bike, plays golf and fields offers to help coach the 
goalies at nearby Hamilton College, where he played from 1985-89. He has 
visited old friends and even contemplated attending his old high school's 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also beginning to get bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to break up the monotony of sitting here at home," he said. 
"I'm looking forward to getting back there (to Anaheim). I'll probably stay 
here until I get the official word (that the labor dispute has been resolved). 
I had plans to go back in two weeks, but I'll probably just hack around, play 
some pickup hockey around here." ELLIOTT TEAFORD

MIGHTY MIGRATION; DUCKS BRANCHING OUT DURING WORK STOPPAGE; COACH RON WILSON

<P>
 Does this qualify as a trick or a treat? Ron Wilson had a rare encounter with 
players in full hockey gear Oct. 31. "I was the one handing out the candy, and 
that rarely happens," said Wilson, who has spent most of his adult life 
immersed in hockey in the fall. "The really surprising thing to me was how many 
kids dressed as hockey players. It was kind of neat to see a quarter of the 
boys dressed as hockey players. And I didn't see anybody dressed as baseball 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 If baseball has gone out of style, hockey might not be far behind if the labor 
dispute kills the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has enjoyed spending more time with his family, going to college night 
at school with daughter Kristen, 17, and to the volleyball games of daughter 
Lauren, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole life has been dominated by hockey from the time I can remember," he 
said. "For once I'm able to do things this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't imagine he doesn't miss being behind the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers the hell out of me. This is what I almost feel I was bred to do," 
said Wilson, whose father and uncle were NHL coaches. "But I'm almost 
apathetic, to be honest, like a lot of fans. I'll be ready for the season if 
the season starts. If it doesn't, there's not a suicide watch at my house, I'll 
tell you that. It's the same philosophy I have in my life. I'm not going to 
worry about things out of my control. I wish I had some control, but I don't, 
so I don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson still goes to the office every day, where he is refining computer 
programs that he and his staff use to keep track of statistics. They'll also 
watch tapes of players on other teams who will be free agents next year or 
might be available in trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is frustrating to sit here and not see movement in the negotiations, 
people being stubborn about the whole process," he said. "It's like there's got 
to be a winner. Give me a break. (NHL senior vice president Brian Burke) said 
it right, it's who's tougher. You read those books about labor shutdowns in 
other sports, like Marvin Miller's baseball book, the rhetoric is always the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains: How many trick-or-treaters will want to be hockey 
players in 1995? ROBYN NORWOODWILSON, RON

CHAPMAN READY TO CAP EVENTFUL FIRST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year ago, Chapman hired Ken Visser to coach the Panthers' first 
football team since 1932. Today, Visser will lead the team into its final game 
of 1994, at 1 p.m. at Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, led by transfers, have appeared unbeatable at times, averaging 
39.1 points per game. And despite losses to La Verne and Occidental and a tie 
with Redlands, Visser has plenty of reasons to be proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any football coach you look back at the losses and the tie and wonder, 
'What if?' " Visser said. "But overall, I think for the very first year, there 
is a very solid team and a very solid staff here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we took a very good first step." 
</P>
<P>
 Visser had to start from scratch when he was hired last December. The school 
had no football equipment and only a handful of students who expressed interest 
in playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently, Chapman tapped a pent-up demand for NCAA football in Orange 
County. Cal State Fullerton disbanded the county's last NCAA program in 1992. 
Visser and his staff, most of whom followed him from Whittier College, 
recruited hard and were surprised at the response. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 112 players showed up for the first day of practice. Three weeks 
later, the Panthers were beating Whittier, 30-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman (5-2-1) has only faltered in its games against the top three teams in 
the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Chapman had to 
rally to tie Redlands, 14-14, lost to Occidental, 30-20, and lost to La Verne, 
36-33. 
</P>
<P>
 A few breaks here and there and Chapman could be undefeated and playing today 
for an NCAA Division III playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that you look back on and say, 'Doggone it, I know it wasn't 
because the kids didn't play hard and the coaches didn't coach hard,' " Visser 
said. "You look back and you would like to have some of those games back, of 
course you would." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (4-4) is led by quarterback Ryan Huisenga and running back 
Terrance Thomas. Huisenga has passed for 1,594 yards (199.3 per game) and 
Thomas has rushed for a Cal Lutheran single-season record of 1,134 (141.8 per 
game).

MIGHTY MIGRATION; DUCKS BRANCHING OUT DURING WORK STOPPAGE; PAUL KARIYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, Paul Kariya was supposed to have shown NHL crowds the dazzling 
playmaking skills many predicted would make him rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with endless time on his hands, "I've picked up juggling," said 
Kariya, 20, who returned to his family's home in North Vancouver, Canada, when 
the lockout began. "I can do the trick where you eat an apple while you're 
juggling, and I can juggle behind my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, who is fond of philosophy and motivation books, was passing through 
the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport during the Ducks' exhibition season when he 
spotted a book on juggling that he'd heard has been used as a motivational tool 
by some Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a metaphor for learning through the art of juggling," he said. "It 
teaches juggling, step by step. It's helped me see how I learn in hockey, too. 
And it's good for hand-eye coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been his own tutor during the lockout, skating at a nearby rink and 
working to develop new skills much as he did during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that bored or mad about the situation," he said. "Everything happens 
for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, he joined a group of NHL players for a charity exhibition series in 
Hamilton, Ontario. "It was tremendous," Kariya said after playing the first 
night. "Everyone was so pumped to play and get back into the hockey 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the lockout drag into January, Kariya said he probably will enroll in 
classes at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. One thing's for 
certain: He doesn't have any financial worries. Even though he's not being paid 
his $575,000 base salary, Kariya received a $1-million signing bonus in 
September and is due another $1.25-million installment in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we were really fortunate. It certainly worked out," he said. His 
three-year, $6.5 million-contract includes almost $5 million in signing 
bonuses, which must be paid despite the work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is to keep his days full. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if I'm still out of work, I can go down to the street corner and 
juggle," he said. ROBYN NORWOOD

MIGHTY MIGRATION; DUCKS BRANCHING OUT DURING WORK STOPPAGE; TIM SWEENEY

<P>
 Tim Sweeney is one player who won't file for unemployment benefits. He's found 
a job -- as a house painter in suburban Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one thing about it, you can't rush it or it won't look good. You 
can't be in a hurry," said Sweeney, who is making about $400 a week working for 
his brother, Patrick. He would have made $285,000 with the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun just to -- you know how men are -- you miss the camaraderie of a 
hockey team. This is working with the guys, talking the whole day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning new things every day too. I'll be putting aluminum siding on a 
house next. I think all this will come in pretty handy when the time comes when 
I have work on my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney and his wife, Christina, returned to Hanover, Mass., when the lockout 
began. He has been skating two or three times a week with players at Weymouth 
High, going to local football games and working five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 One nagging worry is his future with the Ducks, who left him unprotected for 
the waiver draft, which was canceled because of the labor dispute. As the 
Ducks' fourth-leading scorer last season, he thinks there's a good chance he 
could be picked up by another team when and if the waiver draft is held. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he'll keep painting, "for the time being," he said. "I don't have 
anything else to do. That's one of the reasons why I'm doing the painting. You 
can only work out so many hours of the day. I'm trying to keep busy and keep my 
mind off things." 
</P>
<P>
 The approach of winter will change his workday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't paint houses when it gets like that," he said. "We'll probably stop 
painting the outside of houses in the next couple weeks and just paint inside."

PREP WATER POLO PLAYOFFS; LA HABRA DOMINATES SADDLEBACK IN DIVISION II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By GABE LACQUES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Habra's Dan Ploog made sure Saddleback's first playoff appearance in 14 
years didn't last long. He scored six first-half goals, leading La Habra to a 
13-8 victory over Saddleback in a Division II water polo playoff game Friday at 
La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra, seeded fourth, advances to play Tustin in a second-round game 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ploog scored three goals in a 3-minute, 7-second span of the first quarter, 
helping La Habra take a 4-2 lead. He scored his sixth goal on a penalty shot 
with 49 seconds left in the second quarter, and Brian Karol added a goal with 
10 seconds left, giving the Highlanders (20-6) an 8-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the victory, La Habra Coach Jeff Hopkins said his team didn't play 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't one of our better performances," Hopkins said. "We pressed on 
offense too much. But the guys played hard. Even in a game like that, where we 
didn't adapt to the referees, we still got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ugly game, but I'd rather have an ugly game this game than in the 
next round." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra maintained its five-goal lead in the third quarter, and took a 12-5 
lead on a fast-break goal by Ploog with 2:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins then put his second-string players in the game, and Saddleback staged 
a quick three-goal rally to pull within 12-8 with 1:41 left. Hopkins then 
re-inserted his first string, and Karol capped the scoring on a goal with 40 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (16-8) was led by Bret Trezise, who had four goals. GABE LACQUES

LAGUNA BEACH ARTIST'S WISPS SLIP THROUGH ONE'S GRASP

 Angie Bray's wispy drawings, slight sculptures and nearly intangible kinetic 
devices at Sue Spaid Fine Art teeter on the precipice of insubstantiality. 
Meticulously made of eggshells, feathers, smoke, pins, lead and vellum, her 
works aspire to disappear into nothingness, like exhaled breaths on cold winter 
mornings or fond memories that vanish amid the pressures of everyday living. 
</P>
<P>
 This delicate territory is difficult to tread, like steering between the 
Scylla of invisibility and the Charybdis of insignificance. Unfortunately, 
Bray's fragile pieces are too straightforward and unambiguous to trigger the 
quivering, emotional responses they seem to beafter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach artist's intentionally tenuous objects too closely resemble 
simplified versions of Rebecca Horn's double-edged sculptures. Where Horn's 
elaborate pieces of kinetic theater embrace dread and malignancy as well as 
light-handed elegance, Bray's works focus exclusively on the warm, touching 
side of experience. Often overly precious, her naive art doesn't account for 
the ambivalence with which desire, at its most captivating, is always charged. 
</P>

MINK STOLE: TODAY, BLOOD IS RICHER THAN WATERS; THEATER: 'IT'S BEEN REALLY 
WONDERFUL TO PLAY A CHARACTER RATHER THAN A CARICATURE,' THE ACTRESS SAYS OF 
HER ROLE IN THE GROVE'S PRODUCTION OF 'DRACULA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the campy, trashy cult films of John Waters remember Mink Stole for 
her outrageous portrayal of a baby seller in "Pink Flamingos," a murderess run 
amok in "Desperate Living" and an adulterous secretary in "Polyester." 
</P>
<P>
 General audiences have seen the actress in the three latest, and comparatively 
mainstream, Waters movies: "Hairspray," "Cry-Baby" and "Serial Mom," in which 
Stole receives obscene phone calls from the June Cleaver-ish mother-gone-psycho 
played by Kathleen Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two weeks, however, Orange County theatergoers have been watching 
Stole in a decidedly different role. Instead of skewering the middle-class 
conventionalities of suburban Baltimore, she is driving stakes through the 
hearts of London vampires in the Grove Theater Center production of "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did this John Waters mainstay become involved with Gothic drama in 
Garden Grove? 
</P>
<P>
 The Echo Park resident has the same manager as Matthew Walker, who plays a 
bug-eating but endearing lunatic Renfield in "Dracula," which closes Sunday. 
After director Kevin Cochran learned that Stole was available, he asked her to 
audition for the part of Professor Van Helsing, esteemed vampire expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really wonderful to play a character rather than a caricature," 
Stole said as she relaxed upstairs at the theater over coffee after a recent 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like doing the stage," she said. "It's a whole different set of challenges. 
In theater, you're really flying without a net. In film, if you blow something 
you can go back and fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Stole's acting work has been with Waters -- she appeared in all of the 
writer-director's feature films over the past three decades -- but she also has 
stage credits in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. One of her most 
memorable theater experiences was working with comedic playwright-director 
Charles Ludlam in "Love's Tangled Web." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such a force," Stole said of the New York playwright, who died of AIDS 
in 1987. "There wasn't a moment when his brain wasn't going at full speed. He 
exhausted me." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the long drive from her home to Garden Grove (she passes 
the time listening to country music), Stole said she's having fun "not going 
camp" in her latest incarnation as a scholarly slayer of the undead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have enjoyed this," she said. "(The director) allows us a great deal 
of freedom, yet there's a captain at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I never spent a month in Orange County before. Now I know about the 
Carl's Jr., the. . . . ," she said, her voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Stole began her acting career with Waters in a serendipitous manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really start out as anything," she said. "As a teen-ager I met 
someone who wanted to make movies." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Waters was a "really skinny, geeky guy with stringy hair." And 
the early, low-budget movies movies they made together were destined to become 
underground classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waters body of work includes "Roman Candles," "Eat Your Makeup," "Mondo 
Trasho," "Multiple Maniacs" and then the intentionally tasteless "Pink 
Flamingos," in which Stole challenged Divine (the late 300-pound transvestite) 
to become "the filthiest person alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Stole also was in "Polyester," the first (and, one hopes, last) film that came 
with a scratch-and-sniff Odorama card. As Stole cavorted with Divine's 
sleaze-ball pornographer of a husband, audiences had their nasal passages 
assaulted with the smells of gasoline, old tennis shoes and flatulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she had any insider stories about Waters suitable for a family 
newspaper, Stole thought back to the outrageous parties, the general weirdness, 
then laughed and said, "Ah . . . no." 
</P>
<P>
 She did say that Waters "loves being a celebrity, but he has many friends who 
are not famous." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's actually such a nice man," she said. "He's one of my best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite what some filmgoers might think, Waters does make his actors stick 
to the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a few occasions when I've been called on to ad lib," Stole 
said, "but I was told when to ad lib." 
</P>
<P>
 As for herself, Stole said she didn't set out to be a cult figure, "it just 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm John Waters' Mink Stole," she said. "I didn't want to be be somebody 
else's apostrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially Stole was disturbed by the adoration she got from cult-film 
devotees, but gradually she came to appreciate their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a stack of stuff at home that I have to answer," she said, and some of 
her admirers have given her flowers following "Dracula" performances. "People 
are really wonderful to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Female Trouble" is her favorite Waters film, she said, "but I really like 
Dottie" (in "Serial Mom"), which is her most restrained and naturalistic film 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 For her performances in all Waters' other films, she said, "I've always gone, 
'How big can I go?' But in 'Serial Mom,' John kept saying, 'Take it down, take 
it down.' I said, 'John, if I take it down anymore, I'll be dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the film world, Stole said, she is politically active "in spurts," 
such as in 1992 when she helped the Bohemian Women's Political Alliance conduct 
fund-raisers and voter-registration drives. But mostly her life is "very 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I play with my cats (Felix and Maggie), my two beloved babies. They are 
strays that found me," she said. "I read all the time, mostly mystery novels, 
biographies. I go thrift shopping; I do a lot of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stole said she doesn't have any immediate film plans, but "I'd love to have an 
ABC sitcom," she said. "Then I'd never have to worry about money for the rest 
of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 And just what kind of character would Mink Stole play on network TV? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be somebody kind of like myself," she said with a smile. "I think it'd be 
fun to play a cult actor." 
</P>
<P>

DANCE REVIEW; CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IN '21ST CENTURY' PERFORMANCES; 
PRESENTATION MARKEDLY UNEVEN IN 'BLACK CHOREOGRAPHERS' FEST AT CAL STATE L.A.'S 
LUCKMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the impressively wide, uncomfortably low stage of the Luckman Fine Arts 
Complex at Cal State L.A., the current, fifth edition of "Black Choreographers 
Moving Toward the 21st Century" turns its back on showcasing innovation to 
survey strategies of artistic survival in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening, five-part program began Thursday with Phyllis Gomer's restlessly 
eclectic quintet "Urban Sonnet," performed by her locally based Bridge Dance 
Theatre to an atmospheric score by Leigh Anne Gillespie. Relentlessly ordinary, 
it might be considered the bottom line of contemporary African American 
achievement. Yes, it gets worse than this, but never more bland. 
</P>
<P>
 The program ended with an act of conservation: Philadanco's gorgeously danced 
reconstruction of Gene Hill Sagan's imposing 1984 group ritual "Elegy," a work 
very much in the African American mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan's vocabulary integrated balleticisms and Africanisms with great 
sophistication, and his talent for group tableaux often yielded thrilling 
large-scale imagery. Unfortunately, "Elegy" also proved spectacularly unmusical 
-- its rhythms and attack wildly out of sync with the lyricism of Ralph Vaughan 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Bridge and Philadanco are marking time in a disastrous 
period for the arts in America -- the former with hand-me-down abstraction, the 
Philadelphia-based ensemble by relying on revivals. In contrast, Winifred R. 
Harris made a sense of crisis central to her latest work, "What's Behind Door 
1." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' typically surging formal group dances for her Between Lines company 
kept shattering here into depictions of societal violence and despair: an 
execution, a suicide, desperate addicts, leering whores -- and 
fascists-on-the-march. 
</P>
<P>
 Music and lyrics by Me'Shell NdegeOcello (partly performed live) reinforced 
the emphasis on documenting "the evils of this world," but hurt the work in 
some ways -- too many short sections to allow anything other than hit-and-run 
effects, for instance. However, "Door 1" confirmed Harris' stature as Southern 
California's most thoughtful and creative African American choreographer, 
leaving other artists on the program looking awfully conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Using classic blues recordings, Reggie Wilson's quartet, "Peace," initially 
provided gritty gestural character sketches of Southern life and a striking 
three-way division of stage space. But as the piece grew more conventionally 
choreographic, it also became increasingly arbitrary in its expressive choices 
and curiously devitalized, despite committed dancing by Wilson's New York-based 
Fist and Heel Performance Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining liquid undulations with the trashiest throw-the-ballerina maneuvers 
since "Spring Waters," Dwight Rhoden's trio, "Glass Chains," looked like a 
cartoon remake of one of Donald Byrd's sardonic investigations of sexual 
consumerism. Shirley Horn's music gave it a modicum of class, and Rhoden's 
Dayton-based Complexions company sold it with faultless bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" festival continues 
tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2 in the Luckman Fine Arts Complex on the 
campus of Cal State L.A. (213) 466-1767. Two different programs are scheduled 
with five companies apiece. (The program reviewed here repeats tonight only.) 
Tickets: $18-$22.

MUSIC REVIEW; ZARZUELA ZEALOTRY WITH DOMINGO AND FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Placido Domingo isn't like the other tenorissimo. You know, the portly one who 
waves a small white tablecloth while he sings and closes his blissful eyes 
while he basks in push-button ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 When Domingo comes to Southern California, he doesn't just blast sweet sounds 
at the masses through microphones in sports stadiums and super-circus 
amphitheaters. He also appears, bless him, in bona fide, legitimate, 
human-scale halls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera, which Domingo now serves as artistic adviser and (less 
impressively) as principal guest-conductor, will present him in five 
performances of "Otello" this May. Thursday night, between performances of 
"Herodiade" in San Francisco, he moved portions of our opera company to 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium for a festive concert of Spanish music, most of it 
related to the zarzuela genre he so obviously adores. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a night for musical or intellectual profundity. It wasn't much of 
a night for vocal finesse or expressive introspection. But it was a terrific 
night for gutsy extroversion enhanced, as needed, by wit, charm, high spirits 
and, perhaps most important, stylistic conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Domingo sang with tireless ringing fervor and saucy bravado, too, he 
didn't triumph alone. He brought along a couple of distinguished and 
enlightened friends -- Chilean soprano Veronica Villaroel and Spanish conductor 
Miguel Roa, both of whom had helped him turn Manuel Penella's "El Gato Montes" 
into a surprise hit at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaroel may have been a rather pallid Violetta and a distinctly unidiomatic 
Marguerite at the Music Center, but here she proved, again, that she can sing 
Spanish music with irresistible verve and insinuating humor, not to mention 
dignified pathos. Roa, director of the Teatro Lirico Nacional de la Zarzuela in 
Madrid, distinguished himself as a maestro equally authoritative and 
mischievous in the repertory at hand. It's a nice combination of virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 The zarzuela -- technically a Spanish drama that fuses singing, dancing and 
spoken dialogue -- finds its roots in the court of Philip IV, circa 1640. The 
version sampled on this occasion, however, is a 20th-Century evolution, 
something akin to a heavyweight operetta with nationalist accents and/or 
folkloric overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest entry on the Pasadena agenda was the agitated prelude to "Pan y 
Toros," written by Francisco Asenjo Barbieri in 1864. That was the exception to 
the temporal rule. Most of the arias and duets on display dated back to the 
1920s and 1930s, a period that apparently valued verismo theatrics, rhythmic 
propulsion, orchestral simplicity and, above all, pretty tunes. The newest item 
on the program, an ardent aria from Federico Moreno Torroba's "Maravilla," was 
written in 1941 but probably sounded comfortably old-fashioned even then. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo and Villaroel, alone and together, sang their generous hearts out in 
declarations of love (requited and not) and apostrophes to nature, in religious 
ecstasies and colorful rituals, in tones of intimate flirtation and heroic 
desperation, even in a comic flight or two. The music of Penella, Federico 
Moreno Torroba, Jeronimo Gimenez, Jacinto Guerrero, Federico Chueca, Pablo 
Luna, Reveriano Soutullo and Juan Vert employed a more limited, more primitive 
emotive scale than the texts may have implied. Still, it was always engaging, 
always direct, always effective on its own neatly defined terms. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his admirers (who had paid up to $100 per ticket, not including 
post-concert din-din), Domingo's finest moment seemed to come in the 
unrelenting passion of "Adios, dijiste, se va mi vida" from Moreno Torroba's 
"Maravilla." This listener was even more impressed by the all-too-rare 
mezza-voce tones with which he caressed "Bella enamorada" from Soutullo's "El 
Ultimo Romantico." 
</P>
<P>
 Villaroel began her portion of the evening with an encore of sorts, a 
haunting, lustrous performance of Solea's aria from "El Gato Montes." She ended 
with a legitimate encore in which she actually managed to project the itchy 
allure of Gimenez's "Tarantula" without being too cute. 
</P>
<P>
 Roa and the so-called Music Center Opera Orchestra provided rather loud yet 
appreciative support throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * While the Los Angeles Philharmonic was burning Debussy and Lutoslawski under 
Esa-Pekka Salonen a few miles away at the Pavilion, Sidney Weiss, the 
inexplicably-former Philharmonic concertmaster, was fiddling zarzuelas in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 * The ridiculously inadequate program booklet for Domingo and friends offered 
no annotations, no Spanish texts, no synopses, no first names for composers, no 
dates of composition, and no indication of who was singing what. 
</P>
<P>
 * Augustin Lara's "Granada" (1932) served as the fourth and final encore. It 
came after many vociferous suggestions from the audience, and much silly 
pantomime on the stage in which Domingo pretended to be improvising the 
predetermined choices. Shades of the "Three Tenors" show. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concert was dedicated to Pepita Embil, Domingo's mother and a former 
zarzuela star in Mexico, who died earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Domingo and Villaroel enjoyed a huge success last June in Carlos Gomes' "Il 
Guarany" as staged by Werner Herzog in Bonn. Hint. Hint.

LOOKING INTO THE DARKEST CORNERS; POP BEAT: IN HER NEW 'GEEK THE GIRL,' LISA 
GERMANO BARES HER EMOTIONS, DELVING INTO THE REALM OF PARANOIA AND DEPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wish I was cooler, like Courtney Love or something, where I could 
scream and get all this emotion out," says Lisa Germano. "But I just have to 
remind myself, 'This is just what you do, even though it's weird and 
uncomfortable sometimes.' "  
</P>
<P>
 What Germano does is unleash suppressed emotions in quiet torrents that are 
dark, disconcerting and painfully honest. On her new album, "Geek the Girl," 
the 35-year-old singer deadpans, whispers and lilts lyrics about her paranoia 
and depression while sprinkling the heaviest of subjects -- including rape and 
infidelity -- with sarcasm. Germano (who appears Nov. 23 at LunaPark) adds 
sidewinding violin, spare guitar and far-away effects for a hazy, surreal 
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Germano finds her music therapeutic, she also recognizes that it's 
fairly self-obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like what I do is totally selfish," says the petite dark-haired 
Indiana native, sipping red wine in the lounge of a Hollywood hotel. "Then 
someone says they relate to my music, and then I think maybe what I do is good. 
Pain is a universal feeling, sadness too, and when you live through it and you 
can pinpoint it, it's gonna touch somebody as if they felt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though her music hasn't touched the souls of Top 40 listeners, it has made a 
strong impact in the smaller arena of eclectic rock. It's a world that's miles 
from her previous role as violinist in populist rocker John Mellencamp's band. 
Germano's introverted and low-key music doesn't exactly convey the same rural 
scenes of chili dogs and wheat fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my association with him, I thought people would expect my first 
album to be a more fun record," says Germano, who released her debut recording, 
in 1991. "Even now, it's hard to shed that 'you're John's fiddle player' thing. 
When people talk about my music or new record, they feel they have to have that 
strength behind it. It's like, 'She's kind of weird, but she did play the 
fiddle with Mellencamp, so she must be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Those who need the Mellencamp association to accept Germano's music are likely 
to be alienated by "Geek the Girl." Germano, who recorded the entire record 
alone at home, bares herself emotionally much more than on her previous two 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's scary, but that's just what I do," she says. "I'm trying to 
follow a path where you keep questioning yourself: What is special about me? . 
. . There is something special in everybody, but we forget, and that depresses 
me. If I don't bring that out in my music, then I'm wimping out." 
</P>
<P>
 Germano grew up in the northern Indiana town of Mishawaka, one of six children 
in an Italian Catholic family. Her parents were classical musicians who played 
Hungarian music at home and listened to opera. "I used to hate opera," says 
Germano, who was a James Taylor and Dan Fogelberg fan, "but now I love it. It's 
beautiful, funny and terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Germano's solo career began when she left the Mellencamp fold and expressed 
her own feelings in "On the Way Down From Moon Palace," her self-released 
debut. She called her own label Major Bill, for all the costs incurred making 
the record. She went on to release "Happiness" on Capitol in 1993 before going 
with the independent 4AD label this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As "Geek the Girl" attests, Germano's introspection can be incredibly harsh 
and self-punishing, causing wonder at just how she makes it from album to album 
without succumbing to the belief that it's all a hopeless endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm hard on myself," admits Germano. "But it doesn't feel that way; it 
just feels honest. But maybe that's what's special about me -- I'm 
self-deprecating, but doing something positive with it and relating to people 
who feel the same."  
</P>
<P>

 How do you make art about a death sentence meted out to people as the result 
of a moment of pleasure? The seven California artists showing in "Artists' 
Reflections on AIDS" at the Orange Coast College Art Gallery (through Thursday) 
provide a range of answers, some more satisfactory than others. 
</P>

 Trying to come to terms with whatever inchoate combination of fear, grief and 
anger about AIDS may be raging though our minds, we look to artists to provide 
fresh metaphors for these feelings. During the past few years, the most 
impressive work dealing with the disease has been indirect and highly 
metaphorical, reminding viewers in visually novel ways of the fragility of the 
body as a vessel of pleasure and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 In this show, David Joshua Goldstein and Dunnieghe Slawson come the closest to 
that ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's "Icarian" pieces are flattened leather bench covers from gym 
equipment, vertically displayed in black boxes. Each cover bears the abrasions 
and sweat stains made by the men who exercised on the benches, some of whom (as 
Goldstein writes in a brief statement) are now dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented in this fashion, the leather pieces can be seen as deliberately 
unheroic versions of the Shroud of Turin (the piece of cloth supposedly 
containing Jesus' image). But the poignancy of this work also comes from being 
reminded that these scraps of leather literally supported the dreams of men 
trying to build up muscular, sexually desirable bodies that were slowly being 
destroyed from within. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slawson's "Trojan Horse" is a pale, ribbed cornucopia that extrudes from the 
wall, spilling onto the floor a pathetic bundle of shriveled or bulging male 
sex organs, one of which half-disgorges a potato-sized lump. 
</P>
<P>
 The title alludes both to a popular brand of condoms and the legendary hollow 
decoy in which the ancient Greeks hid before destroying the enemy city of Troy. 
In Slawson's scenario, AIDS is the subverting agent that lies in wait for its 
victim; the deformed genitals are visceral symbols of the fear and loathing 
engendered by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolism can be a difficult thing to pull off, however, particularly with 
regard to such an emotionally charged and frequently mined subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Bell's "Drain" -- a set of fragile ceramic receptacles containing 
rubber hoses that plug into the wall -- errs on the side of literalness and 
dependence on a medium that has become a cliche in AIDS-related art. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Kevin Miller uses a cliched technique in his untitled works on 
paper. His veils of white or black paint on phone book pages or obituary 
notices do convey a sense of loss. But the pieces are little more than 
one-liners -- and curiously vague ones, at that. Rather than evoking a sense of 
universality by including obituaries of individuals who died of causes 
seemingly unrelated to AIDS, Miller blurs his simple message. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Wallin's "Lame Dick," a giant wire mesh penis propped up with a steel 
brace, is also a one-liner, and one that unfortunately comes across as cute and 
glib rather than witty or darkly humorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Doree Dunlap's painting "The Space Between" seems weighted down by 
would-be symbolic images (cactus plants, a painting of a large spiral) that 
detract from the strong central image: two people lying separately on a bed 
completely shrouded by a sheet, like bodies on a mortician's slab. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it's hard to deny the sweetly naive appeal of David Torosian's little 
jester, feebly poking his head out of a painstakingly decorated box of marbles 
("Coming to Terms"), but it's also rather awkward to realize how painfully 
earnest was the intent behind such a potentially campy piece. 
</P>

VIENNA SYMPHONY CARVES AN ORCHESTRAL NICHE; MUSIC: ALTHOUGH NOT AS FAMOUS AS 
THE PHILHARMONIC, THE ORGANIZATION HAS BUILT A REPUTATION FOR PERFORMING 
EXCLUSIVELY CONCERT PROGRAMS.

 It's as if Avis claimed Hertz didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Promotional materials stating that "the Vienna Symphony is the city's only 
full-time orchestra" were recently sent out by both the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts and the Orange County Philharmonic Society. But there is, 
indeed, another full-time orchestra in Vienna. In fact, the Vienna Philharmonic 
is the far more celebrated of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only these days, (but for) more than 100 years," agreed Vienna Symphony 
music director Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, who leads that orchestra in concerts 
tonight in Cerritos and Monday in Costa Mesa. (The tour began Oct. 28 in 
Massachusetts, included Carnegie Hall on Halloween, and ends Tuesday in Santa 
Barbara.)  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the presenters, who probably based their news releases on information 
provided by Columbia Artists Management Inc., meant that it's the city's only 
orchestra exclusively playing orchestral music. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Vienna Philharmonic) is a great orchestra, but they play every day in 
the opera," explained Fruhbeck, reached by phone earlier this week in Miami, 
where the Vienna Symphony had performed with Van Cliburn as soloist. "They play 
eight or 10 (orchestral) programs; we play 80 or 90 or 100. We are the concert 
orchestra of Vienna; 80% of the concert programs are the Vienna Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
 The program in Cerritos includes the Passacaglia from Hans Erich Apostel's 
unfinished Concerto for Orchestra, Op. 50; the Adagio from Gustav Mahler's 
Symphony No. 10, and Modest Mussorgsky's "Pictures at the Exhibition" (in the 
familiar orchestration by Ravel). 
</P>
<P>
 On the agenda at the Orange County Performing Arts Center are Anton Webern's 
Passacaglia, Op. 1, Richard Strauss' Horn Concerto No. 2 with principal hornist 
Hector McDonald as soloist, and Brahms' Symphony No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper it appears that Fruhbeck is opening the concerts with a pair of 
passacaglias, but that's not the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, there are three passacaglias, the last movement of the Brahms 
Fourth (Symphony) the greatest of the three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apostel Passacaglia is only four minutes long, he said, "but a very 
concise expression of a very dark piece, almost amounting to funeral music. And 
there is not a doubt that the Webern is a masterpiece. But even between great 
music there are certain degrees. The form, the inspiration, the strict 
Classical -- even Baroque -- handling by Brahms, is such greatness. You'd have 
to go to Bach to find something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fruhbeck, 61, was born in Spain to German parents. He served as conductor of 
the Bilbao Orchestra and the Madrid National Orchestra earlier in his career, 
but the name Fruhbeck apparently wouldn't do for his highly nationalistic 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did my first concerts with the national orchestra," he recalled, "my 
boss, the general director from the ministry, said to me: 'I cannot explain to 
everybody you are Spanish with this name. You need to come up with something 
that everybody can identify.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fruhbeck was born in Burgos; he came up with de Burgos and remained music 
director for 18 years. He continues to make his home in Madrid but no longer 
directs a Spanish orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Fruhbeck, now in his fourth season with the Vienna Symphony, is 
general music director of the orchestra of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, 
principal guest conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, 
D.C., and Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra, and regular guest conductor with 
Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to compare Vienna's two principal orchestras, Fruhbeck exhibited 
none of the competitiveness one might associate with those car rental 
companies, Avis and Hertz. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vienna Philharmonic has a very personal sound . . . a sound they can be 
proud of, and rightly so. Our sound is also in that category," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to keep the Viennese sound of the strings -- but also the 
Viennese oboe and Viennese horns! The Viennese string sound is very dolce 
(sweet), a singing sound, with a lot of charm. But how can you portray a sound 
(in words)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fruhbeck spends more time in Berlin than in Vienna -- four months each year 
with the Deutsche Oper -- which may explain why the one aspect of his musical 
life he could live without has to do with opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult (to do away with), but I would try to minimize 
administrative work in the opera," Fruhbeck said. "You go in at 9 a.m. in the 
morning and you never know when you go out. The worst is that you may go out 
without conducting any music. But it has to be done. It's tragic. Well, almost 
tragic." 
</P>

 Rocking on the Internet: The Rolling Stones will become the first big-name 
group to broadcast a concert live over the Internet when multimedia company 
Thinking Pictures carries the first five songs from the band's Friday show at 
Dallas' Cotton Bowl to computers around the world. (Users need to have a 
high-end work station that runs a special program that is capable of displaying 
live video from the Internet.) While Mick Jagger and company will definitely be 
the biggest band to perform in cyberspace, they won't be the first -- Seattle's 
Sky Cries Mary did an Internet concert earlier this week. Although these shows 
are breaking new ground, the current rudimentary nature of the information 
superhighway means that the image quality will be far inferior to that of 
normal television, which broadcasts three times as many frames per second. The 
show is set to begin locally at 6:30 p.m. and the log-in code is

 Shakur's Accuser Testifies: During four hours of tearful testimony in a New 
York courtroom Thursday, the 20-year-old Brooklyn woman who has accused rap 
artist Tupac Shakur of sexual assault admitted that she had consensual sex with 
the rapper shortly after meeting him at a nightclub a year ago. But when she 
returned to his Manhattan hotel room four days later, she said, Shakur grabbed 
her by the back of the head and forced her to perform oral sex, while three of 
his friends tore her clothes off, groped her and forced her to perform sex with 
them for 35 minutes as she sobbed for mercy. Shakur's attorneys said the woman 
consented to the encounter, but then became a "vengeful suitor" when Shakur 
refused to follow their sexual escapades with romance. The trial is expected to 
conclude next week.

APPRECIATION; CARMEN MCRAE: WHAT STORIES SHE DID TELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmen McRae's nightclub gigs often climaxed with a magical moment in which 
she sent her back-up band off-stage and sat down to accompany herself at the 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 There was something exquisite that happened when McRae, who died Thursday at 
the age of 72, accompanied herself, a creative clarity that perfectly 
illuminated her enormous strengths as a musical storyteller. If, of the three 
jazz singers most prominent since World War II, Sarah Vaughan had the most 
sumptuous voice, and Ella Fitzgerald the most rhythmically engaged sense of 
time, McRae was surely the best at marrying the imagery of words and music 
within a jazz context. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting late -- she did not make a recording under her own name until she was 
32 (in 1954) -- McRae quickly established herself as a singer who could 
legitimately claim comparison with Vaughan and Fitzgerald. In the same year, 
Down Beat magazine named her "best new female singer." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to record a superb series of sessions for Decca in the '50s (some 
of which have been reissued on GRP), and continued to refine her style for the 
next three decades, unfazed by the changing currents of the popular music 
scene. In 1988, she created a remarkable collection of Thelonious Monk readings 
("Carmen Sings Monk," RCA Novus), and in 1990 a highly personal tribute to 
Vaughan ("Sarah -- Dedicated to You," RCA Novus). 
</P>
<P>
 McRae clearly was comfortable in a wide array of settings, from lush 
orchestral backings to pure jazz rhythm sections. Like Vaughan, she was fully 
capable of altering melody lines, and, like Fitzgerald, she could scat sing 
with the soaring skill of an instrumentalist. But her greatest strength was 
that she never did so at the cost of the total song or the sacrifice of the 
underlying story. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae's voice thickened a bit in recent years, but the lucidity of her 
interpretations never wavered. She was one of the finest artists in jazz 
history's small ensemble of world-class singers.

MUSIC REVIEW; DEBUSSY TRIO THRILLS WITH ENTHUSIASM

 It has taken some doing, but the Debussy Trio has managed to make the ensemble 
of flute, harp and viola -- a wedding reception combination if there ever was 
one -- seem avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program worthy of such progressive groups as the Kronos and Arditti 
quartets, and performed as compellingly, the trio -- Marcia Dickstein, harp; 
Angela Wiegand, flute, and Keith Greene, viola -- appeared Thursday in Founders 
Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 New music should always be like this -- played not as a duty, but with the 
enthusiasm, precision, fluency and sense of adventure these performers brought 
to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Four contemporary pieces, including the world premiere of a work commissioned 
by the trio, were anchored on this occasion by the Sonata for Flute, Viola and 
Harp by the group's namesake, in an interpretation remarkable for its vibrant 
textures and silken execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina's "Garten von Freuden und Traurigkeiten" 
(in its 1993 revision) proved the perfect companion piece, hovering mournfully 
in the still air: a spare flute solo insistently echoed by a soft, downward 
slide on a harp string; the viola, in high harmonics, considering and 
reconsidering a distant, bugle-like motif. Occasionally rising to shimmering 
activity, the music quickly falls back into trance-like rumination. A German 
poem is read at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The concert concluded with the premiere of Lyle Mays' "Twleve Days in the 
Shadow of a Miracle," which he wrote for this trio and incorporating taped 
accompaniment. Alternately spacey and spacious, urgent and driving, this 
eclectic, accessible score reflects Mays' background in jazz and fusion and 
effectively integrates live and taped action. An enjoyable ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Krouse's "Dos Canciones Insolitas" (two sultry Spanish songs) with soprano 
Susan Alexander and Jan Bach's fluid, evocative and engaging "Eisteddfod, 
Variations and Penillion on a Welsh Harp Tune" rounded out this fascinating 
concert.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SHOSTAKOVICH HIGHLIGHTS BORODIN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might have been a winter's night in the Great Hall of the Moscow 
Conservatory, the air filled with the tartly sweet strains of the Borodin 
Quartet playing Shostakovich and the sounds of hacking and sneezing -- a few 
drops of rain having the same effect on Southern Californians' bronchi and 
sinuses as months of sub-freezing temperatures have on Muscovites' systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting Thursday was Ambassador Auditorium, and the Borodin Quartet -- 
violinists Mikhail Kopelman and Andrei Abramenkov, violist Dmitri Shebalin, 
cellist Valentin Berlinsky -- was displaying the jewel-like whimsies that 
constitute the 32-year-old Shostakovich's First String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The exquisite lightness of tone, the wry wit, the infinite dynamic variety 
that these musicians have for decades been bringing to the composer's works are 
among the abiding marvels of the chamber-music experience. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pertinent didactic point made as well: that both Beethoven, whose 
Quartet in F, Opus 18, No. 1, opened the program, and Shostakovich were wise to 
wait until their maturities to try their hands at quartet writing. Thus, both 
sprang into the medium as full-blown masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Beethoven profited as completely as did Shostakovich 
from the Borodin's efforts on this occasion. The very sweetness and elegance of 
the performance, exemplified by the violinists' gorgeously long bow-strokes, 
masked the score's tenseness and power. Furthermore, it was impossible to avoid 
noticing Berlinsky's rather frail tone at this stage of his long and 
distinguished career. 
</P>
<P>
 And what can one say about any performance of Schubert's "Death and the 
Maiden," other than "What, again?" It's the quartet that refuses to die, or 
even rest for a few weeks, and while there was much to admire in the Borodin's 
lush, sempre legato reading, it seemed rather a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ensembles play Beethoven and Schubert well, but all of them learn 
Shostakovich at the Borodin Quartet's knee. HERBERT GLASS

MUSIC REVIEWS; L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA ON REBOUND

 A balloon archway and fireworks music greeted those who attended the opening 
concert of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's 26th season at the Wadsworth on 
Thursday. Celebration was in the air, not to mention a sense of relief, of 
having reeled in from the brink of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, this was no ordinary season-opener. After battling financial troubles 
that nearly spelled the end of the orchestra, resourceful business thinking 
enabled the ensemble's continuance. And it's a good thing: The LACO is a fine 
ensemble instrument, and a boon to the local music community. The playing this 
night was both fervent and exacting -- the stuff of survivor's zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Iona Brown, the orchestra's former artistic director and presently the 
"principal guest conductor," led her charges with a firm but free hand, 
bringing a clarity to the baroque business of Handel's Music for the Royal 
Fireworks and Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3. On Bach's venerable Air, Brown 
refused to let the tempo or the sentiments dip into the pool of languidness 
that it often does in modern readings. No revisionist deep-diving here. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Brown brought a bracing, illuminating focus to Mozart's Symphony 
No. 40 in G minor. Still, the orchestra allowed for the mercurial emotions 
contained in Mozart's late work, with its germs of romanticism. The finale was 
played as a blinding fury harboring a secret tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the baroque and Mozart sounds came a gentle breeze of 20th-Century 
thought from unlikely, late-blooming superstar Henryk Gorecki. Like the hugely 
popular Third Symphony, the Polish composer's brief, engaging "Three Pieces in 
the Olden Style" dances along a line between backward glancing, an affinity for 
folk sonorities and modern sensibilities. The powerful final movement boasts of 
thickly voiced, throbbing string textures yielded to sudden airy mournfulness.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SALONEN'S COOL DEBUSSY, WARM LUTOSLAWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen managed to reverse some musical history when he led the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic in a program of Debussy, Witold Lutoslawski and Joseph 
Canteloube on Thursday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Whereas listeners 
usually hear Debussy's influences in the music of Stravinsky, which came later, 
Salonen evoked Stravinsky's acerbic, fragmented structures in the French 
composer's earlier "Images" and "La Mer." Disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, soprano Dawn Upshaw was on hand to lend vocal sweetness and 
warmth to Lutoslawski's witty "Chantefleurs et Chantefables" and six selections 
from Canteloube's evergreen "Chants d'Auvergne." 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen had the Philharmonic playing like an alert machine, glittering in 
precision, transparency and incisiveness, responsive to every flick of his 
wrist. In his own way, however, he was as wayward in interpretation as 
conductors of an earlier generation now maligned for their indulgences. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas they would, say, rev up tempos, then slam on the brakes for 
outsize expressive contrasts, Salonen avoided the built-in expressive effects 
as much as possible, refusing to allow any wave to surge, crest and break, and 
sacrificing momentum and sweep to a tight governance of passing event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Salonen mined the taut inner tension in Debussy's music when it 
was there. But it was not always there, and at those times the music pulled 
apart like wet tissue. Forget also about sensuous colors and half-heard melodic 
lines. The conductor favored, rather, pungent, hard-edged accents and 
juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach better suited Lutoslawski's 1990 "Chantefleurs," a series of 
nine bracing, deftly drawn portraits of fabulous flora and fauna, based on 
poems Robert Desnos wrote for children. The characters include a self-satisfied 
tortoise, a hungry alligator and an army of thirsty butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Upshaw responded to the composer's various impersonations with bright, 
delicate, lush and sometimes sardonic vocalism, spinning out seamless, 
shimmering lines without abandoning textual clarity or meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Lutoslawski's lean modernism, Canteloube's settings of the Auvergnat 
folk songs tended to sound somewhat overripe. But Salonen countered by 
generally keeping the tempos moving briskly. And Upshaw offered irresistible 
vocal characterizations as an excitable youth stealing time to flirt ("Tchut, 
tchut"), sad lovers separated by a river ("Pastourelle"), a mother soothing her 
baby to sleep ("Brezairola") and a peacock-proud owner of a cuckoo ("Lou 
Coucut"). 
</P>
<P>
 * This Los Angeles Philharmonic program will be repeated Sunday at 2:30 p.m. 
in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave. $6-$50. (213) 
365-3500.

ART REVIEW; CHRISTIAN, MILLENNIAL HOPES IN 'LIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People, it appears, respond to the waning of centuries the way they react to 
the twilight of individual existence. They grow reflective and uneasy, 
wondering if they have lived in the best way. Those who feel unfulfilled may 
begin to wish for some promise that assures them it's really not over when it's 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of this mind-set are everywhere as this secular century winds down. 
There is a longing for something to believe in. An exhibition on view at Loyola 
Marymount University's Laband Art Gallery speaks poignantly to this mood. It's 
titled "Burning Lights: Spirituality, Tradition and Craft in Recent Art From 
the City of the Angels." It's one of about a dozen shows citywide being 
presented under the umbrella theme "Toward a Greater Realm: A Southern 
California Exposition of Spirituality, Myth and the Inner Journey in 
Contemporary Art." 
</P>
<P>
 An unpretentious but affecting touring exhibition organized by gallery 
director Gordon L. Fuglie, it's installed with exquisite care and includes just 
four artists, John Frame, Michael Schrauzer, Laura Lasworth and Jan Valentin 
Saether. They share a dedication to lovingly crafted art from the past, 
particularly the woodcarvings and altarpieces of the Northern European late 
Middle Ages and early Italian Renaissance painting. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this standard, the exhibition could have been more populated. 
Such L.A. artists as Jon Swihart and Randall Lavender plow this field. Such 
talents would have emphasized Angeltown as a place of relatively anonymous 
artists who would rather do their thing than be rich and famous. They represent 
a rather broad swath of artists for whom art, in itself, has become a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets this quartet apart is its specific exploration of religious themes. 
Like the English Pre-Raphaelites and the German Nazarenes of old they 
intertwine devotion to high traditional craft with spiritual enlightenment. In 
the broadest sense, modernist art already encompasses most of what is going on 
here. Pioneers like Kandinsky and Mondrian were affected by metaphysical 
systems like theosophy. Contemporary West Coast artists feel strong affinities 
to Zen. This quartet sets itself apart by contemplating Christian themes. It's 
curious how surprising that feels. 
</P>
<P>
 It needs to be clear that this is not mere revivalism. Frame, the best known 
of the group, makes Medieval-style miniature wood carvings of Everyman types 
that speak to the existential dilemma. Here they evoke biblical subjects. 
"Living in Lightning" at once calls up the descent from the cross, the 
expulsion of the angels, the last judgment and the fall of man. This nearly 
cinematic simultaneity blends and revitalizes traditional themes into a modern 
contemplation on chaos theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Locusts Come" shows a harlequin figure under a gallows. An anatomically 
correct human heart is suspended from it. This reminder of the crucifixion 
extends to a rumination on capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrauzer's hinged altarpieces are so lovingly crafted they tend to be more 
important than what is pictured upon them. "Altarpiece" bears figures of a 
young man and woman whose gestures are at once reverent and puzzled. A desert 
landscape stretches across the top panel and open doors. Its sky is so limpid 
it creates the impression of transparency, like the firmament itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist has somehow managed to borrow a device from Light and Space art 
that lends a physical dimension to its spiritual aspirations. This works with 
particular effect in an altarpiece called "The Tower of Babel." This altar-form 
piece includes a tiny painting of a lightning bolt above a small lead tablet 
engraved with a mandala-like geometric design. Even when art's intentions are 
spiritual, it still functions best through the senses. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetness of primitive Renaissance realism is widely appreciated. Lasworth 
brings forth its careful intelligence. Four intricate symmetrical drawings of 
stylized floral motifs seem to speak of an ornate vision embedded in austere 
faith. Her paintings function as enigmatic contemplations. "St. Thomas and Mr. 
Eco" is a pastel rumination on the chairs of two intricate thinkers, one 
Medieval, the other modern. 
</P>
<P>
 Saether's skillful paintings intend to evoke the great dualities of good and 
evil, the light and the dark. Their style, however, is a combination of 
19th-Century academic romanticism and modern illusionism that lends them a 
distracting self-consciousness. The work feels bottled-up and uncomfortable 
with itself, as if its means are out of tune with its intentions.

POP ALBUM CHART; NIRVANA, ONE MORE TIME

 The Kurt Cobain mystique is in full bloom. Mourning fans, eager for a final 
musical memento of the late Nirvana leader, will make the group's "MTV 
Unplugged in New York," which entered the pop album chart at No. 1, one of the 
biggest year-end hits.Two albums gearing up to dominate the Christmas-music 
market just entered the chart--Mariah Carey's "Christmas" (No. 30) and Kenny 
G's "Miracles: The Holiday Album" (No. 38). Look for both to be in the Top 10 
by next month. Fans haven't taken to the rapping Digable Planets' new "Blowout 
Comb," which is plummeting down the chart--No. 71 and sinking. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Black Crowes are back with a new, classic-rock-styled album, "Amorica," 
which jumped on the chart at No. 11. The hoopla about the Stones' tour helps 
the Crowes. More fans are thinking about '60s and '70s rock these days.

TV REVIEWS; 'SPACE SHUTTLE' FAILS TO SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL GREENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Discovery Channel's "The Space Shuttle" is a rather unfocused, often 
lethargic and sometimes downright boring effort -- much like its subject. In 
this respect, it is perhaps the perfect documentary of the nation's current 
manned space program. 
</P>
<P>
 This meandering, two-hour look at NASA's "cost-ineffective white elephant," as 
Carl Sagan describes it, moves at times as slowly as the giant "crawler" that 
carries the shuttle at 1 m.p.h. to its launch pad. The viewer is subjected to 
the banal reflections of an endless stream of talking heads -- technicians, 
administrators and astronauts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is clear that these are extremely dedicated, hard-working people, 
NASA personnel have never been known for their charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Tim Cowling and director-writer Scott Hicks would have been wiser to 
tell the shuttle's story through the eyes of two or three of the more colorful 
participants -- perhaps following astronaut Story Musgrave, "flow director" Tip 
Talone and a soldier in the army of technicians from preparation through 
touchdown of a single shuttle flight.  
</P>
<P>
 Spaceflight intrinsically is an exciting, imagination-provoking subject and, 
despite its overall vanilla flavor, "The Space Shuttle" does have its moments: 
some spectacular, but far too infrequent, footage of the dicey repair of the 
Hubble Space Telescope and other missions; Talone's poignant commentary as he 
wanders through the eerie remnants of the Apollo moon-shot program, which are 
"just lying in the sand . . . like bones in a graveyard" at the Kennedy Space 
Center; Musgrave's matter-of-fact admission that "I'm scared to death of 
launches"; the revelation that the astronauts wear diapers for takeoff; and a 
technician's tearful recollections of the program's only fatal flight, the 
Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Even just a short clip inserted from the Apollo days of the 1960s reminds the 
viewer of how uninspiring the manned space program has become in the last 
quarter century. The documentary could have used this theme of decline from the 
"right stuff" days to sharpen its production and give it some perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 * "The Space Shuttle" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. and midnight on cable's Discovery 
Channel. JOEL GREENBERG

TV REVIEWS; 'FINLAY' CASTS WARM SPELL OVER A SMALL SCOTTISH TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The accumulative warmth of "Doctor Finlay," Scottish Television's six new 
interrelated stories on "Masterpiece Theatre," casts a spell before you're even 
aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It mirrors a world that feels still within reach and yet so impossibly distant 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The chronicles of an idealistic young physician who sets up practice with an 
older doctor in a remote Scottish town in 1945 debuted on PBS last year. Now 
the swirl of personal dramas pick up from the same small town and with the same 
Scottish actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the affable Ian Bannen as Finlay's medical partner, the characters fill 
the air with their rich Scottish burrs and a tangle of unfinished stories 
(incomplete, as in real life). 
</P>
<P>
 Based on characters created by Scottish writer A.J. Cronin, the hourlong 
Sunday segments will particularly snare viewers with memories of a different 
world, notably the 1940s -- when doctors made house calls (some even on 
bikes!), when antibiotics were still a few years away, and when doctors often 
stumbled onto terrible family secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the romantic figure of Finlay (David Rintoul), whose fiancee 
jilted him last year, the good doctor now trumpets Britain's brave new world of 
National Health Service. With dreams of free care for everyone, he is a subtle 
harbinger of the British Labour Party, which after the war hailed socialized 
medicine, big change and (something Americans could never understand) threw 
Churchill out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreground is certainly not political history as such. The dramatic 
thrust here is a microcosm of human flotsam -- an alcoholic wife married to a 
pompous physician in one episode, a pregnant woman wrongly incarcerated in an 
asylum in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, in the joyful conclusion Dec. 18, is the touching marriage of 
Finlay's caring, middle-aged housekeeper (the endearing Annette Crosbie). Her 
wedding dinner, when she and Bannen have one last dance amid whiskey and 
bagpipes, is the show's jeweled crescent. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Doctor Finlay" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. It also airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
on KOCE-TV Channel 50. RAY LOYND

 Welfare Benefits -- Because of an editing error, a story in Friday's editions 
misstated plans by congressional Republicans to change eligibility for welfare 
benefits. The story said that illegal immigrants would be denied assistance. 
Illegal immigrants are already ineligible; the Republican plan would end 
benefits for legal immigrants.
