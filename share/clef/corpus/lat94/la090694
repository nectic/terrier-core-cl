 RARE BIRDS: They have returned in droves. The California least tern and other 
endangered birds have flocked to a natural lagoon at Ormond Beach in Oxnard to 
nest (B1). . . . But now the Ventura County Flood Control District is being 
pressured to drain the lagoon to control insect breeding. A developer is also 
asking for relief because it claims some of its vacant land is being flooded. 
Said Nick Gorely, senior vice president of the Baldwin Co.: "It's our property 
and it's being damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 MEMORIAL HIGHWAY: Plans are underway to designate California 126 as the Korean 
War Veterans' Memorial Highway in honor of their military service. . . . State 
Sen. Gary K. Hart will meet with local veterans in Santa Paula today to 
finalize details for the designation. . . . Meanwhile, a portion of the 
highway, notorious for its high number of terrible collisions, has earned 
another nickname: Blood Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK TO SCHOOL: The lazy days of summer are over, and it's time to hit the 
books again. . . . But it won't be quite the same for some Ventura County 
students returning to school this week. . . . At Garden Grove Elementary School 
in Simi Valley, many students are expected to show up wearing blue and white 
uniforms as part of a new school policy (B6). . . . Although the uniforms are 
optional, a private company has been doing brisk business at the school selling 
pants and skirts. Said Principal Elroy Peterson: "They're selling like hot 
cakes." 
</P>
<P>
 SIDEWALK SURFERS: Other than bowling, there's not much for a teen-ager to do 
in Ojai. . . . At least that's the view of 15-year-old Jake Frost. So Jake and 
his buddies set out to build a 25-foot-long, 5-foot-high wooden ramp in Jake's 
back yard where they could practice their daredevil skateboard moves (B1). . . 
. Word soon spread, and kids from as far away as Ventura started showing up to 
test out the ramp. . . . The neighbors, of course, are none too thrilled. Said 
one elderly resident: "They're driving us crazy."

MEXICAN, CUBAN IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Aug. 27 editorial claims that Gov. Pete Wilson's analogy regarding 
President Clinton's attitude toward Cuban refugees versus illegal immigration 
from Mexico "doesn't wash"! Have we changed our foreign policy to favor the 
acceptance of illegal immigrants because they need a job over the acceptance of 
an immigrant who escapes from an oppressive regime? 
</P>
<P>
 ARNOLD FRIEDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * "Border Brouhaha" once again exposes your anti-Republican stance and 
superficial treatment of a vital issue for the future of California. Illegal 
immigration and protection of our national borders are a federal obligation, 
which are not only virtually ignored, but the costs of providing for these 
illegals are shoved off on the states. 
</P>
<P>
 Next you opine that Wilson does not acknowledge that Californians use illegal 
immigrants for cheap labor. We passed a law creating sanctions on employers who 
knowingly employ illegals; however, the reason this does not work is that 
anyone can obtain a forged green card, Social Security card or other ID in 20 
minutes, as a recent TV expose revealed, but no federal government action! 
</P>
<P>
 If the illegals were prevented from coming here, perhaps some of our lazy 
unemployed might be pushed to work instead of just living off unemployment 
benefits. I am not an employer, so have no bone to pick in this regard, but 
merely an overtaxed individual who migrated to this great country and state 45 
years ago, having to wait for a quota opening, prove financial capability and 
also undergo a severe medical exam and, oh yes, was drafted while I still 
wasn't a citizen and served in the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is not a state obligation but definitely a federal one. I 
can only feel that the federal inaction is due to some tacit agreement between 
the U.S. and Mexican governments to relieve pressure on Mexico due to 
overpopulation.  
</P>
<P>
 FRED NEWMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Marina del Rey 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial attacked the messenger, Gov. Wilson, not the real problem. 
The problem is the corruption in Mexico and the lack of political will of the 
Mexican people! It is easy for illegal aliens to picket office buildings in 
Century City in an effort to gain every economic benefit that they can squeeze 
out of this country. It would take courage for these same people to picket 
government offices in Mexico to protest the political, military and police 
corruption that is so prevalent! 
</P>
<P>
 LAURENCE F. ALMOND

</P>
<P>
 * I urge all legal immigrants and naturalized citizens to stand with your 
undocumented brothers and sisters and vote no on Prop. 187. You may want to 
distance yourselves from the powerless illegals and tell yourself that you have 
nothing in common. But I tell you that should Prop. 187 pass, you will be next. 
All laws can be changed.  
</P>
<P>
 This initiative has nothing to do with legal and illegal, and everything to do 
with color, race and language. Stop Prop. 187 backers now before they devour 
the weak and helpless; because if you don't, you'll soon see them turn their 
baleful glare your way.

JUDGE'S GAG ORDER IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was astonished to read your editorial "Fair, but Also Open" (Aug. 31), which 
admonishes Judge Lance Ito for proposing a gag order on anyone connected with 
the O.J. Simpson case that would prevent them from discussing it outside court. 
The Times is against this? Amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 If any case has ever needed a gag order to ensure a fair and open trial, it's 
the Simpson case. Outside of court, we have seen a media feeding frenzy 
resulting in rumors reported as fact, monies paid out to witnesses for 
television interviews and unrelenting coverage commented on by an untold number 
of "experts," who seem more intent on promoting themselves than finding out the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times is as much a part of this media assault as the "tabloid press" you 
attempt to distance yourself from. 
</P>
<P>
 By issuing a gag order, Ito is forcing the media to focus attention on the 
facts of the case as presented in court. What could be fairer than that? By 
issuing a gag order to keep evidence under seal before it is presented in 
court, he is ensuring that the relevance and context of the evidence is 
maintained. What could be more open than that? 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I believe that The Times should get its priorities straight. The only 
newsworthy testimony by anybody in this case is that which is given in court. 
Any interviews of participants outside of court, by members of the sound-bite 
headline-seeking media can only serve to hurt Simpson's chance to get a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * With each new pitiful, desperate and silly motion it files, the Simpson 
defense team is doing a consummate job of convincing much of the public, the 
amorphous jury pool, that Simpson is indeed guilty. Even those who may have 
initially believed in his possible innocence are not likely to be fooled by 
Robert Shapiro's daily dose of mean-spirited dissemblance. The case is also 
exposing, for all to see, the pathetic absence of morality that characterizes 
the criminal lawyers, their strategies and their defendants in high-profile 
cases of celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICIA McCARTHY

<P>
 * Our society must be going mad. Within two minutes of listening to radio news 
recently, I heard that the judge is considering spending $30,000 a day to 
sequester the jurors in the Simpson case for perhaps six months or more. 
Following that was information that bus fare will be raised to $1.35. 
Hard-working people will have to pay more to get to work while taxpayers, 
including the same hard-working people, spend $30,000 per day to make sure one 
person gets a fair trial. Whatever happened to common sense and rational 
thinking?

</P>
<P>
 New York's clowning, song-and-dance man Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato to the 
contrary notwithstanding, and with sincere apologies to all police and law 
enforcement personnel, I am one taxpayer who is damn happy to have a crime bill

 * Regarding the crime bill: Republican Rep. Dick Armey calls four people 
telling how their loved ones were murdered a "dog and pony show." D'Amato 
stands up in the Senate and starts singing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm." And 
Republican Sen. William Cohen has the chutzpah to whine, "We don't get no

GOOD SCIENCE IN COURT: A BENCH RESPONSIBILITY; CREATIVE APPROACHES, SUCH AS 
NEUTRAL EXPERTS, ARE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a key ruling last year, the U.S. Supreme Court told federal judges that 
they can no longer throw up their hands when it comes to admitting complex 
scientific data into evidence and just let juries decide. The high court gave 
judges sophisticated new guidelines, intended both to admit new breakthroughs 
in science that are not yet widely accepted and to bar bad science from court. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals was a welcome first step 
toward more rational legal decisions involving science and medicine. But it 
places a tough burden on judges, few of whom are trained in scientific method. 
And it may mean giving up some of their devotion to the law's adversarial 
system, which works poorly when it comes to science. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges will get good help soon. Over the predictable objections of trial 
lawyers, fearing erosion of litigant rights, the Federal Judicial Center in 
Washington will soon distribute a reference manual on scientific evidence to 
all federal judges and hold seminars to educate them on science. The American 
Assn. for the Advancement of Science has begun a court demonstration project, 
and the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government recently 
recommended that science and technology resource centers be set up within 
federal and state judiciaries. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts deserve support. But judges need not wait. Federal and state 
judges are even now permitted on their own to call neutral experts to help 
resolve technical disputes. They rarely do so, for fear of interfering with the 
adversarial system, but it is a potential antidote to frequent perversion of 
science by trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 If 99 of 100 experts agree on a point, the defendant or plaintiff will surely 
call the one dissenter, sowing false doubt within a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Stanford study of 65 federal judges who had used neutral experts 
found all but two were pleased. A key issue is who should pay for these 
experts. Court funds for such purposes are insufficient. Presumably, the costs 
must be shared by litigants, at least in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty in absorbing new science is exemplified by the DNA issue in the 
O. J. Simpson case. There is no doubt that everybody, except identical twins, 
has a unique genetic makeup. The forensic issue now is how accurate are the 
tests to determine this genetic "fingerprint." A 1992 report by the National 
Academy of Sciences only complicated the matter by issuing overly conservative 
statistical odds on the chance of two people sharing the same DNA print, and 
that has muddied the matter in California courts, to the benefit of defendants. 
Under fire, the academy plans to revisit the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Science stands poised to offer powerful new forensic tools, vastly superior to 
what is available now. Unfortunately, top scientists, repelled by the 
adversarial process, have shunned the courts, leaving the field to a handful of 
paid experts, some of whom are scorned as intellectual prostitutes by their 
peers. A larger number of competent scientists must take a bigger role in the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 But science may not always have good or conclusive answers. For example, it 
will be years before the cause of the various symptoms called "Gulf War 
syndrome" can be validated or refuted. But government and courts must make 
decisions now, on the basis of the best available evidence. Law and science may 
never achieve full accommodation. But the public good requires lawyers and 
scientists to put aside historic differences and find common ground.

A BOOST FOR TREATMENT IN THE DRUG WAR; CALIFORNIA STUDY DOCUMENTS HUGE SAVINGS 
IN TERMS OF CRIME AND HEALTH CARE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the so-called pork in the newly passed federal crime bill may prove to 
be a sound investment after all in the war against drugs. An encouraging study 
released last week by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs 
has found that every dollar invested in drug treatment saves $7 in crime costs 
and health care costs. That finding supports the call for more treatment in the 
anti-drug campaign, an effort that thus far has tilted heavily toward law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 America has fought drug abuse mainly by increasing the number of federal drug 
enforcement agents, customs officers, police officers and prison beds. Tougher 
sentences for drug-related crimes have become mandatory at the federal and 
state levels. Yet nearly 1 million people now abuse illegal substances and many 
harm themselves and others in doing so, at enormous cost to tax-payers. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement of course has its place in resisting drugs: Drug dealing is, 
after all, frequently a violent business and the link between drug use and 
other forms of criminality is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Law-and-order demands from the public dramatically increased local and state 
outlays for police protection, prosecution and incarceration over the years, 
and little help came from Washington until the approval of the $30-billion 
crime bill last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug treatment traditionally has gotten short shrift in public budgets. It has 
been seen as expensive, and crime-weary voters have questioned its 
effectiveness. Now the California study, based on random sampling of programs 
treating nearly 150,000 people, has found that treatment works -- and saves 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 In documenting that effective drug treatment can reduce crime, the study 
recorded a $1-billion drop in costs related to crime after the drug abusers had 
been in treatment for 15 months. The study also found that drug treatment 
decreased the cost of health care such as emergency room treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The public health consequences of drug abuse are many. The sharing of dirty 
needles, common among heroin addicts, transmits AIDS. The first generation of 
crack babies poses a challenge for public hospitals, schools and foster care 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly welcome is the study's finding that treatment can help people who 
use crack cocaine, which is cheap, highly addictive and readily available. 
Crack addicts have been the most difficult drug abusers to medically treat. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single answer to America's drug problem. Law enforcement remains 
important. Violent criminals belong behind bars. But prevention and treatment 
also belong in the arsenal in the war against drugs.

NEW PAGE IN THE TALE OF RUSSIA; NO LONGER PROPAGANDA TOOLS, HISTORY TEXTBOOKS 
OFFER CANDID PORTRAIT OF COMMUNIST RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Happy the people whose annals are blank in history books," wrote Thomas 
Carlyle. The Russian people possess a long history, a lot of it harsh and 
painful, much of it long kept officially distorted, little of it notably happy. 
In the perestroika era of the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union moved toward 
greater openness in its public life, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the time had 
come to begin filling in the blank pages of that history. What he meant was 
that the time had come to start letting people know at least more of the truth 
about their past and especially what had really happened over the more than 70 
years of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of truth-telling began simply by discarding most of the books that 
were dedicated largely to singing the unqualified praises of communism. The 
next step was to write texts to replace them. Revising the history books has 
been a slow task. Now, three years into Russia's post-communist age, students 
in all of Russia's 67,000 schools are at last to begin seeing texts that offer 
a picture of the nation's modern history sharply different from what their 
parents and grandparents were taught. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Lenin, officially revered since his death in 1924, is now portrayed 
as a political leader who sanctioned terror and set the stage for the sweeping 
crimes of the Stalin era. The Stalin period itself is summed up as being based 
on "exploitation similar to semi-serfdom or even slavery." The 18-year reign of 
Leonid Brezhnev, openly referred to even before the collapse of the Soviet 
Union as the "era of stagnation," is now described witheringly as a time of 
tolerated "burglary and robbery in the service sector," of officials on the 
take, with "alcoholism and speculation, corruption and lack of discipline, 
apathy and careerism" as the main features of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Every country, of course, uses its schools to try to inculcate certain 
political values and support for national institutions. In an autocratic 
society, which Russia for nearly the whole of its long existence has been, the 
most important of those values were unquestioning acceptance of authority and 
obedience to the will of the ruler or the ruling party. Will a new 
non-ideological approach to teaching history to Russia's students help foster 
acceptance of political pluralism and respect for individual rights, two 
cornerstones of democratic progress? Any country that tries honestly to examine 
its history has a much better chance to avoid repeating the mistakes and 
follies of the past. Russia seems committed to taking the path of honest 
reappraisal.

DEATH PENALTY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Capital Punishment Held Up as Life or Death Campaign Issue" (Aug. 
30, about the Florida gubernatorial campaign): It truly frightens me to think 
that the people who run our country are elected because of their promise to 
kill. The death penalty has never been proven to deter murder or any other 
crime; it does not bring the victims back; it does nothing but satisfy a need 
for revenge.Meanwhile, the crimes more likely to actually affect us -- robbery, 
vandalism, gangs, etc., and their prevention and punishment -- have been pushed 
to the background. These issues hide behind a smoke screen called the death 
penalty, which the politicians want us to believe is the answer to all of 
society's ills.

REVITALIZE THE NAACP'S FLICKERING FLAME; CIVIL RIGHTS: NO MATTER WHO HEADS THE 
GROUP, ITS FOCUS MUST BE TO REACH OUT TO THE POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILLIP W.D. MARTIN, Phillip W.D. Martin is a writer specializing in race 
and international relations and formerly directed national projects for Oxfam 
America in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The firing of NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Chavis was a watershed 
incident that may force a dramatic restructuring of the NAACP to reflect the 
needs of poor African Americans. The internal dissension may also foreshadow 
the creation of an alternative civil-rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Chavis took the reigns of leadership from his conservative 
predecessor Benjamin Hooks, the organization had passed its zenith, 
overshadowed by the oratory of Jesse Jackson and upstaged by the boldness of 
politicians such as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Local black leaders, even those of questionable integrity like Al Sharpton of 
New York were confronting bigots at ground level in Bensonhurst and Howard 
Beach, while better-educated African Americans like Julian Bond were addressing 
corporate America in high-rise boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, Waters, Sharpton and Chavis speak face to face with the poorest of 
black people about keeping hope alive. Although some local chapters have 
developed reputations for direct community action, national board members too 
often commiserate only with each other behind closed doors or in conference 
with businessmen or politicians aspiring to high office. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple strategies are essential but not necessarily effective over the long 
term unless they take place within a unified organizational structure that 
involves blacks of all economic classes. As author Clarence Lusane suggests in 
"African Americans at the Crossroads," it is time for blacks to establish 
public-policy lobbies, political-training institutes and community forums of 
various perspectives to help revitalize our flickering civil-rights campaign to 
focus on the heinous crimes of racism and self-deprecation.  
</P>
<P>
 This unity of purpose and styles is what Chavis was trying to achieve in 
organizing a summit of African American leaders and the reason he claims he was 
fired. His imprudent handling of the NAACP's money and a related 
sexual-harassment allegation cannot be swept aside. Still, when he reached out 
to a broader community of African Americans -- the purpose for which he was 
hired -- he was accused of abandoning the integrationist civil-rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Chavis' first act upon assuming leadership was to open the doors 
to Latinos and other people of color. But Latinos did not join, nor did anyone 
else. Membership in the NAACP, which was low before his appointment, continues 
its precipitous decline. 
</P>
<P>
 There is probably very little that can be done to remedy this problem from the 
perspective of many African Americans, who maintain low or no regard for 
mainstream civil-rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, therefore, may be in a better position to help rebuild black 
communities outside the NAACP's narrow confines than within. He is not merely a 
theologian -- that all important symbol of the African American community -- 
but a former Amnesty International certified political prisoner (for serving 
four years on a conviction that was later overturned because the evidence had 
been falsified). This baptism by fire is respected by poor blacks who have 
similar conflagrations in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the urban archeological ruins of the Reagan-Bush years, Chavis met with 
black unemployed gang members, young up-from-poverty college kids, idealistic 
multiculturalists, socialists, spirited Afro-centrists and most controversial 
of all, working-class supporters of the Nation of Islam. They are the 
disenfranchised of traditional civil-rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most traditional civil-rights practitioners are principled men and women who 
have contributed mightily to the cause, but can no more relate to the majority 
of angry and impoverished black youth today than NAACP giant Roy Wilkins could 
relate to the "black power" generation of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Our need to end the joblessness, crime and self-hate that are devouring entire 
black communities make a tactical coalition of Chavis, Sharpton, Waters, 
Jackson, Louis Farrakhan and other key grass-roots and community organizers 
imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategically speaking, Chavis' embrace of Farrakhan is no more an endorsement 
of "Farrakhanism" than network media executives' embrace of Rush Limbaugh and 
Patrick Buchanan are endorsements of their insidious bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Chavis' philosophy might even be regarded as an alternative to 
Farrakhan's segregationist demagoguery. Chavis voices the view that poor people 
of all colors must come together to achieve economic and political power in our 
nation, which continues to favor the prerogatives of wealth. What Chavis and 
Farrakhan share is a willingness to reach out to the black poor of America. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is to survive, the NAACP, no matter who leads it, must do the same.

PRISONS OVER SCHOOLS: FORMULA FOR FAILURE; STATE BUDGET: JAILING EVER MORE 
CALIFORNIANS MAY JEOPARDIZE OUR FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY HART, State Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) chairs the Senate 
Education Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd like to share with you the lives of two of my constituents, both public 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 One is an elementary school teacher in the San Luis Obispo area. In high 
school, she was near the top of her class, and she received a bachelor's degree 
from UC Santa Barbara. But the 134% increase in student fees during her time at 
UC forced her to work 20 hours a week, take an extra year to graduate and take 
out $21,000 in student loans. Now she is in her first-grade classroom from 8 
a.m. to 3 p.m. every day, often staying until 5 p.m. before going home to 
prepare the next day's lesson plan and grade homework in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her $24,500 starting salary is just enough to get her by with her large 
student-debt load; she gets no overtime despite many 50- to 60-hour weeks, and 
she knows that her advancement will depend substantially on whether she pursues 
a graduate education during summer breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of my constituents works at the California Men's Colony at San Luis 
Obispo. He is a prison guard. This fellow doesn't have a college degree; a high 
school equivalency certificate and a few weeks of training were all he needed 
to qualify for his job. Many of his colleagues have stronger qualifications, 
being retired military or police personnel already drawing pensions. With a 
starting salary of $29,000 and overtime paying him time and a half, he knows 
he's lucky. And after two years on the job he has a good chance to be making at 
least $40,000 a year. It's a tough job -- the threat of violence is always 
present -- but the money and job security are worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 These two profiles -- the new teacher and the new prison guard -- illustrate 
just how far out of whack our state's priorities have become. We ask some of 
our most talented high school students to forgo a paycheck for five years, 
incur substantial debt and work long hours for a modest salary with few 
benefits, then entrust them with the vital task of educating the next 
generation. Yet we pay high school dropouts with no student debt and little 
training 20% more plus overtime to baby-sit murderers, rapists and thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, it's not only the salaries and benefits that are out of whack; it's 
the entire state budget. In 1970, the state spent nearly twice as much on the 
University of California as it did on the youth and adult correctional systems 
combined. Ten years later, expenditures on the correctional system exploded, 
raising corrections' share of the General Fund budget by 1985 to nearly match 
UC's; prison costs have continued escalating ever since. The 1994-95 budget 
just approved by Gov. Pete Wilson gives our correctional system yet another 9% 
annual increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quarter of a century, we have effectively reversed our budget priorities: 
We now spend almost twice as much putting people in jail in California as we do 
offering our brightest young people a high-quality college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for this ratio to improve any time in the near future. The "Three 
Strikes and You're Out" legislation signed by Wilson -- which could put 
check-forgers in jail for life if they have two prior felonies -- promises our 
correctional system a steady flow of new inmates far into the future and 
promises an uphill fight for state funds for our education system. 
</P>
<P>
 When the history of the 1990s is written, will people look back and shake 
their heads in disbelief at this era when international economic competition, 
an explosion of diversity at home and a shrinking middle class threatened our 
future, and we chose to invest in prisons rather than schools, guards rather 
than teachers? Teachers and prison guards each perform necessary functions, and 
both deserve a decent wage. But somewhere in the swirl of frustration and anger 
surrounding our anti-crime fervor, we have lost track of where we are going and 
what our destination should be.

AMERICANS WANT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT; THE COST OF TENDING TO THEM AND THEIR 
CHILDREN HAS OVERWHELMED THE STATE. WHY NOT DRAW THE LINE AT THE SCHOOL DOOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON PRINCE, Ron Prince, chairman of the Save Our State Committee, is an 
accountant in Orange County and fifth-generation Californian, a descendant of 
the Vignes family. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the originators of Proposition 187 (the "Save Our State" initiative) 
and one of the thousands of volunteers working for its passage in November, I'm 
concerned about the barrage of disinformation coming from many of California's 
richest special-interest groups. They seem to be threatened by having existing 
immigration laws enforced or, apparently, by any change in the status quo of 
asking taxpayers to continue to fund services for those in this country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of California, 600,000 of them statewide, have put this initiative 
on the ballot. They have done so because the politicians were afraid to deal 
with the problem. While Sacramento pointed its finger at Washington, and vice 
versa, the problem was allowed to grow. It has now grown to the point where it 
threatens to literally bankrupt this state. And an ineffective government must 
now hope that the people will save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, California has an initiative process whereby the people can 
legislate for themselves when necessary. This necessity was met before with 
Proposition 13, which was attacked by many of the same special interests that 
oppose us. They too, were targeted with a campaign of fear, with the same 
predictions of disaster that we are seeing now. Whether it's talk of epidemics, 
or an explosion of crime, or the collapse of the economy, it's all the same 
nonsense. A babble of nonsense designed to confuse the issue so that people 
won't know what they're voting on.  
</P>
<P>
 But this problem is so pervasive and involves so many Californians that no 
amount of money spent by the special interests can change people's minds. By 
now, most have read or heard the statistics about the costs of illegal aliens, 
and they have come to their own conclusions about whether a bad system needs to 
be continued into perpetuity simply because "they're here." And that is the 
essence of the problem: not just to secure the border (where only 40% of 
illegal entries occur) but to deal with those already here. 
</P>
<P>
 Once illegal aliens arrive in California, the burden falls on the state, not 
the federal government. Proposition 187 would lighten that burden by ending 
public benefits paid for health, education and welfare for illegal aliens. It 
would require law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and report all those under arrest for other crimes and 
subsequently suspected of being here illegally. It will also make the use of 
fraudulent citizenship documents, such as the ever-popular phony "green card," 
a felony. Rather than support and harbor illegal aliens, California will report 
them to the INS. And, more important, a yes vote on Proposition 187 will 
pressure the federal government to enforce its own laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Our opponents boast that they are ready to file suit to challenge Proposition 
187 in court. This is a challenge that we welcome. It will force the U.S. 
Supreme Court to revisit its narrow (5-4) decision of 1982 that required public 
education for illegals. The Plyler decision was based on circumstances very 
different from our problem today, where the cost of educating illegal aliens in 
bilingual programs is much higher than the amount allocated for American 
citizens. This is discrimination against our own people. In the words of Joseph 
Stein, president of the State Board of Education, the removal of illegals from 
public schools will "alleviate an inappropriate drain on scarce resources" and 
will "move our public school system to the level necessary for successful 
preparation of children in the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration in the quality of our education system threatens our 
economic competitiveness. But it cannot be reversed as long as more illegal 
aliens continue to pour into the system, demanding more and more special 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our public health-care system is also burdened with growing costs, largely as 
a result of immigration. In 1992, the cost of providing free services to 
illegal aliens was $900 million, an increase of 1,800% over the previous five 
years, according to the state's Department of Health Services. While American 
citizens must prove need (and destitution) before they can qualify for such 
services, illegals are able to take advantage of them by claiming medical 
emergency. Once again, the system discriminates against citizens. Because the 
system is overloaded, the overall quality of care is being reduced to dangerous 
levels. According to the Los Angeles County Department of Health, for example, 
there isn't enough money for TB screening or follow-up care. This is the 
greater threat to public health -- not the deportation of illegals with 
communicable diseases.  
</P>
<P>
 Our welfare system is being abused as well. Although L.A. County Supervisor 
Gloria Molina says that no illegal aliens are receiving welfare in her county, 
she refuses to recognize the common practice of using fraudulent documents to 
show that the applicant is a legal resident. Once again, the system is being 
drained of funds that are then unavailable for those in need, those who are 
rightfully entitled to them. When food stamp allocations are reduced next year, 
what do we say to Americans who don't have enough to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 Fraudulent documents are also used by illegal aliens to get jobs, although 
hiring them is prohibited by federal law. But the law doesn't work, as seen in 
the recent case against an employer charged with hiring illegal aliens -- the 
first such case in eight years. Moreover, employers are afraid to challenge 
applicants for fear of discrimination suits. Proposition 187 will require that 
the illegal aliens share responsibility; it will discourage them from applying 
for jobs with phony identification. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all these problems, many special interests want the flow of 
illegal immigration to continue. Why? Because they are advocacy groups that 
profit from litigation for "human rights" at the expense of our rights. Because 
they are multinational corporations that profit from "cheap labor" at the cost 
of our jobs. Because they are bureaucracies that grow more powerful with ever 
increasing "caseloads," while services for the rest of us are cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 deals with the problem of illegal immigration at the state 
level, where most of the costs are incurred. Its passage will then pressure the 
federal government to do its part. Its failure would send a message to all 
levels of government to do nothing. We must pass it.

 Couched as it was with reminders of the earthquake, the wildfires and the 
sagging economy, our question to readers was simple: Why do you stay in the San 
Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of poems, essays and even a limerick, written on manual typewriters, 
computers or scrawled on note cards, you responded, defiantly defending your 
neighborhood, your strip mall, your Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it is the memories that keep you here: of orange groves, farmlands 
or the deer that once roamed the Valley floor. For others, it is as simple as 
the convenience of nearby malls or the endlessly sunny days. Others point to 
something less tangible, a collective spirit that rises in the face of each new 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But we asked for your words, so we'll let you explain. Here are some of our 
favorite remarks, illustrated with photographs by Brian Vander Brug about why 
there's no place quite like the Valley to call home. Even the Ground Is 
Entertaining 
</P>
<P>
 I live in the Valley because there's always something interesting to write 
home about (home being a euphemism for the Pacific Northwest, where my nuclear 
family still lives). 
</P>
<P>
 I live here because I work at Warner Bros. (I got lucky.) 
</P>
<P>
 I live here because my friend Pat and I polish actor DeForest Kelley's and 
producer A.C. Lyles' stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame every Sunday morning 
at 8:30. (So I'm looney!) 
</P>
<P>
 I live here because I can experience -- firsthand, like a chicken leg -- 
"Shake and Bake." And because there's usually sufficient "rock and roll" to 
suit me. (I'm not talking about music!) Don't you just love living where even 
the ground can furnish a compelling degree of entertainment? It keeps life from 
becoming routine and predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: I live in the San Fernando Valley because each and every one of 
my most cherished, lifelong dreams have been centered in (or very near) this 
magical place. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going anywhere.

there's no place quite like the Valley to call home. Everything Accessible From 
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
 What do I like about San Fernando Valley? Memories of arriving at my uncle's 
house in 1937. Living on White Oak Street in Reseda -- a dirt road. Most of the 
Valley was farmland and orchards. The smogless days and nights were beautiful 
and summer heat didn't seem all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer I worked with my uncle in his Santa Monica bakery. We drove 
through the Sepulveda Pass at 3 a.m. and spotted about four or five deer each 
morning eating alongside the highway. Van Nuys Airport was a dirt strip in 1938 
and I had my first airplane ride in a two-seater. Sepulveda Boulevard was a 
ribbon of concrete two lanes wide and the major north-south road across the 
Valley. Traffic was next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our daughter was born in Van Nuys in a 24-bed maternity hospital. My wife and 
I have lived in three locations in the Valley -- Van Nuys, Northridge and 
Granada Hills. We like Granada Hills because of all the freeways near our 
house. We can head for the desert, Santa Anita track, south to the ocean or 
west to the Ventura beaches. We're close enough to Glendale, Pasadena and 
Hollywood for all the concerts and plays. CSUN is fun if you like watching 
excellent college girls softball or boys baseball, and the football stadium is 
small enough to hear the tackles. The Valley is centrally located. Kaiser 
hospitals are close with nice staffs, which is important when you are 72 years 
old. Our daughter lives and works in the Valley and our neighbors have always 
been the best. 
</P>
<P>
 As for wildfires, they can happen anywhere and the earthquakes are like sex -- 
it seldom happens and doesn't last for long.

 For some, it is the memories that keep you here: of orange groves, farmlands

 But we asked for your words, so we'll let you explain. Here are some of our

Real Confusion 
</P>
<P>
 To stay or not to stay? That seems to be the question of late. The San 
Fernando Valley has developed some wrinkles. The granddaddy of all suburbs is 
showing its age, and people are leaving it for newer pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some people still enjoy living here. Many Valleyites can hold our own 
on either side of this debate. So instead of taking sides, let us consider 
these following advantages. (And disadvantages?) 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny, balmy summers (with temperatures in the 100s on many days). 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake-free zone (at least of tremors above 7.0). 
</P>
<P>
 A lower crime rate (But the Valley is actually in the city limits of Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain rents (you can get a two-bedroom/two-bath apartment for only $1,600 a 
month in the West Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Mass transit near you (in the year 2010). 
</P>
<P>
 Nice size homes (at nice, hefty prices). 
</P>
<P>
 Better schools. (Better schools?)

 Couched as it was with reminders of the earthquake, the wildfires and the 
sagging economy, our question to readers was simple: Why do you stay in the San 
Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of poems, essays and even a limerick, written on manual typewriters,

Garden of Eden 
</P>
<P>
 One of the treats I received each Christmas as a child in Omaha was a large, 
shiny navel orange grown in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Savoring each slice with the tangy sweet juice dripping from my lips, I would 
try to imagine a magical far-off place that produced such a wonder in the 
wintertime. 
</P>
<P>
 To my great excitement and joy, our family did move to Southern California in 
1928 when I was 11 years old. As Father drove our car on the highway from San 
Bernardino to Los Angeles, we gaped at the numerous picture postcard groves of 
orange trees nestled at the foot of snow-capped mountains. We saw fields of 
grapevines and stately palm trees. Paradise on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 When my husband and I established our home in the San Fernando Valley in 1950, 
we planted an orchard in our back yard with orange, lemon, peach, apricot, plum 
and fig trees. We erected a grape arbor that cascaded with Concord and Thompson 
seedless grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, we planted a garden patch of vegetables, surrounded by rose 
bushes and other flowers. It was so easy to grow things. We would never go 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 We are old now and several of our trees have died, as have fruit trees 
elsewhere in the Valley, displaced by concrete. Still, what we like best in the 
Valley is what we have preserved for ourselves in our own back yard -- a bit of 
the Garden of Eden.

Native's Eye 
</P>
<P>
 Do you remember "The Third Eye?" For a kid of 6 or 7, born and growing up in 
Encino in the early 1960s, this curious place, located where the Laemmle Plaza 
now flourishes, is my first and most lasting memory of life then on "the 
Boulevard," in the Valley. In that time of "Leave It to Beaver," I wondered 
what was going on in that strange place with the huge eerie green eye staring 
out from in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I soon came to understand a bit more of my surroundings and my 
world, but I cherish the seeds of my social consciousness as I continue to make 
the Valley my home today. 
</P>
<P>
 I read, amused, how the residents of Encino gather to make plans for creative 
community growth, including expansion of area parkland. I recall the family 
picnics (with a wonderful emphasis on family) we held at little Encino Park, 
possibly because Balboa Park wasn't completed yet. I remember down the street 
from "The Third Eye" was "The Beat" -- the only record store around.  
</P>
<P>
 I've seen my oldest, closest friends flee the Valley for a more sedate life in 
Oregon, a more stylish one in San Francisco; family members migrated for a more 
"sophisticated" one "over the hill." And, of course, the tens of thousands who 
have emigrated to our Valley, and helped it create what it is today. And me? At 
36, and a true native, I'm still here. And yeah, I remember "The Third Eye." 
Sometimes I feel like I still have that third eye, that gives me a very special 
way of seeing life in our world, our Valley. What do I like about the Valley? 
It's home.

the Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 I know I'm not into masochism, so why indeed do I stay? 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary rural quality of the Valley that appealed to me at first 
disappeared so long ago that when I mention it to newcomers, they question my 
sanity; the traffic snarls that occur constantly can rival the worst of the 
ones in the city; the property values have plummeted to inconceivable depths; 
the schools don't seem to be doing any schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 The rural characteristics were destroyed by the engineers that gave us 
sidewalks, curbs, gutters and the great feat of our drainage system. My 
profession (architecture) contributed with horrendous strip shopping centers, 
monstrous malls and slums of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural disasters can (and actually do) happen everywhere, so let's not 
include them in the same list as man-made acts of stupidity (such as riots), 
even though they indeed contribute to our seemingly unstoppable deterioration. 
All things considered, this is a terrible place to live, but . . . every other 
place is so much worse!

AL MARTINEZ: LET THE GAMES BEGIN

<P>
 Something's always happening in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 They battle over jet noise, street vendors, boardwalk activists, topless 
sunbathing, skateboarding, wild bicycling, littering and ugly tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace activists come to blows over how best to protect the world from 
violence. Skinny professors of Chaucerian literature challenge muscle-bound 
dolts who kick sand on them, just like in old Charles Atlas ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest incident tops them all. People who live along the boardwalk, 
angered by the presence of young toughs, have developed a new method of dealing 
with their annoyances. What they don't like, they smash. 
</P>
<P>
 This has to do with a group of residents who one night took sledgehammers to 
four concrete picnic tables along the beach and beat them, not into plowshares, 
but into dust. 
</P>
<P>
 No wild-eyed survivalists in camouflaged uniforms mounted the attack. From 
what I hear, old ladies smashed tables alongside CPAs in designer running 
suits. Children clapped. Bystanders cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous participant explained later that the tables were destroyed 
because they were the meeting place of kids who fought and raised hell at 
night, keeping everyone awake. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes sense to me. Didn't the Romans finally win the Punic wars by sneaking 
into Carthage after dark and wrecking their picnic tables? Rome ruled the world 
for about another 300 years after that. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, smashing tables doesn't scatter the Venice toughs, the next step 
might be to form a posse, hunt 'em down, find an oak tree and hang them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What we have here, you see, is vigilantism, and there are many who feel it 
isn't such a bad idea. They're like the people who cheered Bernard Goetz a few 
years back for shooting four kids who hassled him in a New York subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Goetz became an instant folk hero and was probably, in part, the basis for a 
movie called "Falling Down," in which Michael Douglas beat, smashed and shot 
his way through L.A. in the name of civic serenity and human decency. 
</P>
<P>
 My first reaction to the Venice incident was outrage. Vigilantism is a violent 
and lawless way of dealing with one's problems, and those who participate 
should be held to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in my small group of friends agreed. Taking the law into one's hands is 
not the hallmark of an orderly society. If there is to be violence and cruelty, 
it should be left up to those appointed to carry it out. Is this America or 
what? 
</P>
<P>
 But then I began hearing from people in the bleachers. They left messages on 
my answering machine that amounted to lusty cheers. I could see them rising in 
sequence, doing the wave for those with the sledgehammers, and leaving in 
contentment when the score flashed on the screen: Vigilantes 1, Young Toughs 0. 
</P>
<P>
 I got the feeling as I listened to the messages and talked to people on the 
beach later that it was indeed a kind of game to them. They were fans of a new 
sport played without rules that pitted good guys against bad guys, and, by God, 
they'd won. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they don't realize is this: The game isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A rematch is in the air. Already some of the toughs are swarming through an 
apartment building on the boardwalk, pounding on doors and demanding to face 
the, well, team members who pulverized their tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids who fight and yell and deal dope and sometimes kill each other are 
outraged at the violence committed by the vigilantes. They demand redress, and, 
I'm told, are getting ready for the next encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news. If the vigilantes are to keep the lead in the game they've 
created, they'll just have to do a little more smashing. A few picnic tables 
pounded into sand won't put 'em in the record books. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of preemptive strike we used to talk about during the Cold War is 
called for here. Don't wait for trouble this time. Hit first. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it big. Find out where the toughs live. Then smash up their sofas, their 
television sets, their dining room tables, their lamps, their women, their 
babies and their dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't teach the hoodlums a lesson they'll never forget, the way 
Dallas taught Buffalo in the last two Super Bowls, then rent a bulldozer and 
turn their houses into kindling. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that you say? The toughs are still out there, still forming, still 
yelling, still spoiling for a fight? Not to worry. The vigilantes will be ready 
too. A game played like this just goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one salvation. It's also bound to get bloodier. And someday even 
those who cheer in the bleachers may discover that violent delights meet 
violent ends. Then maybe it won't seem like such fun after all.

Ex-Marine 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 10 years as one of "Uncle Sam's Misguided Children," I was 
concerned about being able to make the transition into the alien culture known 
as "The Civilian World." Fortunately, I've chosen to settle in the San Fernando 
Valley, where it's almost as if I'd never left the military at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Should I miss the adrenaline rush of walking point during a patrol in 
dangerous territory, I need only stroll through the alleyways near Sepulveda 
and Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds, too, are comforting to an ex-military man. The roar of jets from 
Burbank Airport, the constant clatter of low-flying LAPD helicopters, and the 
occasional crack of small-arms fire echoing through the night is enough to warm 
the heart of any grunt. 
</P>
<P>
 In training, we were often awakened by raging lunatics at zero-dark-thirty in 
the morning with shouts, screams and loud crashing noises. In the Marines, we 
called them drill instructors. Here in the Valley, we call them "neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 For the pilots who've become accustomed to a turbulent, high-speed, 
death-defying existence, there's the Valley's system of quake-damaged freeways, 
guaranteed to compress your spine. The antics of the drivers around you will 
make dogfighting a Kamikaze look tame, and given the condition of many of the 
overpasses on the 405 freeway, if you go fast enough, you may actually be able 
to fly your car! 
</P>
<P>
 So, to all of you jarheads, squids, flyboys and dogfaces who are faced with 
separation from the military, I say, "Come one, come all, to the Happy Valley!" 
If you long for the adventurous, unpredictable and occasionally dangerous life 
that you had in the military, then you'll love it here!

Stereotype Valley 
</P>
<P>
 I am an old man. Not, God help me, a senior citizen, but, (bless you) old 
enough to remember when The Times was a respectable Republican newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in the Valley for 55 years. I lived in Burbank when Burbank was 
nothing more than Lockheed surrounded by mortgages, and civilization as we knew 
it ended at Sepulveda Boulevard; in Woodland Hills before it developed an ego; 
in Reseda for reasons known only to God; and in Sylmar for the past 32 years 
and two earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 I have visited friends in every township, subdivision and settlement in this 
Valley, and I have news for you: There is no such thing as 'The Valley' -- no 
homogeneous entity that can be cajoled, wheedled, taken, patronized or ignored. 
There are different neighborhoods, different towns, and especially different 
people. Proud of it, too. If the Valley is changing, it only shows that there 
is life in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, I have visited many places on the surface of this terrestrial globe. 
Some of them were habitable; some were not. They were all populated. Most of 
the people living in these places rather liked them -- I even met one who loved 
Yuma and wouldn't leave if you paid him. Where one lives is important, perhaps, 
but not nearly as important as how one lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would anyone want to live in the San Fernando Valley? Who needs the heat, 
the earthquakes, the traffic, the taxes, the prices, the fires, and the 
supercilious attitude of the mountebanks that cavort in the halls of 
government? Why do I stay? Why do people visit zoos?

 Couched as it was with reminders of the earthquake, the wildfires and the 
sagging economy, our question to readers was simple: Why do you stay in the San 
Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of poems, essays and even a limerick, written on manual typewriters, 
computers or scrawled on note cards, you responded, defiantly defending your 
neighborhood, your strip mall, your Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it is the memories that keep you here: of orange groves, farmlands 
or the deer that once roamed the Valley floor. For others, it is as simple as 
the convenience of nearby malls or the endlessly sunny days. Others point to 
something less tangible, a collective spirit that rises in the face of each new 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But we asked for your words, so we'll let you explain. Here are some of our 
favorite remarks, illustrated with photographs by Brian Vander Brug about why 
there's no place quite like the Valley to call home. Transplant Grows Into a 
Convert 
</P>
<P>
 Though there to shore up my mother's quake-ravaged spirits, if not her 
perilously sagging walls, I temporarily relocated to her condominium in the 
Valley with cynicism and smarting eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gardener, I am lucky to live in a clean-air, low-traffic zone in the 
mountains. Mom lives close to Lankershim Boulevard at Cahuenga in North 
Hollywood, an intersection plotted by the same guy who laid the course for 
Space Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to get my mother's mind off the jigsaw jumbles of shattered wedding 
china and tacky bric-a-brac my brother and I, as kids, had lavished on her 
every Mother's Day, I would insist we go out walking and look for signs of 
horticultural life in this winter of our discontent. My mother wondered whether 
the peripatetic earth will vanquish the work of home gardeners while more 
urgent needs press upon them. I wondered whether anything could actually grow 
in this breathless dry heat and car-befouled air. 
</P>
<P>
 Pink clouds of azaleas sprawling beneath exotic white Bauhinias met us early 
on. Just a floriferous fluke. Then, on an otherwise drab, austere lot, a 
perfect specimen of Rhododendron grew, smothered in lavender blooms. Interlaced 
among its glossy leaves were tendrils of Bougainvillea bearing raspberry red 
bracts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the neighboring lot irises were growing, cinnamon-speckled gold and 
champagne pink, with ball-headed Ranunculus shouting their loud, bright colors 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
 While I miss my own garden terribly, I am excited and inspired by what I've 
found in this Valley I have condescended to inhabit for a few glum months. I 
came to know camphor trees in winter, whose trunks glisten like obsidian in the 
rain, and vibrant avenues of crepe myrtle in summer. By mid-May I became a 
bonafide Valley booster; by August, a convert.

</P>
<P>
 Working in West Los Angeles is enough for me -- although I wouldn't mind 
Scottie beaming up Beverly Center and Orso's Restaurant to Tarzana. The Valley 
lacks nothing except for the crime and riots I read about almost daily. So to 
everyone that thinks Los Angeles is still the mecca: Stay there, we don't need 
the extra weight.

Negatives 
</P>
<P>
 I'm proud to call Van Nuys home. We're (arguably) No. 1 in the Valley. Not 
everybody can boast of being the most unsafe city in the Valley. We have the 
worst and most violent crime and the most dangerous gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the loveliest shade of burnt sienna brown water from our taps. The DWP 
assures us it is not harmful to drink. A fun entertainment in our town is 
watching our new garbage collection trucks fly by. Without even stopping, they 
can hoist a huge garbage can, pass it lightly over the top of the truck, and 
fling more debris into the street than into the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep us competitive in the worst air quality department, we have a gasoline 
bulk loading terminal releasing benzene and other toxic substances into our 
early morning air together with tar-making plants and the Tillman reclamation 
facility to guarantee we never remember what fresh air smells like. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to reward us for being (arguably) No. 1, the city of Los Angeles has 
plans to crown the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area "the home of the world's 
largest truck toilet." The Bureau of Sanitation will truck sewage to us from as 
far away as Malibu in the west and La Canada Flintridge in the east.

</P>
<P>
 In dozens of poems, essays and even a limerick, written on manual typewriters,

</P>
<P>
 For some, it is the memories that keep you here: of orange groves, farmlands

<P>
 But we asked for your words, so we'll let you explain. Here are some of our 
favorite remarks, illustrated with photographs by Brian Vander Brug about why 
there's no place quite like the Valley to call home. Multiethnic Food, No 
Fashion Fixation 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it. The Valley is no Garden of Eden. It doesn't have the breezes of 
Santa Monica, the elegance of Beverly Hills, the chic of Brentwood, the charm 
of Pasadena, nor the trendiness of West Hollywood. It doesn't even have the 
orange groves and cheap housing of its not-so-distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's to like? Plenty. I've lived in the Valley since 1954 (having failed 
in my two halfhearted attempts to move "over the hill") and learned to accept 
and love this diverse and dynamic piece of geography. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley reminds me of why I like cactus. Unlike more delicate hybrids, it 
thrives under adverse conditions. It lives with frequent heat, survives with 
minimum water, and is oddly appealing in an ugly, prickly way. 
</P>
<P>
 I've actually grown to love those strip centers and mini-malls that litter the 
neighborhoods. First of all, they're convenient -- you're never more than five 
minutes from a Slurpee or Winchell's doughnut -- and they're a plucky 
thumb-your-nose at pre-planned, homogeneous, architecturally correct 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The once "white bread" Valley (I remember not being able to find a bagel for 
miles) is now multiethnic. I can now eat tandoori, drink sake, or buy humus all 
within a three-mile radius. I can eat in restaurants with names like Frankie's 
Falafel House, Sam's Sushi Palace, Willy's Wok, and Nick the Greek's, not just 
Bob's Big Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley never was nor ever will be fashionable (Encino pretensions aside), 
and that makes me very happy.

COMMENTARY ; PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 187; SHAME ON THEM, PICKING ON 
CHILDREN; BANNING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR U.S.-BORN OFFSPRING FROM SCHOOL 
AND CLINICS IS MALICIOUS AND FOOLHARDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD F. CHANG, Howard F. Chang is an economist and law professor at USC 
Law Center, where he teaches a course on immigration law and policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the current wave of immigrant-bashing is the 
tendency to lash out at the innocent children of undocumented immigrants. 
Proposition 187, which proponents call the "Save Our State" initiative, would 
exclude undocumented children from public schools and require these schools to 
verify the legal status of not only all children enrolled but also their 
parents; the school authorities would be required to report those "suspected" 
of illegal status. The proposal would also exclude undocumented immigrants, 
including children, from any nonemergency health care provided by any facility 
receiving public funds, apparently even if the immigrant is paying for the care 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 thus would deprive children of prenatal and preventive health 
care, including needed immunizations, and the basic education essential to 
becoming productive members of society. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfairness of punishing children for circumstances beyond their control is 
obvious enough: The injustice of such policies led the U.S. Supreme Court to 
declare in Plyler vs. Doe (1982) that depriving undocumented children of free 
access to public schools violated their right to "the equal protection of the 
laws" guaranteed by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Proposition 187 were not unconstitutional, it would still be foolish 
and simplistic public policy. Proponents claim that Proposition 187 would 
reduce undocumented immigration, as if the undocumented are drawn here in any 
significant measure by our public services rather than overwhelmingly by the 
prospect of employment. The truth is that powerful economic forces in the labor 
market drive illegal immigration, and Proposition 187 would do little to 
discourage such immigration from countries that offer precious little hope of a 
better life. 
</P>
<P>
 The undocumented and their children would remain among us in spite of 
Proposition 187, but with less education and health care. Therein lies the most 
perverse result of Proposition 187: It would create an underclass of illiterate 
and impoverished residents, deprived of basic skills, including 
English-language skills, necessary for the integration of immigrant children 
into our society and our work force. This underclass would create new risks to 
public health and new breeding grounds for crime and thereby threaten the 
welfare of all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents tout Proposition 187 as a means of saving the public treasury from 
the costs related to undocumented immigrants, but don't expect any big windfall 
soon. Unless we close schools and fire teachers, the exclusion of the 
undocumented from public schools will not bring any significant savings 
quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 As a long-term fiscal measure, Proposition 187 is shortsighted. Public 
expenditures on education and prenatal and other health-care services for our 
children, alien or citizen, represent a wise investment that will earn a 
handsome return when these children grow up to be skilled employees and 
taxpayers. Those with higher incomes will pay more in taxes; an illiterate 
underclass will pay little and impose heavy social costs. An underclass denied 
preventive health care will require more emergency medical care, which 
Proposition 187 would continue to provide to undocumented immigrants. Thus, 
Proposition 187 would burden the California treasury by eroding its tax base 
and misallocating scarce resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 punishes not just immigrant children but also present and 
future U.S. citizens. Undocumented parents will face deportation if they seek 
to give their children, even those born as citizens in the United States, 
medical care or an education. Even those children who were not U.S.-born will 
probably grow up here and eventually acquire legal status. Proposition 187 
would deprive all these children of the inculcation of civic values and the 
basic education essential to a literate and informed electorate. Moreover, 
because Proposition 187 will impoverish so many California residents, including 
future citizens who will have access to the broadest array of entitlement 
programs, it will drain the public treasury, not save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is, in short, malevolent and misguided. Regrettably, we will 
continue to see such malicious proposals as long as irresponsible politicians 
continue to pander to the worst instincts in the California electorate, blaming 
politically powerless groups like undocumented immigrants for California's 
social and economic problems. One can only hope that California voters will 
have the wisdom and the decency to reject them.

IT'S A RECORD RICE HARVEST, 44-14; PRO FOOTBALL: RECEIVER SCORES THREE 
TOUCHDOWNS TO SET NFL RECORD OF 127 AS 49ERS OUTCLASS RAIDERS IN 'SUPER BOWL 
PREVIEW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A game that promised to be an imitation Super Bowl succeeded splendidly Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 One team broke records, staged dances, threw parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The other team kicked dirt and banged tables. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't pretty, it wasn't close, and those certainly could not have been the 
touted Raiders who were whipped by the San Francisco 49ers, 44-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Could they have been? 
</P>
<P>
 While the 49ers today are celebrating Jerry Rice's new home atop the NFL 
career touchdown list -- he scored three for a record 127 -- the Raiders will 
spend the week watching homemade horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," defensive tackle Nolan Harrison said. "We lost, we lost 
terrible. I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We lost terrible ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler, a quarterback who overthrew some receivers while watching 
others drop passes, echoed Harrison's comments but with a West Virginia accent: 
"We got a bad, bad butt whipping. Hopefully, this will bring a lot of people 
back to reality." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, it will send them to the El Segundo lost-and-found. 
Questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where is their patented bomb? Jeff Hostetler's 17 completions averaged only 
9.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where is their pass rush? Working against an offensive line that lost its 
starting right side in the first half, they had only two sacks while allowing 
quarterback Steve Young to become the game's leading rusher with 51 yards in 
five carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where is their running game? OK, dumb question. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where was their fire, particularly in the first 13 minutes, when the 49ers 
scored twice while outgaining them, 140 yards to 25? 
</P>
<P>
 "For some odd reason, when the game started, their intensity was much greater 
than ours," Raider tackle Gerald Perry said. "That's not hard to do when you're 
the home team . . . but we never got to the peak that those guys were on." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that the Raiders lost fullback Napoleon McCallum, who is in the 
hospital after dislocating his right knee on a terrifying collision with 
linebacker Ken Norton Jr in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who scored the Raiders' second touchdown on a one-yard run in the 
second quarter, apparently caught his left foot in the wet grass, causing his 
right leg to buckle under him. At the worst, he could be sidelined for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought that McCallum's injury, which caused a lengthy delay with 7:57 to 
play in the third quarter, might have sunk the Raiders' spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they only trailed, 23-14, at the time, but afterward were 
outscored, 21-0, while gaining only 56 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Show some sensitivity, will you?" Perry said when asked about the effect of 
the injury on team morale. "We're talking about a man getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Good point. Even if the Raiders had been inspired by the injury, apparently 
nothing could have been done to stop a 49er offense intent on allowing Rice to 
break Jim Brown's 29-year-old record. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, who beat Albert Lewis to score on a 69-yard touchdown pass on the fourth 
offensive play of the 49er season, added his final two scores in the fourth 
quarter -- on a 23-yard reverse and a 38-yard pass play, making a leaping catch 
over Lewis with 4:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would be coming out," Rice said. "I was on the phone with my 
receivers coach (Larry Kirksey), and he was bawling me out for a couple of 
things I had done wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'So I'm out, right?' He said, 'No, we're going to give it one more 
shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lewis: "We kept making mistakes. They are obviously a lot sharper than we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 By Rice's final score, the Raiders indeed seemed to be willing participants in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive that eventually clinched the victory, an 80-yard march that began 
late in the third quarter, the Raiders were guilty of three offsides penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Young connected with Brent Jones on an eight-yard touchdown pass with 14:55 to 
play. The extra point gave the 49ers a 30-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 During the remainder of the game, the Raiders lost an interception and a 
fumble while never advancing past the 49ers' 41-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the 49ers waltzed off the field, they had outgained the Raiders, 
448 yards to 181, while outrushing them, 156-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know, because I've been in that offense . . . when the 49ers get it going, 
it's like a machine," Raider tight end Jamie Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 68,032, a record crowd for a 49er game at Candlestick Park thanks to 
some added seats, the 49ers took a 14-0 lead in the first 13 minutes on two of 
Young's four touchdown passes, to Rice and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders fought back to make the score 14-7 on a seven-yard pass from 
Hostetler to Tim Brown early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers took advantage of a 40-yard kick return by Dexter Carter to score 
again five minutes later on Ricky Watters' one-yard run. When rookie Doug Brien 
missed the conversion attempt, the 49ers' lead was 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders rebounded on McCallum's run, but then hurt themselves in the last 
40 seconds of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, they failed to call a timeout and allowed the 49ers to kill 
32 seconds and set up a 33-yard field goal by Brien with three seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Raider kick returners Rocket Ismail and Harvey Williams had 
combined to average 30.6 yards in their previous three returns, Raider fans 
were left to wonder what would have happened if the offense had been given such 
great field position with time to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 23 points at halftime and I remember thinking, 'That's a good defense 
we're playing,' " Young said. "I bet nobody scores 30 points on them all year. 
I'm surprised we scored that many on them." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only one.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; STOKES SAYS HE'LL BE READY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver J.J. Stokes, who did not play after the first series of the 
second half in UCLA's season-opening 25-23 victory over Tennessee, said he will 
be ready to play Saturday against Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, who suffered a thigh bruise as he caught a pass on the game's second 
play Saturday, said it tightened on him. He still caught six passes for 84 
yards as UCLA won its first game in which he did not score since it beat Oregon 
State in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' return is bad news for SMU Coach Tom Rossley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had trouble with J.J. Meadors on Saturday," Rossley said. "Tell me J.J. 
Stokes isn't playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Meadors, of Arkansas, caught five passes for 127 yards and two touchdowns in a 
34-14 victory over the Mustangs. JIM HODGES

 Jimmy Johnson, in his new job as a studio analyst for the Fox Network, didn't 
wait long to needle Cowboy owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Dallas coach predicted that the Cowboys will lose to the Raiders in 
the next Super Bowl, and blames the loss on Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the Raiders and the Cowboys in the Super Bowl. I see it being a tight 
ballgame, with the Cowboys being penalized for having 12 men on the field -- 
the 12th being Jerry Jones -- putting the Raiders in field position, kicking 
the field goal. Raiders win it."

 Trivia time: Since the creation of the Heisman Trophy in 1935, only five ends, 
wide receivers or flankers have won the award. Can you identify them?

 Raider hater: Gary Plummer, San Francisco 49ers' linebacker and a native of 
Fremont, Calif., said he grew up hating the Raiders.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just never liked them" Plummer told Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun. 
"(George) Atkinson and (Jack) Tatum and those guys. They had cheap shots going 
on back then and the guys they have now have tried to mold themselves after 
that."

 Overkill: At halftime of a 1916 game against Cumberland, Georgia Tech Coach 
John Heisman reportedly told his players: "You can't tell what those Cumberland 
players have up their sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech led, 126-0, and went on to win, 222-0.

 Dangerous weapon: Senior PGA Tour player Dave Stockton on his golf game, as 
told to Dan Barreiro of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis:

<P>
 "My strengths are my mental ability and my putting. I'm not a big driver and I 
can't pound 'em into the ground, but nobody is going to be very confident 
against me if I have a putter in my hand."

 Clip and save: A harsh analysis of the AFC West race by Bernie Lincicome of 
the Chicago Tribune: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that Howie Long is retired, the Raiders no longer have any players who 
were in Oakland, though their manners are the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego is the NFL's best-kept secret. John Elway has a whole bunch of new 
Broncos to drop his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seahawks don't have a dome to pity in. Without Joe Montana, the Chiefs 
are dust mites and Montana will not make it to October."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; CARTER PROVIDES ANOTHER CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After surviving the challenge of Washington's Napoleon Kaufman in its opener, 
USC's defense will face another Saturday against Penn State at State College, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 While USC "limited" the explosive Kaufman to 156 yards rushing, with a longest 
run of 21 yards, in a 24-17 victory, Penn State junior Ki-Jana Carter ran for 
210 yards and three touchdowns in a 56-3 victory over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Carter's runs went for 80 and 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, in a 21-20 victory over USC, Carter carried 21 times for 104 
yards, with a longest run of 15 yards. On a day when the Trojans rushed for 
only 34 yards, the 5-foot-10, 212-pounder from Westerville, Ohio, was part of a 
Penn State offense that ran for 282 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter gained 1,026 yards last season, becoming Penn State's first 1,000-yard 
rusher since Blair Thomas in 1989. EARL GUSTKEY

BY NAVY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy offensive coordinator Greg Briner was fired in the aftermath of the 
Midshipmen's 56-14 season-opening loss to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Chaump said Briner was fired for what he called "philosophical 
differences in running a football program." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State outgained Navy, 503 yards to 232. 
</P>
<P>
 Briner came to the Naval Academy last season after three years at Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Briner helped lead the Thundering Herd to the Division I-AA national 
championship in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Briner was a quarterback and defensive back at USC, where he was a member of a 
team that reached the Rose Bowl in 1969.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the score, that must have been a Super Bowl preview Monday night in 
San Francisco. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What the Raiders ought to do now is switch Rocket Ismail to running back. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 They have more than enough capable wide receivers, but nary a dangerous rusher 
and that made it relatively simple for the 49ers to defend against them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ismail gained 537 yards in 67 carries for an eight-yard average his final 
season at Notre Dame, and averaged 6.1 yards in 70 carries during two seasons 
with Toronto of the Canadian Football League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Were the 49ers guilty of pouring it on when Steve Young threw the touchdown 
pass to Jerry Rice late in the fourth quarter? Maybe, but the Raiders should be 
more upset at themselves for giving the 49ers the opportunity. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There used to be a racehorse named Montana to Clark. Pretty soon, there should 
be one named Young to Rice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raider loss prevented a clean sweep of opening games by the six NFL and 
major college teams in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The ABC pictures were fine and Al Michaels' captions were crisp. But why did 
we have to be subjected to that drawn-out, promotional interview with Craig T. 
Nelson of "Coach" when the 49ers were being assessed a penalty during the 
Raider drive late in the first half? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The new NFL rules favoring the offense are making a difference. Last year, 587 
points were scored in 14 games the first week.This year, 652 were scored. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 I hate to go out on a limb, but Jay Schroeder might not be the answer to the 
Arizona Cardinals' offensive problems. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of the top five passers in yardage Sunday, only Dan Marino's team won. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, all of the top five rushers' teams won. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Teams with new coaches went 2-3, Dallas and the New York Jets winning and 
Arizona, Atlanta and Washington losing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Barry Switzer is off to a fast start with the Cowboys, but it is doubtful that 
he will be able to match his 29-0-1 start at Oklahoma. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Dolphins secondary could use Deion Sanders. So could a lot of 
others. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The way the Colorado Rockies played baseball and the Denver Broncos play 
football, it should be known as Mile High Scoring Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it reassuring to know that even John Elway messes up sometimes under 
pressure? . . . Don't look for first-round draft choices Heath Shuler and Trent 
Dilfer to match the success of 1993 rookie quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe and Rick 
Mirer. Shuler was three for eight for 14 yards in Washington's loss to Seattle 
and Dilfer didn't play in Tampa Bay's loss to Chicago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 New York Jet wide receiver Rob Moore, who isn't supposed to be a guy who can 
play with pain, breaks his left wrist and 22 days later, wearing a soft cast, 
catches five passes for 83 yards against the Buffalo Bills. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fox TV could add Ed O'Neill to its lineup of football experts. O'Neill, who 
plays Al Bundy on "Married With Children" was a linebacker at Youngstown State 
and had a tryout with the Pittsburgh Steelers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I agree with the voters in the Associated Press poll who thought Nebraska's 
bye was more impressive than Florida's 70-21 victory over New Mexico State and 
moved the Cornhuskers to No. 1. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can accuse Notre Dame of stupid scheduling. The Irish played 
Northwestern the week before Saturday's game against Michigan, will have a bye 
before the Florida State game, and will play Air Force the week before the USC 
game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the triathlon to the 2000 Games in Sydney means that some of 
the greatest athletes in the world will be able to compete in the Olympics. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Not to confuse golfers with triathletes, but there's another sport that 
belongs in the Olympics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tennis needs more matches like the one between Andre Agassi and Michael Chang, 
full of spectacular rallies instead of service aces. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It can't be long before Murphy and Luke Jensen appear on the David Letterman 
show. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's baseball menu: The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and Riverside Pilots will 
open a best-of-five series for the California League Southern Division 
championship at Riverside at 7:15 p.m. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I guess all those off-season problems lowered Jason Kidd's Dallas Mavericks 
contract to $60 million. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: Navy fires its offensive coordinator after losing to San Diego 
State, 56-14. Reaction: How safe is the defensive coordinator's job?

<P>
 On the surface, it looks like a rebuilding year for the Cougars. Lots of holes 
being filled with inexperienced players, some up from a 7-3 freshman team. But 
if not dominant, the Cougars will at least be dangerous. MacKenzie makes Patton 
bubble with enthusiasm. MacKenzie is big, strong and fast, three things coaches 
tend to like in a tailback. All he lacks is varsity experience. He has a big 
offensive line to run behind, led by Honeycutt, who was underrated last season. 
Purvis is a solid tight end. The defense has more questions. Grigas is the only 
returning starter. He's good, but he can't be everywhere.

 Trabuco Hills won the Division VIII title last season and now finds itself 
playing in a Division I league. Tough break. The Mustangs probably don't have 
what it takes to challenge for the league championship this season, but they 
should be in the running for a playoff spot. Collins threw for 903 yards and 
seven touchdowns during the regular season, but at the moment Pintsak is the 
starter. "The one thing I will say is we have the best two quarterbacks in the 
(Orange) County," Barnett said. "Our two are better than any other two at any 
school." From there, it gets a little thin. Fobbs is a dangerous receiver. He 
caught 22 passes during the regular season a year ago. Jacobs can open some 
holes, but who will run through them is the question. Harper, Haynes and 
Johnson are in contention. Taylor is the team's best defensive player. Carter 
is good enough that he would have been on the varsity last season if he had 
been old enough.

 Mater Dei went a long way, then ran into a wall. The Monarchs survived plenty 
of controversy early in the season. Tailback sensation Michael Graham left the 
team after three games, transferring to Edison. But the Monarchs still won the 
league title and then clawed their way to the Southern Section Division I 
final. They beat Santa Fe Springs St. Paul, 17-14, in the final minute when 
John Flynn completed two fourth-down passes to Michael-John Rzeznik, the last 
one an eight-yard touchdown pass with 1 minute 6 seconds left. Mater Dei then 
held on to beat Long Beach Poly, 17-14, when the Jackrabbits missed a field 
goal in the final seconds. Mater Dei then survived a cold night in Lancaster, 
beating Antelope Valley, 15-11. The bubble burst in the final, as the Monarchs 
were overwhelmed, 56-3, by Rialto Eisenhower. San Clemente had its finest 
season in more than a decade. The Tritons, league doormats throughout the 
1980s, started stepping on people. They qualified for the playoffs for the 
first time since 1979. San Clemente beat Quartz Hill, 45-21, then lost to 
Encino Crespi, 24-21, in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. Second-place 
Capistrano Valley had another solid season. The Cougars nearly knocked off 
Mater Dei for the league title. They then defeated Los Angeles Loyola, 21-6, in 
the first round, then lost to Eisenhower, 37-19, in the quarterfinals.

 No where to go but up. A year ago, people expected great things from the 
Dolphins. They had, after all, one of the premier quarterbacks in Scott 
Covington, now at Miami. But Dana Hills flopped. A team ranked among the 
county's and Southern Section's top 10 in the preseason polls, failed to score 
in its last three games. Now it is up to Deneke, who had a 6-14 record at 
Encinitas San Dieguito the past two seasons, to pick up the pieces. He doesn't 
have a lot to work with. Maynard moves in at quarterback and has shown some 
ability. He was the team's punter a year ago and will probably be more vital 
kicking the ball than throwing it. Deneke would prefer a power game, but 
doesn't have the offensive line to pull that off. Expect the Dolphins to 
showcase Harrison, getting him the ball as much as possible. He was the 
league's sprint champion. But Harrison did not play football last season, so he 
has not been tested by fire. He had better be quick. Brown is the team's only 
returning offensive lineman. Howard has size, but is untested. Hein is a 
quality linebacker, but has little experience around him. All in all, a 
building season for the Dolphins. But expectations are lower. All they have to 
be is competitive and that, probably, is attainable. Another 1-9 season 
wouldn't be too devastating, a .500 record would be celebrated.

 Denny takes over this program divided. Turmoil has hurt the Diablos for the 
past few seasons. There have been plenty of distractions, from coaches who were 
fired to coaches who were hired, not to mention public disputes about their 
unofficial devil mascot. But hope abounds under Denny, a Mission Viejo 
assistant the past five seasons. Actually, if the off-the-field and 
behind-closed-doors problems are resolved, the Diablos could have a good 
season. Moherman was a find at quarterback. He drove the Diablos to a field 
goal against Mater Dei on his first varsity series. Moherman threw two 
touchdown passes in a 42-0 victory over Dana Hills. Keneley is a force on 
defense. He was a first-team all-league selection a year ago. The offense and 
defensive lines are solid, but skill position players lack experience. 
Somewhere, the Diablos must find a running game. But compared to the program's 
past woes, that should be child's play.

 San Clemente is coming off its best season in more than a decade, finishing 
third and reaching the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals. But the 
Tritons will find it difficult to match that success. They won't, however, slip 
back into the abyss. Samperi is one of the top linemen in the county. He leads 
a solid offensive line. What quarterback they will protect is a question. Smith 
saw some time off the bench last season. Carlin is a transfer from Del Mar 
Torrey Pines. Two others wait in the wings. Whoever it is will have good 
receivers as targets. Cheyenne Dixon is a great name, but can he run? The 
defense has Karns and Frith up front, but there are elephant-size holes to 
fill.

<P>
 All the scoring came in the final 15 minutes. Stanford took the lead, 3-2, 
when Carmen D'Onofrio scored on a free kick in the 86th minute. The Titans' 
Joey Franchino had a chance to tie it, but his shot hit the side post just 
before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Collins had two goals for Stanford, the second coming in the 77th minute 
and putting the Cardinal ahead, 2-1. Fullerton's Brad Wilson tied it about 
seven minutes later. Adrian Cortes scored the other Fullerton goal.

 The Cardinals signed Jay Schroeder, picking up a third quarterback who went to 
the Super Bowl with another team. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room, the club released quarterback Shawn Moore, who was signed two 
weeks ago after Denver waived him. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder moved into the No. 3 spot, behind Steve Beuerlein and Jim McMahon. 
Although he started 91 of 109 games with the Washington Redskins, the Raiders 
and Cincinnati, Schroeder said he wouldn't lobby for Beuerlein's starting spot.

 Six days before the NFL's most celebrated reunion, Joe Montana admitted Monday 
that he has not spoken to Steve Young since Montana left the 49ers after the 
1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He also did not deny that tension existed between the two quarterbacks during 
Montana's last season in San Francisco, when he was sidelined because of an 
elbow injury while Young established himself as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime somebody has something that you want, if there is not tension there, 
then you will be on the second team all of your life," Montana said. "I think 
there has to be tension there." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana and Kansas City will play host to the 49ers on Sunday. It will be the 
first time Montana has faced his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a fun and interesting experience," Montana said. "I'll be doing 
something I never imagined I'd have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana said he would have stayed with the 49ers if they had offered him a 
chance to compete with Young for the starting job in 1993. Even though he was 
named the starter shortly before he agreed to a trade with the Chiefs, Montana 
said he was only being paid lip service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want anything given to me," he said. "All I really wanted and asked 
for was fair competition. But they weren't going to open it to competition, 
period."

 San Diego Chargers Coach Bobby Ross said the team hasn't decided what it will 
do with safety James Fuller, who was arrested early Saturday for investigation 
of assault with a deadly weapon. He did not make the trip to Denver for 
Sunday's game. . . . Bronco tight end Shannon Sharpe sprained his right knee in 
the game end could be sidelined up to four weeks. . . . Houston Oilers 
quarterback Cody Carlson, who sustained a second-degree separation of his left, 
non-throwing -- shoulder, said the shoulder was sore Monday but he doesn't know 
whether he'll play Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys. . . . Fox's overnight 
rating for its first Sunday of regular-season NFL coverage was 18% higher than 
CBS' rating for the first weekend of the 1993 season. . . . Safety George 
Teague, who had two interceptions Sunday in the Green Bay Packers' 16-10 
victory over the Minnesota Vikings, broke his right thumb but said he won't

sidelined three to four weeks because of a sprained big toe on his right foot.

 Former Detroit Tiger and Dodgers pitcher Hank Aguirre, who moved from baseball 
to the auto industry where he created jobs for hundreds of Latinos, died of 
prostate cancer at his home in Bloomfield, Mich. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, a three-time All-Star who grew up in Azuza, began an auto parts 
manufacturing company called Mexican Industries, and employed 800 Latino 
workers from southwestern Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre was 75-72 with a 3.25 earned-run average in 16 years. His best season 
was 1962, when he had a 16-8 record and a league-leading 2.21 ERA for the 
Tigers. 
</P>

DEL MAR; OCEAN CREST WINS EVENLY MATCHED DEL MAR DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conventional thinking was that a stampede known as the Del Mar Derby could 
be won by anyone. That thinking proved correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Crest, a provisional entry who went off at 11-1, led from wire to wire 
over an evenly matched field. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner's game plan for the $300,000 race for 3-year-olds over 1 1/8 miles 
on the turf was to lay off the lead and see what developed. That was the way 
trainer Frank Brothers designed it, but that was not the way jockey Laffit 
Pincay Jr. saw it unfolding. Ocean Crest wanted the lead, Pincay gave it to him 
and they never gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Crest was a horse without a stakes victory running against veterans of 
graded-stakes victories such as Numerous, Unfinished Symph, Powis Castle, 
Bluegrass Prince, You and I and Eagle Eyed. He was invited only because another 
invitee refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors seemed confused about this array of stars, betting 8-1 Numerous down 
to 4-1, dragging 12-1 You and I down to 7-2 and sending Marvin's Faith, upset 
winner of the La Jolla Handicap, off as a longshot once again at 20-1. Ocean 
Crest had opened at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ocean Crest went to the front with Pollock's Luck off his right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to lay off about third," Pincay said, "but he broke sharply and 
got onto an easy lead. He was still on the lead easy on the second turn. He was 
on the rail and saving ground and I just decided to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 The pack was coming, however, bumping and jostling and trying to get at the 
leader. Some of the bumping caused the favorite, Eagle Eyed, already fractious 
at the starting gate, to be disqualified and dropped from third to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfinished Symph, a 6-1 choice being ridden by Martin Pedroza because of the 
broken ribs suffered Saturday by Gary Baze, got up for second place. Powis 
Castle was moved up from fourth to third when Eagle Eyed was disqualified. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Exalto, a lightly raced 3-year-old from the barn of Neil Drysdale, rallied 
under Chris McCarron to win the $60,000 Relaunch, a 1 1/16th-mile race on the 
turf for 3-year-olds and up. He had never run in a stakes race, going one-two 
in two maiden races and one-three in two allowance races. Regardless, he went 
off as the 3-2 favorite and paid $5. The pace in this race was, as expected, 
set by Makinanhonestbuck and A Treek for Roses, who led the others by eight and 
nine lengths down the backstretch. The surprise was that Fumo Di Londra, a Del 
Mar Derby invitee, was not with them. He abandoned his front-running style, 
jockey Alex Solis taking him back at the start. When McCarron called upon 
Exalto entering the far turn, Sharp Phase and Patrick Valenzuela came with him 
but were not as strategically placed. Sharp Phase ended up beaten by 2 3/4 
lengths and Fumo Di Londra finished third another 1 1/4 lengths back. The 
Relaunch -- and Exalto -- proved that horses stepping up in class are 
preferable to those stepping down. . . . Mr. and Mrs. Martin J. Wygod's entry 
of Profit Margin and Strategic Alliance was too much, in the $55,000 I'm Smokin 
for Cal-bred 2-year-olds over six furlongs. Profit Margin, ridden by Chris 
Antley, set the pace from a few yards out of the gate and won by a half-length 
over his teammate, who took the opposite approach and came stretch-running from 
last under Valenzuela. Strategic Alliance got up for second in spite of 
bouncing off the rail during the stretch run. The entry paid $2.80 to win. 
Profit Margin's previous victory was in a maiden race on Aug. 13. A day 
earlier, Strategic Alliance had won a maiden race by 11 lengths, pulling away 
down the stretch. The duo figured to have the best of it, but did not exactly 
overwhelm the field. Strategic Alliance was a nose ahead of third-place 
finisher Bienfeo, well-placed by Solis, and little more than a half-length 
ahead of Fandarel Dancer, who pressed Profit Margin throughout. . . . Weight 
assignments for Sunday's Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap are a bit 
deceiving. Kingdom Found, the San Diego Handicap winner, and Lykatill Hil are 
listed at the high weight of 118 pounds. However, Brocco, unraced since the 
Kentucky Derby, is listed at 117. Since 3-year-olds get a five-pound allowance, 
his weighting is theoretically at 122. D'hallevant, the Pat O'Brien Handicap 
winner, is also at 117. . . . Journalism, the post time favorite, won the San 
Francisco Handicap at Bay Meadows in the last race of the National Best Seven.

 A small Oregon company has shipped an entire food-processing plant to China. 
Some assembly is required.  
</P>
<P>
 Tech-Mark Inc. President Gildo Martini said his company made a $1.2-million 
dollar deal to sell a ready-to-operate, 7,400-square-foot meat-processing plant 
to a buyer in China.He refused to release the name of the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech-Mark's manufacturing division will provide the cooking ovens, food 
dryers, steam cabinets and smokehouses.  
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. manufacturers, working with Tech-Mark, will provide additional 
processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said he sees a wide-open market, at least now, for this kind of 
business opportunity in less technologically advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a growing market that will keep blossoming for years," he said. 
"There is a tremendous need for our equipment in developing countries."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; JOHN HENRY FRIENDS MAKE TIME FOR TEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were finger sandwiches, scones and fine china, yet it was no ordinary 
tea that drew 125 people to the Santa Ana Country Club on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the John Henry Foundation in Garden Grove, which helps the 
mentally ill, were the guests, and many spoke of loved ones who had been 
devastated by schizophrenia or other serious mental disorders. The 
$25-per-person tea raised about $1,500 for the foundation. Tea and Sympathy 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, this was a traditional afternoon tea. Each table was set by a 
hostess who brought in her china and centerpieces that ranged from vases filled 
with purple irises to stuffed bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests filled their plates from a buffet stocked with finger sandwiches, 
scones, chocolate-dipped strawberries and other treats. While they ate and 
drank tea, models wandered among the tables sporting the latest fashions from 
the Dresser and Michael Nusskern in Fullerton and Audrey Jones in the Brea 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these guests had been drawn together by a serious and often ignored 
problem: the plight of the mentally ill. Many, like event chairwoman Pat 
Malmister, had family members who suffered from a mental illness. Malmister has 
a 37-year-old stepson, Kenneth, who is schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, it's pure hell," Malmister said. "This foundation was the first 
that's been able to help my son. He lives in a foundation home, and he's able 
to function on his own. It's given my husband a lot of hope." Invisible People 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Massimino, founder and president of the foundation, started the group 
four years ago. A psychiatrist, he felt the mentally ill were being neglected 
and ignored by society. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was named after a fictional character in a folk song who overcame 
tremendous obstacles ("John Henry, he could hammer . . . "). 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we were the ugliest of all causes, we needed to be identified with 
someone who could overcome all odds," Massimino said. "Our mission is to 
improve the quality of their life." 
</P>
<P>
 To reach that goal, the foundation offers affordable housing, employment, 
friendship and financial planning to the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have all of those in place you can't have a better life," 
Massimino said. The group owns seven private residences that provide permanent 
low-income housing as well as businesses that offer employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Anderson, 40, attended the tea and told how the organization has helped 
her in her battle schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of (the foundation and Massimino), I've come to this point where I'm 
functioning normally. With medication and talk therapy with my doctor, I hope 
to go back to work as a nutritionist and have a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's major fund-raiser, a black-tie Monte Carlo night, will be at 
John and Donna Crean's Santa Ana Heights estate Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attending the tea included Faith Sloyer, Carol Montsinger, Rosemarie 
Lomeli, Pam Fitch, Leah Kazarian, Rosalie Viera, Candace Leasure, Kathleen 
Nolan, Beth Massimino, Marianne Shearer and Debbie Bolduc. KATHRYN BOLD

COUNTY'S JEWS MARK START OF THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proclaiming a time for awakening and remembrance, Ventura County's growing 
Jewish community marked the start of High Holy Days on Monday night with the 
celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 Jews filled Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks for Rosh Hashanah 
services that spilled over into the neighboring United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds came to Temple Beth Torah in Ventura to hear readings from the 
biblical book of Genesis and trumpeting blasts from the shofar, a ram's horn 
blown to reawaken Jews to their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura County's newest Jewish congregations celebrated Rosh Hashanah and 
the establishing of their new synagogues this summer in Ojai and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are a time for 
Jews to reflect on their lives and renew their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of addressing the modern dilemma we have with time," said Rabbi 
Michael Berk, who leads Temple Beth Torah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraging people to look at time differently, to not feel that every 
moment has to be filled with activity -- time becomes very oppressive for us 
otherwise -- but rather to look at the quality of that time," Berk said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony planned for today at Marina Beach in Ventura, Berk said he and 
fellow synagogue members will throw bread crumbs into the ocean, symbolically 
casting away their sins. 
</P>
<P>
 During holy days, Jews may also go to visit relatives' graves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time where, if you take it seriously, you think about your mortality," 
Berk added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Shimon Paskow said Rosh Hashanah strikes three spiritual chords for 
Jews. It celebrates the sovereignty of God, calls them to lead a moral life, 
and asks God "to remember us for a good year of life and health." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai and Camarillo, Ventura County's newest Jewish communities are 
preparing to celebrate Rosh Hashanah for the first time in congregations formed 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Cindy Wolfsohn's dining room in Camarillo had served as a 
Hebrew school for her children and those in 10 other families. Then they began 
holding Sabbath services together, led by student rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 This year they took the plunge, Wolfsohn said.  
</P>
<P>
 The families rented a 2,500-square-foot building on Flynn Road and asked 
Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles to send their favorite student rabbi to 
serve the fledgling synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real exciting time for us, because not only is it the Jewish new year, 
but it's the beginning for our organization," she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Student rabbi Allison Flash said she, too, is excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great time to get a congregation started," Flash said. "I want 
to create an environment where people feel welcomed . . . where people feel 
like they want to continue their relationship with this congregation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, many Jews who felt disaffected by mainstream Judaism had been 
gathering informally in each other's homes for events such as Hanukkah and 
Passover, said David Feigin, a founder of the Ojai Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year they decided to get serious about building their own community. 
</P>
<P>
 They pooled their money to buy a tiny 115-seat building in Meiners Oaks that 
once housed the Church of Christ. And they phoned Hebrew Union College, which 
assigned them student rabbi Peter Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us grew up with our religious experience being more or less empty and 
foreign to us. We wanted to make (the center) whatever everyone wanted it to 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of building a new community from scratch is thrilling, Feigin 
said. "There's only one first time, so we're excited about that," he said. "The 
most important thing for people to know is we're doing things with an open and 
tolerant approach, so that everything we do will have meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Student rabbi Lee said he, too, is eager to see the community give shape to 
its open format, from the structure of services to the text of their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we have a lot of freedom to explore the type of worship and 
community and education and camaraderie," Lee said. "Since there's nothing in 
place, we're really starting from zero . . .. We're not starting with any 
preconceived notions of what the community should be like."

OJAI CITY COUNCIL ASKED TO BUILD SKATEBOARD PARK; RECREATION: POPULARITY OF A 
BACK-YARD RAMP PROMPTS YOUTHS AND PARENTS TO URGE CITY TO FUND A PUBLIC 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost five months, 15-year-old Jake Frost and his friends labored as much 
as six hours a day to build a 25-foot-long wooden skateboard ramp in his 
family's back yard in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The five teen-agers, working about two days a week, finished the ramp in 
December, despite a neighbor's written complaint to Ojai officials that noise 
from skateboarders using the ramp would shatter the neighborhood's calm. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jake and his buddies, however, the five-foot-high ramp provides a far 
better place than the streets to careen off walls and perform daring aerial 
maneuvers and other tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to skate," explained one of Jake's friends, Juan Barraza, 16. "And 
there's really nothing for us to do out here." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sentiment shared by more than Jake and his tight-knit circle of 
sidewalk surfers.  
</P>
<P>
 As many as 15 kids at a time started showing up at the Frost house to do airs, 
plants and grinds -- some coming from as far as Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Jake's mother, Kathy, is leading a group of neighbors and parents to 
request that Ojai build a public skateboard park that would lure some of the 
skateboarders away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather the city do it because it's too a big of a facility for a 
neighborhood to sustain," Kathy Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost has even offered to donate the back-yard ramp to the city -- under 
protests by Jake and his friends. But the city informed her that Ojai lacks the 
funds to move or maintain the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost and other parents say Ojai teen-agers need more places for recreation. 
And teen-agers agree: A youth representative to Ojai's Parks and Recreation 
Commission who surveyed the city's teen-agers said they ranked a skateboarding 
park No. 1 on their wish list. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, some proponents of a skateboarding facility argue, it's time to 
get the speedsters away from customers shopping downtown at the Arcade, off the 
streets -- and out of Jake's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed -- in concept. 
</P>
<P>
 At a packed council meeting last month, Kathy Frost joined about 40 
skateboarders and several of their parents in helping to lobby for approval of 
a public park for skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Casey Murphey, 16, offered to help design a facility and keep 
it in good condition. "We really have nowhere to go . . .. The bowling alley is 
going to be closed down -- that's the only other recreation I can think of."  
</P>
<P>
 Skaters and parents also noted that many other cities in California -- 
including Camarillo -- provide safe and widely used facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of possible lawsuits the city could face if youngsters are injured 
skateboarding in a public facility is not a problem, Parks Commissioner Craig 
Walker told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law protects owners of recreational property in injury lawsuits as 
long as safety signs are posted, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said a skateboard park may range in size from the area of a tennis 
court to about one-third of an acre, and can cost from $16,000 
</P>
<P>
 to $100,000. City officials have said community money would have to be raised 
to pay for a skateboard facility, if one is given final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But detractors have argued that skating is a fad and the city should be wary 
of investing time and effort into such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously approving the concept of a skateboarding park, the council 
instructed a task force of merchants, skateboarders and city and school 
officials to report back to them on possible locations for the facility, and 
how money could be raised for its construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers at the meeting suggested converting an unused portion of 
Ojai's Park and Ride lot for the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary research indicates there is plenty of community support for a 
skateboard park, said Carol Belser, the city's director of recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Belser said, the Parks and Recreation Commission surveyed two 
local schools. At Matilija Junior High, 46% of those surveyed said they would 
regularly use a skateboard facility. And at Nordhoff High School, that number 
was 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 And a separate questionnaire sent to local merchants and adult residents 
yielded 174 favorable responses and only two unfavorable replies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the city makes a final decision, the ramp at the Frost home continues to 
draw local skaters, although the numbers have dropped off in the last few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the ramp's popularity, Frost said, skateboarders flocking to 
use it created parking problems on her four-house cul-de-sac and occasionally 
disrupted mail delivery and trash pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Barraza said some days a crowd would collect to watch the skaters perform 
their high-flying maneuvers. "There would be five guys on one side waiting to 
skate, five on the other side, and about five guys watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said she has taken pains to keep the problems to a minimum, making sure 
skaters don't drink alcohol or play loud music and that they leave by dark. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year, after she got a letter from a neighbor expressing concern about 
the ramp, the teen-age builders placed carpet padding under the wood and relaid 
its Masonite surface to help deaden sound. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ojai building official has inspected the ramp and said it meets city 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighbors say the ramp is a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're driving us crazy," said Tiba Willner, 88. "It was so noisy and it 
kept going on in the late afternoon and the early evening . . . I'm a stroke 
victim and I need rest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Willner agreed with the need for a public skateboarding facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think any activity that keeps kids out of the street is fine," Willner 
said. "But it should be in the park, and it should not be in the residential 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 2 1/2 years, Frost, 43, has taken in several troubled friends of 
her son, feeding and housing them for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she originally supported building the ramp as a way to help her son 
and other youths who come from troubled backgrounds or broken homes. "I think 
these kids are used to quitting or giving up," she said. But building the ramp 
"they couldn't quit. It was a project that, if they wanted to use it, they had 
to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 And skateboarding, Frost said, is invaluable for troubled "lost boys" who 
don't play team sports, yet need an athletic outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It releases a lot of their aggression and anger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his hard work helping to build the ramp at the Frosts' house, Juan 
said he'd still like to see the city build a public skateboard ramp. The 
back-yard ramp is getting worn down by Ventura kids, Juan complained, who fly 
so far off the ramp that their skateboards crack the Masonite when they land. 
</P>
<P>
 A public skating park "would be cool," he said. "I'd skate it."

WILDLIFE, DEBATE FLOURISHING AT ORMOND BEACH; ENVIRONMENT: ENDANGERED SPECIES 
ARE RE-EMERGING AT LAGOON SINCE THE COUNTY LEFT INTACT A SANDBAR THAT IN 
PREVIOUS YEARS HAS BEEN BULLDOZED. BUT FLOODED LANDOWNERS SAY THE AREA SHOULD 
BE DRAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California least terns and other rare and endangered wildlife have returned to 
a natural lagoon at Ormond Beach in Oxnard in numbers biologists and 
environmentalists have not seen for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-emergence of the terns, snowy plovers, brown pelicans and other 
shorebirds comes after environmentalists and regulatory agencies persuaded 
Ventura County officials to suspend their annual practice of bulldozing an 
outlet to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 No outlet will be cut this year until after the season's fledglings have left 
their nests in mid-October, according to an agreement reached with Ventura 
County Flood Control Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lagoon now encompasses several acres and has flooded or threatened 
nearby private property, and landowners are growing impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co., a developer that wants to build 5,000 homes in the beach 
area, started pumping water to alleviate some of the flooding on the company's 
property last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, which has threatened to sue Flood Control, contends the flooding 
constitutes a condemnation of its land. 
</P>
<P>
 Another adjacent landowner, Halaco Engineering, has written Flood Control with 
worries that rising waters might flood its electrical facilities. In addition, 
county mosquito abatement officials are pressuring the Flood Control Department 
to take action now to open the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood Control has proposed installing its own set of pumps and pipes to lower 
the water level by two feet, an interim measure that will be discussed today by 
regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole scenario worries environmentalists, including Roma Armbrust of 
the Ormond Beach Observers, who fear Flood Control or Baldwin will completely 
drain the lagoon, now or in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, as Armbrust walked on the beach under a lightly misting 
sky, least terns protested the intruder by taking to the air and emitting 
short, high-pitched beeps while snowy plovers and sandpipers scurried along at 
the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Great and snowy egrets swept their spindly black legs behind them and 
straightened their crooked necks as they launched into graceful flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it beautiful?" Armbrust said. "I wish it could stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Her desire is yet to be addressed, as Flood Control, mosquito abatement and 
the regulatory agencies grapple over how to handle the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosquito abatement officials in the county's Environmental Health Department 
have asked Flood Control to drain or reduce the water level in the lagoon to 
control insect breeding, which representatives say has soared to 10 times its 
normal rate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as drainage ditches from the city of Oxnard and the Bubbling 
Springs Creek continue to empty water into the area with no outlet to the sea, 
a canal near Halaco Engineering is reaching the top of its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Halaco, which melts down aluminum cans for recycling, has written to Flood 
Control suggesting that the high waters may cause a safety hazard or even death 
to workers if its facilities are inundated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have high voltage down here," said Halaco plant manager Dave Gable. "I 
sympathize with Flood Control having to comply with other agreements, but we 
have to be concerned about the safety of our people here and the fact that 
flooding could put us out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although once a natural drain for runoff from the Oxnard Plain, the lagoon at 
Ormond Beach now collects water from gutters and farmland through concrete 
canals built by Flood Control. The city of Port Hueneme's Bubbling Springs 
Creek also drains into the wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 The wetland, which supports myriad wildlife, is home to six endangered 
species, including five shorebirds and, recently, the endangered tidewater goby 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Flood Control finds itself in a dilemma, with businesses asking 
the county to do what it has historically done and open the lagoon, and 
regulatory agencies and environmentalists pushing it to leave the lagoon 
intact, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is looking at us to do something," said Alex Sheydayi, deputy 
director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood Control is proposing to pump some of the water out of the lagoon to 
lower the level to 4.25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But for long-term solutions, the department has commissioned a study to 
evaluate the best way to handle the problem. The study will look at whether the 
sandbar should be breached, whether pumps could be permanently installed to 
partly drain the lagoon or if there is some other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armbrust, whose group acts as a watchdog for the beach, finds the study 
suspect from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Impact Sciences, the firm hired by Flood Control to perform the study, is also 
writing a study for the city of Oxnard on the environmental impacts of the 
houses and commercial development Baldwin wants to build at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a conflict of interest," Armbrust said. "We have a developer who wants 
to develop the land on which the runoff is occurring. It would have been much 
more prudent for Flood Control to have chosen a firm that was not dealing with 
an active participant in the development." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi said Impact Sciences was hired because it had done so much work in 
the area.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take advantage of all the information they already have," he 
said. "And these are professional people." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Phillips, coastal biologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
said the report will be evaluated by the agencies on its merits and scientific 
methods. The firm selected is not an issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She welcomed the study as a means to learn more about the water flow and 
habitat of the area so the regulatory agencies could make a well-informed 
decision on what to do with the lagoon, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is (that) right now we don't know exactly what the effects 
(of the flooding and draining) are because the hydrology of the area has been 
so altered over the years by farming runoff and Flood Control," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut an outlet to the sea would completely drain the lagoon and very likely 
reduce the populations of birds and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there something short of an out-and-out breach that would still let them 
do what they need to do for (flood control and mosquito abatement)? That's what 
we hope the study will tell us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin officials say, however, they want action now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the county to stop flooding our property," said Nick Gorely, senior 
vice president at Baldwin. "It's our property and it's being damaged. 
Historically, Flood Control has breached the sandbar." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin started pumping last week, he said, because the need to alleviate the 
problem was urgent. He said the flooding prohibited access to the property, 
which remains vacant while the city of Oxnard develops a plan for the area and 
studies environmental impacts of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 40 acres of their property is under water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clear taking-of-land issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baldwin officials knew the property was subject to periodic flooding when 
they purchased the land, said Morgan Boucke, wildlife biologist with the 
California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be 40 acres of land that is flooded, but there are more than 30 
acres of their land that has been under water all summer long," she said. "It's 
a wetland, and Baldwin was told that when they bought the land." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, the area is shown as a wetland on maps dating back to the 
1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sandbar builds up every year as the summer tides are lower and the wave 
current is not as strong and there is not much water from rainfall coming in," 
she said. "The only difference is that they have always gone in and popped it 
whenever they wanted and they haven't done that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sheydayi acknowledges that Flood Control has historically drained the 
area to prevent flooding and that there is mounting pressure to take some 
action, he also agreed that the area was a natural drain for the Oxnard Plain 
long before Flood Control built its channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The channels are our facilities, but I'm not sure we're really responsible" 
for the flooding, he said. "The problem down there is in some respects a 
natural process."

 The study now under way should solve the problem for future years, he said. He 
said the consultant has finished collecting information and that Flood Control 
will consult with the regulatory agencies to try to come up with a solution. A 
final report with proposed solutions is expected next year.  
</P>
<P>
 But what is really needed in the area, said Fish and Wildlife's Phillips, is a 
comprehensive conservation plan for the entire Ormond Beach. That plan would 
analyze the impacts of all the activities at the beach, one of the last 
wetlands in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few coastal wetland systems left in California and one of the 
very few with a variety of habitats, including the dunes, the uplands, beaches 
and wetlands," Phillips said. "So it is a real important area just by scarcity 
alone."

NEW DAY ON CAMPUS; UNIFORMS, BUS FEES JUST SOME OF THE CHANGES FACING STUDENTS

 Five-year-old Nichelle O'Brien glanced quizzically at her new plaid jumper as 
her mother pulled the stiff blue and gray uniform over her kindergartner-size 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little long," she said. "But I have to grow into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle and her 625 schoolmates at Garden Grove School in Simi Valley will 
adjust to the fit of new uniforms this school year as their elementary campus 
launches a voluntary uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove is the only school in Ventura County taking advantage of a new 
state law allowing uniforms in public schools, but it's not the only campus 
that will confront dramatic changes as the new school year begins this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the uniforms at Garden Grove, Simi Valley schools face another first: 
Parents will be required to pay for school busing -- a charge the district was 
forced to impose to make up a financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District, special-education 
students at two schools will share classes with mainstream students for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Thousand Oaks sixth-graders will enter middle school classrooms Thursday 
for the first time since Colina Middle School -- formerly Colina Intermediate 
-- adopted a reconfiguration plan for grades six, seven and eight in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Moorpark, hundreds of students will attend classes at the new Mesa 
Verde Middle School campus, which will help relieve overcrowding at Chaparral 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think change is accelerating in our schools," Ventura County Supt. of 
Schools Charles Weis said. "People are trying to get our schools ready for the 
21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most visual changes in the county will be apparent Thursday, when 
the majority of Garden Grove School students arrive for the first day of school 
in blue pants or skirts and white tops embossed with the school logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other Ventura County schools have established strict dress codes 
forbidding baggy, oversized clothing, Garden Grove is the first school to 
establish a uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope the common attire will allow students to focus more on 
academics and less on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children want to have uniforms on," Principal Elroy Peterson said. "They want 
to identify what school they go to and show pride in the way they look." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were able to buy the uniforms, which include shorts, culottes, 
sweaters and knit shirts, at Target and JCPenny, but also at the school, where 
a uniform supply company held three summer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting on campus for her mother to buy her new blue and white outfits last 
week, 7-year-old Jessica Moss said now she won't fight with her mother over 
what to wear to school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to wear a uniform because before I would say, 'I want to wear these 
clothes,' and then I'd say, 'No, I want to wear these clothes,' " the 
second-grader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica's mother, Joan Moss, is equally relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty easy, you either wear the pants or the skirt," she said. "I 
think most parents think it is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said the uniforms are also cheaper than buying new school clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually spend $300 to $350," she said. "This year I spent about $150 so the 
cost is less." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for Garden Grove's uniforms range from $33 for a girls' plaid jumper to 
$12 for a knit-collared shirt. Boys' twill pants cost between $16.50 to $22.50, 
depending on size, and girls' and boys' shorts vary in price from $15.50 to 
$20.50. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the school's parents have already bought uniforms for the start 
of the school year, Vice Principal Judy Cannings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who do not wear uniforms are required to adhere to the school's dress 
code, which states that students must wear collared or crew-necked shirts 
tucked in at the waist, and properly fitting pants or shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code also prohibits hats, tank tops, sweat pants and disruptive 
hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
 While some parents have complained that Garden Grove's dress code is as 
restrictive as the uniform policy, the school's tough rules were supported 
recently by a new state law permitting school districts to require students to 
wear uniforms. The law, which Gov. Pete Wilson signed last month, takes effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our society is changing, and that is one of the changes for the 
better," Cannings said, adding that other Ventura County schools may decide to 
follow Garden Grove's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think other schools in Ventura County are looking at us," she 
said. "I don't know if we are part of a trend, but we are being watched." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito of the Ventura Unified School District has instructed his 
25 principals to form task forces to investigate whether families would welcome 
dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change in the Simi Valley Unified School District stirring debate is 
the district's new policy on bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with cutting $2.5 million to balance the district's $77.1-million 
budget, the school board decided earlier this year to adopt a "transportation 
user's fee" beginning with the 1994-95 school year. Conejo Valley Unified, the 
only other Ventura County school district to charge for school busing, began 
imposing fees two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Thursday, Simi Valley students must present a credit card-sized 
plastic pass to ride the bus to school. The passes cost $300 a year or $150 a 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy has not been well received, district officials said. Based on 
the number of bus passes sold, transportation director Frank Smith said school 
ridership is down about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to many districts (that charge for busing); it usually starts 
out low and increases," Smith said. "I think most people when you have to put 
additional money out of your pocket are going to be upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley parent Stella Kenton, who refused to pay for school busing, said 
her daughter will walk home from Berylwood School this year -- a two-mile hike 
for the fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a lot of people are going to let their kids walk just as we are 
doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they intend to study whether more students walk than take 
a bus because of the fees, and whether more crossing guards might be needed. 
But they said they have no immediate plans to increase the number of crossing 
guards. The city now has 22 guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got a request this week from the school district for six new guards," 
said Diane Jones, the city's environmental services director. "But what is 
important for people to realize is that we don't have any history at this 
point. Once school has started, we have to wait for patterns to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the city's study will probably begin in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Stella Kenton worries that her daughter and other children 
who walk to and from school will be endangered as they try to cross busy 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand that (the district) has a money problem," she said. "(But) 
it seems like they are not working for the kids." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley, three schools have changes for the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks special-education students, who previously attended classes 
limited to children with disabilities, will now be integrated into classes at 
Park Oaks and Maple elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program will allow about 15 students, most of whom have multiple 
learning disabilities, to enroll in some regular classes rather than be bused 
to one of the district's seven campuses that enroll special-education students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago, special-education people and kids were isolated away from 
the world," said Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry C. Gross, a former special-education 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gradually moved away from isolation to what we call normalization or 
mainstreaming," he said. "The idea is that these youngsters and adults should 
be put into environments with normalcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley schools already integrate special-education students with other 
pupils for at least part of the school day, but until this year Park Oaks and 
Maple schools did not have the facilities or staff to accept students with 
special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really trying to get them back to their neighborhood home-school 
environments rather than transporting them all over town," Maple Elementary 
School Principal Marilyn Bayles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators at Maple in Newbury Park plan to ease their six special-education 
students into the new school setting over time, Bayles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pupils will spend most of their school day at a "learning center" with a 
teaching specialist and an aide. But they will participate in regular physical 
education classes, library hours and recesses with other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first year, we are proceeding on a slow basis," she said. "We are 
really starting at ground level and building." 
</P>
<P>
 Bayles said the gradual integration of special-education students will benefit 
all of Maple Elementary's schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger they learn to accept differences in other people the better off 
we are going to be," Bayles said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Colina Middle School in Thousand Oaks, educators are bracing for 144 new 
sixth-graders to join students at the former seventh- and eighth-grade campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We arranged a block of four rooms for them and lockers," Principal Michael 
Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colina students and parents supported the change to create Conejo Valley 
Unified's first middle school campus last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by state educators have concluded that the middle school configuration 
offers a better educational environment for children and adolescents than 
junior high schools, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, junior high has been just that . . . a replica of the high 
school," Gross said. "They need a transition program that bridges being a child 
and an adolescent." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the three years, I don't believe you have as much time to make that 
transition," he said. "All the best judgments of educators say this is the best 
configuration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes at the elementary and middle school levels in Thousand 
Oaks, returning high school students said they see nothing new about going back 
to school this week. "I think it is mostly the same, but you see a lot of new 
faces," said Andy Clarke, a Westlake High School junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High School 12th-grader Theresa Nguyen said she was eager to 
start her final year of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," the 16-year-old said. "It's my senior year and I want to get it 
over with and get to college."  
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High registrar Brenda Rini has worked in the Thousand Oaks school 
system for 25 years at every grade level. And each year, she said, the first 
day of school conjures up memories of her own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something new every day when you meet these young people," Rini 
said. "But it takes you back."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR 'DAY OF THE DEAD'

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Inlakech Theater Company, an Oxnard-based arts group, and the city of 
Ventura will sponsor a series of activities this fall to celebrate Dia de los 
Muertos, or Day of the Dead, a traditional Latin American festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition has it that on Dia de los Muertos, the dead are allowed to leave 
their land, Mictlan, and return to the homes they once knew, "to their beloved 
ones who are calling them and asking them to come back," said Javier Gomez, the 
Inlakech artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a holiday where you find communion with the people who have meant 
something to you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of the celebration is not how people died, but how they lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Sept. 17, on each Saturday for five weeks in a row, area residents 
can attend free workshops at the West Harrison Community Center in Ventura from 
9 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the three-hour workshops, participants will learn about the history of 
Muertos celebration and will create "Muertos masks" out of plaster and paint 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The masks are made by pressing wet plaster to a face, then painting the dried 
product. The masks may be carried or worn in the procession on Nov. 1, the Dia 
de los Muertos. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities will begin at 3 p.m. at the community center. From 3 to 5 
p.m., local artists will paint residents' faces with skeletal designs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m., the Inlakech Ballet Folklorico will perform, and at 5:45 p.m., the 
Aztec dance troupe will do a traditional dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession commences at 6 p.m., winding through west Ventura streets to 
end at the Livery at 34 N. Palm Street, where participants can eat traditional 
Mexican foods, view Muertos masks made by local schoolchildren and watch plays 
and dance performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's theme this year is "Happy Muerte to You," Gomez said, promising 
a special sighting of Elvis at the Nov. 1 procession. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STORE OPERATOR IS ARRESTED IN SHOOTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark liquor store operator who became fed up with a man trying to sell 
electronics in front of his shop was arrested after he shot at the man to force 
him to leave, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdulrahman Barakat, 31, was arrested Saturday outside his store in the 400 
block of High Street in Moorpark after he allegedly shot at Juan Carlos 
Salazar, 26, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Barakat asked Salazar to leave the property, and the two men began arguing, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Barakat went into his store and retrieved a semiautomatic pistol, 
then shot at Salazar as he was running away. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, police said. Barakat was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, Barakat was the victim of a stabbing at his store, which 
has been owned by his family for more than 24 years. In that incident, Barakat 
was attacked after he refused to cash an income-tax refund check for the 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Saturday's shooting, Barakat was released from Ventura County Jail 
on $5,000 bail. He could not be reached for comment, and a woman working at the 
store declined to discuss the shooting. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CONTAMINATION FIGHT TARGETS STORM DRAINS

<P>
 An effort to prevent Thousand Oaks residents from dumping trash and hazardous 
materials into storm drains will begin this month, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of activities that officials say is intended to maintain a clean 
ocean and keep area lakes and creeks free from contamination will begin once 
enough volunteers have come forward to help the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The first project will entail stenciling messages warning "Don't Dump, Drains 
to Lake" onto curbs above storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages will help remind people that when they pour something down the 
drain, it does not simply disappear, said Mohammad Fatemi, the program 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community involvement in this important program will benefit everyone by 
helping to maintain a clean environment," he said. For more information, call 
Fatemi in City Hall at 497-8611. MATTHEW MOSK

OAK PARK ACTIVIST WELL KNOWN FOR HIS TENACITY; COMMUNITIES: LOCAL ADVISORY 
COUNCIL'S FOUNDER MAKES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE 
UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY HIS BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park's unofficial mayor Ron Stark is not afraid to admit he can be a 
nuisance to others. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and founding member of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council even 
has a T-shirt emblazoned "Proud to Be an Oak Park Whiner." 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old retired engineer has made just about everything that happens 
in Oak Park his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whining has made this community one of the best in Southern California," 
Stark said of the unincorporated community of 15,000 just east of Thousand 
Oaks. "We're very proactive. We're whiners, and the results are great." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Oak Park's original residents, Stark was an agitator from the start. He 
and his family relocated from Torrance in 1966 and were the 12th or 13th family 
-- his memory is a little hazy -- to move to the new community. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months of settling into his new five-bedroom home, Stark had stumbled 
upon his first big issue -- the threatening news that a developer building 
along Kanan Road planned to pave over its grassy medians. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other residents quickly mobilized, founded a homeowners association and 
stopped the median pavers dead in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark is ferociously devoted to protecting Oak Park's interests. His tenacity 
has made him few friends in county government over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to talk about him without swearing," said Lenora Kirby, aide 
to county Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who represents Oak Park. "He's a pain in 
the ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County public works Director Art Goulet puts it more delicately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron is a guy who has very strong opinions and is not afraid of expressing 
them or doing whatever he feels needs to be done," Goulet said. "That is both a 
positive and negative statement. He's a very persistent person." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearkening back to the early days of Oak Park, Goulet gives an example of that 
persistence. New houses were going up all over the community, and as fast as 
they could be built, they were being sold. To control the proliferation of real 
estate signs, the county had limited developers to placing the advertisements 
in specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stark found signs cropping up in rights of way, on street corners, 
everywhere but in their proper places. One day, he ripped up a bunch and drove 
to Ventura, arriving in Goulet's office with an armful. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted us to deputize him," Goulet recalled. "He said since we didn't have 
time to deal with the signs, that he would. But we couldn't give him any 
authority, and we told him we would have to do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of deputizing him, public works officials came to an agreement with 
Stark whereby he would notify the department whenever he saw an illegally 
posted sign, and the department would then write a letter to the offending 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark and his wife, Paulette, still live in the house they bought 28 years 
ago. Their three children are grown, but a daughter lives just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch-style house is filled with his wife's collection of cows -- ceramic 
ones, plastic ones, wooden ones, even stuffed cows in wedding garb. "They're 
taking over the house," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his retirement 3 1/2 years ago, Stark has turned his full attention to 
Oak Park causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have lots of time to make a nuisance of myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the issues close to Stark's heart are a little more complicated 
than real estate signs. With county libraries struggling under budget cuts, Oak 
Park residents have been lobbying to get a new facility. They now share space 
with the library at Oak Park High School, an arrangement they say is cramped 
and uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Another matter is the community's unincorporated status. In June residents 
were given three options on a ballot measure designed to gauge public opinion: 
become a city, annex to the city of Thousand Oaks or stay as they are. 
Overwhelmingly, they voted for the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park residents want a ZIP code of their own to save residents from being 
charged Los Angeles County sales tax and insurance rates because they share 
Agoura Hills' ZIP code. Their request has been rejected several times, but both 
VanderKolk and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) have appealed to 
the U.S. Postal Service on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 When the VISTA bus service to the county's cities began in July, Oak Park was 
left out of the loop, chiefly because county officials believed that the 
community would not generate enough ridership to warrant a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark, of course, has opinions on all these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park deserves that library, Stark says. He says the community will 
eventually have to become a city to protect residents' tax dollars, and he 
believes Oak Park will prevail in the quest for its own ZIP code. He also 
insists that the VISTA bus is going to pull into town and screech to a halt any 
day now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So he writes letters, he makes phone calls, he goes to Municipal Advisory 
Council meetings, he checks sales receipts to make sure merchants are not 
accidentally charging Los Angeles County sales tax at Oak Park's small shopping 
center. He zealously counts riders on VISTA buses to prove the service needs 
those Oak Park riders. Then, he reports his findings at meetings of the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so tired of seeing my face down there," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if his face is well-known by members of the Transportation Commission, it 
is less likely to be recognized in the very community to which he devotes so 
much time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average shopper going to Ralphs (supermarket) in Oak Park might not know 
who Ron Stark is," said David Ross, a longtime Oak Park resident and former 
member of the Municipal Advisory Council. "And that's a shame."

VENTURA MAN STRUCK AND KILLED BY TRAIN; SAFETY: AUTHORITIES SAY THE ACCIDENT IS 
AN APPARENT SUICIDE AND THAT THE 28-YEAR-OLD VICTIM WAS SEATED ON THE TRACKS.

 A 28-year-old Ventura man was struck and killed Monday by an Amtrak train in 
an apparent suicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Capilla-Vasquez, 28, was seated on the tracks east of San Jon Road 
in Ventura shortly after 11 a.m., his head between his knees and his hands 
wrapped tightly over his head as the northbound train approached, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting Capilla-Vasquez, the engineer sounded the train whistle, but 
the man made no attempt to get out of the engine's path, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was not able to stop before hitting Capilla-Vasquez, who was 
pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which was en route to Santa Barbara, was delayed about one hour 
after the 11:18 a.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's incident is the latest in a number of train-related deaths in Ventura 
County within the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a Simi Valley man was struck and killed by a Metrolink train while 
trying to rescue his dog, who had strayed onto the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent suicide on Christmas Eve in 1992, a Simi Valley man was dragged 
to his death after he threw himself in the path of a Metrolink train. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before that, three Oxnard men were killed and a fourth badly injured 
when an Amtrak train slammed into their van as it crossed a private, unguarded 
stretch of track near Moorpark.

SCHOOL YEAR OFFERS NEW CAMPUSES, NEW IDEAS; EDUCATION: TIERRA LINDA OPENS IN 
CAMARILLO AND OXNARD HIGH WILL BE MOVING. SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE LAUNCHING 
REFORMS.

 Toting new pencils and clean notebooks, thousands of Ventura County students 
will return to school this week with the sense of expectation and promise of a 
fresh start that comes with every new school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard High School's 2,200 students are heading back this morning to a 
school that is anything but fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers are starting their year at a 43-year-old campus of grungy 
classrooms, broken lockers and dried-out lawns that all bear witness to 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, however, the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new Oxnard High School campus on Gonzales Road scheduled to open in 
February, today marks the final time that the school on 5th Street will open to 
returning students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming here with the anticipation of moving," Principal Daisy Tatum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only Oxnard High, but Camarillo, Rio Mesa, Hueneme, Frontier and Channel 
Islands high schools and the elementary schools in the Pleasant Valley, Rio and 
Somis school districts begin classes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in Ventura, Ojai and Santa Paula reopen Wednesday, while all schools 
in the east county resume classes on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, all 119,000 public school children in Ventura County are scheduled 
to be back in the classroom, trying to cut through the mental fog that 
sometimes settles during the summer and to pick up where they left off three 
short months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Most years, the end of summer and start of school pass much the same. But this 
year there will be some changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Elementary School District, the brand-new 
Tierra Linda School will open its doors for the first time this morning to 
primary-grade children. 
</P>
<P>
 And throughout the Oxnard Union High School District, incoming ninth-grade 
students may find themselves under more scrutiny from school officials than 
they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is launching a new program to curb the increasing failure rate 
among ninth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time, school officials will pay special attention to 
incoming freshmen and emphasize some of the basics necessary to succeed in 
school, such as good study skills and regular attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District is also planning to get back to 
fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a committee of parents, teachers and school officials will decide 
which Ventura elementary school to convert to a back-to-basics format beginning 
in fall, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is also considering whether to require children who attend the 
back-to-basics school to wear uniforms and how many volunteer hours to request 
from the students' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to learning which school will convert to the back-to-basics 
format, Ventura parents and teachers also expect to find out this year whether 
the district will fire football coach Bret Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who teaches history at Balboa Middle School and coaches after school 
at Ventura High, will have a hearing this month on allegations that he dated 
and had sex with students. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the third Ventura High coach -- after Dale Hahn and Harvey W. Kochel -- 
to be accused of sexual misconduct in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than a year ago and prior to the allegations against both Hahn and 
Taylor that Ventura Supt. Joseph Spirito launched a program to teach moral 
values in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But in light of the accusations against the three coaches, the district's 
emphasis on teaching morality may seem to parents to be particularly relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spirito's open letter to the community, the superintendent told parents 
that they should feel confident sending their children to Ventura schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you kiss and embrace them as they leave the safety of your home, be 
assured we will welcome the children with your hopes and dreams in mind as we 
prepare them to become valued citizens of our society," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 And to help prepare students to become good citizens, the district this year 
will expand its moral values curriculum to all grades at all schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers districtwide will focus on a different positive character trait each 
month, ranging from courtesy to cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in case students at Buena High fail to always exhibit such good values, 
the staff is taking extra precautions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Jaime Castellanos and his three assistant principals will try a new 
method for catching students who litter or otherwise cause trouble at the 
school during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day at lunchtime, two of the four administrators will change out of their 
button-down shirts and ties to don T-shirts and shorts and hop onto bicycles to 
patrol the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to keeping tabs on their own students, the bike patrol will help 
school officials catch trespassers on the 54-acre campus, Castellanos said. "It 
allows us to get from one end of campus to another real quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around the campus at the new Tierra Linda School in Camarillo probably 
will not pose a problem for teachers and staff. Rather, the new school may not 
be big enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the elementary school expect to have trouble finding space for 
all the children who report for the first day of class today, Principal Dianne 
Quinby-Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 750 kindergarten through third-grade students are signed up this year to 
attend the new school -- 40 over capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The overenrollment is no surprise, considering that the school was built 
solely to ease overcrowding at other schools, Quinby-Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along, since this school was even begun to be planned, it was known that 
this was a school that would catch up with enrollment and that it would be full 
almost from the first day," Quinby-Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease crowding at the new school, the principal said officials will probably 
have to transfer some students back to other district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the complication, Quinby-Anders said preparing for the first year at 
the new school has been "exhilarating. Everyone is very up, very proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as teachers and children find it exhilarating to go to a brand-new 
school, ninth-grade students may feel equally excited about starting high 
school. But the experience of being a freshman at a big high school may also be 
scary and overwhelming, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard Union High School District, officials believe some ninth-grade 
students fail classes because they have trouble making the transition from 
junior highs with 700 or 800 students to high schools with enrollments of more 
than 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly one-quarter of all ninth-graders at the district's six high schools 
flunk their freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is particularly disturbing because students who fall behind in ninth 
grade have trouble catching up in later grades, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting into academic trouble in the ninth grade and they're not 
getting out of it," Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help more ninth-graders succeed, school officials are conferring with 
administrators at local junior highs to determine which incoming freshmen are 
at risk of failing. 
</P>
<P>
 The six high schools are assigning counselors to monitor the performance of 
these and other ninth-graders. And all of the schools will hold special classes 
to teach freshmen basic study skills such as how to read a book for full 
comprehension and how to take notes, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard High School, incoming freshmen will barely have time to get 
comfortable at one school before they move to another. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials believe the move to the new campus on Gonzales Road will be a 
pleasant change for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 The district succeeded in getting state money to build the $40-million campus 
after state officials agreed that the current school's location in Oxnard 
Airport's flight path makes it unsafe for students. 
</P>
<P>
 With sparkling, cream-colored buildings topped by tile roofs, the new campus 
will look far better than the dingy school on 5th Street, said Richard Canady, 
the district's assistant business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a different world," Canady said. "It's like coming out of the Dark 
Ages into the light."

AREA STUDENTS FACING MANY CHANGES AS CLASSES GET UNDER WAY; EDUCATION: UNIFORMS 
AND BUS FEES IN SIMI VALLEY AND A NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL IN MOORPARK ARE A FEW OF 
THE ADJUSTMENTS MARKING START OF SCHOOL THIS WEEK.

 Five-year-old Nichelle O'Brien glanced quizzically at her new plaid jumper as 
her mother pulled the stiff blue and gray uniform over her kindergartner-size 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little long," she said. "But I have to grow into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle and her 625 schoolmates at Garden Grove School in Simi Valley will 
adjust to the fit of new uniforms this school year as their elementary campus 
launches a voluntary uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove is the only school in Ventura County taking advantage of a new 
state law allowing uniforms in public schools, but it's not the only campus 
that will confront dramatic changes as the new school year begins this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the uniforms at Garden Grove, Simi Valley schools face another first: 
Parents will be required to pay for school busing -- a charge the district was 
forced to impose to make up a financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District, special-education 
students at two schools will share classes with mainstream students for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Thousand Oaks sixth-graders will enter middle school classrooms Thursday 
for the first time since Colina Middle School -- formerly Colina Intermediate 
-- adopted a reconfiguration plan for grades six, seven and eight in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Moorpark, hundreds of students will attend classes at the new Mesa 
Verde Middle School campus, which will help relieve overcrowding at Chaparral 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think change is accelerating in our schools," Ventura County Supt. of 
Schools Charles Weis said. "People are trying to get our schools ready for the 
21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most visual changes in the county will be apparent Thursday, when 
the majority of Garden Grove School students arrive for the first day of school 
in blue pants or skirts and white tops embossed with the school logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other Ventura County schools have established strict dress codes 
forbidding baggy, oversized clothing, Garden Grove is the first school to 
establish a uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope the common attire will allow students to focus more on 
academics and less on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children want to have uniforms on," Principal Elroy Peterson said. "They want 
to identify what school they go to and show pride in the way they look." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were able to buy the uniforms, which include shorts, culottes, 
sweaters and knit shirts, at Target and JCPenny, but also at the school, where 
a uniform supply company held three summer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting on campus for her mother to buy her new blue and white outfits last 
week, 7-year-old Jessica Moss said now she won't fight with her mother over 
what to wear to school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to wear a uniform because before I would say, 'I want to wear these 
clothes,' and then I'd say, 'No, I want to wear these clothes,' " the 
second-grader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica's mother, Joan Moss, is equally relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty easy, you either wear the pants or the skirt," she said. "I 
think most parents think it is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss said the uniforms are also cheaper than buying new school clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually spend $300 to $350," she said. "This year I spent about $150 so the 
cost is less." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for Garden Grove's uniforms range from $33 for a girls' plaid jumper to 
$12 for a knit-collared shirt. Boys' twill pants cost between $16.50 to $22.50, 
depending on size, and girls' and boys' shorts vary in price from $15.50 to 
$20.50. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the school's parents have already bought uniforms for the start 
of the school year, Vice Principal Judy Cannings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who do not wear uniforms are required to adhere to the school's dress 
code, which states that students must wear collared or crew-necked shirts 
tucked in at the waist, and properly fitting pants or shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code also prohibits hats, tank tops, sweat pants and disruptive 
hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
 While some parents have complained that Garden Grove's dress code is as 
restrictive as the uniform policy, the school's tough rules were supported 
recently by a new state law permitting school districts to require students to 
wear uniforms. The law, which Gov. Pete Wilson signed last month, takes effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our society is changing, and that is one of the changes for the 
better," Cannings said, adding that other Ventura County schools may decide to 
follow Garden Grove's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think other schools in Ventura County are looking at us," she 
said. "I don't know if we are part of a trend, but we are being watched." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito of the Ventura Unified School District has instructed his 
25 principals to form task forces to investigate whether families would welcome 
dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change in the Simi Valley Unified School District stirring debate is 
the district's new policy on bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with cutting $2.5 million to balance the district's $77.1-million 
budget, the school board decided earlier this year to adopt a "transportation 
user's fee" beginning with the 1994-95 school year. Conejo Valley Unified, the 
only other Ventura County school district to charge for school busing, began 
imposing fees two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Thursday, Simi Valley students must present a credit card-sized 
plastic pass to ride the bus to school. The passes cost $300 a year or $150 a 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy has not been well received, district officials said. Based on 
the number of bus passes sold, transportation director Frank Smith said school 
ridership is down about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to many districts (that charge for busing); it usually starts 
out low and increases," Smith said. "I think most people when you have to put 
additional money out of your pocket are going to be upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley parent Stella Kenton, who refused to pay for school busing, said 
her daughter will walk home from Berylwood School this year -- a two-mile hike 
for the fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a lot of people are going to let their kids walk just as we are 
doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they intend to study whether more students walk than take 
a bus because of the fees, and whether more crossing guards might be needed. 
But they said they have no immediate plans to increase the number of crossing 
guards. The city now has 22 guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got a request this week from the school district for six new guards," 
said Diane Jones, the city's environmental services director. "But what is 
important for people to realize is that we don't have any history at this 
point. Once school has started, we have to wait for patterns to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the city's study will probably begin in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Stella Kenton worries that her daughter and other children 
who walk to and from school will be endangered as they try to cross busy 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand that (the district) has a money problem," she said. "(But) 
it seems like they are not working for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley, three schools have changes for the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks special-education students, who previously attended classes 
limited to children with disabilities, will now be integrated into classes at 
Park Oaks and Maple elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program will allow about 15 students, most of whom have multiple 
learning disabilities, to enroll in some regular classes rather than be bused 
to one of the district's seven campuses that enroll special-education students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago, special-education people and kids were isolated away from 
the world," said Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry C. Gross, a former special-education 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gradually moved away from isolation to what we call normalization or 
mainstreaming," he said. "The idea is that these youngsters and adults should 
be put into environments with normalcy."

TMI INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your series of slanted articles on TMI will probably end the company and my 
investment with it. It's a shameful example of the distorting power of the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 Your articles were like throwing brickbats at the firefighters while they 
battle to save your blazing home. These people (TMI) are trying to recover 
following a serious problem that affects us all, the economic decline of 
California, statewide real estate value declines, and an insane tax structure 
that imposes public woes on private landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, I am not pleased with my TMI investments, but then I am also 
unhappy with SCE, worth less than 50% of its value 12 months ago. My other real 
estate investments also tanked. Thankfully, my other investments did better. 
And that is why my broker preached diversification. Anyone who would invest all 
of their savings in one thing, be it speculative raw land or CDs, is a victim 
of their own greed. Your story portrays the plaintiffs as poor teachers 
dependent on pensions now that all their investments are lost. It conveniently 
overlooks the fact that no one advised them to put everything into TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one factor, greed, could do that. Who's to blame? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyday, Merrill Lynch receives nuisance suits without your paper giving them 
front-page play. No mention in your paper. What's the point? A newspaper should 
deal in news, not disgruntled complaints.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER'S DEBUT NOT A THING OF BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Miller described his regular-season debut as Ram quarterback in Sunday's 
14-12 victory over the Arizona Cardinals as "ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox didn't go quite that far on Monday, but he did criticize 
Miller, who will face his former team, the Falcons, Sunday in Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals sacked Miller five times for 29 yards in losses. He completed 
six of 16 passes for 131 yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to keep working at it," Knox said of the passing game. "We had a 
lot of things in there, and we didn't hit some people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he got some pressure, but I think that if he could do it over, 
there would be some passes he wouldn't have thrown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the quarterbacks the Rams bypassed to sign Miller fare in their 
regular-season debuts Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Scott Mitchell, who the Rams courted as a free agent, completed 16 
of 31 passes for 203 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in the Lions' 
31-28 overtime victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota's Warren Moon, whom the Rams tried to acquire in a trade with 
Houston, completed 20 of 37 for 166 yards with no touchdowns and three 
interceptions in a 16-10 loss to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's Brett Favre, whom the Rams showed brief interest in as a 
restricted free agent, was 22 for 36 for 185 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer, who the Rams could have taken with the fifth 
overall draft pick, held a clipboard in the Buccaneers' 21-9 loss to the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Buddy Ryan responded angrily to the post-game comment of Ram 
assistant head coach Joe Vitt, whom he has known since coaching at the 
University of Buffalo. Vitt said the Rams would be undefeated if they could 
play a Ryan team each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your information is no better than your source," Ryan said. "I remember he 
was a go-fer in Buffalo, going after coffee. I guess he's really come up in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After injuries hit the Rams hard last season and during the exhibition season, 
Knox said he was relieved the Rams had no major injuries against the Cardinals. 
Free safety Keith Lyle (sore shoulder) and tight end Troy Drayton (ankle) are 
both expected to practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an error by the Rams' publicity department, the team's record 
fumble return was incorrectly reported Sunday. The correct record was 67 yards 
set by Jim Peterson in 1975. Cornerback Todd Lyght broke it Sunday with a 
74-yard return. . . . Johnny Bailey's 13-yard punt return against the Cardinals 
matched the team's season best last year by Henry Ellard. The Rams averaged 
only 5.4 yards a return last season. . . . The Ram defense was awarded the game 
ball for its play Sunday, and linebacker Thomas Homco was the special teams 
player of the week. MIKE REILLEY

SCHOOLS TACKLING JOB TRAINING NEEDS; L.A. DISTRICT DEVELOPS PROGRAMS FOR 
NON-COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the experts are correct, half of the children in Karen Schain's sixth-grade 
class at Valerio Street Elementary School in Van Nuys are on their way to 
careers as well-paid technicians and managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest -- now eager, curious 11- and 12-year-olds -- face a life of work as 
minimum-wage clerks when they graduate from high school in the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 As jobs change, warn economists and educators, so must job training. Public 
schools, once seen as the uniquely American way to instill uniform culture and 
academic training, are increasingly being judged on their ability to train 
large numbers of children for a future that may not include college. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present, we are not preparing our kids for the kind of society we are 
going to live in," said Carole Kennedy, a board member of the National Assn. of 
Elementary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his own study, James Catterall, a professor of education at UCLA, 
predicts that in six years more than half of the jobs will be in areas that 
typically require only a high school education. And although only 25% of 
available jobs are likely to require a college degree, about 35% of students 
will have a diploma from a four-year institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics fuel a growing debate over college preparation, vocational 
education and how schools can best prepare students for a future workplace that 
is uncertain and changing, particularly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing in the world is you could have a child who decides not to go 
to college, but who has no knowledge and no skill in any other area," Schain 
said. "Ninety-nine percent of the teachers in (the Los Angeles Unified School 
District) are trying desperately hard to get these kids ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, Schain's sixth-graders sat in their portable classroom, 
surrounded by brightly colored placards with aphorisms such as "In his dreams, 
even the smallest kitten can be a tiger!" and thought aloud about what they 
want to be when they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Karo, 11, wants to be an engineer because he likes working on his family's 
computer. Amalia, 10, wants to be a teacher. Georgiana, 11, wants to be the 
first woman President. And Luis, 12, wants to be an astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to study the planets," Luis said. "They have a lot of moons and some 
of the moons have radiation and craters." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they wait for their few minutes on the classroom's computer 
and talk about careers in terms of choosing academic paths and exploring the 
prerequisites of various jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to keep children on track, the Los Angeles district is pushing more 
work-based learning programs, said Jim Konantz, the director of career 
development for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 One model used is a federal Department of Labor report that concluded three 
years ago that schools need to do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half our young people leave school without the knowledge or 
foundation required to find and hold a good job," said the report by the 
Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills titled "What Work Requires of 
Schools." The report stated, "Young people will pay a very high price. They 
face the bleak prospects of dead-end work interrupted only by periods of 
unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 To become competent workers, the study concluded, students need the ability to 
identify, organize, plan and allocate resources; to work with others; to 
acquire and use information; to understand, monitor, improve and correct 
social, organizational and technological systems, and to work with different 
kinds of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Translating those goals into the classroom involves more work-based learning 
programs, Konantz said. The idea is that in addition to learning good work 
habits and interpersonal skills, students can learn practical applications of 
their classroom work and then bring their real-world experience back to the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the Youth Service Academy, in which 600 of LAUSD's most at-risk 
students participated, Konantz said. The school day was lengthened, curriculum 
was changed to reflect work skills, and students got real jobs in city 
departments after class. 
</P>
<P>
 After one semester at work, students improved their grades, Konantz said, from 
225 grades of A to 400. Failing marks fell from 200 to 100, then virtually 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example, Konantz said, is the creation at 25 high schools of 
career-cluster programs, or high school majors, such as math, business, 
engineering, languages, child development, travel-tourism and humanities. Each 
career cluster offers revamped vocational-type training in which students learn 
basic skills such as writing and math in the context of learning about the 
chosen career. 
</P>
<P>
 All students need reading and writing skills, Konantz said. But if they can 
learn those skills by reading technical manuals and writing data summaries, all 
the better. Sometime around the turn of the century, he said, all Los Angeles 
students will choose a career cluster by the time they enter ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a system that tends to push people along to higher and higher degree 
levels," Catterall said. "What's happened over the last 30 or 40 years is that 
we've raised the credentials required for given jobs -- a sort of credential 
inflation. At the same time, anyone looking at the meaning of a high school 
diploma or a college degree has expressed dissatisfaction with what those 
levels tend to produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all are convinced that practical education is the definitive answer. 
Programs such as the career-cluster major, already in place in Oregon high 
schools, have been criticized as a return to tracking, forcing students to make 
early decisions that will affect the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians point to the turn of the century, when tracking was first 
introduced largely in response to growing numbers of immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 But as industry changed and technology bounded beyond the reach of the 
schools' ability to keep up, vocational training increasingly fell into 
disfavor, Catterall said. By the 1970s and 1980s, policy-makers targeted the 
vocational/technical track as one in which undertrained teachers taught 
low-achieving students on out-of-date equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But as an increasingly intolerant economy gives newcomers little breathing 
room and the level of students' interest in their education continues to 
plummet, experts say that well-tuned vocational training ought to be making a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't you teach reading by technological books?" asked Kennedy of the 
national principals group and the principal of the New Haven Accelerated School 
in Columbia, Mo. "There isn't any reason why kids can't have an integration of 
curricula where you put science and reading together." 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools are more worried about next year's achievement tests than about 
the next century's work force, said John Hall, an elementary school counselor 
and the former LAUSD coordinator for elementary school counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Being charged with such a responsibility, he said, is simply overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valerio, Schain schedules each student for a 15- to 20-minute turn each 
week on the classroom's old-model Apple computer, in lieu of computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 She borrows microscopes to show them. She takes them on field trips to area 
businesses. She asks guest speakers to come in and talk about how they got 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She has faith, she said, that she sends her children off knowing she did the 
best she could. 
</P>
<P>
 Catterall, however, said he is worried that the best the schools can do might 
not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not particularly optimistic that our educational system will change 
significantly in the directions that we say and believe are necessary," he 
said. "If we do achieve significant change, it will be somewhat unprecedented 
and a wonderful surprise."

NEW CANCER SURGERY MODE IS DEVELOPED; HEALTH: THE DYE TECHNIQUE MAY PREVENT 
UNNECESSARY REMOVAL OF LYMPH GLANDS IN BREAST MALIGNANCIES. ITS APPLICATION IN 
OTHER PROCEDURES IS ALSO UNDER STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new procedure that could minimize unnecessary surgery for breast cancer 
patients and help guide their therapy has been developed by surgeons at the 
John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The new technique, which involves injection of a blue dye into a tumor before 
it is surgically removed, makes it easier for surgeons to determine whether the 
cancer has metastasized -- or spread into the lymph glands -- Dr. Armando 
Giuliano and his colleagues report today in the journal Annals of Surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 If the dye-mapping procedure shows that cancer has not spread, the patient is 
spared the painful removal of her lymph glands, speeding her recovery and 
reducing costs, Giuliano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very worthy piece of research . . . that has the potential of 
simplifying the surgical treatment of this disease," said Dr. Bernard Gardner 
of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "If his (Giuliano's) preliminary work holds up, it may allow us to be much 
more selective in who undergoes that particular part of the operative 
procedure," added Dr. Walter Laurence, a surgical oncologist at the Medical 
College of Virginia. "I think the early results look very promising." 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is already the subject of an international study examining its 
use against melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, and Giuliani is 
planning a similar trial against breast cancer, he said. He and his colleagues 
are also studying the potential for using the technique with other types of 
cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer in women, striking an estimated 
182,000 each year and killing 46,000, according to the American Cancer Society. 
Experts predict that one woman out of every nine will develop breast cancer at 
some point in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard treatment for breast cancer is the surgical removal of either the 
tumor itself or the entire affected breast. Surgeons also routinely remove all 
of the 25 to 30 lymph glands that are associated with the affected breast and 
inspect them for signs of spread. If metastasis has occurred, the patient 
generally receives chemotherapy, radiation or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Removal of the lymph glands does not generally provoke life-threatening 
complications, Giuliano said, but it can be uncomfortable and irritating. 
Typical problems include potential nerve injury, a swollen arm and limited arm 
motion, all of which can impede recovery from the breast surgery itself.  
</P>
<P>
 The lymph glands are also part of the body's immune system, and their removal 
produces a small impairment of immunity, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, then, recovery of the patient is most rapid if lymph gland removal 
can be avoided, but leaving behind lymph glands with cancer cells in them can 
be fatal. Giuliano's approach, originally developed by his colleague Dr. Donald 
L. Morton, is to find the single lymph gland that is most likely to contain a 
cancer cell -- what he terms a "sentinel" gland. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach is possible because individual lymph glands in a region are 
strung together like a series of lakes connected by rivers. Each lake is fed by 
its own tributary system, and anything that enters a lake through its 
tributaries is then spread to other lakes through the larger waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same fashion, each lymph node is fed by its own "tributaries" -- tiny, 
almost invisible axilla that drain a specific region of tissue. The sentinel 
gland is the particular lymph gland whose axilla drain the region where the 
tumor is located. Unfortunately, the sentinel gland cannot be identified by 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton reasoned that if he injected a dye into the tumor, it would quickly 
show up in the sentinel gland. "It's so simple that everyone asks, 'Why didn't 
somebody think of it a long time ago?' " Giuliano said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the current procedure, the researchers inject 3 to 5 milliliters of a dark 
blue dye into the tumor itself, or, if it has already been removed, into the 
tissue at the site. Within five minutes, the dye travels to the sentinel lymph 
gland. The surgeons then dissect the tissue at the site to follow the axilla 
and locate and remove the sentinel gland. Theoretically, then, if the sentinel 
gland contains no cancer cells, the remaining glands would be left intact. If 
it does contain tumor cells, all glands would be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's paper, the team reports on the examination of 174 women who were 
undergoing conventional breast cancer surgery and who had all their glands 
removed. In 114 of them, doctors were able to identify the sentinel gland 
before the glands were removed. In 109 of those 114 cases, the presence or 
absence of tumor cells in the sentinel gland correctly showed whether the 
cancer had metastasized.  
</P>
<P>
 Giuliano pointed out that all of the mistakes occurred early in the study 
while the researchers were developing the procedure. "There's a very real 
learning curve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his colleagues are currently organizing a large-scale trial of the 
technique to determine its reliability. If the procedure is validated there, he 
concluded, surgeons would have a valuable tool to determine whether a women 
would have to suffer the pain and inconvenience of having her lymph nodes 
removed along with her breast.

 More than 600 passengers and crew members who fell ill aboard a Royal 
Caribbean cruise ship last week were stricken by shigellosis, a virulent 
intestinal disease, investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the shigella bacteria aboard the San Pedro-based Viking Serenade 
had not yet been determined, and CDC investigators were sampling the ship's 
food and water and testing its food preparers for signs of infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise liner returned to port from Ensenada, Mexico, on Thursday, a day 
early from what was supposed to be a four-night journey, after large numbers of 
passengers fell ill with severe bouts of vomiting, fever and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the passengers aboard, 583, or 37% of the total, reported signs of the 
illness, while 40 crew members out of 612 were also stricken, according to the 
CDC. The bacteria was found in half the stool samples taken from the 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a nasty bug. Any disease that causes fever, diarrhea, cramps and 
vomiting is extremely uncomfortable, and particularly the very old and the very 
young are especially impacted," said CDC spokesman Bob Howard in Atlanta. "For 
37% of a group to be made ill, we certainly have to classify this as a large 
outbreak." 
</P>
<P>
 Six people aboard the ship were hospitalized, including one 78-year-old man, 
Clarence Bazar of Long Beach, who died -- apparently of a heart attack -- after 
he fell ill with the intestinal symptoms and was hospitalized in Ensenada. 
Bazar was seriously ill before the cruise with heart disease, diabetes and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said investigators have not yet determined whether the disease 
contributed to Bazar's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Shigellosis spreads through contact with feces, usually via food or person to 
person, although it can also be transmitted through the water supply. Just a 
small number of the organisms -- 10 to 200 -- are enough to make a person 
violently ill, and Howard said one infected food handler could spread the bug 
to hundreds of people aboard the ship without even knowing he or she had the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the CDC, the cruise line is testing all food handlers, 
surveying the water system and removing all prepared food from the ship. CDC 
investigators said Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is sanitizing and 
inspecting the vessel, is acting "expeditiously." 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise ship, according to Howard, received "an excellent score" in a 
sanitary inspection conducted by the CDC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a vessel that is absolutely spotless and all it takes is one 
infected food source or one infected handler who may or may not know he or she 
is infected," Howard said. "A lot of it has to do with a large number of people 
in a confined area. The bottom line is we simply don't know the mode of 
transmission in this case. We continue to do testing on water, stool samples 
and blood samples." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean's chairman, Richard Fain, said the company is cooperating with 
the CDC to ensure that the bacteria is eradicated before the ship's next 
scheduled voyage Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking Serenade left San Pedro on Aug. 29, and the first reports of 
illness occurred the next day, while it was docked off Santa Catalina Island. 
The number of ill grew steadily as the ship cruised toward Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 With an incubation period of 12 hours to five days, shigellosis typically 
begins with fever, stomach pain and diarrhea, which often turns bloody after a 
day or so, and can last a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of shigella found in the passengers -- Shigella flexneri -- can be 
successfully treated with antibiotics.  
</P>
<P>
 It is spread through physical contact or in food by an infected person who 
fails to wash his or her hands. Some people can be infected with the bacteria 
and pass it on to others without experiencing any symptoms; the infection can 
even be transmitted to others up to four weeks after the illness ends. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, such as with a recent waterborne illness in Milwaukee, bacteria 
can cause outbreaks of intestinal disease that afflict hundreds of thousands of 
people. Shigellosis strikes about 15,000 people a year, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines promised full refunds to the 
passengers. Fares for the excursion ranged from $599 to $1,899 a person 
including air fare.

HOLIDAY WEEKEND BRINGS LIGHT CROWDS TO SOUTHLAND SHORELINE; LABOR DAY: OTHERS 
CELEBRATE L.A.'S 213TH BIRTHDAY OR ENJOY ROCK MUSIC FESTIVAL. TRAFFIC DEATHS 
ARE DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern Californians bid an unofficial farewell to summer Monday in an 
eclectic array of Labor Day celebrations, with a mounting death toll from 
weekend traffic accidents providing a grim counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Balmy weather and warm ocean waters lured an estimated 2 million people to Los 
Angeles County beaches over the three-day holiday weekend, but lifeguards said 
the crowds were small compared to those on other recent summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusually quiet for this time of year. It's beautiful out here, but it's 
not as crowded as it has been," county lifeguard Lt. Don Souther said Monday 
from Santa Monica. "I'm guessing it's the weather -- it's starting to cool down 
and surf has dropped off." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other weekends, Souther said, about 40% to 50% fewer visitors came 
to the popular beaches stretching from Marina del Rey to the Malibu city limit 
over the Labor Day weekend. On Sunday, 312,000 sun and sea lovers turned out 
along that nine-mile stretch, which includes Santa Monica and Venice piers, 
Souther said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had only three rescues on Sunday. That's very quiet for a Labor Day 
weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd Saturday was much smaller, estimated at 212,000, with 10 rescue and 
first aid calls. In comparison, 273,000 people were attracted to the same 
beaches the previous Saturday, when 49 people required rescues or first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach crowds also were fairly light in the South Bay, where attendance was 
estimated at 215,000 on Sunday. Lifeguards speculated that people were enjoying 
other activities because the brutal heat wave had finally ended. On Monday, the 
busiest day of the three, temperatures at the beaches were in the high 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is one of the lightest holiday weekends we've had in many years, 
and I don't know what it's attributed to," said lifeguard Lt. Robert Schroeder, 
who is based in Hermosa Beach. "Maybe it's because we had some morning fog 
cooling things off."  
</P>
<P>
 To the north, at Malibu, Zuma and Point Dume beaches, crowds were typical of 
any summer weekend, with 102,000 to 150,000 people flocking to the sands each 
day, said county lifeguard Lt. Steve Wood. Surf on these south-facing beaches 
started to pick up Sunday, drawing many of the surfers from beaches farther 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend rescues and accidents were minor -- the usual bruised in-line 
skaters, dislocated shoulders, tipped-over catamarans and cycling mishaps. 
"Nothing more serious than some suturing at the hospital," Souther said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not tempted by the balmy beach weather, there were plenty of other 
activities to choose from, including the 213th birthday celebration for the 
city of Los Angeles, held near historic Olvera Street in Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scouts from Troop 364 kicked off the festivities, honoring the founding of 
Los Angeles, with a pancake breakfast at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic 
Monument. Events included games, an arts and crafts show and a salute with 
police and fire department helicopters.  
</P>
<P>
 Other holiday celebrations ranged from an arts street fair in Hermosa Beach to 
Lollapalooza '94, a rock music festival on the campus of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But temperatures that climbed into the 90s in Arcadia were being blamed for 
the cancellation of the Festival Santa Anita, which had drawn only about 5,000 
people by Sunday. Promoters had been expecting 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As always on holiday weekends, traffic fatalities and drunk driving arrests 
marred the festive mood.  
</P>
<P>
 Complete tallies will not be available until today. But by Monday morning, the 
CHP reported, there had been eight highway deaths in Los Angeles County, up 
from three last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the CHP reported that 28 people had been killed in traffic 
accidents by Monday morning, down from the 49 deaths reported during the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 1,521 drunk driving arrests statewide, a drop from last year's 
total of 1,813.

NORTHRIDGE TEAM A HIT ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northridge's little leaguers had faced adversity before, but on Monday they 
learned to deal with something more elusive than a curveball and more fleeting 
than a fastball -- their own celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous," said Spencer Gordon, 12, the right fielder."I have more 
confidence with baseball than TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer and the rest of the Quake Kids team that gained fame and the national 
championship were waiting backstage in Burbank to go on Jay Leno's "Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the little leaguers handled their talk show duties with the same 
bravado and humor that carried them from the tragedy of the Northridge 
earthquake, which left several without homes, to within a game of the world 
championship. And those same qualities allowed them to bounce back after they 
lost to a tough Venezuelan team in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno described their saga as "the most amazing story. . . . A lot of these 
kids don't have houses." (Actually only one is still out of his house.) 
</P>
<P>
 The host asked Spencer about the loss in the final game at Williamsport, Pa. 
The boy admitted it was "real disappointing. It was an off day for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Would they like to try to hit off him, Leno asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno lobbed a couple of Whiffle balls and the little leaguers bashed them into 
the audience. Then the host pleaded a sore arm and brought in a surprise 
reliever, Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, who didn't fare much better. One ball 
hit the lights above the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was over, the team posed with Leno for a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed the celebrity thing was not so tough. You joke around, sign a few 
autographs. "It was fun," Spencer said.

HENLEY SAYS HE'S READY TO REJOIN RAMS TODAY; FOOTBALL: INDICTED CORNERBACK SAYS 
HE'LL BE IN ANAHEIM TO RE-SIGN A $350,000 CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley said he will be at Rams Park today and intends to 
re-sign a one-year, $350,000 contract with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was cut by the Rams in August because bail restrictions from a federal 
drug trafficking indictment limited his traveling with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But a ruling by a federal judge on Friday lifted the travel restriction, and 
Henley will meet with Ram President John Shaw and Coach Chuck Knox with the 
intention of signing a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked to Darryl or the Rams today," said Marvin Demoff, Henley's 
agent. "Our understanding Friday was that they were going to sign him Monday or 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor on Friday sided with Henley's attorneys and 
dropped a provision from his bail that a U.S. marshal or pretrial services 
agency officer accompany Henley on the road, if $2 million in bail was posted 
and Henley came up with an additional $200,000 cash deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, in his sixth year with the team, signed a one-year, $350,000 deal with 
the team in August, but was assured his travel would not be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 But his bail terms prohibited him from leaving the Central District of 
California, which includes Orange and Los Angeles counties, without approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys petitioned the court to allow him to travel outside the 
district, but Taylor allowed him to do so only if Henley, or a "responsible 
third party" such as the Rams, could come up with $1 million in bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor also ordered that a U.S. marshal or pretrial services officer accompany 
Henley on the road games, to make sure he didn't flee. Team officials opposed 
the escort, saying it would be a distraction to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley didn't travel to the Rams' final exhibition game, Aug. 25 at San Diego, 
and was cut by the team three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-signing Henley would give the Rams an extra defensive back for their first 
road game of the regular season, Sunday at Atlanta.

MIKE DOWNEY: RAIDERS GOT MORE THAN FILL OF RICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Rice outscored the Raiders on Monday night. He ran for one touchdown, 
caught passes for two more and became the greatest touchdown-maker in NFL 
history, passing Walter Payton, passing Jim Brown and leaving the Raider 
defense in bits and pieces, like so much Rice-a-Roni. 
</P>
<P>
 Kept in the game with San Francisco already cruising by 23 points so he could 
score his record-breaking 127th pro touchdown on prime-time TV, Rice and the 
49ers really rubbed it into the Raiders' faces. Rice went long for a 38-yard 
pass from Steve Young with 4:05 to play, a historic catch that meant absolutely 
nothing to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning Coach George Seifert said, "We were all privileged tonight to see one 
of the great moments in football history, what Jerry Rice did. I think the man 
is obviously the greatest wide receiver to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rice, "I really don't deserve the credit myself. Joe Montana, Steve Young 
. . . there were so many guys who helped me. I love the game and look forward 
just to coming out every week. All I want to do is have fun on a football 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rice, who owns this city now that Montana works elsewhere, the pass all 
but certified his status as the greatest to play his position. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Raiders, all it did was make a bad situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Their own passing game was not sharp in the season opener. Rice accounted for 
more receiving yardage (169 yards) than Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler did 
passing yardage (168). Hostetler also had to watch teammate Napoleon McCallum 
be carried off on a stretcher and went to the sidelines himself in the fourth 
quarter because an injury to him would have been the night's final insult. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Raider defense, whatever individual bright spots they might see on 
highlight films this week must be weighed against the fact that they 
surrendered 44 points in their season opener, the most points a Raider team has 
given up since the 51 scored by Buffalo in the playoff game of Jan. 20, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing any game to the 49ers is hardly humiliating. Losing a season opener to 
anybody is not fatal -- look at Dallas, which opened last season 0-2. But 
losing like this, by 30 points, on a Monday night, when the Raiders are usually 
at their best, will have repercussions. People will think twice now before 
shouting to the world that the Raiders will be representing the AFC come Super 
Bowl Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, who knows something about getting to Super Bowls, ran his way into the 
record books with a demonstration of his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's only 31. He'll score more. 
</P>
<P>
 With his three touchdowns, Rice surpassed Brown's long-standing record of 126. 
It was a record that Brown owned for 29 years, and one that did not seem likely 
to be threatened by a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no ordinary wide receiver. Rice is the man who dominated Super 
Bowl victories every bit as much as Montana did, only to get shortchanged on 
much of the credit. While Montana's face was plastered on billboards and 
magazine covers coast to coast, Rice's remained recognizable mostly in the Bay 
Area and in the minds of enemy defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the 22nd time Rice has caught two touchdown passes in one game, and 
his 30th multiple-touchdown game. (He once had five in one night.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first one Monday was a beauty. Rice flagged down a long pass from Young on 
a play that covered 69 yards. Lionel Washington and Patrick Bates, trying 
desperately to keep up, did not. When Washington made one last desperate lunge, 
knocking Rice off-balance, the receiver wobbled and stumbled and still kept his 
balance, running into the end zone while Washington was run into by Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a human highlight film again. About all the Raiders could do to 
counterattack was go to Rocket Ismail, who made one very nice Rice-like catch 
and run to within a yard of a touchdown. Otherwise, these were not the usual 
Raiders. They very rarely threw long, and the 30-yarder to Ismail was the 
longest completion by Hostetler all night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers kept feeding them Rice, Rice and more Rice. They sprang him on a 
reverse, a 23-yard run in the fourth quarter that tied Brown's record. 
Teammates mobbed Rice in the end zone and, with 12:15 to play and San Francisco 
ahead, 37-14, it was presumed Rice's night was over. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not. Keeping the Raiders at bay even though injuries to guard Ralph 
Tamm and tackle Harris Barton wiped out the right side of their line, the 49ers 
sent their starters back onto the field to get Rice his record. And, with 4:05 
remaining, he got it, leaving cornerback Albert Lewis clawing at him helplessly 
from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting this record at home, in front of everybody here, means a lot to me. 
That's why I wanted to go back out there," Rice said. "It didn't have anything 
to do with the Raiders. It was just a good opportunity to do it right here in 
front of real 49er fans. I'd like to give a game ball to every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Young, his quarterback: "Tonight you saw why Jerry Rice is the best there 
is. I'll tell you, it's a priviledge just to throw the ball to see how he 
catches it." No. 1 With a Bullet 
</P>
<P>
 With his three touchdowns against the Raiders Monday night, San Francisco's 
Jerry Rice became the leading touchdown-maker in NFL history. The top 10:

GRETZKY UNFAZED BY FINANCIAL LOSSES IN MCNALL DEALINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The motivating force behind Wayne Gretzky's high-profile business partnership 
with Bruce McNall was never to build a financial empire, he says. It was mainly 
to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was just that. They were co-owners of the Toronto Argonauts of 
the CFL, which won the Grey Cup in 1991. And one of their thoroughbred horses, 
Golden Pheasant, won the Arlington Million. 
</P>
<P>
 And with McNall's financial empire in disarray, and Gretzky's losses from his 
partnership with the embattled club president estimated at less than $2 
million, he remains philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my lumps, but I knew that going in," Gretzky said. "I went into the 
whole thing knowing the downside. I was disappointed but it's not going to kill 
me. It taught me a lot about the business of sports and partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial losses weren't enough to damage their friendship. Gretzky said 
he talks to McNall on a regular basis and attempts to offer support. "I get 
about two phone calls a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being partners with a close friend, Gretzky is in business with 
creditors and bankruptcy trustee R. Todd Neilson. He owns four thoroughbreds 
with his new partners, including one horse that is having a great deal of 
success racing in New Zealand. Then there is the rare baseball card, a 1910 
Honus Wagner, in which Gretzky has a 50% stake. It was bought for $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be partners with anybody else," Gretzky said Monday on opening day of 
the Kings' training camp at Iceoplex in North Hills. "At a certain point in 
time, (the trustee) will want to auction off their 50% to raise capital. If I 
can buy the other 50% and put it away, I'll do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't communicate about (business) a whole lot with Bruce, so I'm 
not communicating a lot with these people. I don't worry much about it. I'm an 
athlete. It's something I bought for fun. I didn't buy it to say, 'OK, this is 
something I'm going to buy to build an empire.' This is something I did for my 
personal enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's financial slide has focused some attention on Gretzky's finances 
since the two held such a prominent business relationship. Last week, a 
Canadian newspaper reported that Gretzky had lost as much as $5 million and 
that he was being threatened with several lawsuits from creditors of McNall's 
Summa Stables Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's lawyer, Ron Fujikawa, termed the report "absolute nonsense" on both 
fronts. Fujikawa said Gretzky was not being besieged by angry creditors and had 
received one letter of inquiry. Monday, Gretzky shook his head and laughed when 
asked about the $5 million, saying: "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky said the success with thoroughbred horses offset some of his Argonaut 
losses. But he never invested with McNall in rare coins and was not involved in 
the banking side of the McNall Sports and Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 He owned 18% of the Argonauts as did the late actor John Candy. When the team 
won the Grey Cup and still lost money due to so-so attendance and a poor lease 
at the SkyDome, Gretzky tried to convince McNall to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Gretzky obviously is concerned about McNall as a friend, not as a 
partner. McNall, the former majority owner of the Kings, has agreed to plead 
guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud 
investigation, sources close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he has to go through the justice system and hopefully it works out 
positive for him," Gretzky said. "It's really out of our hands. It's not 
something that really involves the hockey players, it's more his personal 
business. . . . I think it's tougher on me than most guys because I'm a friend. 
It's easy to be friends with a guy when you're on top of the world. I think 
true friendship comes through when people are down-and-out, that you try to 
stick by them as best you can." 
</P>
<P>
 New majority owners Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and Joseph M. Cohen were at camp 
Monday. McNall was not there, but he briefly spoke to the team at a meeting 
Sunday. He introduced the owners and said the team would probably be asked a 
lot of questions about his status, according to one of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky was asked how difficult it was to fathom the seriousness of McNall's 
current situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed for everyone," he said. "It's bad for everybody. Hopefully, 
it's something that won't hurt too many people." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There were 53 players in camp. The only absentee was Keith Redmond, who had 
personal problems. He is expected to report later this week. . . . Right wing 
Rick Tocchet on his recovery from back surgery: "I'm not 100% yet, but I'm 
getting there. The quickness, hopefully over the next month I'll get that 
back." Coach Barry Melrose put Tocchet on the left wing with Wayne Gretzky and 
Jari Kurri. But Melrose said he wants to keep both Tocchet and Kurri on the 
right wing. . . . Goaltender Kelly Hrudey said he worked with a personal 
trainer for the first time in his career. He was not surprised the Kings 
drafted goaltender Jamie Storr and was impressed with him. "From all accounts, 
he is a franchise player," Hrudey said. "The thing is, I'm not going to give my 
job to anyone. He's going to have to earn it. It's no different than when I 
beat out Billy Smith in New York." . . . By and large, players were not 
optimistic about avoiding some sort of work stoppage. Gretzky, for his part, 
has kept a close eye on the baseball strike. "We're not as powerful and we 
don't have the history that baseball does, especially in areas like Florida and 
California, so we're just gaining momentum in those areas," he said. "It would 
be tough to lose a lot of those fans at this point in time because fans are fed 
up with sports in general, not just hockey." . . . The Kings will hold a 
scrimmage open to the public Wednesday at 9:45 a.m. and an intrasquad game 
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Both events are at Iceoplex and cost $5 per person, with 
the proceeds going to youth hockey programs.

THE ROLE MODEL; USC'S KEYSHAWN JOHNSON TRIES TO SUCCEED MORTON -- AND IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL and EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of people are counting on Keyshawn Johnson this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the USC football coaches, who believe Johnson could be an 
outstanding replacement for All-American receiver Johnnie Morton. 
</P>
<P>
 There are his teammates, who know that the team's success could be tied to 
Johnson's. 
</P>
<P>
 And, there are those who helped Johnson pull himself out of a morass of drug 
dealing and gang banging. Those are the people he wants to please. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is trying to be a role model. He has talked to elementary school 
students about his past and its pitfalls. He has written to high school 
students about not giving up on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started hanging out with the wrong crowd and got myself in trouble," 
Johnson wrote in Cal-Hi Sports this year. "I was selling drugs, gang banging 
and robbing people on the streets when I was finally arrested in the eighth 
grade and put in a correctional facility for nine months. I didn't do these 
things because I needed money, but because I needed a change of pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had seemed to be heading in the right direction before he decided to 
change his pace. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived with his mother and brother about a half-mile from USC and, when he 
was 6, found himself on the practice field with Charles White and Dennis 
Thurman and other stars of late-1970s Trojan football. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a regular at practice, asking for wrist bands, retrieving footballs, 
carrying helmets and shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players loved it when I asked if I could carry their pads and helmets," 
he said. "It was after practice and they were tired." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a ballboy for the Trojans for seven years during the coaching regimes 
of John Robinson (on his first tour of duty) and Ted Tollner. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Larry Smith moved in as Trojan coach, Johnson moved to the streets. 
It wasn't long before he found his way to a juvenile detention facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I was released from jail, my brothers and sisters sat me down and told 
me that it was time for me to take responsibility for myself," Johnson wrote. 
". . . It was at Dorsey (High School) that I finally found myself. Here I was, 
one of the best athletes in the state and I wasn't preparing myself for 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Johnson was offered a scholarship to Miami but didn't score well 
enough on his SAT. He ended up at West Los Angeles Community College, where he 
struggled with his grades and quit the football team after seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was having a bad year, but we were all having a bad year," said Rob Hager, 
Johnson's coach at West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sat out a year, took a hard look at reality (and) he took on some 
responsibility. He took inventory of himself, as to what he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw him in 1992. When he came back to our program in '93, he had a 
different attitude. He's a mature guy for his years, he's been around." 
</P>
<P>
 The two years that Johnson had dropped out of sports, he said he was learning 
to become a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson bounced back last season with a flourish, scoring 12 touchdowns in 
nine West L.A. games and catching 55 passes for 1,245 yards, an average of 22.6 
yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has started this season slowly. A thigh bruise has limited his 
practice time, and in Saturday's 24-17 victory over Washington, he caught one 
pass for five yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad luck that has followed Johnson on the field, he believes, might also 
be dogging him off it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, a warrant for the arrest of a Keyshawn Johnson was 
issued in 1991 for two counts of misdemeanor theft. The warrant says Johnson is 
accused of stealing a portable telephone valued at $900, and a pager from a Van 
Nuys electronics store. 
</P>
<P>
 It lists Johnson's address as the one he was living at in 1991, and the 
physical description also matches. It also lists the make and model of a car 
that Johnson had at that time. However, the birthdate on the warrant is exactly 
one month and one year off from Johnson's birthdate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keyshawn Johnson wanted for theft is also wanted for failure to appear on 
five moving violations and driving on a suspended license. USC's Johnson says 
there is a possibility that his driver's license is suspended, but says he no 
longer drives. He also said his driver's license was stolen in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he did not know about the warrant until told about it by a Times 
reporter last week. He strongly denies any charges and says it is a case of 
mistaken identity. Johnson is even seeking help to clear his name.  
</P>
<P>
 Police generally do little more than write a report on any misdemeanor crimes. 
The rise in crime in the Southland leaves police virtually no time to 
investigate misdemeanors or to execute those warrants. The warrants are usually 
only served when discovered in traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC official said the school also plans to investigate the warrant in the 
hopes of clearing its receiver's name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC has high expectations for Johnson. "He can do all the things Morton could 
do, and he's bigger and faster," receivers coach Mike Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hager has no problem comparing Johnson to Morton, who was a first-round 
draft choice of the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keyshawn is a phenomenal talent," he said. "He's tall, strong and fast and 
he's got a great eye for the ball. And he likes to compete. It's very 
reasonable to think he can succeed Morton. He's got that kind of talent, and 
Keyshawn won't settle for anything less than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, Johnson's current coach, echoes that sentiment: "Keyshawn is going 
to be fun to watch. I think he's going to be a dynamic player." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson wants to be dynamic in other areas, as well. Last June, he talked 
about his background in South Central L.A. at Bixby Elementary School in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sensational," principal Sue Fellenzer said. "He talked about 15 
minutes and he spoke from his heart, with that big Magic Johnson smile. The 
kids not only loved him, but so did the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he talked to the children about "mistakes I made, that they 
shouldn't do what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 He summed up his life this way: "I don't blame anyone for the mistakes I made 
when I was younger. I just want people to know that there is always hope for 
those that have gone astray." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a subject he can discuss from experience.

MEETINGS PRODUCE BIG TALK, BUT LITTLE ACTION; OLYMPICS: THE CENTENNIAL CONGRESS 
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A THINK TANK OF NEW IDEAS. INSTEAD, IT BECAME A SERIES OF 
SPEECHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turn out the lights in the City of Lights, the $16-million birthday party is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Also known as the Olympic Centennial Congress, it was conceived as a 
high-minded think tank that would bring together not only international and 
national Olympic officials but also academicians, historians, journalists, 
sponsors, marketing mavens and, yes, even athletes to discuss and debate their 
roles at the start of the Olympic movement's second century. 
</P>
<P>
 Come together they did last week in the underground halls of a charmless 
convention center on the city's outskirts, more than 3,000 strong to hear 430 
three-minute speeches over a five-day period on every subject from ambush 
marketing to the ambush of Nancy Kerrigan.  
</P>
<P>
 But as for discussions and debate, there was little of that as speakers were 
herded to and from the stage as if they were all winners of less prestigious 
Oscars at the Academy Awards. John MacAloon, a respected Olympic historian and 
University of Chicago sociology professor, fumed at the lack of opportunity for 
formal give and take at the end of sessions, as is usually a feature of 
academic conferences. "I thought the Berlin Wall had come down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even informal exchanges in the lobby subsided after it was discovered that 
Olympia, a metallic green robot that wandered the halls, had super sensitive 
hearing powers. When one observer practically whispered to another that Olympia 
must have set the organizers back about $200,000, the robot, standing about a 
football field away, turned and said, in perfect English, " That's a lot of 
money!"  
</P>
<P>
 All of this occurred to the delight of International Olympic Committee 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, who declared that the theme of the 
Congress would be unity and then gave no one a chance to disagree. That assured 
that the theme of the Congress for reporters would be boredom, which hardly 
distressed Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
 About to step onto an escalator one afternoon, he spotted an Associated Press 
reporter in the lobby out of the corner of his eye and abruptly turned on his 
heels to go speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No headlines," Samaranch said, his eyes twinkling. 
</P>
<P>
 He liked that thought so much that, in his closing speech Saturday, he said, 
"Good news is no news." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his deputies were eager to accommodate him. In the opening speech of 
the first morning session, IOC Vice-President Kevan Gosper of Australia said 
the movement needed the courage to eliminate sports from the Olympics that are 
no longer popular or modern, the courage to assure that professional athletes 
competing in the Olympics in increasing number are true lovers of sport and not 
merely gladiators, the courage to insist upon the continuing participation of 
athletes from developing nations and the courage to open stadiums to the common 
man instead of reserving all the seats for corporate sponsors and VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Gosper, fearing that he had been too blunt, went to the press room to 
inform reporters that he was merely tossing out some suggestions, that he was 
not sure when or even whether the IOC should act upon them and that what really 
bothers him is "extravagant, unrelated" entertainment at sporting events. He 
was unable to describe what he was talking about, but he presumably knows it 
when he sees it. After that performance, some of his IOC colleagues began 
sarcastically referring to him as "Captain Courageous." 
</P>
<P>
 But if speakers were somewhat circumspect because they were concerned that 
their words might come back to haunt them, who could blame them? At the most 
recent Congress in 1981, one conclusion of the final statement's drafters was 
that there was "no place in the Olympic Games for professional or open 
competition." Eleven years later, the Dream Team pretty much ended that notion 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was time for a new Congress, the 12th in 100 years, and Paris certainly 
seemed to be the place because that is where a French baron, Pierre de 
Coubertin, convened the first meeting of the IOC in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants were jolted when they arrived by a retrospective in the Saturday 
magazine of a French sports newspaper, L'Equipe, that described de Coubertin as 
racist, misogynist and anti-Semitic, and, although the writer ultimately 
concluded that the baron was OK for his time, many speakers in this politically 
correct age rushed off to delete, or at least soften, their references to him. 
</P>
<P>
 All they had to do was change their focus from de Coubertin to Samaranch 
because the movement today is much more reflective of the Spanish banker's 
vision than that of de Coubertin. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview before the Congress, Samaranch proudly detailed some of his 
accomplishments in 14 years as president: the election of women to the IOC, 
including two executive board members; the creation of an athletes' commission; 
the opening of the Games to professionals; the development of a fund for 
athletes from emerging nations; the intensification of the fight against drugs 
and racial discrimination; the establishment of a court of arbitration for 
disputes between athletes and federations; the schedule change that placed the 
Winter and Summer Olympics in different years; the construction of new IOC 
facilities, including an Olympic museum, and the significant improvement in the 
IOC's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 If all Samaranch, who will retire in 1997, wanted to do was call a Congress to 
celebrate his reign as president, few would have argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But Samaranch promised much more, including open discussion that would result 
in a program, particularly for the Summer Olympics, that included primarily 
sports that are popular today. Some, he said, would have to go. Instead, all 
the IOC did was add two sports, triathlon and taekwondo, for the 2000 Summer 
Games in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolution, not revolution, said IOC member Jacques Rogge of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all IOC members were satisfied with that philosophy. "You might have to 
speculate that if the IOC doesn't eliminate anything and adds two more sports, 
who's going to take it seriously?" said Richard Pound, an executive board 
member from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the IOC did score some points for its overdue recognition of athletes as 
forces within the movement. Donna de Varona, a gold medalist swimmer from the 
United States, said that when she attended her first Congress in 1973, the 
credential was literally ripped from her neck by an IOC official because she 
applied for it through the organizing committee instead of the IOC. De Varona 
was one of many current and former athletes to participate last week. In fact, 
she was asked to present two speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the IOC seemed poised to give athletes more of a voice, if for no 
other reason, as Rogge explained, to prevent a situation in the future like the 
United States has now with its baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleased to have been heard, de Varona said that a Congress is necessary "so 
that a large number of people from throughout the world can gather periodically 
to share their thoughts on the Olympic movement." 
</P>
<P>
 But, like many others, she said that she was offended by the $16-million price 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
 With little else to report daily, reporters fixed on that figure. IOC 
officials were sensitive about it, choosing an alternate site for their grand 
gala in fear that the first choice, the Palace of Versailles, would inspire 
Marie Antoinette and "let them eat cake" references. They also scurried to 
explain that they were contributing only $6 million, while the rest came from 
the French and Parisian governments, perhaps as a down payment on Paris' 
proposed bid for the Summer Olympics of either 2004 or '08. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the IOC, which boasts of the financial assistance it has given to 
athletes such as world champion runner Maria Mutola of Mozambique, should 
consider that $6 million would finance training for a lot of athletes for a lot 
of years.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it is possible that reflection upon the Olympic movement is, like 
prayer, best done in private.

DUCKS; ROOKIE KARIYA BIG HIT AS PRACTICE DRAWS 9,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came, 9,000 strong, to watch a hockey practice. The first day of hockey 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of the fans who spent their Labor Day filing through the turnstiles 
at the Mighty Ducks' free public session at The Pond of Anaheim were there to 
watch Paul Kariya take his first official step onto NHL ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya did no more than step off the bench, and they cheered. Kariya quickly 
put his head down and stretched, they cheered. Kariya skated, they cheered. 
Kariya, a compact 5-feet-10 and maybe 170 pounds, checked 6-5 tough guy Stu 
Grimson into the boards, and they really cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really nice," said Kariya, 19, the strikingly creative playmaker who 
signed a three-year, $6.5-million contract last week. "It got a little bit 
embarrassing after a while, but it was nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing I didn't expect was all the fans. I thought it was a closed 
practice and then came into the arena parking lot and saw all these cars. It 
was amazing. I had no idea people would be here to watch an open practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks opened their first day of practice believing a few thousand fans 
would wander in and hopefully buy a T-shirt or maybe even a season ticket. (The 
team already has sold 12,000 season tickets). 
</P>
<P>
 "I won the office pool," Coach Ron Wilson said. "I said there'd be 5,000 
people and as soon as I saw all the people there in the morning, I said there'd 
be 10,000 when Paul came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe I'd come on the ice a little ahead of him and they'd cheer 
and I'd wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was shunning this rookie -- certainly not captain Randy Ladouceur, a 
12-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were skating around and Randy said, 'I better get up with you so I can get 
media attention,' " Kariya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his teammates were eager to get their first look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're actually excited," Wilson said. "They're curious to see what 
he can do. Paul's so unassuming, it's not like he pushes people aside. He works 
as hard as everybody else. That's what will endear him to his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fan reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like everyone went, 'We're not worthy,' it was nice and polite," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will hold Kariya out of Sunday's exhibition against the Kings at the 
San Diego Sports Arena in part because he expects a physical game. But the 
rookie made an impression by playfully mixing it up with Grimson, who 
accidentally put three teammates out of commission with ill-aimed hits last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I checked him into the boards," said Kariya, who also took some nudges from 
Grimson. "I didn't know if I should touch him or not, but he said, 'Way to 
work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He also made a small gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, there's a fly on me," Kariya said. "I'd better stay away from him the 
rest of the year."

BLAKE'S FOUR-YEAR KINGS' CONTRACT BELIEVED WORTH ABOUT $10 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings view defenseman Rob Blake as a future Norris Trophy winner, and are 
paying him accordingly with a new contract worth about $10 million, according 
to sources. It averages about $2.5 million a season, but about one-third of the 
payments are deferred. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported previously, it is a four-year deal -- three years plus an option 
-- and is tentative pending NHL approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 24, said he won't practice until the contract is approved. Last season, 
Blake scored a career-high 20 goals and 68 points.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for me to step up in a leadership role with some of the younger 
guys," said Blake, who earned $700,000 last season. "When you've been here five 
years, you're not a rookie anymore. We've always had great leaders here -- 
Wayne (Gretzky), Marty (McSorley), Larry Robinson and Paul Coffey." 
</P>
<P>
 The league's two highest-paid defensemen are New Jersey's Scott Stevens and 
St. Louis' Al MacInnis. This season, Stevens will make a base salary of $2.8 
million, plus a $3 million signing bonus. MacInnis will get a total of $3.5 
million, including a $500,000 signing bonus. LISA DILLMAN

 Not even one minute into the first night of swimming's World Championships, 
the tidal wave from China that had been forecast began to sweep across the pool 
at Foro Italico with the same shocking force as the lightning that struck two 
nights earlier and forced postponement of a diving event. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first final Monday, the women's 100-meter freestyle, both Chinese women 
broke the world record set by the United States' Jenny Thompson, and the 
winner, Le Jingyi, broke it by almost half a second with a time of 54.01 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to the 12 years it took the women to lower the 100 freestyle 
record by half a second before Thompson swam her 54.48 in 1992 and it is easy 
to understand why the world of swimming felt it had just witnessed lightning 
striking twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," said Thompson after seeing Le's time on the scoreboard. "That's 
ungodly." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps unholy would be the word preferred by many within the sport who 
suspect the Chinese women are fueling their performances with substances more 
illicit than the caterpillar fungus, turtle blood soup and ground deer horns 
that they claim as part of their diets. 
</P>
<P>
 Their accusers were more skeptical than ever Monday, when the Chinese women 
went three for three in finals. Although their winning times in the 400-meter 
individual medley and the 800-meter relay were not as impressive as Le's in the 
100 freestyle, they were world championship records. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's absolutely ridiculous," said former U.S. swimmer Summer Sanders, who 
won gold, silver and bronze medals in the 1992 Summer Olympics. "If it keeps 
going this way all week, there's going to have to be a serious investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Quick, the U.S. women's coach from Stanford, has made similar demands 
as the Chinese women have emerged as world powers in less than six years, 
claiming that they were involved in "pharmaceutical warfare." But it was 
apparent Monday that he does not want to battle them anywhere this week except 
in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everything done, all year, 365 days a year, to have this be a fair 
contest," he said. "But this is not the time and place to address it. When 
you're at a championship, the mode of operation has to be that you worry about 
the things you can control, and you don't worry about the things you can't 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 His swimmers, for the most part, followed his lead. Thompson, who also has 
cast aspersions upon the Chinese in the past, cooled off in the practice pool 
for a long time before emerging to say that she is not intimidated by them. She 
might have beaten Le, she said, if she had not been set back this summer by a 
broken arm suffered in a water slide accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she finished fourth in 55.16. That was almost four-tenths of a second 
out of the medals as Germany's Franziska van Almsick finished third in 54.77 
and China's Lu Bin second in 54.15. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is I'm going to work my. . . .off to try to win the gold medal in 
my home country (during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta) and try to get the 
world record," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it's not undoable. My lifetime goal is to go under 54 seconds. I 
still think that's within my reach, maybe in a year when I don't have a broken 
arm." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the winner, Le, 19, of Shanghai, barely had a moment to enjoy her 
triumph before she was asked about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the allegations groundless, she said: "When the Europeans and 
Americans get very good results at major competitions, no one accuses them of 
using drugs. When the Chinese come to the forefront in sports, we are accused. 
It's unfair. I think some people are jealous." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many drug tests she has taken this year, she said, "I can't remember 
because there have been so many." 
</P>
<P>
 She had to take another Monday. The international swimming federation, FINA, 
was criticized during the 1992 Summer Olympics for its policy of testing 
finalists at random, which meant that medalists might not be called upon. In 
response, officials announced here last week that all champions, as well as 
other finalists chosen at random, would be required to submit to tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Le in doping control was Dai Guohong, 17, who won the 400 individual 
medley in the world's fastest time this year, 4:39.14. The woman with the 
year's previous best time, the United States' Allison Wagner, was second in 
4:39.98 after losing more than two seconds in the breaststroke. Kristine Quance 
of Northridge was third in 4:42.21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese also won the 800-meter relay in 7:57.96, easily beating the van 
Almsick-led Germans, second in 8:01.37, and the U.S. team of Cristina Teuscher, 
Thompson, Janet Evans and Nicole Haislett, third in 8:03.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Chinese want to prove they have really arrived, setting their sights 
on van Almsick in today's 200 freestyle, Evans in Wednesday's 400 freestyle and 
Hungary's Krisztina Egerszegi in both backstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts predict the Chinese will win half of the 16 women's events, which 
is one less than they won earlier this year in the world short-course 
championships. After the first day, they have only two fewer medals than they 
won in the 1991 World Championships at Perth, Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice, the other swimmers confess, to hear a national anthem other 
than China's during the medal ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick of that song," Thompson said.

IOC'S THREE-YEAR SEARCH ENDS, EASTON TO FILL SECOND U.S. SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The three-year search for a second International Olympic Committee member from 
the United States ended Monday, when James L. Easton of Van Nuys was elected at 
the conclusion of an IOC session in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 His selection is part of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch's effort to 
strengthen representation of international sports federations within the 
100-member organization.Easton, 59, is president of the international archery 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles has been the lone representative of the IOC to 
the United States since former U.S. Olympic Committee president Robert Helmick 
of Des Moines, Iowa, resigned in 1991 amid a conflict-of-interest inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was necessary that the position got filled now because it's been 
too long," Easton said. "People start wondering what's wrong with the United 
States or the IOC because they can't select somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Easton was not among the four recommendations for the position submitted to 
Samaranch by the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know Jim very well," USOC President LeRoy Walker said when it became 
apparent Easton had emerged as the favorite. "But, from everything I've heard, 
he's someone we can work with for the good of the Olympic movement in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the IOC adopted tough anti-doping regulations that mandate a minimum 
two-year suspension for a first serious drug offense and a lifetime ban for a 
second. The long-awaited IOC medical code is meant to bring all Olympic sports 
in line with uniform anti-drug rules, procedures and sanctions. RANDY HARVEY

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / SEASON PREVIEW; LUCKY TO BE ALIVE; ALL-AMERICAN PHIL 
FONUA OF MIRA COSTA HIGH SUFFERED BRAIN ANEURYSM, BUT IS ON THE MEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As he has so often this summer, Phil Fonua walked into the weight room at Mira 
Costa High in Manhattan Beach on Aug. 10 to work out in preparation for the 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
 With college coaches from such schools as Notre Dame, USC and Arizona 
inquiring about his talents, the 17-year-old defensive lineman eagerly 
anticipated his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 That particular Wednesday afternoon is one his family will not soon forget, 
however. While hoisting dumbbells for a set of curls, Fonua collapsed to the 
floor and fell unconscious before a crowd of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics were quickly on the scene, and Fonua was rushed to Torrance 
Memorial Medical Center, where it was determined he had suffered a 
life-threatening brain aneurysm. The prep All-American underwent a successful 
four-hour operation the next day and is recuperating at home after three weeks 
of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 David Alexander, a neurosurgeon who is monitoring Fonua's progress, said his 
patient is lucky to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "A third of the people who have a brain aneurysm do not survive the first 24 
hours," Alexander said. "That is a very significant statistic. Phil has been 
helped by the fact that he is young and physically strong. He's made tremendous 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 While the prognosis for full recovery is good, it remains to be seen whether 
Fonua will ever be able to return to competitive athletics. Alexander and other 
doctors agree that sports is definitely out for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua, 6-feet-2, 275 pounds, has never had any significant medical problems. 
His aneurysm was caused by a congenital condition -- a weakening in the wall of 
the blood vessel that caused it to bulge, leak and eventually rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the condition would have been nearly impossible to detect, and a 
weakened blood vessel is more likely to rupture in older people. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melvin Snyder, who performed the surgery, said athletics did not play a 
part in the aneurysm but that Fonua's "very active physical activities," 
including weightlifting, could have contributed to the blood vessel rupturing 
at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua spent last week at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood with a 
team of eight doctors and therapists aiding his rehabilitation. He was released 
on Friday but will return to the hospital five days a week for the next month 
or so as part of his continuing therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 His physical and mental skills have been slowed a bit by the aneurysm, but 
Fonua is improving and expects to return to school in a few weeks. Joanne Levy, 
his case worker at Daniel Freeman, said he will have to start slowly and build 
back to his old schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "A full day at school is likely to tire him out quickly," she said. "These 
things take time, and it's different when you're at home and not in the 
hospital with everyone taking care of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa Coach Don Morrow, who guided the team to a Southern Section 
championship last season, said the loss of the school's star player has been 
emotional for coaches and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow was getting helmets ready for preseason drills when Fonua collapsed. 
When he got there, the player who is often referred to as the "Terminator," was 
on the ground and appeared to be having a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever forget that day," he said. "The irony is that Phil is 
such a big and strong guy that you never expect him to be down in a helpless 
condition. Our thoughts have been with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The team split duties visiting Fonua in the hospital, where nurses said he had 
more well-wishers than any other guest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua does not remember anything about Aug. 10, which doctors say is normal. 
His speech is a little slow and groggy, but he dreams of returning to the 
weight room and the football field sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be back by the fifth game," he said. "I'm really starting to feel 
better. I'm a little weak but getting stronger. I wouldn't be scared to take a 
hit. I wouldn't be scared at all." 
</P>
<P>
 James Joachim, Fonua's family physician, is optimistic about his patient's 
recovery but is cautiously approaching the case. 
</P>
<P>
 This year "is completely out of the question," Joachim said. "I don't think 
any physician would clear Phil for any contact or non-contact sport. He and his 
family realize life is more important than the risk of the recurrence of a 
serious head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know there is a very courageous spiritual side to this young man that 
may change what happens in the future. (But) at this moment, I would not ever 
allow him to participate in any contact or non-contact sport, for at least a 
year. His family knows this is well-advised medical advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua's yearning to don pads and a helmet was revived last Wednesday when he 
attended a Mira Costa practice with his therapist, the first reunion with all 
of his teammates since the aneurysm. It was an emotional meeting, one Morrow 
decided to keep within the team by banning reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members are grateful Fonua is improving but understand his desire to 
return to sports. The middle of five children, Fonua is the first to excel in 
athletics. He emerged in football last season as a starting fullback and 
defensive tackle, rushing for 403 yards and 15 touchdowns, catching 16 passes 
for 258 yards and four touchdowns and finishing with 41 tackles, 16 sacks and 
two caused fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa defeated Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos, 29-17, in the Division VII 
title game, the first championship for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua is a rare three-sport standout. He was the starting center on the 
basketball team that won the Ocean League championship, and he placed fourth in 
the shotput at the state track and field championships in June. He is powerful, 
quick and can dunk a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Football is the sport Fonua most wants to continue in college, and he has been 
mentioned on several preseason high school All-American teams. Recruiters have 
sent him letters since last year, with many of the major colleges promising a 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 When and if Fonua resumes his athletic career remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said his patient has not had complications and could resume a fairly 
normal schedule within a few months if things progress as they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't rush him into anything, however," Alexander said. "He won't be 
playing football by the fifth game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua sees things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just thinking about getting stronger," he said. "And I'm glad I'm alive."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / SEASON PREVIEW; THE TOP 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' top 20 high school football preseason poll of teams from the City 
and Southern sections, with division, last year's record and comment.  
</P>
<P>
 1. LA PUENTE BISHOP AMAT (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 11-1, lost to Antelope Valley, 21-7, in Div. I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Lancers have a new coach in Tom Salter, but the transition 
should be eased by returning talent. Running back-defensive back Daylon 
McCutcheon, fullback-defensive lineman Kory Minor and linebacker Ramogi Huma 
were All-Southern Section last season. Bishop Amat has won 10 consecutive 
league championships. 
</P>
<P>
 2. LOS ALAMITOS (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 14-0, beat Huntington Beach, 39-21, in Div. II final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Griffins have an unbeaten streak of 35 games due in large part 
to an efficient passing game. Quarterback duties have been inherited by junior 
Kevin Feterik, who performed well over the summer. Los Alamitos moves up to 
Div. I this season and has a nonleague schedule that includes powers Carson and 
Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 3. SANTA ANA MATER DEI (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 12-2, lost to Rialto Eisenhower, 56-3, in Div. I final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Monarchs are still reeling from last season's embarrassing 
performance in the title game. But Mater Dei has a better team this season, 
headed by returning starting quarterback John Flynn and heavily recruited 
offensive lineman Matt Motherway. 
</P>
<P>
 4. RIALTO EISENHOWER (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 14-0, beat Santa Ana Mater Dei, 56-3, in Div. I final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: This is supposed to be a rebuilding year for the Eagles, who are 
coming off their finest season. Many coaches are not even picking Eisenhower to 
win its league, but things should not be all that bad. Watch for receiver R. 
Jay Soward, one of the top juniors in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 5. PASADENA MUIR (Southern Section, Division II) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 8-3, lost to Fountain Valley, 34-28, in Div. II first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Mustangs have had trouble winning consistently under any coach 
except Jim Brownfield, who stepped down for the second time before last year. 
Jack Allen led the team to a league title in his first season but then watched 
a quick exit from the playoffs. As usual, Muir is loaded, with 15 returning 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
 6. ANAHEIM ESPERANZA (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 7-4, lost to Compton Dominguez, 35-19, in Div. II first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Aztecs should bounce back from a disappointing 1993. Coach Gary 
Meek has 16 starters returning from last season, including his quarterback and 
a pair of receivers. Esperanza should also dominate on both sides of the line 
as it has in prior years. 
</P>
<P>
 7. CARSON (City Section, Division 4-A) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-4, beat Dorsey, 26-0, in Div. 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Coach David Williams had a successful rookie season, guiding the 
Colts to their ninth title. He hopes to return stability to a program that was 
solid until Gene Vollnogle retired four years ago. Carson has plenty of 
offensive weapons, including quarterback Ramon Rogers and receiver J.R. 
Redmond. Its nonleague schedule is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 8. ANTELOPE VALLEY (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 7-6, lost to Santa Ana Mater Dei, 15-11, in Div. I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Antelopes were rolling along last season until they had to 
forfeit three games for using an ineligible player. They still made the 
playoffs and managed to upset top-seeded Bishop Amat in the quarterfinals. 
Returning is all-league running back Jermaine Lewis, who gained 1,541 yards as 
a junior, and quarterback Trymon Redick. 
</P>
<P>
 9. LOYOLA (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 8-4, lost to Rialto Eisenhower, 37-19, in Div. I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: One of the Southland's most solid programs is coming off one of its 
least memorable seasons, losing three of its last four games. Life won't get 
any easier in the rugged Del Rey League, but Loyola should be improved with 12 
returning starters. Questions remain at quarterback, where sophomore backup 
Scott Walter will probably see action. 
</P>
<P>
 10. IRVINE (Southern Section, Division V) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 13-1, beat Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, 41-14, in Div. IV final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Wherever the Vaqueros have gone they have won, and the team has 
plenty of talent for yet another title run. In 1991, Irvine won the Div. II 
championship. It dropped to Div. IV the following year and won that title last 
season. Yet another drop to Div. V should prove no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 11. WESTLAKE VILLAGE WESTLAKE ((Southern Section, Division III) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 8-3-1, lost to Hawthorne, 24-22, in Div. III quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Next to Los Alamitos, the Warriors should have the area's best 
passing game. Receivers Billy Miller and Mike Leibin are top prospects, and 
Coach Jim Benkert has three talented quarterbacks to choose from. There are 
holes to fill on the offensive and defensive lines, but Westlake should be 
better than it was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 12. SYLMAR (City Section, Division 4-A) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-2-1, lost to Carson, 22-21, in Div. 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Spartans, who won the 4-A title in 1992, fell one point short 
in their quest to reach the final last season. Coach Jeff Engilman talked about 
leaving in the off-season but decided to stay. Sylmar has plenty of size and 
speed. Running back Durell Price and defensive tackle Brandon McGee are two of 
many standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 13. MORENO VALLEY CANYON SPRINGS (Southern Section, Division IV) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 12-2, lost to Irvine, 41-14, in Div. IV final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Canyon Springs, the new kid on the block in the Inland Empire, is 
loaded with 14 returning starters from a team that advanced to the divisional 
final. The Cougars are not loaded with college prospects, but they have plenty 
of depth and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 14. NEWHALL HART (Southern Section, Division II) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-2, lost to Compton Dominguez, 44-42, in Div. II quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Indians have won three league titles in a row, and a fourth is 
not out of the question. The team will continue to look for the pass first with 
junior Steve McKeon calling the signals. The running game should be stronger 
with Ted Iacenda returning, and the defense should also be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 15. LONG BEACH JORDAN (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 5-6, lost to Encino Crespi, 35-7, in Div. I first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: After years of playing second fiddle to Long Beach Poly, the 
Panthers are primed to win the Moore League. Their hopes hinge on the play of 
junior quarterback Ortege Jenkins, considered one of the top all-around 
athletes in the league. Running backs Ahmad Jackson and LaJuan Gibbons add 
firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 16. SANTA FE SPRINGS ST. PAUL (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 7-4, lost to Santa Ana Mater Dei, 17-14, in Div. I first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Marijon Ancich worked miracles in his first season back at St. 
Paul, so it is only natural that expectations are higher this year. The 
Swordsmen do not return many starters, but quarterback Gerry Ceballos is back 
and will pass more often. The team faces an early test against Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 17. MISSION VIEJO TRABUCO HILLS (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 11-3, beat Costa Mesa, 44-6, in Div. VIII final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: For winning the Div. VIII title last season, the Mustangs were 
rewarded by being placed in the South Coast League and moving up to Div. I. It 
should not make any difference, however, since Trabuco Hills was 5-1 against 
South Coast League teams the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 18. LONG BEACH POLY (Southern Section, Division I) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-2, lost to Santa Ana Mater Dei, 17-14, in Div. I 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Jackrabbits are expected to battle Jordan for the Moore League 
title, an underdog role they are not used to. Poly does not return many 
starters, but its program is so solid that it rarely has rebuilding seasons. 
Leadership duties fall to senior quarterback Rob Toler, who is in his third 
year on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 19. PARAMOUNT (Southern Section, Division II) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-1, lost to Placentia El Dorado, 21-16, in Div. II first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Veteran Coach Ken Sutch is trying to put last season's 
disappointing playoff loss behind him. The Pirates entered the game seeded 
fourth with a 10-0 record. Paramount should be back in the hunt with two-time 
all-league quarterback Michael Fletcher returning. Fletcher also plays 
defensive back and returns kicks and punts. 
</P>
<P>
 20. WOODLAND HILLS TAFT (City Section, Division 4-A) 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year: 10-2, lost to Dorsey, 33-7, in Div. 4-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Many coaches in the City pointed to Taft last season as the new 
contender, and the Toreadors performed well until being routed in the playoffs. 
Starr has rebuilt the program and has several top prospects in the lineup this 
year, including running back Jerry Brown and defensive back Dashon Polk. ERIC

YOUNG QUARTERBACK COMES BACK FOR MORE; FOOTBALL: MISSION VIEJO'S MOHERMAN HAS 
ALWAYS HAD THE SIZE; NOW THE SOPHOMORE HAS SOME EXPERIENCE AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Austin Moherman knew exactly what he wanted. His goal was to be the Mission 
Viejo High varsity quarterback before his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from the be-careful-what-you-wish-for file, Moherman looked over the Mater 
Dei defense late last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was a freshman being asked to decipher and beat -- not to mention survive 
-- one of the most vicious teams in Orange County. It would be enough to make 
most experienced quarterbacks tremble in their cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moherman was too concerned to be scared. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I didn't think about them a whole lot," Moherman said. 
"Yeah, I knew I was playing one of the best teams around. I was more worried 
about what I was suppose to do than what they could do to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman's first play was a 40-yard pass completion. 
</P>
<P>
 On his shoulders has Mission Viejo placed its future. Moherman returns this 
season as the Diablos' undisputed No. 1 quarterback. He's always had the size 
-- now 6 feet 4, 170 pounds -- and skill. Now he also has the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman's presence is enough to make first-year Coach Bill Denny see bright 
days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw him out there against Mater Dei and he didn't flinch," said Denny, 
who was a Diablo assistant last season. "Now that was a rude opener. He had the 
maturity to deal with the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman has always been a quarterback with an eye to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8, he attended a quarterback camp. , where he cornered Todd Marinovich, 
then a senior at Capistrano Valley. His big question was, "What's it like to be 
a high school quarterback?" 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted was to be the varsity quarterback by the time I was a 
sophomore," Moherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 That timetable accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman was on the freshman team through the first seven games last season. 
He was savoring a victory over El Toro, which gave the Diablos a 6-1 record, 
when the phone call came. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was he being called up to the varsity, he was starting the next 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of strange," said Moherman, who also played on the varsity 
basketball team. "Everything was really new in practice. But I felt ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff wasn't so sure. So Denny decided to test the new 
quarterback in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman was in for a surprise on the first snap. Defensive back Matt Denny 
burst in on a blitz and creamed Moherman. Never mind that it was a 
seven-on-seven drill, with no linemen to block and no contact allowed with the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Matt got a little carried away," Moherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to put some stress on him right away to see how he handled it," 
Bill Denny said. "He bounced right back up and didn't say a word. We knew at 
that point we had something here." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to tell by his stats. Despite that first pass, Moherman 
struggled against Mater Dei. He completed only five of 14 passes for 59 yards 
with two interceptions. Things didn't go much better against San Clemente the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Dana Hills game. Moherman was seven of 10 for 97 yards and two 
touchdowns. The Diablos led 35-0 by halftime, and won, 42-0, to end a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get to the playoffs," Moherman said. "That's the way I'm 
approaching this season. I definitely have high goals." 
</P>
<P>
 And he tends to achieve them rapidly.

49ERS TAKE THE INTIMIDATION FACTOR AWAY FROM RAIDERS; PRO FOOTBALL: FOLLOWING 
EASY VICTORY, A CONFIDENT SAN FRANCISCO TEAM QUESTIONS THE GAME PLAN ITS 
OPPONENT USED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Monday night's showdown, many NFL experts said that the Raiders and the 
San Francisco 49ers could be playing a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
 This viewpoint, however, was not heard in the 49er locker room after their 
44-14 blowout victory as many of the San Francisco players had more questions 
about the Raider game plan than their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders tried to intimidate us and that just didn't work," linebacker 
Gary Plummer said. "That's the first thing they did wrong. We just came out and 
dominated them." 
</P>
<P>
 When the statistics sheet was passed around, the 49ers looked in amazement at 
how they had outgained the Raiders, 448 to 181, in total yardage. They also 
pointed out that they had 24 first downs to the Raiders' 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was easy out there, but you just can't stop us," running back Ricky 
Watters said. "If you try to key on me and our running game, our passing game 
will beat you. If you try to stop our pass, we'll beat you on the ground. Any 
way you look at it, you have to give something up." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being victimized by Jerry Rice's three-touchdown, record-setting game, 
the Raiders also had problems stopping the rest of the 49ers' weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever they slowed Watters, who rushed for only 37 yards but had five 
catches for 55 yards, they got burned by players like tight end Brent Jones, 
who had four catches for 59 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, San Francisco quarterback Steve Young had plenty of 
time to complete 19 of 32 passes for 308 yards and to scramble for 51 yards in 
five carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is just loaded," Watters said. "We all work together so well, it is 
just great once we get into games." 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the game, the Raiders figured to have problems slowing the 49er 
offense, but the feeling was that San Francisco would have an equal number of 
problems stopping the Raider passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 With a core of speedy receivers and the passing combination of Jeff Hostetler 
to Tim Brown, the Raiders were expected to stretch the 49er secondary with a 
vertical air attack. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they had a lot of big-time threats, with so much speed," San 
Francisco safety Tim McDonald said. "But I was very surprised to not see them 
take some shots." 
</P>
<P>
 From their opening drive, the Raiders used their deep-ball threats as decoys, 
causing the 49er secondary to line up nearly five yards deeper than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept expecting them to just let it go, but maybe since they saw us pretty 
deep, they decided to try and establish their running game," McDonald said. 
"But that didn't work because our guys up front really got after them early. 
After that, I really didn't know what they were doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider rushing attack was not the answer to open things up against the 
49ers, as the running backs gained only 34 yards in 20 carries for an average 
of 1.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect the Raiders, but they've got to realize that they can't intimidate 
just by putting on their silver and black uniforms," Plummer said. "They try to 
be physical and use cheap shots at times, but this is the NFL and that doesn't 
work all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who dropped four passes, had 147 net yards passing, Brown leading 
the team with five receptions for only 42 yards. The longest completion was a 
30-yard pass to Rocket Ismail, who gained most of that after the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 49ers celebrated their stunning victory, there was concern about the 
Raiders' Napoleon McCallum, who left the field on a stretcher after dislocating 
his knee on a tackle by Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't know what had happened until someone called for me not to 
move," Norton said. "It's very unfortunate. I just know that he was real quiet 
when he went down. He just didn't move. I wish him luck and my prayers are for 
him."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RISON PROVIDES SOME WORDS TO PLAY BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Rison's new career as a pro football forecaster wasn't a big hit with 
the Rams, who took issue Monday with the Atlanta wide receiver's prediction of 
a victory over them next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated after the Falcons' 31-28 overtime loss to the Lions at Detroit on 
Sunday, Rison said: "I'm going to guarantee a win. You can print it in USA 
Today, as far as you can print it. You can print it all the way to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison's comments made national TV highlight shows and local newspapers and 
became instant bulletin board material for the Rams, who are feeling pretty 
good about themselves coming off a 14-12 victory over Arizona on Sunday at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disrespectful," Ram free safety Anthony Newman said. "That's not 
what being a professional football player is all about. That's a bunch of high 
school . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He forgets that we still have to play a game. We're going to have a lot of 
fun out there, believe me. We're not going to say anything. We're not going to 
stoop down to his level. We're going to do something physically to show what 
we're all about." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons have won six of the past seven meetings, and the Rams haven't won 
in Atlanta since the 1989 opener. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley said he will be at Rams Park today with the intention 
of re-signing a one-year, $350,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was cut last month because bail restrictions from a federal drug 
trafficking indictment limited his travel with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor sided with Henley's attorneys Friday 
and dropped a provision from his bail that a U.S. marshal or pretrial services 
agency officer accompany Henley on the road, as long as $2 million in bail was 
posted and Henley provided an additional $200,000 cash deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked to Darryl or the Rams today," said Marvin Demoff, Henley's 
agent. "Our understanding Friday was that they were going to sign him Monday or 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan responded angrily to the postgame comment of Ram 
assistant head coach Joe Vitt, whom he has known since coaching at the 
University of Buffalo. Vitt said the Rams would be undefeated if they could 
play a Ryan team each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your information is no better than your source," Ryan said. "I remember he 
was a go-fer in Buffalo, going after coffee. I guess he's really come up in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an error by the Ram publicity department, the team's previous 
fumble return record was incorrectly reported Sunday. The record was 67 yards 
by Jim Peterson in 1975. Cornerback Todd Lyght broke it with a 74-yard return 
against Arizona. MIKE REILLEY

BASEBALL STRIKE; NO PROGRESS REPORTED DESPITE INFORMAL TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There was no indication of substantive progress in baseball's stalled labor 
negotiations Monday despite an ongoing series of unofficial contacts among some 
owners, union officials and players' agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some probes being made in an effort to find a common ground, but so 
far they've been unsuccessful," a management source said on Day 24 of the 
players' strike, the first time since 1894 that major league baseball hasn't 
been played on Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maine, President Clinton delivered a Labor Day appeal to owners and 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this Labor Day, there's still time for them to go back to work and finish 
the best baseball season in 50 years -- and I hope they will," Clinton said 
during an address to workers at the Bath Iron Works. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been only three negotiating sessions since the stoppage began on 
Aug. 12, and there are none scheduled before acting commissioner Bud Selig's 
tentative Friday deadline for canceling the remainder of the season if a 
collective bargaining agreement has not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Selig indicated Monday that there was some flexibility in that 
deadline and said he would take it "a day at a time," depending on the status 
of the situation Thursday or Friday. He is scheduled to discuss the termination 
date with Don Fehr, the union's executive director, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig met Monday with Secretary of Labor Robert Reich in Milwaukee, but 
sources said he dismissed a series of suggestions by Reich to end the strike. 
Selig refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich told the Associated Press that he had a "candid" discussion with Selig, 
who owns the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was passing through Milwaukee and I wanted to hear from him personally," 
Reich said. "I am not encouraged. I think the baseball owners and players are 
taking their customers for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said he didn't detect any movement in the owners' position, adding that 
the two sides "are still very far apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at a Democratic fund-raiser in Wasau, Wis., Reich told his audience: "I 
think there is a very good possibility we are not going to have a World Series 
this year and that would be the first time since 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) is a testament to the fact that baseball has gone from being our 
national pastime to a huge industry, in which there is, I hate to say, a huge 
amount of greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also indicated that there has been considerable discussion among 
owners -- particularly in the high-revenue group -- seeking avenues of 
compromise without a salary cap, but those, too, have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, meanwhile, is expected to charge the owners with unfair labor 
practice today or Wednesday. The complaint, to be filed with the National Labor 
Relations Board, stems from the owners' refusal to make a $7.8-million pension 
payment from All-Star game receipts. The payment was due on Aug. 1, but owners' 
negotiator Richard Ravitch maintains the owners were no longer obligated 
because the agreement had expired.

SURVIVING THOSE WONDER YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early adolescence is a pivotal phase, marked by great variation in physical 
development and acute emotional sensitivity. Youngsters are apt to test the 
limits of adult authority, seek greater independence and argue. At the same 
time, they may be immature and clingy. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say these children require a variety of activities to meet specific 
developmental needs: 
</P>
<P>
 * Positive social interaction with adults and peers. Conformity to peers is 
important but is based mostly on superficialities. Kids still want and value 
parents' opinions and guidance on basic values. 
</P>
<P>
 If parents cannot afford $200 sneakers, for instance, they should be honest 
about it. Parents need to take time to listen when kids want to talk about 
their concerns. They are advised to give kids slack over merely disturbing 
behaviors -- such as those involving hair, dress or music -- and to focus more 
on the disturbed ones, such as drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Structure and clear limits. Parents need to let kids get together with 
less-than-total supervision, but they must set limits based on safety. For 
children who are in dangerous circumstances, having a protective, controlling 
parent may keep a child alive. Otherwise, a gentle, understanding, but firm 
approach is best. 
</P>
<P>
 * Competence, achievement and creative expression. Parents should help kids 
identify talents and achieve, encouraging after-school activities or providing 
tutors if necessary. Schools need to provide high-quality instruction and 
high-interest exploratory courses with positive expectations, meaningful 
rewards and praise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Physical activity. Parents should be good role models in valuing physical 
activity and, if possible, participate together. Schools need to provide 
intramural sports or other exercise activities that involve students of all 
sizes and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meaningful participation in their families, schools and communities. Even 
parents overwhelmed by work can verbally encourage participation in service 
projects or student councils and committees.

 * Self-definition. Parents can help kids understand their own roots and 
appreciate the different backgrounds of others. Diaries can be helpful.

 "The toughest thing for parents to come to grips with is that their kids are 
growing up," said pediatrician Frank Loda, director of the Center for Early 
Adolescence at the University of North Carolina. Often, he added, they need to 
set aside time to rethink their own youthful struggles to avoid hidden agendas 
and reliving the problems of their past. LYNN SMITH

<P>
 Sound like anyone you know? 
</P>
<P>
 For the vast majority of Americans, the answer is no, says Penn State 
University sociologist Vicki Abt. But to watch daytime TV talk shows, you would 
expect the answer to be yes. And that is just one of the many things about 
these shows that is undermining America's collective psyche and social norms, 
Abt says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a blistering essay that has generated anger, anxiety and a counterattack 
among talk-show stars, Abt and co-author Mel Seesholtz of Penn State charge 
that Oprah, Phil, Sally and the rest are so devoted to portraying deviant, 
bizarre and unusual behavior that their millions of daily viewers are becoming 
numb to what is normal and abnormal, right and wrong, public and private. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, says Abt, whose paper appeared in the summer issue of the Journal of 
Popular Culture, the shows make a mockery of psychotherapy and further exploit 
people who are typically down and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudist Families Who Swap Mates  
</P>
<P>
 Grandmothers Who Strip for Fun  
</P>
<P>
 Odious! Abt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is forbidden anymore," she says. "Television emphasizes the deviant 
so that it becomes normal. If you really are normal, no one cares."  
</P>
<P>
 Abt's essay, based on 60 hours of talk-show viewing during the winter of 
1991-92, has been dismissed by a number of talk-show producers but caught the 
eye of the queen of daytime chatter: Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey has invited Abt to 
appear on her show, tentatively scheduled to air next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read (Abt's) paper and I thought, 'Well, she made some interesting points 
about blurring the line,' " says Winfrey, in a telephone interview from her 
Chicago office. "I questioned myself about whether we have ever done that. If 
we have, I feel guilty about it, because I want to uplift and enlighten." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, too, are questioning the value of talk shows. Feeling increasingly 
uncomfortable about their roles, a large group of media psychologists spent 
hours at the annual American Psychological Assn. meeting last month in Los 
Angeles planning tactics to encourage more responsible and helpful talk-show 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most media psychologists feel like I do: that talk shows are a 
double-edged sword. It's hazardous or helpful to your health depending on how 
it's done," says Laguna Beach psychologist Ellen McGrath, president of the 
APA's media division and a frequent talk-show guest. 
</P>
<P>
 Abt says her goal is to inspire a debate about whether talk shows help people 
or do more damage. But she leaves no doubt as to her view: "There have always 
been dysfunctional people and dysfunctional families, but never before have 
they been so much in our face." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that people who watch talk shows grow increasingly desensitized 
to bizarre, horrible and sick behavior and feel no responsibility to intervene 
or even care, Abt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you show deviance, the more it becomes no big deal. And when you see 
something that really should have upset you, and it's no big deal, this is very 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Abt's paper cites several destructive sins waged by talk-show hosts, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Acting as pseudo-professional counselors without suitable credentials to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating an insincere atmosphere of caring and helpfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging a culture of "victims" who are not responsible for their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take this show, Abt says: Sally Jessy Raphael has staged a reunion between a 
father and the four grown daughters he abandoned 20 years prior. The women cry. 
Sally tells them: 
</P>
<P>
 "Forgiving is so important. . . . Why don't you tell your father you love him 
and forgive him?" 
</P>
<P>
 To the father, she demands: "Say you're sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Sally to impart this advice? Abt asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows also create false illusions of caring, she says, a tactic that 
exploits vulnerable people. 
</P>
<P>
 "These hosts act like your best friend. Well, they are not going to be your 
best friend," Abt says. "Oprah is not there to listen to your problems four 
days (after taping)." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is the advice that is dispensed particularly useful, Abt says, 
although talk-show hosts like to say they serve a valuable role in educating 
the public about such issues as domestic violence and incest. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they should do is say this is purely entertainment," she says. "The 
reason they are doing this is for ratings. That is the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 In their paper, Abt and Seesholtz note that the original "Donahue" show of the 
1960s centered on celebrity, author interviews or political agendas. And while 
stars and politicians are occasional guests, most TV talk shows today focus on 
"real-life private people trying to 'fix themselves' through therapy," they 
write. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they say, the true tenets of therapy are breached continually on talk 
shows, including ensuring a patient's privacy, going slowly, evaluating the 
patient's history, dealing only with issues that the patient is ready to 
handle, tailoring therapy to fit the patient and providing referrals and 
follow-up care. 
</P>
<P>
 While a therapist can be sued for malpractice if those tenets are 
significantly violated, "A television talk show (host) as well as any laymen, 
unlicensed therapists, gurus, best-selling authors can say anything they want 
to troubled people whom they have only just met -- as long as it's 
entertaining," Abt and Seesholtz charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most offensive, Abt says, is the ease with which talk shows portray 
many of its guests as victims who are not responsible for their actions. 
"'Rather than being mortified, ashamed or trying to hide their stigma, guests 
willingly and eagerly discuss their child molesting, sexual quirks and criminal 
records in an effort to seek 'understanding' for their particular disease." 
</P>
<P>
 They cite another "Sally" episode, "When Your Best Friend Is Sleeping With 
Your Father." A daughter confronting her best friend and father onstage was 
advised to "just love them both and accept the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Abt says: "The new couple were let off the hook by the audience when they 
said they weren't to blame because they didn't plan to fall in love -- 'It just 
happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Abt is not alone in her sounding of this particular alarm. Several political 
figures, included California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, have recently bemoaned the 
"Oprah-ization of the jury pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Lundgren, in a recent Time magazine interview, suggested that too many 
potential jurists are watching talk shows and sponging up the notion that 
everyone is a victim. Juries with this collective conscience are increasingly 
likely to make allowances for someone's bad deed based on mitigating 
circumstances, such as child abuse or mental illness, he warns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that her name has been co-opted to describe the corruption of 
America's jury pools, Oprah Winfrey offers the most socially constructive show, 
say Abt and other media watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do believe that talk shows do more good than not good," Winfrey 
says. "I certainly believe that is true of our show." 
</P>
<P>
 Winfrey says she has subtly remodeled her show to avoid the sensational, silly 
and bizarre. She says she underwent a revelation earlier this year when she 
began watching some of her competitors on TV monitors while she worked out at 
the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time this year, I understood the criticism (about talk shows)," 
she says. "I never watched anyone else before." 
</P>
<P>
 Her recent shows have been on such topics as how to stop gossip, how to 
protect your child's safety in your home, and how to safeguard your home from 
break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfrey complains that whatever she does, she is sullied by being lumped with 
the other talk shows. But representatives of other shows say they have nothing 
to be ashamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Abt and Seesholtz's paper is not based on any science or even a survey, says 
Lee Fryd, director of media relations for the "Sally Jessy Raphael" show. Nor 
are the shows based on deviant topics, she says: 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot (of topics) that are universal. We did a show on 
mothers-in-law who don't like their sons' new wives. Why do you think these 
shows are popular? Because the viewing audience can identify with these 
real-life problems. These are universal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Fryd credits talk shows with helping to erase taboos and myths that cripple 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people didn't get up there and talk about incest, it would never come to 
light," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, talk shows inform, give people needed attention, allow them to get 
started toward healing, and provide a safe and supportive forum for sensitive 
exchanges, says New York psychologist Gilda Carle, a relationships therapist 
and frequent talk-show expert guest. 
</P>
<P>
 She compares talk shows to "neighbors across the fence giving advice to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "So often, people feel like no one is listening," Carle says. "When someone 
tells their story (on a show), they have everyone's undivided attention. That 
may be a sorry state of affairs, but that's the way it is. People want to be 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The shows don't pretend to do real therapy, Carle argues, only to raise 
awareness, such as the recent spate of shows on domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not instantaneous therapy. All we can do is give them a start. And I 
think we can accomplish extraordinary goals. For example, women who have 
thought they were deserving of abuse are now hearing, 'No, no, no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As for airing one's dirty laundry, Carle says that's an individual's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a man asked to appear on Raphael's show to tell his wife that he 
had cheated on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we suggested that this might not be the best time and place to tell her, 
he said, 'I know my wife best, and I know she would most appreciate me saying 
this in a public forum,' " recalls Carle, who was asked to appear alongside the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The show went on. The woman was told and broke down, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a bright side, Carle says. True to her husband's prediction, the 
hapless woman rallied and said: "If my husband insists on airing this on 
television, he must love me." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Carle: "I was able to hold her when this all happened. That could never 
have happened if he had told her in their living room or in their car, where 
she would not have had a supportive audience and someone to help her through 
the shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for airing your dirty laundry in public, well, some people prefer this as 
a way of support." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Lawrence Balter is neutral about whether talk shows help or hurt. 
A popular child psychologist in New York, he has appeared on many shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's opinions are often not clearly distinguished from actual facts and 
evidence. So the audience might be misled," says Balter, who teaches workshops 
to doctors and psychologists on how to communicate their ideas on television. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are rewarding, moments. He recalls appearing on "The Oprah Winfrey 
Show" during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers were over there. Kids were left behind. People were very frightened. 
The show got across to people how to talk to their kids and deal with it," 
Balter says. "That was an excellent service to offer people. . . . A 
responsible talk-show format has the potential of doing tremendous good." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, executive director of the Psychology Center in Laguna Beach, says she 
wholly agrees with many of Abt and Seesholtz's criticisms and is particularly 
concerned about what happens to guests after the show ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on the show is a seductive experience (for the guests)," says McGrath, 
an expert on depression. "But there is an enormous letdown afterward. There is 
no safety net. Half of the people are very upset after going on. I end up 
having to do a lot of post-trauma therapy in the Green Room." 
</P>
<P>
 But, like Balter, she agrees to do some shows because of the opportunity to do 
good. After doing a "Montel Williams Show" on depression, McGrath invited the 
audience to write to her if they wanted a free information packet on 
depression. She received more than 1,000 requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "These shows (tell us) what kinds of problems people have and what potential 
solutions they can consider," she says. "There is enormous potential to help 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk shows seem to be moving away from the more deviant and inflammatory 
topics, McGrath notes. And to encourage this trend, the American Psychological 
Assn.'s media division recently updated its ethical guidelines to help 
psychologists and talk-show producers avoid inappropriate or hurtful 
situations, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also is developing a TV consultants directory for talk-show 
producers that will list psychologists willing to help with responsible program 
development (including choosing guests to avoid exploiting vulnerable people) 
and plan a program after the show to assist guests who need therapy or support 
in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there is an increasing push for more research on the effects of talk 
shows, McGrath says. In one of the first studies on this subject, she found 
that people who watch several talk shows a day are significantly more depressed 
than the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 If talk shows do want to do good, leaving viewers morose is not the way to go 
about it, McGrath says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see 15 or 17 major talk shows and this proliferation of Victimville, 
you know it has all been said and done. I think that wave is ready to break. 
People are going to get sick and tired of it. They see and feel that it is not 
good for them." Friends of Yours?

THE MIDDLE AGES; WHAT IF I GET TEASED? BEATEN UP LOST? THOUSANDS OF KIDS WILL 
LEAVE THE COMFORT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THIS YEAR FOR THE HALLS OF JUNIOR HIGH. 
AND THEY'RE ALL FIGHTING THEIR OWN FEARS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first day of middle school, 10-year-old Mario Pallais was too nervous to 
eat. Schoolmate Marie Paulino, 11, asked if she could stay home. Their insides 
were shaking because in just a few minutes, the youngsters would be launched 
into a new universe, a world fraught, they had heard, with endless 
possibilities for personal humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fall term arrives, thousands of Southland kids like them are worrying 
with varying degrees of hysteria:  
</P>
<P>
 What if I get lost and have to ask directions from an older kid who makes fun 
of me? 
</P>
<P>
 What if they notice I'm wearing fake Adidas from Payless? 
</P>
<P>
 What if I get beaten up? 
</P>
<P>
 What if they make me change clothes for P.E. in front of everyone? 
</P>
<P>
 What if I get a pimple on the end of my nose? 
</P>
<P>
 What if the teachers are mean to me? 
</P>
<P>
 What if I don't know anyone?  
</P>
<P>
 Switching from elementary schools to larger, more impersonal junior highs or 
middle schools never has been easy. Not only are kids leaving a single 
classroom teacher for multiple, specialized teachers, they are switching during 
puberty -- a growth spurt second only to infancy in its velocity of change -- 
and the excruciatingly painful self-consciousness and wild energy that goes 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is also the additional, sometimes legitimate, fears of bodily harm 
and drugs, which, to them, just get lumped in with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid to get beat up and I'm afraid to get talked about," said Candace 
Marshall, 11, who still likes to play with Barbies. This fall, when she enters 
Marshall Fundamental School, which includes grades 6 through 12, she said, "I'm 
going to be the youngest person there and there are bigger kids around me and 
everything. I've got to learn to act right around them. If I'm acting childish, 
they'll say, 'Oh, look at that girl over there, she's acting all childish. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Her solution: "I think I might have bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
 Some are afraid their belongings will be stolen; others are afraid they 
themselves might vanish. Crystal Noe of Pasadena, a seventh-grader, said she's 
no longer eligible for the district school bus and dreads, as do some adults, 
having to ride the MTA. "I just don't want to get stolen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Wilson Middle School in Pasadena, Ingrid Wilk, 11, figures the 
worst thing that could happen to her would be to get "jumped into a gang." She 
knows how it goes: "First they ask you. If you say, 'Yeah,' they say, 'We'll 
meet here at this time' and stuff. The whole gang comes and they say, 'Are you 
ready?' and you say, 'I guess.' And they start beating you up. They hit you 
with bats." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, girls who say no also get beaten up, she shrugged. "It's like, 
which way to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the methods are only slightly more refined. Marisa Jester, 
12, going into Los Alisos Intermediate School in Mission Viejo, said she's 
heard that "people will have girlfriends go over and ask if you like them, and 
then they tell them what you said about them and the little group gets on you 
and threatens you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making it all worse is the urge to conform, which peaks during early 
adolescence, said Anne Petersen, professor of adolescent development and 
pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. "It puts more pressure on kids to 
find out what the rules are. It's a time when kids are much more likely to 
worry about all sorts of extra things." 
</P>
<P>
 How they look, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, there is precious little physical conformity in middle school. 
While some students weigh less than 50 pounds, others look so mature they have 
been mistaken for parents. Some girls still snuggle with stuffed animals, while 
some boys wear full beards and want to make out behind the buildings. 
Sometimes, child and adult coexist in the same cartoon-like body: bone-thin 
legs planted in sneakers the size of ski boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she started at Le Conte Middle School, a year-round school in Hollywood, 
a few weeks ago, it's been clear that Marie Paulino is the smallest girl in 
school. She said her 46-pound backpack weighs more than she does. "Just because 
I'm small, they think I'm stupid," she said. "I try to tell them, not with 
words, but with eye contact. I give them a sorry look." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, girls and boys who develop earlier than others can have 
problems that last into adulthood -- especially girls, Petersen said. Without 
social or emotional maturity to match, they often become easy prey for older 
boys or young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingrid said she has two friends like that. "Boys would always go up to (one 
girl) and say, 'Let me grab your chest.' She was sitting down one day and a boy 
grabbed her chest really hard and she started crying and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't tell that to (my other friend). She would grab them by the hair 
and throw them around." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who conducted a long-term study of middle-school students, said: 
"One of the most interesting things is that the body type that kids have in 
junior high tends to persist in our data into adulthood. Kids who were fat in 
early adolescence think of themselves as a fat person even if they're not fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is a time of heightened emotions, those years tend to be remembered 
with more clarity -- a phenomenon known as "hot cognition." Especially if it's 
painful. "A lot of the kids in these various (long-term) studies talk about the 
years of early adolescence being the worst of their life so far," Petersen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 (How many adults still have nightmares about forgetting their locker 
combinations? Hands, please.) 
</P>
<P>
 Adina Nack, 21, said she was labeled by classmates and even teachers as a 
nerdy brain in junior high. It wasn't until her sophomore year in high school 
that she began to shed that internalized image. "I had my first boyfriend and 
he was not a nerd. He was a jock. He had a varsity letter. I felt like I had 
finally reached acceptability status." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently graduated from UC Irvine, she said she retains "a tinge of animosity" 
toward the really popular people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't wish them ill," she said. "But I'm looking forward to reunions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are painfully aware that difference brings ridicule and sometimes danger. 
For some, clothes can be the first line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to dress up-to-date," said Donald Boyd, 11, of Pasadena. "The first day 
of school, I'm wearing black jeans, creased hard, and a white shirt. I can't be 
going in no bell bottoms with an Afro on top of my head. I'd be the 
laughingstock of the year on the first day of school. I'd be considered a 
nerd." 
</P>
<P>
 Phi Nguyen, 13, recalled her first day at El Rancho Middle School in Anaheim 
Hills. "Everyone is looking at everyone else and you're looking down at your 
own clothes, and looking at everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mission Viejo's Marisa: "If you're not wearing the labels No Fear, 
Stussy, Mossimo, they make fun of you. They say, 'Nice clothes, cheapie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, "You have to have shoes that go with the outfit, or you're not 
there," said Mia Nakao, a second-year student at Oak Avenue Intermediate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all kids are traumatized by the transition. Researchers said about 80% of 
kids get through middle school without falling apart, about the same success 
rate people in general have getting through life. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that self-esteem drops among both boys and girls in junior high, 
probably because of their loss of status. But by the end of the first year, 
their esteem has returned to the same level prior to the transition, said 
Douglas MacIver, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some kids, it's a piece of cake. They use the newness as a challenge and 
really grow as a result of it," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on seventh grade at Corona del Mar High School, Danielle 
McDermott, 12, said, "It was my best year. I made a lot of friends. I had good 
teachers. I liked the breaks and we had all kinds of lunch things, like 
McDonald's. You could leave for lunch if you wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Her grades improved to straight A's. "We did more creative thinking." Math -- 
a notorious bete noir for girls -- was her best subject, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the difference is the school environment itself, said Anthony 
Jackson, program officer with the Carnegie Corp. of New York, which funds a 
national reform movement to make middle schools more user-friendly. Many 
schools, particularly in California, are starting to hold orientation programs 
the preceding spring to de-traumatize the transition and have instituted team 
teaching to create smaller, more personal, schools within schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as Le Conte switched from grades seven to nine to grades six to 
eight, the school also eliminated the use of lockers and instituted uniforms in 
an effort to better monitor students and identify outsiders. "I'm not sure if 
it's the uniforms or eliminating the lockers or the grade change, but it's 100% 
better," teacher Nancy Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they want, kids can wear their gym clothes all day long. ("It hasn't been 
that bad, actually," said P.E. teacher Jeanette Young.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most middle schools are aware of the need for reform, Jackson said, but only a 
small percentage is pursuing change aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 For some children, their distress over middle school can push them over the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year somewhere in the U.S. at the beginning of school, a kid is found 
hanging from a tree or with a shotgun blast in his head, usually a boy, because 
of P.E.," said Joan Lipsitz, founder of the Center for Early Adolescence at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

 "Sometimes it happens at first report card time; he's terrified to take home a 
report card with an F. And the reason he has an F is that he refused to take 
off his clothes and if you don't get into gym shorts, you don't get credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Parker, a gym teacher at La Conte, said some boys don't want their legs 
to show. "It'll be a hundred degrees and they'll be wearing sweats, they're so 
self-conscious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls have developed elaborate methods of changing underneath large 
T-shirts, or holding up towels for one another in specially reserved corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond changing, the playing field itself can terrify kids. "The thing that 
scares me most is getting crushed in football," said Damian Butler, 13, who is 
about to enter Washington Middle School in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the middle school transition has almost become a rite of 
passage in a culture lacking such unified, formal rituals. Girls particularly 
start dressing more maturely, with make up and dangling earrings. Older boys 
like to initiate the younger ones with pranks, similar to fraternity hazing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Le Conte, newcomers have been called "scrubs" for generations. 
"Sixth-graders are toilet scrubbers. Eighth-graders are kings," explained Ruben 
Andreasyan, 11, who has been in middle school a few weeks now.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, sixth-graders get "scrubbed" (given a noogie -- or Dutch rub) or 
"corded" (beaten up). Explained 8th-grader Fernando Trebno: "If somebody acts 
stupid in class, then everybody starts saying, 'Cord, cord, cord. . . .' When 
they go out, everybody jumps on them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they flush some kids' heads in the toilet," said Ronnie Ramirez, 
11. In the locker room, older boys snapped him with a towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still and all, he said, "I thought it was going to be worse." 
</P>
<P>
 After only a few weeks, Mario Pallais said most of his fear is gone. Often 
lost the first day, he got directions from teachers. "The second day, I was 
getting better and better, and now I don't get that lost," he said. Teachers 
were nicer than he was led to believe and he hasn't been hurt. At least, he 
said, "Not yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Presnell, 11, a classmate at Le Conte, said before she started school, 
she was afraid she might be killed. One time a stranger did mug her off campus, 
she said, and attempted to strangle her with a string when she refused him 
money. But the string broke and she escaped by pretending to take a bus home, 
she added proudly. On the bright side, she said, "The first day of school, I 
made four new friends. And I didn't need directions." And she's chosen to wear 
her gym clothes all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking forward to their next chapter, most kids might agree with Ingrid from 
Pasadena, who knows her feelings are definitely mixed. "I'm excited because I'm 
going to a new school and meeting new people and everything and I'm nervous," 
she said, "because of the exact same reason I was excited."

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: COUSINS CONJURE SLAVISH DEVOTION FOR SHARED DREAMS 
OF 'JEANNIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Saturday 7 p.m. Channel 4: "I Dream of Jeannie, the '90s Version." Alfonso 
Luna moves in with Josef Rodriguez and he starts cleaning house. In a corner of 
a kitchen cabinet he comes across a dusty genie bottle and rubs it. Nothing 
happens, but the discovery does prompt the wacky cousins to confess a mutual 
love for the "I Dream of Jeannie" show. They start an antique business and 
begin collecting Jeannie items.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OK, this plot doesn't quite have the zing of the original '60s TV show, but 
what would you expect in the too-hip and politically correct '90s? Folks just 
aren't going to buy the idea of a curvaceous blond Arab telling a WASPish 
astronaut, "Thou may ask anything of thy slave, Master"not in Al Bundy's 
wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 PC or no, the original "I Dream of Jeannie" has remained fresh for some 
audiences long after Jeannie's bottle was uncorked. The show, which lasted five 
seasons from 1965 until 1970, now airs six times every Thursday night on 
Nickelodeon. Series star Barbara Eden is slated to donate a Jeannie bottle and 
leave her handprints Wednesday at the Santa Ana Planet Hollywood in a luncheon 
benefiting the Wellness Community. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to Rodriguez and Luna, there are still lots of Jeannie fanatics 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know several Jeannie collectors," Rodriguez said, "but the sad realization 
is that they're really psycho. There's one guy who would die to have Barbara 
Eden's original costume. So he could wear it. Fortunately, he's in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Psycho may be a relative matter, particularly since we have photos of 
Rodriguez and Luna kissing their Jeannie dolls. Granted, we asked them to, but 
they could have said no. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luna, 37, is a first generation Jeannie fan, while his cousin Rodriguez, 27, 
didn't start dreaming about her until the show was in rerun syndication. When 
Luna moved into Rodriguez's apartment 2 1/2 years ago, he did indeed find a 
Jeannie bottle in the kitchen, though he had to be quite a fan to recognize it 
as such.  
</P>
<P>
 It actually was a 1964 Jim Beam whiskey decanter, identical to the ones 
Jeannie producer Sidney Sheldon had taken to be painted to arrive at the 
Middle-Eastern-looking urn used on the show. "Alfonso was so in awe of it, 
you'd have thought he did find a genie in it," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after that, the cousins had the bottle painted to be a replica of the 
one on the show. It became their good luck mascot in launching their part-time 
antiques-dealing business called Endangered Pieces. On weekdays, Rodriguez 
works for the Pennysaver while Luna is a custodian for the Brea Unified School 
District.  
</P>
<P>
 The bottle seems to have given them good luck so far. The apartment is 
furnished and decorated in '50s chic, and -- though they were told they were 
very hard to come by -- they've amassed a respectable trove of Jeannie items.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prize of those is one of the 10 original prop bottles used in the show. It 
is authenticated and they paid more for it than they'd care to say. It resides 
in a glass case with cherished personal mementos, such as Luna's father's 
violin and the flag from Rodriguez's father's burial. 
</P>
<P>
 They have several Jeannie dolls, valued at around $400, as well as one 
actually used in the show that is worth far more (it is from a 1966 episode 
where Jeannie turned a telescope into a Jeannie doll to please a child -- and 
the toy's manufacturers, one presumes). There's a Jeannie game, Halloween 
costume, comics, books, and other trinkets, including a Mardi Gras coin from 
Metairie, La., commemorating the show. 
</P>
<P>
 They started up a videocassette of the 1965 debut episode as we talked. In it 
astronaut Capt. Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) is stranded on a desert island and 
finds a mysterious bottle and, probably hoping it's Jim Beam, pops the cork. 
Out steams Eden in bare-midriff harem suit, declaring "I'm your slave, Master," 
which, of course, causes Nelson to do nothing but fret and worry for five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the many things to have happened in their lifetimes, what made the 
cousins focus on a '60s sitcom? 
</P>
<P>
 Luna said, "I liked it because it was entertaining. It caught my attention 
that there was magic in it, and problems she'd get into and solve. I also liked 
'Bewitched.' I watched a lot of TV but, Jeannie's the only one I watched then 
that is still on my mind now. And compared to the programs today, it's clean 
and there's no violence in it." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think Barbara Eden's beautiful," explained Rodriguez. "She's drop-dead 
gorgeous. And it's such a very unique, different show. Even though people 
compared it to 'Bewitched' and 'Bewitched' may have been just as good in some 
ways, Barbara Eden really did it for me. She's everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, though, the pair haven't taken much interest in Eden's non-Jeannie 
roles, a respectable body of work including "Ride the Wild Surf," "The Amazing 
Dobermans," the TV movie "The Feminist and the Fuzz" and several episodes of 
"Dallas" with old co-star Hagman. Asked if they belong to the Barbara Eden fan 
club, Rodrigues responded, "We don't want any part of it. They don't really 
focus on Jeannie, but on the other parts of her career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They claim to like all the episodes of the TV show, with a particularly warm 
regard for the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have seen this at least 100 times. Every time we invite someone 
over we watch it. And every time it's like we're seeing it for the first time," 
Rodriguez said. And indeed, as we sat there, the two stared, rapt, at the 
screen.  
</P>
<P>
 That first season, by the way, was in black and white, and in most episodes 
Eden wore a veil over her belly to mask the fact that she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many sitcoms, the basic premise of "I Dream of Jeannie" seemed at odds 
with reality. Not nearly so implausible as finding a genie in a bottle was the 
concept that Capt. Nelson (promoted to major in subsequent seasons) didn't 
comport himself as others might when given a beautiful slave with magical 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubtless, millions of male Americans watched the program each week wondering, 
"Why, why why , doesn't Tony Nelson just have Jeannie turn Admiral Bellows and 
everyone else into chewy dog toys and then have Jeannie slip into something 
more comfortable?" 
</P>
<P>
 Luna and Rodriguez have their own different, if entirely honorable, ideas 
about what they'd do if they had a genie. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said, "I would take away bigotry, the hatred in the world and would 
make sure everybody had happiness, because the world is going downhill and 
somebody needs to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do the same," said Luna. "I'd end a lot of the selfishness and greed in 
the world, have a world where you could leave your home without locking your 
doors, a more happy place." 
</P>
<P>
 And then? 
</P>
<P>
 "And then maybe wish for more time with Jeannie," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They tried to meet Eden once at a event where she was signing autographs, but 
the line was too long. They doubt they'll be able to get out of work Wednesday 
to see her at Planet Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime they fear they might be running out of Jeannie items to 
collect. They still need the coloring book and the doll in a blue outfit (they 
came in several colors), but they think they've cornered the market on the Jim 
Beam decanters, having about 100 of them in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one Jeannie comeback, a 1985 TV movie. Rodriguez has mixed feelings 
about whether the show could fly in the '90s.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would probably offend a lot of people," he said. "The master and slave 
thing probably wouldn't go over too well with the women's movement. But Jeannie 
could make it work, because she was by no means a slave. She had Nelson wrapped 
around her finger and she knew it."

LAUGH LINES; IN ARKANSAS, TRY NOT TO SWAT YOUR LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's become very popular these days to stereotype all people from Arkansas as 
bug-eating hillbillies. Right off the bat, I must emphasize that such a thing 
is terribly unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the bug-eating thing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent Mosquito Cook-Off at Crowley's Ridge State Park in Walcott, 
Ark., not everyone dined on the blood-sucking insects. Only about 100 people 
did. The rest went with the more traditional Arkansas picnic fare -- the 
opossum and provolone Hoagie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mosquito contest, the big winner thrilled the judges with a 
mouth-watering batch of cookies. Sure chocolate chip is slightly more popular, 
but for crying out loud, chocolate just isn't very good for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The cook-off champion, a guy named Larry -- I don't know if he has two 
brothers named Daryl and Darrell -- starts by crushing the mosquitoes. Crush 
them lightly, he insists, because you sure don't want to be snapping the wings 
off the main ingredient in any recipe. He then scrapes the bugs into a mixture 
of brown sugar and maple syrup. If syrup isn't available, Larry says you can 
substitute crankcase oil from your Uncle Gomer's plow. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he boils the concoction, which he claims rids the bugs of 16 
disease-carrying bacteria. While he admits he's no doctor -- a confession that 
shocked the townsfolk, many of whom had never in 20 years questioned his 
routine demand to "Take off your clothes and cough for me!" -- his explanation 
about cleansing the bugs of disease is good enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 (Of course, the Menendez brothers' initial explanation that they were only 
skeet shooting and their parents "popped up out of nowhere" was also good 
enough for me.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, when the cookies came out of the oven, people swarmed all over them, 
slapping each other over and over again to get to them because, well, there was 
no longer anything else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tasted good," a 20-year-old resident told the Associated Press, which will 
pretty much cover anything if it's close to one of their bureaus. "You couldn't 
taste the mosquitoes at all." 
</P>
<P>
 You could sense the disappointment in his voice. Apparently he had saddled up 
the mule for the five-mile trip to the park so he could taste the mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coulda' gotten regular cookies at home," he said. He then named about 35 
other things he could have gotten at home, a list that included "drunk" and 
"all covered in slop." 
</P>
<P>
 Other lip-smacking mosquito foods in the contest were mosquito pizza, chili 
with mosquitoes and -- you might want to lean your head real close to the 
toilet bowl before you read this next one -- mosquito meat pie. (Hey, don't say 
I didn't warn you.) 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the contest came from park rangers who said -- honest to God -- 
that they wanted to get rid of the pesky insects because so many people 
complained about the flying bacteria ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 And in case you were wondering, this was the second annual mosquito cook-off. 
Translated, that means the people had it last year and liked it so much they 
went home that night and danced with the livestock, bless their closely linked 
blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
 And, based on the fact that the mosquito-eating thing was caused by complaints 
about the bugs, I believe we should all fall to our knees right now and pray 
that the people of Arkansas don't start complaining about dog droppings in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Because if they do, and if things follow their usual pattern down there -- 1. 
Define problem. 2. Cook it. -- well, I'm leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. So we've cleared up that bug-eating business. Now, about that 
they're-all-hillbillies thing. Nothing could be further from the. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. All out of space.

BODY WATCH; BATTLE OF THE BINGE; IT'S BECOME A RITE OF PASSAGE AT COLLEGE: 
DRINKING JUST TO GET DRUNK. BUT OFFICIALS AREMOVING TO EDUCATE STUDENTS ABOUT 
THE DANGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget pledging to a fraternity or attending the first home football game. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an increasingly popular rite of passage for college freshmen: Getting 
falling-down drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Binge drinking has emerged as one of the unhealthiest aspects of college life, 
with freshmen of both sexes and students who live in fraternities and 
sororities most likely to spend at least one night a week drinking to get 
drunk, health experts say. This phenomenon has always been around, but never 
have so many students -- particularly women -- reported bingeing. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, on the heels of a disturbing report from Columbia University, 
colleges across the land are taking steps to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranging from peer counseling to health fairs to private counseling, campus 
officials are alerting students to the risks of binge drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some campuses are tightening policies regarding alcohol use at 
campus events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years between 19 and 24 are a window of high risk. It's a dangerous time. 
But we have found that we can assist young adults through this risk period," 
says Alan Marlatt, director of Columbia University's Addictive Behaviors 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Binge drinking, usually defined as consuming five or more drinks at one 
sitting, has been a growing concern on colleges for several years. But the 
report from Columbia portrayed the phenomenon as severe and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 It found: 
</P>
<P>
 * One in three students can be described as an alcohol abuser. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of women who deliberately binged rose from 10% in 1977 to 35% 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bingeing causes serious problems such as violence, vandalism and school 
failure. According to the report, 90% of campus rapes involve drinking by the 
assailant, and 60% of women who contract sexually transmitted diseases are 
under the influence during intercourse. (It's the risk of these repercussions 
that students often ignore when they set out for what they think will be a 
harmless night of partying.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a study at the University of Washington -- which operates one of the most 
sophisticated binge-drinking prevention programs in the nation as part of a 
federally funded study -- students admitted that bingeing led to negative 
consequences. Forty percent reported getting into fights after bingeing and 30% 
said they blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you ask them whether they are problem drinkers, only 16% of the 
students say they are," Marlatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the students right? Is binge drinking merely a social activity or are 
these students alcohol abusers -- or worse -- alcoholics? 
</P>
<P>
 To address binge drinking, health officials have had to come up with an answer 
to that question, Marlatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his research, the vast majority of students who binge do not fit 
the definition of alcoholism, which includes a gradual tolerance to the 
substance, drinking larger amounts over a long period of time, spending great 
amounts of time plotting how to obtain the substance and withdrawal symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they do seem to fit the other category of 'alcohol abuse,' " Marlatt 
says. "That is defined as the recurrent use in situations that are hazardous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, binge drinking in college does seem to have a social element 
attached to it, he notes. His study found that incoming freshmen -- known for 
their partying ways -- drink the most and that alcohol use declines over the 
four years of college. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women living in the Greek system tend to binge more, followed by 
students living in dormitories and, lastly, students who commute to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most college students drink less as they get older, and there is a maturing 
out when it comes to problem drinking," Marlatt says. "After age 25 people are 
not as influenced by peer pressure and they seem to know their drinking 
limits." 
</P>
<P>
 But getting younger students -- who are usually under the legal age limit -- 
to avoid alcohol abuse is more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Columbia report, experts advocated a campuswide effort to deglamorize 
alcohol, including banning liquor and beer ads on campus and strict regulation 
of drinking at campus events. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlatt has taken a more voluntary approach. In his study, incoming freshman 
answer a questionnaire designed to identify potential alcohol abusers, usually 
those students who binged in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 These students are asked to enroll in the study, in which half receive a 
private counseling session about the risks associated with binge drinking. 
These students also receive a feedback sheet that shows them how much they are 
drinking and offers non-judgmental advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, the students who received the counseling had a 28% decline in 
alcohol consumption compared to a 14% drop among the students without the 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in the counseled group also reported taking fewer risks while 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get a significant difference in the number of times a person said they 
had sex while intoxicated," Marlatt says. 
</P>

 While most colleges don't have the resources to privately counsel hundreds of 
freshmen, most are addressing binge drinking in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Student Health Center at USC take substance abuse outreach 
programs to residence halls. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, students can take a for-credit course called Students to Enhance 
Peer Sobriety (STEPS). These students learn how to become peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, STEPS counselors made 45 presentations to campus groups, says Ellen 
Thomas, director of health education at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is also introducing the Responsible Hospitality program, which 
teaches licensed alcohol servers about responsible alcohol use but can be 
applied to informal settings, such as private parties, Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fraternities have also asked for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been very receptive. We have a lot of students striving to 
implement the program this year," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, awareness of the risks of binge drinking has also permeated the 
campus, says Vicky Luce, coordinator of the Natural High program, which 
encourages substance-free activities for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming freshmen receive information on the topic during orientation -- as do 
their parents during a separate program. And, the Student Welfare Commission 
sponsors health fairs that include alcohol abuse information, Luce says. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is a "dry" campus; that is, alcohol is not allowed on campus. And even 
off-campus Greek residences must abide by rules governing alcohol abuse, she 
says. Presentations to discourage bingeing are offered regularly in 
fraternities and sororities. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she says: "The problem is dying down there considerably."

FITNESS: BODY WATCH; HOW TO KEEP THE BOUNCE OUT OF SPORTS

 In the old days, so the story goes, women wore two bras at once to prevent 
"breast bounce" while exercising. That, of course, was before the birth of the 
first sports bra. In 1978, two women runners sewed together two jock straps, 
creating the prototype Jogbra. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, an explosion of options has joined the lineup. At least 10 
companies now offer sports bras, industry experts estimate, with models ranging 
from plain-Jane discount store models for under 10 bucks to flowered underwire 
models costing $35 and up. Women spend about $30 million a year on sports bras, 
according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Candidates: Well-endowed women tend to have more discomfort than 
smaller-breasted women if exercising without a supportive bra. Still, 
physicians and exercise experts encourage every woman to wear a well-fitting, 
supportive bra, especially if they engage in such "high-bounce" activities as 
running, volleyball, cheerleading, basketball and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always good to wear a sports bra, even if you're not doing high-impact 
activities," says Rudy Hayek, a Tarzana exercise physiologist, "because it 
helps stabilize the torso." 
</P>
<P>
 "The structures that support the breast are relatively weak," says LaJean 
Lawson, a Portland, Ore., exercise scientist and former professor who has 
researched sports bras for about a decade. When stretched during exercise, the 
breast skin recovers, whether a woman wears a bra or not, Lawson says. But 
supporting the breasts firmly but gently while exercising is definitely the 
better idea, she and other experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Options: The plain white sports bra has lots of company these days. 
Jogbra, for instance, still offers traditional white styles along with more 
fashionable floral prints and hot colors such as French blue and jade. 
</P>
<P>
 For fuller-breasted women, there's the New Sports Bra, an underwire model 
created by Kimberly Mattson, a Los Angeles accountant and fitness enthusiast 
who never liked the choice of sports bras when she went shopping. The bras, she 
says, are "non-compressive," meaning they support without flattening. They're 
available in black, white, florals and other colors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting Tips: Finding a supportive sports bra that's also comfortable is the 
main goal, say exercise experts. "What's best depends on the size of the woman 
and the sport," Lawson says. While smaller-busted women (A and B cups) might 
not need maximal support, they should still look for fabrics with good ability 
to draw away moisture, Lawson says, and straps that don't bind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an A or B size, you can probably get by spending only $12 or $15 
for a sports bra," says Lawson, who also consults for a sports bra 
manufacturer. But those with C cup or above probably will need to spend more to 
get maximal support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some sports bras are quite effective, some are not," says Dr. Gerry Smith, 
assistant professor of exercise science at Oregon State University, Corvallis, 
who has also researched sports bras. "The materials are a good clue. If it is 
just elastic, probably it is not good enough support." 
</P>
<P>
 "A sports bra really needs to fit well around the rib cage," adds Anne 
Boschma, who has researched the fit and function of sports bras while a 
graduate student researcher at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linking Bra with Sport: Select a bra suited to your activity, experts suggest. 
Jogbra, for instance, advises consumers to pick styles labeled "Low MCR" -- for 
motion control requirements -- if they plan to engage in low-impact sports such 
as cross-country skiing, walking or weight training. They should pick styles 
labeled "Medium MCR" for rowing, fast walking or step aerobics, and those 
labeled "High MCR" for soccer, running, martial arts and other high-impact 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do a few movements (similar to your workout) and see if it is comfortable," 
Mattson says. When shopping, wear whatever you normally wear working out so you 
can see how the bra fits underneath it, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance Clues: When a sports bra starts to stretch in areas that didn't 
used to, it's probably time for a trade-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying again, remeasure, Mattson suggests, especially if your weight 
has changed. Even if weight remains stable, take measurements every year or so.

FIRST PERSON: BODY WATCH; DISCOVERING FOREIGN COUNTRIES ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My favorite benefit of physical exertion will always be a higher allowance of 
chocolate consumption. But I cannot deny that exercise adds measurably to my 
overall energy level, especially when I'm traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 If I have flown through six time zones, eaten food of dubious origin and slept 
fitfully on unforgiving surfaces only to be rewarded with a panoramic view of 
Acme International Headquarters, I will feel cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, conducting good business is its own reward, but a pair of running shoes 
and a reasonably game attitude yield much higher interest for life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, running is replacement therapy. It replaces almost any other exercise 
that proves untenable for lack of time, facility, companionship or clement 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 I run. I despise it. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the road, I am uncharacteristically willing to suspend my animosity. I 
have discovered that running in a foreign environment not only assuages the 
guilt that comes with sampling the local cuisine -- it is, after all, only 
polite -- but it enables me to examine unfamiliar territory in a wholly 
personal way. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first trip to Australia many years ago, I was faced with the prospect of 
a day spent slammed in the back of a minivan with eight other journalists 
shuttling between presentations of questionable interest. 
</P>
<P>
 From my Grampian Mountains accommodations, I arose early the first day for a 
run. It was drizzling as I set out on a lonely dirt road. The soapy odor of 
lemon gum trees weighted the air and I happily splashed through huge puddles, 
rendering them puddlettes. Suddenly, about 20 yards ahead, an enormous gray 
figure bopped forcefully across the road and into the dense, scrubby bush. It 
was my first unfettered kangaroo, and I was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a mile farther, an open plain flattened off to my right, revealing an 
awesome society of emus, stalking along in purposeful motion. Nothing, 
including my photographs of the trip, is more indelible than the memory of that 
smell, that rain, those animals. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a remotely fast runner -- although I recall a pastoral run in 
Northern California when a sudden, scuffling noise from the thick underbrush 
along the road propelled me into a world-class sprint. I would never be 
confused with dedicated competitors whose thigh measurements are roughly 
equivalent to those of their biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm a steady runner, and I'm fit. My mind is more willing to concentrate 
on work after I have worshiped at the temple of my body. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cultures, apparently, agree. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Hong Kong seemed an exciting, big Asian city that was little 
different from exciting, big Western cities. My mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning as I jogged along the Kowloon waterfront, square in the face of 
the rising sun, otherworldliness crept in. Junks rolled patiently on the 
lapping water. At the edge of a small greensward, a number of caged birds 
watched eight or 10 elderly Chinese lost in the balletic practice of tai chi. 
Although I was not impeding their routine, my footfalls were audible and I felt 
like an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon my return to the hotel, I asked the concierge about the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pets," she replied, "need exercise too."

BOOKS & AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY: FINDING AND LOSING A POSTWAR 'PARADISE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her first book, "Eva's War: A True Story of Survival," Eva Krutein of 
Irvine provided a compelling, first-hand account of surviving World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young married woman, she and her 14-month-old daughter were forced to 
flee the Red Army as it advanced into her native Danzig, the former free state 
that was annexed by Germany in 1939 and later became part of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 book dramatically chronicled the hardships and horrors of war from a 
civilian perspective: Huddling with strangers in shelters during bombings, 
fellow civilians rummaging for food in garbage cans, entire families "living 
like rats in holes," beneath the rubble of their former homes, a female friend 
who was raped 30 times by Russian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Krutein, a retired music teacher, is back with a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paradise Found, and Lost" (Amador Publishers; $11) picks up the Kruteins 
story after the family immigrated to Chile in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 Krutein said in an interview that an unsettling political situation in Europe 
and the threat that the Soviet Union would occupy western Europe prompted her 
and her family to leave Wilhelmshaven, Germany, where they had been living 
since the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to have to go through the same thing twice: Running away from 
the Russians at the last moment to become refugees as we did in the first book 
and lose everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krutein's husband, Manfred, who served as a lieutenant in the German navy, had 
opened a private shipyard on the North Sea after the war. "So," she said, "we 
made a lot of money and could go to America with our three children and take 
everything, including the piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Their plans to immigrate to the U.S., however, were quickly dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immigration office said we needed a sponsor. We didn't know a single 
soul, therefore we went to South America. Chile and Venezuela were the only 
South American countries that accepted immigrants at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Chile, Manfred found a job as a mining engineer and Eva worked as an 
opera coach and gave piano and harpsichord concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 To Krutein, Chile "was a paradise. For me, it was the wonderful nature, the 
beauty of the country. That's why we went there, and we found it 100 times more 
beautiful than we thought. And they're very nice, warm, outgoing people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kruteins had to learn to speak Spanish and to deal with the culture shock 
of living in a country where, she said, "Manana doesn't mean tomorrow. It means 
sometime or never. If you have an appointment, you get there on time and either 
people show up after an hour or not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the book, which is written like a novel, also deals with machismo and 
the lack of women's rights in Chile. "If women are beaten by their husbands, 
they accept it because there are no laws for the women." 
</P>
<P>
 As the book's title indicates, however, Chile was a "paradise found, and 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1960, American immigration laws had changed. Thanks to Sputnik, the Russian 
spacecraft, which propelled America into the space race, "the U.S. needed more 
engineers and scientists and so Manfred could sponsor himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Chile after nine years wasn't easy for Krutein, who helped out in milk 
distribution center and a clinic for the poor. "It was a heartbreak," she said. 
"At first I didn't want to go because I loved Chile so much." 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S., Manfred landed a job as a design engineer for a construction and 
mining company in Palo Alto; Eva returned to school, earning a master's degree 
in music. The family later moved to Pacific Palisades, San Diego and then 
Irvine in 1976, and she also became a music instructor at UCLA and Pepperdine 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Krutein said her family "left before the turmoil" -- the election of socialist 
Salvador Allende as Chile's president, "which created a chaos in the country 
and split the country in two. Then came the coup d'etat by Augusto Pinochet" in 
1973.  
</P>
<P>
 But the book also chronicles the Kruteins return visits to Chile during the 
Pinochet dictatorship, their first in 1974 when they learned that many of their 
friends had been murdered, tortured or had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent return trip to Chile was in 1992, with Pinochet long out of 
power and the country again returned to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Krutein says she saw a Chile that was "even more modern than California. For 
instance, although they have more earthquakes than we have, Santiago has an 
extended subway system, immaculately clean and punctual." 
</P>
<P>
 She also noticed an improvement in women's rights: "The women work now. Before 
they didn't because they were confined to their kitchens and to bed mainly."  
</P>
<P>
 In general, she says, life in Chile is much better than when they left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although (Pinochet) was a brutal dictator like Hitler and was guilty of the 
suffering and the deaths and disappearance of thousands of people, he helped 
build up the country technically and economically." He was able "to get loans 
from the U.S. because he was an enemy of the communists and therefore he got 
everything he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paradise Found, and Lost" isn't the last we'll hear about the Krutein family. 
</P>
<P>
 Krutein already has started writing a third book, one that will deal with "the 
years from 1960, including Manfred's involvement in the secret raising of a 
Russian nuclear submarine on the ocean floor" in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Krutein is telling the story of "Paradise Found, and Lost" during 
frequent talks in churches, clubs, libraries and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll give a slide-illustrated talk at the University Club at UC Irvine Sept. 
21. For more information, call (714) 856-7737.

 Restoring 'Last Supper': "The Last Supper," one of Leonardo da Vinci's most 
famous frescoes, will undergo major restoration work starting this week and 
will be closed to the public until mid-1995, art officials in Milan said 
Monday. The famed Italian Renaissance artist painted the fresco at Milan's 
Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, completing it in 1497. The painting, which 
shows Jesus Christ surrounded by his 12 apostles during the last meal before he 
was crucified, has been damaged by air pollution, humidity and dust, officials 
said. They added that a climate control device and air purifier would be 
installed in the church's refectory. EMMY WATCH

 Celebrating Nominees: Hollywood is gearing up for Sunday's Emmy Awards with 
several pre-award events scheduled to fete the nominees. Among them is 
Saturday's Women in Film luncheon at the Bel Age hotel, honoring this year's 
record number of female nominees. At the event, Women in Film will present its 
first Lucy Award for Innovation in Television (named after Lucille Ball) to 
producers Gary David Goldberg and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, as well as a new 
annual Lucci Award recognizing an individual whose TV accomplishments have 
"previously gone unheralded." That award is named after its first recipient, 
Susan Lucci of "All My Children," who has received a slew of Emmy nominations 
but never collected the prize. . . . Another pre-Emmy bash, this one hosted by 
the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and double nominee Swoozie Kurtz 
("Sisters," "And the Band Played On"), is set for Thursday at the Westwood 
Marquis Hotel. Among the more than 40 actors scheduled to attend are Dennis 
Franz, Jane Seymour, Shelley Fabares, Estelle Getty, Sela Ward, Tim Curry and 
Alex Rocco, as well as Emmy co-hosts Patricia Richardson and Ellen DeGeneres. 
</P>
<P>
 * More News: Cable's E! Entertainment Television is airing four specials 
devoted to the Emmys, including an in-depth look at the nominees (airing Sunday 
at 11 a.m.), a live pre-show and post-show (which will expand Emmy-night 
coverage from 6 p.m. all the way to 1 a.m.), and a highlights special planned 
to air at 7:30 a.m. on Monday. Meanwhile, comedians Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, 
Garry Shandling and Michael Richards are the latest presenters announced for 
Sunday's award show, which airs at 8 p.m. on ABC. LEGAL FILE

 Bank on the Block: Actress Kim Basinger's bank is up for sale in an effort to 
ease her financial straits. The Bank of Braselton, the smallest in Georgia with 
$6.25 million in assets, will be auctioned Sept. 22 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Los Angeles. Basinger went into bankruptcy last year after Main Line Pictures 
won an $8.1-million judgment against her for pulling out of its film "Boxing 
Helena." The actress paid a reported $20 million in 1989 for 1,700 acres of 
Braselton, near her hometown of Athens. Her bankruptcy petition puts the value 
of the town at $900,000.

 * Restraining Order: Whitney Houston, star of "The Bodyguard," found life 
imitating art when she had to get a restraining order against a man she says is 
stalking her. The order was issued against Charles Gilberg, who claims to be 
the father of Houston's daughter and has harassed the singer's family at their 
church. It was the second time Houston has obtained a restraining order against 
him. CLASSICAL MUSIC

 Music in the Park: About 700 people were on hand Sunday evening for a free 
Symphony in the Glen concert at Mid-Wilshire's Pan-Pacific Park. The 40-member 
professional ensemble, composed primarily of studio musicians, played music by 
Beethoven, Mendelssohn and others to concert-goers filling the park's 
amphitheater and surrounding hillside. Founded and led by conductor Arthur B. 
Rubinstein, who has composed music for more than 200 films and TV shows, the 
orchestra is concluding its first season of free classical concerts in Los 
Angeles parks. Rubinstein says food collections at the events have resulted in 
donations of more than 1,000 cans of food so far. This season's final concert, 
also set for Pan-Pacific Park, is expected in October, and fund-raising has 
already begun for an expanded 1995 season.

 * A Papal Release: Cassette and CD versions of "The Papal Concert to 
Commemorate the Holocaust," a landmark April 7 concert held at the Vatican, 
will be released today on Justice Records, followed on Oct. 26 by a video 
documentary from Rhino Home Video. The concert, which featured the Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra of London and the Choir of St. Peter's Basilica (singing 
in Hebrew for the first time), underscored the Catholic Church's recent 
official recognition of the state of Israel and acknowledgment of the 
Holocaust. SHAUNA SNOW

 September is now national "Classical Music Month," and kids can get hip to a 
classical sound with a growing number of friendly, quality recordings that 
prove such fare is not only accessible and engaging, but a feast for the 
imagination. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf," narrated by none other than the kids' kid 
herself (even though she's now a grown-up 18), Melissa Joan Hart, star of 
Nickelodeon's "Clarissa Explains It All." Hart's style is lively, casual and 
well-spoken and the orchestra is top-notch: the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with 
Seiji Ozawa conducting. The recording also features Saint-Saens' "Carnival of 
the Animals" and Benjamin Britten's "The Young Person's Guide to the 
Orchestra." Sony Classical. Cassette: $9.98. CD: $13.98. Widely available. For 
older children and adults, Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," performed by the St. 
Louis Symphony conducted by Leonard Slatkin, is another in the outstanding 
boxed gift sets from RCA Victor Red Seal that include illustrated CDs, 
exquisite character die-cuts, fold-out stage scenes and a glossy guide to 
story, dance and instrumentation in English, German and French. Also available: 
"The Sleeping Beauty" and "The Nutcracker." RCA Victor Red Seal/BMG Classics. 
Boxed set (two CDs): $27.98 at Tower Classical. Mail order: (800) 221-8180. 
And, for very young listeners, more Tchaikovsky, coming in October for the 
holidays: The return of the delightful "Lamb Chop's Nutcracker Suite," a quirky 
retelling by Emmy-winning Shari Lewis of the classic E.T.A. Hoffmann tale and 
Tchaikovsky ballet. Lewis and her adorable but salty puppet pal make this one a 
keeper. A&M Records. Cassette: $9.98. CD: Prices vary. At Kmart and other 
retailers or call (800) 541-9904. El Rey Leon: A Spanish version of Walt Disney 
Records' "Lion King" soundtrack is now available on CD and cassette at record 
retailers, mass merchants and other stores. The release is the latest in the 
company's growing catalogue of Spanish-language versions of its classics, from 
"La Bella y La Bestia" to "Blanca Nieves y Los Siete Enanos."  
</P>
<P>
 An Offer With Strings: To celebrate the kick-off of its 32nd season, the Bob 
Baker Marionette Theatre is offering two-for-the-price-of-one tickets to its

 A tale of two clowns: the tall and lean Mump, with shiny blue tights, blue 
high-tops and a long blue horn on his head; and the short and squat Smoot, with 
baggy red shorts, red high-tops and two smaller red horns on his head. But it's 
not just the clothes and the bright red noses that distinguish Michael 
Kennard's Mump and John Turner's Smoot from Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and 
Costello and George and Gracie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toronto-based team, now wreaking havoc in the West Coast premiere of "Mump 
& Smoot in 'Ferno' " at the La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Forum, brings a 
fresh twist to the form by eliminating language as we know it. They speak 
gibberish -- supposedly the language of Ummonian from the land of Ummo -- but 
make themselves understood by gesture, inflection and emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 They use this trick to distill their parts into the yin and yang of comedy in 
its purest form. They interact with an audience that understands them 
perfectly, whether Smoot is tricking one patron into throwing a ball at Mump, 
or Mump is solemnly soliciting another to take a wildly posed picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By speaking their nonsense with conviction and, yes, clarity, they offer a 
peek into the wonderland of how much we convey by body language, and the way we 
say something rather than what we actually say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ferno" shows Mump and Smoot doing their shtick as they wait for an airplane. 
When the pilot doesn't show, Mump decides to fly the plane himself. They crash 
and experience dismemberment, death and life after death while conveying a 
panoply of complicated emotions -- wrenching, desperate and loving as well as 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Karen Hines' expert direction, the show works so seamlessly, you can't 
see her hand at all. The emphasis is on the performers as it should be -- as 
alone in the world as Beckett's Didi and Gogo. 
</P>
<P>
 And they play their parts to perfection. Kennard's towering Mump stares down 
Smoot and the audience with as much intimidation as ego itself, determined to 
control. Turner's ingenuous Smoot plays the mischievous id sneaking around 
Mump's directives with anarchic delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Manning's set design, chiefly a simple wooden crate of a plane on a 
black stage, reduces their world to basic elements. Michel Charbonneau's 
lighting, and a lot of smoke, takes the clowns up to the clouds and back. David 
Hines' music and sound effects underscore the mood of this funny yet 
thought-provoking show. Like "Children of Paradise," Mump & Smoot's "Ferno" 
makes you not only laugh, but also contemplate the marvelous complexities of 
existence. It shouldn't be missed.

THEATER REVIEW; 'BUTTERFLIES' FAILS TO FULLY METAMORPHOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The North Coast Repertory Theatre production of "Apocalyptic Butterflies" has 
problems and promise -- like the marriage it describes. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Wendy MacLeod crafts a predictable tale of a husband and wife whose 
marriage frays under the stress of a new baby who is seven weeks old at 
Christmastime when the play begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune named a 1988 production of MacLeod's play one of the 10 
best of that year. It also has been produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 
New Haven, Conn., and at INTAR in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One can see a hint of what might have been here in the witty exchanges and 
occasionally insightful observations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, much potential is obscured by the central performance of Mark 
Taylor as the husband, Hank Tater. Under Vinny Ferrelli's heavy-handed 
direction, Taylor goes from Macho Man in the first act to Sensitive Man quicker 
than Clark Kent turning into Superman. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with his performance lies in the penultimate scene, when 
we need to believe in his final, desperate attempt to win his wife back. Here, 
it seemed as if he was putting her on. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey McNeil turns in competent but unexciting work as Muriel. The supporting 
actors make the show worth watching, particularly Annette Murphy as Trudi, the 
zanily wise Other Woman. With her dingy manner and dead-on deadpan comic 
timing, Murphy is at her best comforting Hank by telling him he is a permanent 
blip on her timeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat DiMeo turns in a warm and wise performance as Francine Tater, Hank's 
mother, who sees the marriage foundering and tries to set it right. Jack Becker 
is wonderfully goofy as Dick Tater, the father who lives in a mobile home so he 
will have money to spend on totem poles and painted butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident designer Marty Burnett turns in another terrific set: Hank and 
Muriel's kitchen borders a motel room with a giant vertical bed for Hank and 
Trudi's scene, later replaced by a field of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the play offers wise words -- mostly from the mouths of Hank's 
parents and Trudi. Love, his mother tells him, is his father using the chart on 
the Whitman Sampler to remove all the chocolates she doesn't like. Life, his 
father explains, is doing things -- like buying totem poles and carved 
butterflies -- because they have spiritual value and they make people smile. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the central characters were as funny or compelling. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; DESPITE CHANGE IN DIRECTORS, L.A. FEST STAYS ON SAME TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a palace revolution earlier this year that ousted Chuck Conklin, the 
founding artistic director of the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival, there was 
speculation about the new philosophy guiding the four-day event's musical 
makeup. The incoming director, trumpeter Bob Allen, plays in Chris Kelly's 
Black and White Jazz Band, and the rumors were of a shift back from mainstream 
toward a preponderance of traditional groups. But most of this year's contracts 
were already in place so that no dramatic change was apparent over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 There were new faces, like the fine, young fluegelhorn artist Wendell 
Brunious, one of an increased number of African American instrumentalists and 
groups at the festival, held at the L.A. Airport Marriott and Doubletree 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 While silver hair still predominates heavily in the audiences, there appeared 
to be a larger percentage of younger listeners than ever -- a crucial item for 
the future of the festival and of mainstream jazz.  
</P>
<P>
 What is also apparent is that the diversity of the festival's offerings is 
crucial to its success. The traditional groups drew their loyal, 
T-shirt-wearing followers as always and the big bands attracted large crowds, 
who proved that the jitterbug still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were large turnouts as well for the star instrumentalists playing in 
various combinations. Indeed, the year's individual stars seemed clearly to 
include pianist Dick Hyman, Bob Wilber on clarinet and soprano sax and 
cornetist Warren Vache, whose appearances in various ad-hoc groups (and, in 
Hyman's case, in a brilliant hourlong solo recital) drew standing-room-only 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Vache's wide-ranging, contemplative and lyrically thrilling improvisations 
even survived the wind tunnel acoustics of an open-air ramp. Hyman is a 
virtuoso who has made his eclecticism a recognizable and unmatchable style. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilber's tribute to Sidney Bechet was a major Sunday night event, as was a 
session with drummer Frank Capp's Juggernaut band. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance was evidently off slightly. Uncertainty over who might play could 
have been a factor. In the matter of diversity, the lesson for future festivals 
surely is: If it works, don't fix it.

SCREENING ROOM: LOOKING AT A 'SOFTER SIDE OF HONG KONG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "The Softer Side of Hong Kong: The Films of Stanley Kwan and Clara Law," 
the Monica 4-Plex will present on Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. throughout 
the rest of September four films simultaneously, one for each of its screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Law's "Farewell, China" (1992) presents the harshest view of life in New York 
imaginable -- so much for "softer." Frustrated by the lack of educational 
opportunities during the Cultural Revolution, a young wife and mother (Maggie 
Cheung) perseveres mightily until she at last obtains a visa to continue her 
studies in international trade in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that it defies credibility that she'd head for Manhattan without 
any contacts whatsoever; what lies in store for her is terrifyingly believable. 
Shocked to be asked for a divorce and then losing contact with her completely, 
her loving husband (Tony Leung) follows her to New York, entering the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farewell, China" takes on raw, epic dimensions as Leung's desperate search 
for Cheung is intercut with flashbacks to what has been happening to her. What 
emerges is a portrait of Chinese immigrants struggling to survive under truly 
terrible conditions.  
</P>
<P>
 Again supported by Leung, Maggie Cheung also stars in Kwan's "Actress" (1992), 
a remarkably perceptive film biography of Ruan Ling-yu, who was as mesmerizing 
as she was ill-fated. Ruan was one of the greatest actresses ever to face a 
camera, combining the delicacy of Lillian Gish with the sensuality of Greta 
Garbo.  
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a servant and the scion of the rich family for whom her mother 
worked, Ruan was dogged throughout her all-too brief career by publicity 
surrounding her birth and later on, her love life.  
</P>
<P>
 Kwan's "Rouge" (1988) is an exquisite supernatural fable, an opium dream of a 
movie that re-creates glamorous Hong Kong of the '30s and then plays it against 
the city's teeming, workaday present to illuminate and contrast the changing 
relationships between men and women. The story focuses on the ravishing Fleur 
(Anita Mui), whom we first meet in 1933 in a luxurious brothel and then see 
again in 1987, inexplicably not looking a day older and apparently searching 
for a long-lost lover.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rouge" turns upon the old Chinese belief that a day in the spiritual world is 
roughly equivalent to 50 years on earth. As Fleur and her weak-willed lover 
(Leslie Cheung) embrace, in an old movie-style close-up, Kwan pans to the 
glittering skyline of 1987 Hong Kong, and in that moment we are whisked more 
than a half-century forward as the still-youthful Fleur enters a newspaper 
office to place a notice in the personals column. What emerges from Kwan's 
shifts between past and present is a protest of the folly of women, who, out of 
ingrained custom, sacrifice themselves for men unworthy of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a strong feminist flavor to Clara Law's ravishing "The 
Reincarnation of Golden Lotus" (1989), an erotic, romantic fable set 
simultaneously -- and seamlessly -- in the past and in the present. Law is a 
real virtuoso, bringing terrific visual flair to boldly stylized glimpses of 
antiquity only to cut to the fast, decadent, hard-edged luxury possible in 
today's Hong Kong -- and all the while shaping her actors' portrayals precisely 
to her purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 The lovely Joi Wong stars as a ballerina in China who becomes increasingly 
convinced that in an earlier life she was known as the Golden Lotus, who 
becomes entangled with her brother-in-law as well as a lover. It's a 
predicament that Law feels unfairly earned Wong, in Chinese myth and 
literature, the designation as "the No. 1 slut in ancient Chinese history." * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Premiere Showcase also continues at the Monica 4-Plex 
with "The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk II," which opens Wednesday for a one-week run. 
A lively, successful sequel that again shows off the uninhibited imagination of 
director Corey Yuen and his writers, it finds our blithe, acrobatic hero (Jet 
Lee) involved in the anti-Manchu Red Flower Society and a potential romantic 
triangle. As before, the sensational comedian Josephine Siao is back as Lee's 
lusty martial artist mother in this delightfully knockabout period.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LOLLAPALOOZA '94 FINDS ITS BALANCE AT FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday, fans pogoed happily in front of 
Lollapalooza '94's second stage, cheering to the pop songs of Japan's Shonen 
Knife, while yards away at the main stage, giant mosh pits surged to the 
aggressive chants of L7. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the two stages, carnival rides spun, poets pontificated, 
interactive computers interacted and dozens of booths filled with political 
paraphernalia, food and retail booths bustled. It was virtually an eclectic 
rock and rap carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Lollapalooza mastermind Perry Farrell's dream has finally come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Porno for Pyros frontman has always referred to the summer tour -- now in 
its fourth year -- as a traveling show with a carnival appeal, but until this 
year, his dream only took a vague or lopsided shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, either the main stage lineup far outweighed the smaller second 
stage fare, or the non-musical events were too sparse, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the two-month 1994 edition wound up last weekend, Lollapalooza seems to 
have finally hit a pinnacle where all elements balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The multitude of bands (mostly good) on the two stages and non-musical events 
(mostly fun) gave more than 30,000 fans so many things to choose from on Sunday 
that it was overwhelming -- just as any good carnival should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite naturally, the reviews from the early shows in the two-month tour 
stressed acts on the main stage -- which meant most of the media attention has 
been on headliners Smashing Pumpkins and the Beastie Boys, both of which turned 
in strong sets Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This emphasis on the main stage was reinforced when the tour opened at the Sam 
Boyd Silver Bowl in Las Vegas because the second stage was relegated to a small 
corner of the facility, and the non-musical elements were limited. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Dominguez Hills, where the tour was scheduled to end Monday, the 
second stage was given far more prominence and the non-musical aspects were 
greatly expanded. The result was that these elements offered strong, constant 
competition to the main stage lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the best sets of the day, Cypress Hill packed the second stage, 
booming laid-back hip-hop tunes and serving up more odes to the almighty weed, 
while the audience jumped up and down en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser known bands like England's Stereolab, which plays a mutation of '60s 
cocktail music, and local jazzy hip-hopsters Pharcyde also held large 
audiences, even though they competed with the likes of the Breeders and Green 
Day, whose sets ran simultaneously on the main stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stereolab's intricacies may not have come across quite as well outdoors as in 
clubs, but the surreal-sounding band compensated by playing more 
straightforward versions of songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharcyde hypnotized the audience into a blissful groove with its hip-hop 
meltdowns, while Shonen Knife delivered irresistibly pure pop. But not 
everything on the second stage was as glorious. Shudder to Think's set was 
bogged down in melodramatic vocals and unfocused tunes, while the Boo Radleys 
came across as simply sappy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the second stage shut down just before sunset, all attention was again 
focused on the main stage, where the Beastie Boys had already began churning 
out its hyperactive blend of hip-hop and hard-core rock with bouncy stage moves 
and high-strung raps. 
</P>
<P>
 Smashing Pumpkins closed the show triumphantly with an hour of bittersweet 
sounds -- from waves of reeling guitar to lulls of contemplative simplicity -- 
that are so smartly crafted yet spontaneous and soulful, reflecting the whole 
tone of Lollapalooza '94.

LOCKHEED-MARTIN UNION: PAIRING, THEN PARING; MERGERS: BOTH FIRMS HAVE PUSHED 
DEFENSE CONVERSION. BUT EXPERTS SAY THAT EVEN COMMERCIAL VENTURES WILL GET A 
HARD LOOK NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta say their planned merger will accelerate both 
companies' post-Cold War expansion into commercial markets, but analysts are 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts say the merger aims chiefly to create a leaner, meaner defense 
contracting giant. Beyond that, they figure, the consolidation is a chance for 
both firms to give their commercial ventures a long, hard look -- then dump the 
ones that aren't solid moneymakers with roots in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides defense, "everything will be on the table now," said Rohit Shukla, 
executive director of the nonprofit Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. and Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta Corp. 
announced plans last week to combine forces to create an aerospace powerhouse 
with $23 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Both say their commitment to diversify away from defense remains firm despite 
the planned merger, the largest consolidation in defense industry history. And 
the companies' chief executives predict that the new Lockheed Martin Corp. will 
eventually grow, after the unspecified job cuts that will come with the move. 
</P>
<P>
 But job applicants shouldn't hold their breath. Analysts paint a picture of a 
smaller, tighter Lockheed Martin pared down to the areas in which it has clear 
superiority, civilian or military. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial markets expected to be targeted by the new company include space 
systems, information services and environmental technology. As for other 
non-defense business lines, "they will shed like you wouldn't believe," 
predicted Shukla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventures such as CalComp, Lockheed's Anaheim-based computer graphics concern, 
will be among the first dumped by the new defense giant, he said. Profits at 
CalComp, which employs 1,600 worldwide, have been disappointing, and Lockheed 
tried unsuccessfully to sell the firm a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Access Graphics, headquartered in Boulder, Colo., is another computer-related 
Lockheed venture that's likely to be a square peg in the new company, said Lior 
Bregman, an analyst with the investment banking firm Oppenheimer & Co. in New 
York. "Graphics and computer peripherals never fit, and it still doesn't fit," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even profitable companies such as Burbank-based Lockheed Air Terminal, the 
firm's airport management company, may eventually be sold, Shukla said. In 
recent years, the unit has expanded from airport management to airport 
development. But despite its modest success, the company "does not contribute 
anything to (Lockheed's) core business," Shukla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta have made strides in recent years to diversify 
away from defense. Lockheed is involved in everything from collecting highway 
tolls to developing commercial launch vehicles. U.S. defense sales shrank from 
70% of Lockheed's total sales in 1991 to 64% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta's sales outside U.S. defense accounted for more than 30% of 
its revenue last year, up from 25% five years ago, company spokesman Charles P. 
Manor said. The firm's diversification efforts range from a joint venture with 
a company that dissolves pollutants in molten metal to providing computer 
graphics technology for Tokyo-based video game maker Sega Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies were on paths toward expanding non-defense activities to 50% of 
sales, and that evolution will continue apace with the merger, Manor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has focused . . . on the creation of a defense juggernaut," he said. 
"But we did this not just to have a critical mass with (the Defense 
Department), but to compete in global markets." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts question whether the huge new Lockheed Martin will be 
any more competitive outside of defense. Being big "makes it harder for them to 
be flexible, adaptable and operate as a commercially successful enterprise," 
said Dan Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit public 
policy think tank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's more successful commercial offspring include Lockheed Information 
Management Services Co. in Teaneck, N.J., which provides systems for processing 
parking tickets and toll-road collections for local governments. It has also 
developed "intelligent highways" that, using sensors, can assess fees as 
commuters drive by toll booths. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed's most celebrated defense-conversion efforts can be found at 
Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is rooted in the development of ballistic missile systems, but it has 
also done business in space exploration for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, however, Missiles & Space is using its technological base to expand 
into space imagery products, commercial launch vehicles and materials 
technology. It has also secured a $700-million contract with the Motorola 
Satellite Communications Division to develop parts of a constellation of 
orbiting communications satellites called Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta is an old hand in space technology. The company makes both the 
Titan and Atlas rocket systems.  
</P>
<P>
 "Space is the common denominator," said Bregman, the Oppenheimer analyst, 
adding that all of Lockheed's space efforts "fit very well with Martin 
Marietta's." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for environmental services, he said. Lockheed's ventures in that 
sector are "a perfect fit" with Martin Marietta's, Bregman said. Besides the 
agreement with Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass., Lockheed also 
oversees toxic waste cleanup at Department of Energy facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Lockheed and Martin Marietta are well poised to take advantage of 
growing concern over pollution problems overseas, according to Shukla. "There 
are huge markets out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Martin will also move rapidly toward commercialization of its 
military business, Shukla said. "They won't design from the ground up for a 
specific customer anymore. They will design one product and market it in many 
ways."  
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, the new aerospace behemoth is likely to spend some time 
digesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a limit to how much an organization can absorb and assimilate at one 
time," Schwendinger said. "It's going to take them a couple years at least."

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: YOU WON'T EVER SEE A SALE LIKE THIS AGAIN! (UNTIL 
TOMORROW) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is your last chance to read this column. 
</P>
<P>
 It's my going-out-of-business sale. Read it before it's gone. Today only! 
</P>
<P>
 Marketers know there are few more effective sales pitches than the two words 
last chance . The Labor Day weekend was littered with "last chance" and 
"clearance" sales -- everywhere from Nissan car dealerships to the Broadway 
department stores to Paul's Big Screen Television. Consultants say that during 
the recent economic downturn, marketers stressed urgency in order to coax 
consumers to buy. It worked so well that the mantra continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to feel left out," said Harry Noyes, a consumer psychologist and 
president of Psychological Motivations, a Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., consulting firm. 
"The chance of missing an opportunity that may not come again is too much for 
many consumers to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
 We are a nation obsessed with last chances. And, for that matter, 
second-to-last chances. One Studio City retailer has posted a window sign that 
reads "Almost Going Out of Business." 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of New York City -- particularly along 6th Avenue -- are littered 
with merchants who have claimed for years that they are "going out of 
business." Some of the screaming signs, however, actually promise far less than 
what unwitting consumers perceive. One sign flashing outside a store is worded, 
"Going Out for Business." And one Lexington Avenue store recently posted this 
warning: "Doors Close at 9 p.m. Tonight." The merchant explained that his doors 
did close at 9 p.m. that night -- and each night thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who are generally most moved by "last chance" sales are those who 
grew up in big families, said Dr. Joyce Brothers, the syndicated writer and 
radio talk show host. "They knew that if they didn't grab something while it 
was in front of them, their brother or sister would snatch it." 
</P>
<P>
 C&R Clothiers, the discount men's clothing chain based in Culver City, thinks 
it knows how to get customers into its stores. For three straight years -- in 
fact, several times a year since 1992 -- it has run "Sale of the Decade" sales. 
</P>
<P>
 How can there be more than one "Sale of the Decade?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one was bigger than the one before it," explained Paul Reisbord, 
chairman of C&R Clothiers, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, sales are one of the few sure ways to spur consumer attention, 
said Michael W. Marsak, president of the Marina del Rey consulting firm 
Effective Marketing Strategies. "Customers live for the two-day sale and 
retailers live off the two-day sale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Better Business Bureau says it gets many complaints about boldly 
advertised sales that don't live up to their billings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores advertise they are going out of business and then, when the sale 
ends, they simply change their name, said Debbie Mahdi, office manager at the 
BBB's district office in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1992, she said, the BBB received numerous complaints about RB 
Furniture's widely advertised bankruptcy sale, which the company called the 
"Sale of the Century." The "sale" dragged on for months before the Los Angeles 
district attorney's office sued RB Furniture as well as Gene Rosenberg & 
Associates, the Newington, Conn.-based liquidator of RB. While each denied 
wrongdoing, together they paid fines totaling $140,000 to settle 
false-advertising charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of consumer attraction to urgency, the Los Angeles retail chain 
Family Bargain Center runs TV and radio ads in English and Spanish each time it 
has a sale, vowing, "Like everything else at Family Bargain Center, we buy in 
limited quantities, so when it's gone, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad man behind the campaign said the rationale is simple. "Retail 
advertising by definition must have urgency built into it," said Bruce 
Silverman, president of the Los Angeles agency Asher/Gould Advertising. "You 
must say that you have an undeniably good reason for people to buy it right 
now."  
</P>
<P>
 But with the onslaught of "last chance" sales during the recent recession, 
some consumers have also been conditioned to understand that, in fact, "there 
is no last chance," said Susan Small-Weil, consumer psychologist at the New 
York ad agency Warwick Baker & Fiore. "If you don't buy sheets at the 'White 
Sale' in January, you can simply wait for the next 'White Sale' in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it seems there will always be room to hook consumers with the "last 
chance."  
</P>
<P>
 I personally learned how well this "last chance" scenario works, when -- more 
than 20 years ago -- I spent one long evening trying to peddle soda at college 
football's Orange Bowl game in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was on winter break from college and flew to Miami to visit Mom. I'd read in 
the newspaper that they needed vendors at the Orange Bowl football game. It 
sounded like a nifty way to see the game for free -- and to make a few nickels. 
</P>
<P>
 But selling was a bear. Too much competition. They paid us a nickel for each 
cup, and by the end of the third quarter, I'd only made about $5. That's when I 
changed my tune. For the rest of the game, I roamed the stadium aisles 
shouting, "Last chance on cola!" 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. I left the Orange Bowl that night with more than $25 stuffed into 
my pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I leave The Times, with nearly a decade of Marketing columns stuffed into 
my scrapbooks. Maybe one or two of them were helpful to some of you. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, you might want to read this column again. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it's your last chance.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: FOR MONEY FUND INVESTORS, YIELDS, SAFETY 
ARE IMPROVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Money market mutual funds are getting safer -- and more lucrative for 
investors -- thanks to a confluence of factors that range from the derivatives 
scare to continuing stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in short-term rates has helped push average yields over 4% for the 
first time since January, 1992, and so far this year the money funds have been 
about the best place to put your cash.  
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest buoy to yields is that fund managers continue to waive their 
fees in an effort to boost investor returns, says Walter Frank, chief economist 
at Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass.-based industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the average general-purpose money fund is now returning 4.16%, 
compared to an average yield of just 2.7% for all of 1993, according to 
IBC/Donoghue Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, just as things have begun to look up for money fund investors, 
some investors have bailed out, citing concerns about complicated hybrid 
securities generically referred to as derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain confidence despite derivative-spurred losses, some money funds 
have poured millions of dollars into their funds in recent months to keep net 
asset values consistent -- in effect bailing out investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the losses have undermined confidence in the industry, convincing 
many individuals that money funds are not as safe as they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fair amount of fear about this industry," says Don Phillips, 
publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds Report in Chicago. "Money funds were sold 
as an alternative to cash. But (because of derivatives), investors are no 
longer convinced that the funds are as safe as cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the last several months, there has been something of a "safety 
backlash" that has prompted many of the big money funds to clean up their acts 
like never before, Frank says. By and large, money funds are replacing 
derivatives with super-safe government securities, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest to fall to the trend is Kidder, Peabody Group, which announced last 
week that it would eviscerate derivative securities from its five money market 
offerings at the urging of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC 
cracked down earlier this year, informing fund managers that certain high-risk 
securities were "not appropriate" and should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas derivatives caused losses this year, in 1993 they were the darlings 
that boosted money fund returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the higher rates and greater security, does it still make sense to 
keep money in cash equivalents, such as money funds, when the stock and bond 
markets do so much better over time? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that as long as you're parking your cash for only a short 
period, money funds can give you the opportunity to sidestep market corrections 
and earn far more on your money in the long run, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While market direction is always hard to call, there is a lot of talk of the 
long stock bull market being at a high point, given traditional measurements 
such as price-earnings ratios and dividend yields. Bond prices, meanwhile, get 
hit whenever interest rates rise. If the economy picks up steam this year or 
next, some bond investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve Board will 
again raise interest rates, which would send their asset values south. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, this is a tenuous time of year for investors because market 
pressures that involve the business inventory cycle tend to push interest rates 
up somewhat during the fall, says William E. Rhodes, vice president of Merrill 
Lynch in New York. That can prove unsettling for both stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "September is the dreaded month because October tends to be where market 
bottoms occur," Rhodes says. "There's an old market adage that you buy stocks 
on Rosh Hashanah and sell on Yom Kippur. It seems to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday falls on Sept. 6 this year. Yom Kippur is 
Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those who invest in money funds this fall ought to be aware that the 
way you use your fund will have an effect on your total return. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, many people buy a fund based on its performance and its promise 
to waive fees to maintain a higher-than-average return, Frank notes. However, 
some of the funds that aggressively waive fees also restrict services, such as 
check writing. You can generally still write checks against your assets in the 
fund, but you may have to pay a hefty fee each time you do. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who use their money fund as an alternative to a bank account will 
find that the cost of these per-check fees can more than outweigh the benefits 
of a higher interest rate. If you require check-writing services, pay less 
attention to yield and more attention to who can provide the services you need 
at a low cost, Frank says.

COMPANY TOWN; NEW ANIMATION BOOM CREATES HOT DEMAND FOR ARTISTS; FILM: 
COMPANIES ARE SNATCHING UP YOUNG TALENT WITH OFFERS OF BIG PAYCHECKS, SCREEN 
CREDITS -- EVEN CREATIVE FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After graduating from art school this year, Ricky Nierva planned to backpack 
around Europe for five weeks before trying to break into Hollywood. But 
Hollywood couldn't wait that long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was packing for Europe and getting ready and I would get these messages: 
'Hi, Ricky, this is Disney'; 'Hi, Ricky, this is Warner'; 'Hi, Ricky, this is 
"The Simpsons," ' " says the 22-year-old animator. 
</P>
<P>
 Nierva, who ended up at Turner Pictures, is the beneficiary of a sweeping new 
demand for animation talent, a development set in motion by rapid strides in 
computer technology and Walt Disney Co.'s phenomenal success with such films as 
"The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies hoping to claim a share of the animation market are competing for 
freshly hatched artists with offers of ample paychecks, prestigious film 
credits, creative freedom and the tutelage of big-name directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our students get recruited like college athletes. Their talents are in such 
demand, it's very difficult to get them to stay here and complete their 
education," says Steven D. Lavine, president of California Institute of the 
Arts in Valencia, where Nierva earned his character animation degree. "They 
have a choice of staying here and racking up more debt or going there and 
starting at significant wages." 
</P>
<P>
 The wages are high, indeed. Nierva, who was hired as a visual development 
artist at Turner, is earning $950 a week, or $49,400 a year -- more than $1,000 
above the average starting salary of a USC Business School graduate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For studios eager to build solid creative teams, the cost of new talent is a 
relative bargain, considering that well-established animators can earn $75,000 
to $100,000 a year for a three- to four-year project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, animation is a business that is run and grown by the artistic talent 
in it," says Disney Feature Animation President Peter Schneider. "We are always 
looking to find more and more artists."  
</P>
<P>
 New animation artists are the prime targets of recruiters partly because many 
of the top names in the business are already under contract at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a finite amount of animators. What it requires is essentially 
growing your own," says Bonne Radford, who heads the Los Angeles animation arm 
of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Koenig, a self-described "animation nerd" who graduated with Nierva, 
found himself juggling five job offers after Cal Arts' Producers Show in May, 
an annual show-and-tell for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig, 22, started working at Turner last month, a job he says he chose 
largely for its opportunities for creative growth. "The thing that's so great 
about this is that I'm actually doing animation," he says, waving a sheaf of 
elephant drawings for the upcoming musical feature film "Cats Don't Dance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so lucky to have this job," he says. "My first job is a position that 20 
years ago someone would have waited five to seven years to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 By hiring a generation of animators fluent in the new computer technologies -- 
such as the 3-D live animation used in this summer's "The Mask" and "True Lies" 
-- the studios can also keep up in a rapidly changing media world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students today are very computer-oriented already when they get to the 
school," says Cal Arts' Bitomsky, adding that more students than ever are 
attracted to the school's animation programs, widely considered by the industry 
to be the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, much more is possible," Bitomsky says. The major studios 
"all, in a way, have to obey and serve the potential of the technologies 
available. If they don't take advantage, someone else will." 
</P>
<P>
 While animation is swiftly making its way into mediums from music videos to 
CD-ROM, the feature film remains by far the most lucrative application of the 
art. Disney has proven that the potential profit from ticket sales alone can be 
astounding, and a well-marketed hit can drive sales in ancillary markets such 
as home video, CDs and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether anyone can challenge Disney's dominance in the feature market remains 
to be seen. The company continues to expand its 700-employee Burbank animation 
unit to support an ambitious roster of films that includes "Pocahontas" for 
1995 and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" for 1996, as well as "Toy Story," the 
first-ever wholly computer-animated feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's phenomenal success with such films as "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" 
-- which is projected to be the highest-grossing film of all time -- is the 
main reason for the current financial gamble in big-screen cartoons. And though 
the sudden departure of Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg last 
month has cast doubt on whether Disney can continue the momentum, studios now 
entering the market have learned from its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, for example, says it is taking the long view. In the past, Turner 
Pictures President Dennis Miller says, "the mistake has been to do these films 
on a one-shot basis. To succeed, we believe you have to invest in the 
infrastructure. You have to have an adequate development pool of interesting 
projects with distinct styles." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio hopes to eventually release a film every 12 to 18 months, Miller 
says. Its first offering, "Pagemaster," is a live-action/animation hybrid due 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, independent Burbank producer Rich Animation will release "The 
Swan Princess," a feature that cost the small company $30 million to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Other contenders are Warner Bros., which hopes to capitalize on a rich history 
in TV cartoons through its new feature animation unit, and Fox, which announced 
in July that it will pour $100 million into a 300-employee animation studio in 
Arizona to be run by Don Bluth. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin, in conjunction with Universal Pictures, is moving its London-based 
animation studio to Burbank. Bonne Radford says the unit will have a staff of 
about 300 and that about 50 of the animators have agreed to move to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why we are able to do it, that our core group of talent is coming 
with us," she says. As for the rest? "We are actively recruiting."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; RESIGNATION SENDS BRAZIL STOCKS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian stock prices posted their largest single-day drop in seven months 
after this weekend's abrupt resignation of Rubens Ricupero as finance minister, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most international markets were quiet Monday due to the U.S. Labor Day 
holiday. Stock prices slid in Tokyo and Frankfurt, following the dollar lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, the Bovespa stock index in Sao Paulo tumbled 10.5%, closing at 
48,040. In Rio de Janeiro, the IBV index fell 10.0% to 17,734. Investors were 
worried that Ricupero's comments that he had slanted economic statistics to aid 
pro-business presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso could hurt 
Cardoso's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian law prohibits government backing of political candidates, and 
Cardoso's opponents petitioned the electoral tribunal to force him out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the big drops, the Bovespa index remains up 72% in U.S. dollar terms 
this year. 
</P>

 "Of course it's bad," said Paulo de Tarso, portfolio manager at Banco 
Tendencia in Sao Paulo. However, the incident isn't likely to prevent Cardoso 
from winning the election, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights around the world: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese domestic stocks staged a stunning bull run in Shanghai on Monday 
with a 13% surge in the A-share index. Institutions, major individual 
shareholders and small investors went on a buying spree, their confidence 
boosted by news that Beijing was pressing ahead with a plan to invite foreign 
funds into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell 0.61 to 99.05 Japanese yen before recovering about 0.20 yen 
later in London trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average shed 244.65 points, or 1.18%, 
to close at 20,409.18. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp fall "mainly reflects the weakness of the dollar against the yen," 
Merrill Lynch trader Dan O'Keefe said in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Germany, the slumping dollar and falling bond prices helped pull 
Frankfurt stocks lower. The DAX stock index closed at 2,174.52, down 30.19 
points, or 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico's Bolsa index fell 8.80 points, or 0.33%, to close at 2,666.03, its 
eighth consecutive loss. Shares in Mexico's two biggest airlines, Aerovias de 
Mexico and Mexicana de Aviacion, tumbled more than 6% after the sudden 
resignation of the chairmen of both carriers over credit problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold closed in London at $386.85 an ounce, down from $387.25 on Friday.

 * Theme Parks: Disney Development Co. canceled plans to visit a theme park in 
Thailand, accusing its owner of lying about Disney's intentions in that 
country. Chaiwat Luangamornlert, chairman of Siam Park City, told local 
newspapers last week that Disney executives were considering opening a theme 
park in Thailand and that he was advising them in their search for a potential 
site.Three hours before Kenneth Wong, Disney's senior vice president and 
general manager of the Asia Pacific region, was to visit the park, Siam Park 
City received a fax from Wong saying he would not be coming. "Due to the 
unauthorized, inaccurate, and misrepresentative media reports released by your 
organization, our visit to Siam Park is hereby canceled," Wong said in the fax. 
Wong confirmed that he had not visited the park as planned. "We did not feel it 
was appropriate for them to issue the statements that they had," Wong said. He 
declined to define Disney's relationship with Chaiwat.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SCHULHOF HAS NERVES ON EDGE AT SONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With summer symbolically fading and workplaces returning to normal, at least 
one executive will have his hands full this week. Sony Software President 
Michael P. Schulhof has to talk his company down from its mass anxiety attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the turmoil is Schulhof's handling of a decision to bring Jeffrey 
Sagansky in as second in command. Internal sources say the Sony chief kept most 
of his top lieutenants in the dark about the plan until it was revealed in 
press reports last week. On top of that, they say he still hasn't tendered a 
convincing explanation of Sagansky's responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sony Music, the company's sole cash machine, President Thomas D. Mottola 
and his staff are said to be livid over the "destabilizing" effect of the 
Sagansky news and the way it was delivered. Conversations between Mottola and 
Schulhof are conservatively described as "strained." 
</P>
<P>
 "The way this thing went down is an indication of weak leadership in the 
highest realms of Sony," said one angry insider. "Why would any executive worth 
his salt do anything to alienate the biggest breadwinners in his company? It 
defies logic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Sagansky's hiring has also rattled executives at Sony Pictures, who 
fear he's being brought in to lead a housecleaning of the troubled company 
headed by Peter Guber. Executive recruiters, meanwhile, are using the unsettled 
state of the company as an opportunity to circle in on Olaf Olafsson, the 
respected head of Sony Electronic Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof could have soothed a lot of nerves last week by rapidly concluding 
the Sagansky deal and delineating the new lines of authority in a public 
statement. Instead, he left it to aides to offer confusing and sometimes 
contradictory background accounts of the new corporate order -- one in which 
Sagansky, easily one of the most sought-after executives in the entertainment 
industry when he left CBS, has been relegated to a vague "strategic" post. 
</P>
<P>
 As they prepared for the long Labor Day weekend, even some of Schulhof's 
longtime backers threw their hands in the air over the way he's managed 
Sagansky, who could have been sold early on as a savvy executive move for the 
company. "What can I tell you?" said one. "It's all very confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 And all too familiar. While no media tycoon is totally immune from the 
sometimes scorching coverage of their industry, Schulhof, 51, suffers more 
self-inflicted burns than most. 
</P>
<P>
 A former physicist who's been called brilliant by a lot of people who should 
know, Schulhof nonetheless has, with his actions, confounded observers often 
since Japan's Sony Corp. snapped up CBS Records and Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of Sony's American operations, Schulhof has responsibility for making 
its roughly $10-billion entertainment investment pay off. But his track record 
is mixed at best. Sony Music under Mottola is the big success, with cash-cow 
acts such as Pearl Jam and operating revenue of $4.5 billion for the fiscal 
year ended March 31. On the other end of the spectrum is Sony Pictures, which 
is considered a major financial drain on the company after a long box office 
drought. The jury's still out on the new-media division, Sony Electronic 
Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one well-placed critic: "He knows how to buy, but he doesn't know how to 
operate." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical Schulhof misstep came earlier this year when he widely touted a plan 
to sell a 25% stake in Sony Pictures to an outside investor. When no one 
rushed, or even crept, forward to take him up on the deal, Schulhof and the 
company were exposed to unnecessary embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof also has a history of inciting executives at Sony Music. In one move 
that remains a sore point, according to knowledgeable sources, Schulhof denied 
Mottola funding for strategic acquisitions at the very time he was pouring 
millions of dollars into a cosmetic makeover of the Sony Pictures lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the title issue. After relegating Mottola to a sort of executive 
limbo early in his tenure, Schulhof last year named him chief operating officer 
of Sony Music. Many colleagues took the appointment as a sign of Mottola's 
coronation. But one week later, Schulhof issued a memo clarifying that he and 
not Mottola was actually in charge of domestic music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after that, in November, Schulhof tried to silence rumblings about 
management instability at Sony Pictures by dramatically releasing word that his 
core group of senior executives had renewed their contracts. By spring, Sony 
found itself sheepishly explaining why Jonathan Dolgen, perhaps the most 
respected of the group, had defected to Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Sagansky. While company sources say he will largely focus on 
stirring up interest in the 25% Sony Pictures sale, or possibly a public 
offering in the entire entertainment operation, Hollywood insiders believe all 
roads inevitably lead back to a problem-solving role at Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, through his operatives, was insisting as of last week that Sagansky 
will have no operating authority over the three divisions. But as history has 
shown, Schulhof has a tendency to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one observer: "It's almost impossible to imagine what Schulhof was 
thinking. Was he attempting to assert his authority or trying to fool the 
Japanese? Was he trying to sneak up on Guber? Who knows? Whatever possessed him 
to go about this decision in the manner that he did, it was a big mistake."

COMPANY TOWN; INFORMATION AGE SPAWNS NEW POWER LIST; LEADERSHIP: VANITY FAIR 
SINGLES OUT THE GIANTS OF ENTERTAINMENT AND TECHNOLOGY.

<P>
 Good news for Company Town readers: Vanity Fair magazine says America's new 
powerbrokers are the very people who grace these pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the reporters, unfortunately, but a select group of 19 Information Age 
leaders that Vanity Fair calls the "New Establishment." In its upcoming issue, 
the magazine makes the case that this roster has replaced the "small group of 
WASP men whose breeding grounds were the playing fields of prep schools" and 
who ended up in government, the law and on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the New Establishment list are movers and shakers from all of the 
industries loosely bunched under the entertainment-technology banner. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hollywood, there's media mogul David Geffen, Creative Artists Agency 
Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, director-producer Steven Spielberg and 
singer-actress-director Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate entertainment world is represented by Walt Disney Co. Chairman 
Michael D. Eisner, Time Warner Inc. Chairman Gerald Levin, News Corp.-Fox Inc. 
Chairman Rupert Murdoch, McAndrews & Forbes Holdings Chairman Ronald Perelman, 
Viacom Inc. Chairman Sumner Redstone and Seagram Co. President Edgar Bronfman 
Jr., who made the list by virtue of his large stake in Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in from cable, computers and telecommunications are AT&T Co. Chairman 
Robert Allen, QVC Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill 
Gates, Tele-Communications Inc. President John Malone, McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc. Chairman Craig McCaw, Bell Atlantic Corp. Chairman Ray 
Smith and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. Chairman Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are two people who are industries unto themselves: blue chip 
investment banker Herbert A. Allen Jr., who's handled many of the biggest media 
mergers of his day, and talk show supremo Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The group picture on the front page of today's Business section, which is not 
an exact representation of the executives on the list, was taken at Allen's 
annual Sun Valley, Ida., investment conference this summer. Vanity Fair says 
the power list was compiled by a committee. ALAN CITRON

 Santa Ana City Councilman Ted R. Moreno remembers the old days -- extensive 
travel, health club memberships, lunches with lobbyists and, ah yes, the 
council's sumptuous Christmas buffet, complete with fine wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perks were as much a part of local politics as ribbon cuttings and endless 
discussions about zoning variances. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it one of the legacies of the recession: Southern California politicians, 
spurred on by angry and distrustful constituents, are trying to curry public 
favor by giving up the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a day and age when a lot of residents and constituents have little faith 
in their officials, we have to show that we are watching our pennies," said 
Moreno, who successfully pushed for council cutbacks in Santa Ana. "The free 
spending of the '80s is over. Let's come into the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible example of the new downwardly mobile trend is 
multimillionaire mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, who is taking only a 
buck a year for his services. But over the past two years, as government 
dollars diminished, councils and boards of supervisors from Ventura to San 
Diego have cut their pay, slashed their expenses and turned down gratuities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, however, have come at a cost of their own, some political experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pay and benefit reductions win points with taxpayer advocates and 
voters, they make it difficult for all but the very rich to hold public office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time we pull back, we change the equation by which people can run and 
stay in office," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and professor 
at Claremont Graduate School. "It's going to make it harder for lower income 
people, for minorities, for women. It will mean a government that is not 
representative of California cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, the only board member to 
accept a 5% pay raise this year, calls the trend to work at a cut rate 
"government by bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are hard times, we understand that," Edelman said. "There also has to 
be an understanding of reasonable compensation for our elected officials. If 
you are going to have people running for office who are going to give back all 
of their salary, it puts people who can't compete in that arena at a 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there needs to be a standard and so on, but I think this pay thing 
has gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 But many constituents disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have had to tighten their belts since the start of the 1990s, said 
Shirley L. Grindle, an Orange County taxpayer advocate. It's only fair that 
government officials do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is really uptight and rightfully so," Grindle said. "It's hard to 
understand when officials take pay raises and perks when everyone else doesn't 
have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to be viewed as insensitive to the economic situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some of the most notorious perks have been left intact. Members 
of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors still tool around town in 
bulletproof cars. And officials from Anaheim to San Diego continue to receive 
free tickets to concerts and sporting events at city-owned stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But consider: 
</P>
<P>
 All 15 Los Angeles City Council members and four county supervisors agreed to 
either waive a 5% pay increase or donate the money to charity or other causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance, Redondo Beach, Pasadena and other Southland city councils cut their 
travel budgets -- contributing to a 15% drop in the number of officials 
attending the League of California Cities' state conference last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Orange County, it's a crime for many elected officials to even accept a 
stick of gum from a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the trend is finding its fullest expression in political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Following in Riordan's footsteps, wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron K. 
Unz, who ran unsuccessfully against Gov. Pete Wilson in the June primary, vowed 
to accept only $1 a year if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington (R -- Santa Barbara), the millionaire son of a Texas 
oilman, has refused contributions from lobbyists and other special-interest 
groups while pouring at least $10 million of his own money into his campaign 
against Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Los Angeles-area candidates, meanwhile, say they would refuse to take 
a proposed 37% pay raise for state legislators, even though a state salary 
commission says an increase from $52,500 a year to $72,000 a year is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 All this worries Ruth Holton, the executive director of California Common 
Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always held that public officials should receive a fair salary," 
Holton said. "Without that, the office will only be accessible to wealthy 
candidates. And we are seeing more and more wealthy candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Holton said she understands the public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, people look at a pay increase and they say, 'They don't 
deserve it, what have they done for us lately?,' " Holton said. "The public at 
this point is not receptive, regardless of the merits of any kind of pay 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of receptiveness is by no means restricted to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Placer County, which includes a portion of Lake Tahoe, taxpayer advocates 
found out that the Board of Supervisors had gradually increased its pay and 
perks from $22,000 in 1985 to $84,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious, the advocates put an initiative on the ballot that called for 
limiting all pay and benefits to $30,000 annually for each of the five 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had the rights to give themselves raises, and they abused them," said 
Jim Pillow, who helped draft the initiative. "We said, 'enough is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The measure passed with about 63% of the vote, forcing board members to roll 
back their salaries. Now, most supervisors spend little time at the county 
government center, said board Chairman Alex Ferreira. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all busy with their other jobs," Ferreira said. "There is no way you 
could support a family on $30,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Capping salaries can also cause other problems, Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It discourages people who might not otherwise run for office, but it also 
increases the pressure to hide the pay from the public," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Ventura County, for example. Fearful of the public's reaction to an 
across-the-board pay increase, county supervisors in the late 1980s quietly 
voted themselves a large array of lucrative perks, including seven weeks "in 
lieu of vacation" pay and a bonus based on how long they could stay in office. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the extras were added to their base pay of $50,232, the supervisors 
were earning between $73,000 and $98,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from taxpayer advocates to get rid of the extras, the 
supervisors eventually agreed to cut the perks and raise their base salaries to 
$64,543 annually, or 65% of the salary of a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 By linking their salaries to those of the judges, the supervisors figured they 
no longer would be burdened with the task of increasing their own pay, since 
the jurists' salaries are set by the state. Officials in Los Angeles, San Diego 
and Riverside counties had already passed ordinances linking their salaries to 
those of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the Legislature unexpectedly voted to increase the pay of 
judges and other state employees by 5%, forcing the local officials to decide 
whether to take the raise or turn it down. The most savvy politicians saw the 
dilemma as a chance to gain points with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors each agreed to waive the increase, as did three of 
the supervisors in San Diego County, where board members earn $76,171 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for us to lead by example," said San Diego County Supervisor 
Dianne Jacob, who has been giving 10% of her salary each year to the county. 
"Times are tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of respect for businesses who are struggling and private citizens who are 
struggling, this is my way of stating that as one elected official, change is 
needed and change must come from the top." 
</P>

 In Los Angeles, council members quickly made public their plans to turn down 
the increase, which would have added $4,534 to their $90,680-a-year salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson vowed to donate his increase to the Devonshire and 
Foothill police divisions, and Councilman Nate Holden said he would turn his 5% 
raise over to the American Youth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon promised to give his raise to police in his 
northeast San Fernando Valley district, while the rest signed waivers, leaving 
the money in their office budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all said if there is a raise to be had, it is not going to be us," said 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "Part of it is to provide some symbolic 
leadership. It's really a way of saying, 'Look folks, we are all in the same 
boat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, however, accused the other council members of grandstanding, saying if 
they were really serious about making sacrifices, they should have given up 
more than $4,534. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to give up something, they should roll back their salaries," he 
said. "That puts a bite in it. . . . Who are they kidding? They are just 
jiving, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues insist they mean business and say they've got a list of other 
voluntary givebacks to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 When City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. took office last year, he turned over 
his city cars -- all seven -- to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg hung a "No Gifts" sign outside her second-floor office at Los Angeles 
City Hall, making it clear she would not accept any of the many gratuities -- 
from baseball tickets to fruit baskets -- that are routinely given to elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 And Councilwoman Laura Chick gave the LAPD three cars and $80,000 from her 
office budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had listened very carefully during the campaign," Chick said. "I heard loud 
and clear from citizens that they had really lost their faith. They saw us as 
fat cats who were more interested in filling our own pockets than in doing the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to send a message that I want this job." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, government officials sought to improve their image by 
implementing a stunning set of political reforms, from new limits on meals for 
officials at its chief transportation agency to campaign contribution limits 
for officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors last year adopted a virtual ban on all gifts 
to 1,650 elected, appointed and certain "designated" county officials who are 
in a position of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The action followed Supervisor Don R. Roth's conviction on state ethics law 
charges for failing to report thousands of dollars in gifts of home 
landscaping, meals and other favors from those who did business with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials even got into the act by banning all gifts to officials after 
two Anaheim council members accepted thousands of dollars in complimentary 
Disneyland tickets. The scandal led to the temporary suspension of those 
council members' voting authority on the amusement park's proposed $3-billion 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot think of anything good about wining and dining," Grindle said. "It 
just confirms what the public tends to think already: They are being bought and 
paid for. I'm proud they enacted the gift bans." 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by what Orange County had done, two Redondo Beach council members 
proposed a similar ban last year, saying it would help restore public 
confidence in city politics. The measure failed, however, by a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn White, who earns an annual salary of $7,658 as a Redondo Beach 
councilwoman, voted against the ban. She said adopting the measure would be 
like "putting four stoplights in a one-intersection town. You don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than instill confidence in voters, the ban would erect a barrier 
between council members and the public, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to talk to me and you can't buy me a cup of coffee?" White said. "We 
felt it was too restrictive." 
</P>
<P>
 While the council voted down the no gifts ordinance, Redondo Beach officials 
did cut their travel budget -- an action dozens of officials across the state 
have taken over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel budget for council members was $10,500 in 1990 in Redondo Beach. It 
is now $7,300. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Torrance, the City Council has cut its travel budget from $35,000 to 
$24,500 annually. And in Pasadena, council members have allocated $12,000 for 
travel, down from nearly $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of California Cities has felt the greatest impact from the travel 
cuts. Attendance at the league's annual state conference, where council members 
attend workshops on everything from planning and development issues to budget 
matters, has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's fewer people from a city or fewer cities themselves, we've seen 
a 15% drop," said Terry Dugan, the league's assistant director for education 
and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugan and political analyst Bebitch Jeffe said they believe the travel 
reductions will only hurt the officials' ability to do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it's a blowout like the League of Cities convention, you get ideas, 
you begin to network," Bebitch Jeffe said. "You can only do so much by phone. 
Travel is so critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside City Council members tried to buck the trend in February by voting 
to increase their monthly expense allowances from $275 to $875 each, on top of 
their monthly salaries of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they needed additional money to pay for lunches with 
constituents, phone calls, office supplies and travel expenses -- things they 
now pay for out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, however, showed up in force to urge the council to reconsider 
the increase. The council eventually reversed its decision and turned the 
matter over to a citizens committee for review. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the $875-a-month expense allowance is now uncertain, but there's 
one thing Councilwoman Joy Defenbaugh knows for sure: By the time her term is 
up three years from now, she will have charged a hefty sum on her credit card 
to pay for council expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will make her think hard about running again, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenbaugh says she spends hours preparing for the meetings, turning a 
part-time council job into the main focus of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work very hard," she said. "Certainly if you are not paying a living wage, 
that limits who is going to be able to run for office." Give and Take 
</P>
<P>
 Across Southern California, city council members and county supervisors are 
trying to win points with the public by cutting their perks and forgoing pay 
increases. Here is a look at the salaries and benefits they still receive and 
some of the extras they have given up:

DARING SWIM SAVES 18 FROM CAPSIZED BOAT; RESCUE: AFTER FIVE HOURS CLINGING TO 
VESSEL OFF L.A. HARBOR, MAN GOES FOR HELP. A BOY, 3, DIES IN THE TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After five hours in the ocean clinging to his capsized boat and fearing his 
family and friends would die in the cold nighttime waters just outside Los 
Angeles Harbor, a 32-year-old father of six decided to swim through the choppy 
seas for help. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time rescuers arrived, a 3-year-old boy was dead and three other 
youngsters required hospitalization for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 The terror began four hours after 19 people from three families crammed onto a 
pleasure boat for a Sunday afternoon fishing jaunt. Perhaps because too many 
people were on board or perhaps for some other reason, the 24-foot craft 
overturned 1 1/2 miles outside the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the lights on shore but unable to get the attention of other boaters, 
the five adults in the fishing party desperately clutched 13 of the 14 
children, all of them hanging onto the crippled craft. Rafael Pacheco held his 
10-month-old daughter, Ashley, to his chest, trying to keep her warm in the 
65-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went down so fast, we couldn't grab anything but our kids," said Pacheco, 
who was a varsity swimmer in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 With his weeping wife, Karen, begging him not to leave her and the children, 
the La Puente man dived from the overturned hull when it became clear that no 
passing vessels would see the boat and the people bobbing in two-foot swells. 
He believed they could not survive the night in the cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 After swimming less than a mile, Pacheco reached the fishing vessel Fish Tank. 
Within 20 minutes, the Coast Guard found the group, still holding onto the 
floating remains of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then they discovered that 3-year-old Adam Romero was trapped in the 
submerged cabin, clad in a red T-shirt, shorts, one sandal and a helmet -- his 
life vest still strapped to his chest. The boy could not be revived and was 
pronounced dead at St. Mary's Medical Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other children remained hospitalized, 10-month-old Ashley Pacheco in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials were investigating the cause of the accident, Petty 
Officer Trent Jones said. They will examine whether the boat was overloaded, 
the possible use of alcohol, construction of the vessel, and the experience of 
the ship's captain, Anthony Romero of La Puente, who had owned the craft for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero and Pacheco had been planning the outing for several weeks. Each man 
would bring his entire family, they had decided. They would spend a leisurely 
afternoon at sea, fishing and letting their kids dip their hands in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 p.m., feeling content with the day, they decided to call it quits and 
return to shore. Romero started putting away the fishing poles and clearing 
gear from the cluttered deck of the 21-year-old Sabrecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Romero could turn on the motor, the craft was slammed by a wave 
from a larger vessel passing by, Rafael Pacheco said. Squealing, all those 
aboard ran to one side of the boat, hoping to avoid a drenching. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the weight on one side, the boat tipped over, tumbling its passengers 
into the sea. There was no time to grab flares, radios or flashlights, Pacheco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all terrified," said Karen Pacheco, 29. She had only one thought: 
"I've got to save the kids; I've got to save my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Each adult tried to make sure their young charges were safe. The Pachecos 
quickly found their six youngsters -- from 10-year-old Breann to tiny Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's friend Jim Laing, 30, grabbed his nephew and cousin. Romero and his 
wife, Caroline, searched the waters but could only find five of their six 
children. Panic washed over them when they realized that 3-year-old Adam had 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The families grasped the sides of the overturned boat, not realizing that Adam 
was still trapped beneath it. They could see other boats in the distance, said 
Rafael Pacheco, and several times he thought he spotted Coast Guard vessels, 
but they never came close enough to see the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of boats out there, but they were too far to hear our 
screams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold, wet and scared, the children began to weep, asking their parents the 
impossible. "Take me home," each pleaded, Pacheco said. "They were screaming, 
crying, saying, 'I want to go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Pacheco held onto several children while Rafael hugged the 10-month-old 
to his chest, trying to keep her warm as the sun set and the water started to 
feel colder and colder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cried themselves to sleep," Rafael Pacheco said. "But they woke up each 
time a current hit the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Pacheco decided he had to swim for help or they would all die. But 
his wife thought his mission would end only with his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't leave me! Don't leave me!" she screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco was adamant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to. I have to," he told her. "It's our only chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I secured my babies. I said, 'You guys hold onto each other and don't let go. 
I'll be back,' " Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stay here, Karen," he told his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he swam off into the night in the direction of a small fishing boat 
he had spotted about three-fourths of a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroking through the choppy waters, Pacheco felt numb with cold and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make it. My babies, my friends, my kids' friends -- they were all 
out there. I had to make it," he said. "I didn't feel nothing. Swim. Get out of 
there. Get some help." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted, he finally reached the fishing boat and was pulled aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boat went over! Just call the Coast Guard! Everybody is freezing," he told 
his rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco wanted to let his wife know that help was on the way. He asked for a 
flashlight and signaled to her -- hoping she would realize what the flashing 
light meant. At 11:20 p.m., the Coast Guard received the radio call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 20 minutes, boats from the Coast Guard, Long Beach Fire Department and 
Los Angeles City Fire Department reached the families. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the survivors had been pulled from the water, Los Angeles Firefighter 
John Burgan donned scuba gear and dived beneath the ill-fated boat. There, he 
saw Adam Romero, pinned against the inside of a storage area, floating in about 
three feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed him and brought him to the surface, and gave him mouth-to-mouth," 
Burgan said. "I thought he may have been underwater less than 30 minutes. I 
assumed there was every chance that we could revive him." 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, a 4-year-old girl was listed in fair 
condition Monday with hypothermia but was expected to be released today or 
Wednesday, said hospital spokesman Ron Yukelson. Initially in critical 
condition, she was being treated in the hospital's pediatric intensive care 
unit after suffering seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Mary's Medical Center, two other children, 10-month-old Ashley and a 
4-year-old girl, remained in intensive care in the pediatrics unit, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his harrowing swim, Pacheco declined treatment.

COLUMN ONE; RANKINGS RANKLE ACADEMIA; THE POWER OF COLLEGE GUIDES HAS SOME 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS CALLING FOR BOYCOTTS WHILE OTHERS ARE LOBBYING THE 
GUIDE-MAKERS IN HOPES OF WINNING BETTER MARKS. 
</P>

<P>
 He may be one of the most powerful figures in American higher education, but 
Mel Elfin doesn't have a Ph.D., teach a single course or hold office hours on 
any campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two high-ranked college officials a week, on average, pay their 
respects to -- and sometimes lobby -- this irascible, bushy-browed editor who 
collects tabloid headlines and gives himself haircuts at his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Elfin is in charge of the U.S. News & World Report annual ranking 
of more than 1,400 colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the magazine's hottest sellers each fall, its annual "America's Best 
Colleges" list is jokingly referred to as academia's "swimsuit issue." And 
while the decade-old guide is considered the most influential, it is just one 
in a burgeoning pack of rankings that has administrators climbing the 
ivy-covered walls. 
</P>
<P>
 There are guides for Christian students, Jewish students, environmentally 
correct students, disabled students. One popular book rates campus life in 
restaurant-review style -- five stars for the best -- and another irreverent 
tome belittled one university as a "high school with ashtrays." Money magazine 
computes "best buys," while the Business Week guide evaluates "customer 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say these guidebooks and rankings -- with their commentaries or 
compilations of test scores, graduation rates and class sizes -- have become a 
powerful tool in the new scholastic marketplace. As never before, students and 
their parents are using them to comparison shop. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has eroded the control of the intellectual Brahmins, who for decades 
have determined the academic pecking order but who now must pay attention to 
the consumer demands of parents and students trying to figure out what 
constitutes a quality education. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this is a very fundamental change and it's a very difficult change," 
said Peter Likins, president of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. ". . . 
What's hard for us in higher education is just being judged by these outsiders. 
They're not academics and our long-treasured tradition is one of internal 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any college that believes the rankings are of no consequence is blind to 
realities," he said. "They have an influence on how parents and students 
behave. They have an influence on how alumni feel about their alma mater." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention a big effect on how educators act. The Assn. of Universities 
and Colleges in Canada is trying to block Maclean's magazine from publishing 
its fourth annual ranking this November. The group passed a resolution calling 
on member schools to boycott requests from Canada's leading newsmagazine for 
institutional statistics -- a call to arms that many schools have ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, college officials lobby, whine and bicker -- and widely 
suspect each other of misreporting statistics to look good. The president of 
Marshall University in West Virginia chastised colleges that "juggle their 
numbers" for the guides, an ethical lapse he compared to misusing research 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reminiscent of Faust's selling his soul to the Devil, some of us in higher 
education are peddling our souls in exchange for rankings in a magazine's 
promotional efforts," J. Wade Gilley fumed in a 1992 article for Academe 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a doctorate to figure out why, given the competition in higher 
education for good students. 
</P>
<P>
 "High school counselors tell me that students come into their offices with a 
page torn out of (U.S. News), saying, 'This is where I want to apply' and it is 
School No. 5 as opposed to School No. 6," said B. Ann Wright, dean of 
enrollment at Smith College in Massachusetts. "It's the power of the vertical 
column." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also face pointed questions from lawmakers, trustees and alumni if a 
school gets mediocre reviews or slides lower in the rankings. When Lehigh 
didn't even show up in the early U.S. News lists, Likins said, he heard about 
it at alumni gatherings in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that score well, however, trumpet the rankings. Berea College printed 
T-shirts and bumper stickers after U.S. News picked the 1,500-student Kentucky 
school as one of the best in the mid-1980s. A spokesman said applications 
tripled overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., went one better, renting a billboard to 
announce its sixth-place finish in a U.S. News category one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear what's going on here," lamented Robert Atwell, president of the 
American Council on Education, the umbrella association for 1,600 schools and 
higher education groups. "There are too many instances in which institutions 
brag about raising their profile from 45th to 26th, not choosing to recognize 
that it says absolutely nothing about the quality of the institution. It might 
have been terrific at 45 and not any better at 26th, but if it comes up at 65 
next year, you'll die by the sword." 
</P>
<P>
 How did it get so crazy? 
</P>
<P>
 Many academics say they are victims of the public's lust for lists -- and 
publishers that pander to it. Increasingly cost-conscious administrators are 
using more objective benchmarks to measure their school's efficiency. And a 
drop in the supply of traditional students has created a buyer's market. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say it was academia's pomp, not circumstance, that caused the 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're as much at fault here," said Patrick P. Terenzini, associate director 
for the National Center on Post-Secondary Teaching, Learning and Assessment at 
Penn State. "Colleges and universities have been very reluctant to share much 
information with the public . . . . There's a good deal of image management 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education's carefully coiffed image, preserved in postcard-perfect 
brochures churned out by admissions offices, was mussed up during the last 
decade by revelations about fat administrative salaries and dubious research as 
undergraduates were shoveled into crowded lecture halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most agree that academia's biggest transgression was of the purse: It kept 
hiking tuition even as jobs dried up during the recession. With exclusive 
schools crossing the $100,000 threshold for a bachelor's degree, the average 
price of a college education has doubled since 1983, rising 2.5 times faster 
than the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 As sticker shock set in, students and their parents couldn't find hard numbers 
and comparisons to help make the second biggest investment in their lives. Thus 
grew the power of rankings and guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envision this as a Consumer Reports approach to higher education," said 
Elfin. "People can get all the information they need on the comparative merits 
of a $200 VCR, but there was nothing that would give them the comparative 
merits of two institutions, where it costs $80,000 to $100,000 for a degree." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in the early 1980s with a proliferation of guidebooks, the staid 
encyclopedic tomes traditionally relegated to the reference shelves of high 
school counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright from Smith College traces the phenomenon to a 1982 guide compiled by 
then-New York Times education editor Edward B. Fiske. He introduced a five-star 
system to rate the academic, social life and quality of life of selected 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first that set colleges against each other in a way that had not 
happened before, in terms of who was the best and who was not the best," said 
Wright. "I was at the University of Rochester at the time and I was one of 
those people who were horrified because we were given three stars, which was in 
the medium range." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guides emphasized commentary and sassy attitudes. The Princeton Review 
Student Access Guide to the Best Colleges, for instance, began featuring lists 
with blunt titles like "Campus like Eden/Campus like Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, an explosion in guidebooks has created about 30 titles catering to 
all kinds of student tastes, said Joe Hollander, an editor at New Jersey-based 
Peterson's, one of the nation's oldest guidebook publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing caused more academic anguish than when the rankings bug spread to 
periodicals such as Business Week, Money and U.S. News, say college officials. 
With their built-in base of millions of subscribers, the popular press became a 
fearsome wild card at a time when admissions offices were competing for 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Business Week has turned the tables on the nation's top business schools by 
surveying hundreds of recent graduates and corporate recruiters for "customer 
satisfaction." When the first of its biennial lists came out in 1988, it was a 
shocker -- dark horse Northwestern University came in first, while favorites 
like Stanford and the University of Chicago limped in at ninth and 11th, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The list "induced an identity crisis" among some elite management schools, 
even causing one to revamp its curriculum, Stanford and Emory University 
researchers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 No guide, however, seems to have captured consumer attention -- or frayed 
academia's nerves -- more than U.S. News. With an appeal to Middle America, a 
circulation of 2.2 million and a "news you can use" philosophy, the magazine 
has become something of a gold standard in college rankings, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 When it began in 1983, U.S. News simply polled 500 college presidents and 
declared Stanford, not Harvard, the nation's best major university, one of 
several categories it used. Using reputation to assign rankings was no 
different than the method used in 1925 when a Midwestern college president 
published the first rankings of Ph.D. programs based on the opinion of experts 
in each field, said David S. Webster, associate professor at Oklahoma State 
University, who has studied the history of academic rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 College presidents launched salvos against the U.S. News rankings as a "beauty 
contest" and a blatant attempt to sell magazines. Thirty of them vented their 
spleens as guests of the magazine at a dinner in January, 1988, said Elfin, 
U.S. News' special projects editor who took over the rankings that year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Elfin, college presidents faced a veteran of Washington journalism who also 
is familiar with the back lots of higher education. Married to the chair of 
nearby Hood College's political science department, Elfin is a dissertation 
away from getting his Ph.D. in contemporary American history from the New 
School for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his style doesn't fit into the noblesse oblige world of academia. His 
office is lined with tabloid headlines, and instead of polite understatement, 
he bowls through conversations with pointed interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators admit Elfin has earned their "grudging respect" for keeping an open 
ear and working with them to refine the ranking methodology. After the heated 
1988 dinner, for example, U.S. News moved quickly to incorporate more objective 
data from the schools, rather than to rely solely on reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Elfin and in-house statistician Robert Morse have reworked the 
formula to produce 14 categories, where schools are ranked according to 
financial integrity, faculty resources, student admissions and alumni 
satisfaction, as well as reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining the information is a months-long task, with the magazine sending out 
13-page questionnaires asking for 80 different "data points," such as average 
SAT scores for entering freshmen and size of endowments. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials grumble about the growing blizzard of surveys, one reaching 
140 pages, from guidebook publishers. A Berkeley researcher estimated it took 
the campus one staff position, or $50,000 worth of time, to fill out all the 
surveys -- a cost of up to $50 million when extrapolated over all of higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet educators say they can't risk the statistical consequences of silence, and 
each year about 100 college presidents, deans or other officials travel to 
Washington to take a seat on Elfin's red couch for a little schmoozing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the parade on a recent morning was Robert T. Conley, president of The 
Union Institute, a non-traditional Cincinnati school that provides "distance 
learning" -- independent study courses taught by computer -- to 1,700 students 
throughout the country, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Framed by tabloids headlines screaming "Dead Infant Fed to Dog" and "Fergie 
Throws Up!" the pink-faced Conley strained to describe the institute's 
philosophy of allowing "the learner to interact personally with his own 
education" before Elfin seized control with a barrage of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have arrived at Elfin's doorstep for some more decidedly aggressive 
lobbying, and often propose changes in methodology that will help their 
respective institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Claremont's Harvey Mudd College, which was named best "smaller 
comprehensive school" by U.S. News in 1985 only to disappear from the top 
lists. School officials came to see Elfin and ask the magazine to create a 
category for engineering specialty schools. When the list debuted in 1991, 
Mudd's name was on top. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the dean of Georgetown University Law School, concerned that 
her school wasn't rated any higher than 13th in the graduate school lists, 
invited Elfin for a tour before handing him a two-page critique of the 
methodology over lunch. She'll have to wait to judge the results until the 
magazine publishes its ranking of graduate schools in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State's Webster said he has "nothing but contempt for college 
presidents who troop through" Elfin's office, but the editor and others are 
more concerned about the continual allegations about schools that try to "game 
the system" by cheating on their statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the tricks is to inflate SAT scores by not counting those of some 
athletes and "special admits," many times low-scoring minority students 
admitted through diversity programs, say officials. Another is to reduce the 
student-teacher ratio by counting faculty on leave or those who are retired but 
have a campus office, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfin's staff has tried to eliminate the problem with careful wording, but 
some of the officials who come calling insist it continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, Elfin said the magazine got a jolt when it obtained a 
confidential American Bar Assn. report that showed a third of the 176 
accredited law schools covered in the graduate school ranking had reported 
different admissions numbers to the magazine. Most discrepancies were minor. 
However, one low-ranked California school -- which U.S. News wouldn't name -- 
told the ABA it had admitted 55% of applicants while telling U.S. News the 
number was 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these are the people to whom we entrust . . . our ideals, our heritage 
and our young," Elfin said about allegations of cheating in general. "Not only 
do they fib, they're in here ratting on others who fib." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the annual rankings are published, the scramble for bragging rights 
continues. Elfin said U.S. News' legal department issues about 20 
cease-and-desist letters a year to schools that imply they made the top rank or 
exaggerate their standing. One school, he said, has been warned repeatedly 
about its claim it is one of the "Top Ten Catholic Colleges," a category U.S. 
News doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 To Elfin's way of thinking, such wrangling is just part of a larger shakeout 
in academia, a gut-wrenching change he says may kill off bad colleges and leave 
academics more humble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snobby, holier-than-thou kind of thing that was built up during the 1980s 
has been dispirited by the economic crisis," he said, adding that editors at 
U.S. News never anticipated that the magazine would become such a force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have caught a wave, but it was there for the catching," he said.

U.N. DEBATE OPENS ON POPULATION PLAN; GROWTH: GORE CALLS ISSUE 'SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT PROBLEM HUMANKIND FACES.' GOVERNMENT LEADERS FROM PAKISTAN AND NORWAY 
OFFER DIFFERING ABORTION VIEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With bitter disputes flaring here already about abortion, world leaders on 
Monday started debating a historic global population plan to deal with what 
Vice President Al Gore called "the single most important problem humankind 
faces." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year voluntary program would for the first time downplay demographers' 
traditional preoccupation with sheer numbers in discussing population, focusing 
instead on enriching the health and lives of women and children and seeking a 
more balanced sharing of the Earth's resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not be here today if we were not convinced that the rapid and 
unsustainable growth of human population was an issue of the utmost urgency," 
Gore said in his opening remarks to the U.N. Conference on Population and 
Development, the largest such event ever organized by the United Nations, with 
almost 20,000 participants from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that it has taken "10,000 generations to reach 2 billion (people), 
and then in one human lifetime -- ours -- we leap from 2 billion toward 10 
billion." 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers are not by themselves the problem," Gore said. "But the 
startling new pattern they delineate is a symptom of a much larger and deeper 
spiritual challenge now facing humankind. Will we acknowledge our connections 
to one another or not? Will we accept responsibility for the consequences of 
the choices we make or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 There already is broad international consensus on many crucial steps that must 
be taken to deal with population problems around the globe: giving women more 
control over their own lives and health; improving health care; ensuring that 
economic development eases the burden in the world's fastest-growing regions, 
and widening access to family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the world's most powerful religions have attacked this conference 
for considering issues such as safe abortion, non-traditional families -- which 
some interpret as an endorsement of homosexuality -- and adolescent sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has been joined by a range of Islamic organizations in demanding 
that the U.N. delegates, representing more than 100 nations, eliminate from 
their 113-page population blueprint all references to abortion and other 
language seen as out of step with traditional family norms. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy prompted at least four Muslim countries -- Iraq, Sudan, Saudi 
Arabia and Lebanon -- to boycott these sessions, scheduled to run until Sept. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 Even moderate Islamic countries like Jordan, Turkey and Bangladesh have 
downgraded their level of representation here. 
</P>
<P>
 The depth of feeling about the long-controversial issues was evident at 
Monday's opening ceremonies, especially in remarks by the only two female heads 
of government appearing here. 
</P>
<P>
 Benazir Bhutto, prime minister of predominantly Muslim Pakistan, offered a 
conservative view on abortion and reproductive issues, warning delegates to 
deal with such matters carefully to avoid "a clash of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gro Harlem Brundtland, a physician and the prime minister of Norway, 
offered an emotional call for legalizing abortion worldwide to end unnecessary 
maternal deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morality becomes hypocrisy if it means accepting mothers . . . dying in 
connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted 
children living in misery," Brundtland said. "Decriminalizing abortion should 
therefore be a minimal response to this reality." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali -- at home in his native Egypt, 
whose population of 59 million grows by 1 million every year -- warned against 
abandoning the mission of effective population management in the search for 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tolerance must be shown in the strongest possible way, (but) it should not 
lead to cautious compromises, half measures, vague solutions or, still worse, 
statements that lull us into complacency," he said, adding, "such tolerance 
must also be mutual, for we cannot allow a given philosophical, moral or 
spiritual belief to be imposed upon the entire international community or to 
block the progress of humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. population officials have repeatedly emphasized that the draft the 
conference is considering creates no internationally recognized right to 
abortion and does not encourage use of abortion in family planning; it in fact 
discusses the procedure only in encouraging measures to protect women against 
unsafe, illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must look squarely at the facts about abortion," said Nafis Sadik, 
executive director of the U.N. Population Fund and secretary general of the 
Cairo conference. "There may be as many as 50 million to 60 million abortions a 
year. This is a serious threat to women's lives and health. Between 70,000 and 
200,000 lives are lost each year as a result of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has repeatedly been attacked and accused of seeking 
to promote legalized abortion around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore came out firing Monday, noting that American aid programs do not cover 
abortion financing. He also outlined the American policy, which emphasizes that 
each nation must decide for itself whether to legalize abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States Constitution guarantees every woman within our borders a 
right to choose an abortion, subject to limited and specific exceptions," the 
vice president said. "We are committed to that principle. But let us take a 
false issue off the table: The United States does not seek to establish a new 
international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be 
encouraged as a method of family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also believe that policy-making in these matters should be the province of 
each government, within the context of its own laws and national circumstances 
and consistent with previously agreed human rights standards," he added. "We 
believe that where abortion is permitted, it should be medically safe and that 
unsafe abortion is a matter of women's health that must be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, American and European officials have sought to broker a 
compromise that would help address many of the objections to the population 
conference draft, some 95% of which is already in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy E. Wirth, undersecretary of state for global affairs and a former 
Colorado senator, said a key provision of the proposed compromise would remove 
in the draft plan any reference to abortion in the section on family planning; 
instead, it would go in the section on reproductive health care services. This 
would be done to emphasize that this issue should be decided by each nation, 
not globally, and the reference would be worded almost identically to Gore's 
description of national policy-making and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Other compromises would clarify "reproductive rights," specifying that "sexual 
and reproductive rights encompass respect for the security and dignity of the 
person and the physical integrity of the human body as expressed in human 
rights documents." 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth noted that the population plan "before the conference is 92% agreed. . . 
. I think we are very close to having language arrived at that will move us 
from 92% to close to 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gore predicted that the 1994 Cairo population plan, like the two that 
preceded it in the last two decades, would not win Vatican endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is remarkably significant that there is a broader consensus in Cairo than 
on any document in any international conference in history," he said in a 
meeting with a small group of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added of the Vatican: "They're not going to agree to the final document 
in any event, and nobody should be surprised by that. They have other 
disagreements beyond abortion, including issues related to contraception, and 
regardless of what changes are likely to be made here, they will not endorse 
the final document." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop James McHugh of Camden, N.J., a Vatican delegate, warned that the U.S. 
government's advocacy of abortion as an option for women "would be a powerful 
incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party, as well 
as the Clinton Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gore said he never expected the support of the Roman Catholic Church for 
the Administration's backing of contraception and "within our borders . . . a 
woman's right to choose." He said the government nonetheless had the backing 
"of the vast majority of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The present proposal, proponents say, is unprecedented because for the first 
time it moves away from simply relying on target population figures and 
contraceptive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, leaders here also are considering other ways to improve life for the 
1 billion humans who now live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 They still hope to control the world's population growth, holding it by the 
year 2015 to 7.27 billion rather than the 7.92 billion it is likely to reach if 
left unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also proposals to decrease births by educating women and giving them 
access to safe contraception and related health care. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time, world leaders here are also discussing issues such as: 
reducing violence against women; providing family leave for fathers to give 
them a greater stake in child rearing; reducing consumption by industrialized 
nations, and providing a range of reproductive health care programs -- not just 
contraceptive services -- to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program emphasizes people rather than numbers," Sadik said. "It 
concentrates on the individual's quality of life and well-being. It takes a 
wide view of reproductive health and personal choice. A key objective is to 
meet the needs of families and individuals, especially women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The measures called for are simple and undramatic," she said. "Implementing 
the program will, however, call for commitment to change and dynamism. Based on 
the highest of moral and ethical principles, it is a reminder to every country 
that they are collectively responsible for the quality of life of every 
individual."

RWANDA'S NEW LEADERS ASSERT 'SAFE ZONE' HOLD

 Though another panicky flight of Rwandans may be the outcome, Rwanda's 
government began a three-stage operation Monday to quickly assert its authority 
in the U.N.-policed "safe zone," where fears of its wrath and rule triggered an 
exodus last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Three military liaison officers from the Rwandan Patriotic Front left for the 
country's southwest to take up permanent posts with battalions from Ethiopia, 
Ghana and French-speaking African countries already stationed in the region, 
said Canadian Maj. Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission 
to Rwanda. 
</P>

 Several members of the Rwandan Cabinet will tour the area under U.N. guard 
within the next few days, and mayors and other local officials, accompanied by 
a platoon of armed soldiers from the RPF, will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should (happen) quickly, within the next 10 days," Plante estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 If that timetable is adhered to, it will mark the consolidation of the Rwandan 
government's authority over the entire violence-racked country for the first 
time since it came to power in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The "safe zone" was created by the French in late June as a stream of more 
than 2 million refugees, some guilty of having massacred huge numbers of their 
countrymen, fled toward the border with Zaire, stampeded by fears over what the 
impending change in government might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Victors in a short, sharp civil war, the RPF ousted a regime led by hard-line 
members of the Hutu majority, who, in April, masterminded a nationwide blood 
bath of political opponents, lawyers, journalists and other professionals and 
members of the Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest estimate from U.N. officials organizing emergency relief to Rwanda 
is that 1 million people may have been slaughtered. But this Central African 
country is so disorganized, people's whereabouts so uncertain and old 
population estimates so incomplete that such a figure can only be regarded as a 
rough, disputable guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The French firmly kept RPF troops out of the southwest but pulled out of the 
"safe zone" Aug. 21, handing control over to troops under the flag of the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's new leaders asserted that they had the right to send their own 
soldiers in, saying it was important for their credibility; they later 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Monday, their only permanent presence in the region was a handful of 
customs and immigration officials sent to staff border posts on the 
Zaire-Rwanda frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 That will change this week, Plante said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will see an increase of government activity in that zone," he told a news 
briefing. "That is, more and more government ministers will be visiting the 
main cities." 
</P>
<P>
 When the French handed control over to 2,000 U.N. troops and left, aid workers 
had feared another surge of refugees to Zaire like the wave that carried 
hundreds of thousands of miserable, sick and dying people to camps at Goma and 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not happen on the scale feared, although tens of thousands of people 
surged across bridges spanning the Rusizi River. 
</P>
<P>
 According to latest estimates, 500,000 Rwandans who fled their homes elsewhere 
in the country are still in the southwest, along with 1.2 million local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The phasing-in of the new government's authority while U.N. soldiers are still 
on the ground seems designed to reassure Hutus that if they did not become 
killers, they have nothing to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plante's remarks made it clear that Canadian Maj. Gen. Guy Tousignant, the 
U.N. commander in Rwanda, is bracing for a potentially hostile reception or 
attacks on the RPF officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite an implication for us (the U.N. force), in terms of security," 
Plante said. "One step at a time, we'll visit one town, and see the reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Tousignant toured the southwest by helicopter Saturday. Asked whether that 
meant the U.N. commander had concerns about what the extension of the RPF's 
authority might provoke, Plante said, "He doesn't drive around the countryside 
just to look at the birds." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources also said Monday that customs officials stationed by the RPF on 
the Zaire frontier had recently become the target of threats; it was not 
immediately clear who was behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Plante reported the departure of the Rwandan military officers for the 
former "safe zone," Tousignant summoned his battalion commanders for a meeting 
in the capital, Kigali, and was supposed to talk with Defense Minister Paul 
Kagame, the Tutsi who led the RPF to victory in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees who fled into the "safe zone" are predominantly poor Hutu farmers but 
include thugs who took part in the killings. Stoking their wariness about the 
new Rwandan government's intentions are rumors spread by officials of the old 
government, now across the border in Zaire, that the RPF's Tutsi-controlled 
army is bent on vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 28,000 members of the defeated Rwandan government's army were 
driven into Zaire along with the huge refugee population. Aid workers have 
reported that the soldiers are regrouping in the refugee camps. But U.N. 
officials have announced that some have gone over to the RPF. 
</P>
<P>
 Plante said Monday that about 40 of the 210 members of the old gendarmerie, or 
police, in the southwest had pledged their loyalty to the RPF as it prepared to 
send in its officials. They and other policemen voluntarily surrendered more 
than 170 weapons, he reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Shahryar Khan, the United Nations' special envoy to Rwanda, said 
400 soldiers who had fought for the defeated government had joined up with RPF 
forces. Civilian officials from the old regime also were pledging loyalty to 
the new leaders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Large numbers of civil servants, magistrates and teachers have sent in their 
particulars and have been asked to continue working," Khan said.

DISBELIEF, OUTRAGE ABOUND IN MIAMI'S LITTLE HAVANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a great betrayal, a cynical sellout, says Pedro Gonzalez, a television 
repairman by profession and a self-described patriot of his native Cuba by 
belief, history and fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is dancing the rumba with Fidel Castro, but President 
Clinton will learn this is a dangerous step," said Gonzalez, gathered with 
other like-minded Cuban exiles along Calle Ocho , central artery of Little 
Havana, the Cuban American urban heartland. "Miami feels wounded and betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a familiar refrain these days along 8th Street, a place where even the 
fast-food joints serve invigorating shots of Cuban cafecito and nearby avenues 
are named in honor of Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. There is disbelief, 
outrage, a feeling that something has gone badly amiss -- and a foreboding that 
it might get even worse. The daily images of Cubans held behind barbed wire at 
the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay have triggered a kind of collective 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just that Cubans are being denied sanctuary in Florida because of a 
Clinton Administration policy shift that reversed three decades of favorable 
treatment. There is also widespread suspicion about the ongoing negotiations 
between U.S. and Cuban representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington insists the talks are limited to immigration matters and will not 
address Cuba's demands for a lifting of the U.S. trade embargo, but that 
assurance is viewed warily on Calle Ocho . More and more voices are calling for 
"dialogue" between the two governments, rejecting the generation-long 
preeminence of the Miami hard-liners in U.S.-Cuban affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dialogue?" asked Jose Esteves, a white-haired, pony-tailed businessman who is 
clearly aghast at the thought. "There is no dialogue with him ." 
</P>
<P>
 Just the mention of dialogue with Fidel Castro is enough to trigger a torrent 
of vitriol in machine-gun Caribbean Spanish. "Dialogue" has become an epithet, 
a code word for yet another clever Castroist subterfuge. Those Cuban Americans 
who seek talks -- dialogueros (roughly, "dialogue-seekers"), as they are called 
disparagingly -- are denounced as traitors, dupes of the tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dialogue is treason!" asserts Alodia Gomez de la Torre, a 62-year-old 
wheelchair-bound grandmother who stopped by 8th Street the other day to show 
her support for la causa . "I will go back to Cuba myself and fight before I 
accept dialogue! They can push me in in my wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 In these tense days, the litmus test for loyalty leaves little wiggle room. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday, someone tossed a pair of Molotov cocktails at the Little Havana 
offices of Replica , a Spanish-language magazine that has called for dialogue. 
There were no injuries, but the attack, the first such incident in four years, 
came as exile leaders warned that broader talks with Castro could lead to 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, incendiary bluster, and condemnation of any move even vaguely 
conciliatory toward the Cuban leader, has long been a fundamental 
characteristic of exile politics. The current sense of betrayal, however, is 
something new and pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere does the disappointment seem more intense than along 8th Street, a 
1950s-style strip of coffee bars, restaurants and stores. Most shoppers long 
ago moved to air-conditioned malls, but Calle Ocho remains a sounding board and 
gathering spot for anti-Castro militants. It was here last month where 25,000 
mourners marched in the funeral procession of Rafael Gamez, one of the balseros 
, or rafters, who was lost during the recent exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 When Administration strategists express fear of a Cuban American backlash, 
they are alluding to the 8th Street crowd and its white-collar political 
godfathers, notably the virulently anti-Castro Cuban American Foundation and 
its leader, Jorge Mas Canosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics call the hard-line core a small, anachronistic group of reactionaries 
whose extreme views predominate because of lopsided influence and bullying 
intolerance of dissent. Nonetheless, the White House has taken pains to 
reassure Miami's Cuban Americans publicly that wide-ranging negotiations with 
Havana are not on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, community leaders have tacitly accepted the painful detention of 
Cubans at Guantanamo -- a policy that, from the Administration's standpoint, is 
necessary during a period of national backlash against immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 On 8th Street, though, locking up fleeing Cubans on a military base simply 
won't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, directly in front of the stone monument and eternal flame commemorating 
the "martyrs" of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion, a half dozen men have set 
up metal cots beneath a makeshift plastic tent and are engaging in a very 
public hunger strike. They demand a naval blockade of Cuba, a U.N. embargo of 
the island and legislation allowing armed Cuban Americans to launch an invasion 
of Cuba to overthrow Castro's government. Men in fatigues stop by to express 
support, testament to the strong paramilitary undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunger strikers' camp, flanked by U.S. and Cuban flags, has become a 
rallying point, a kind of civic shrine. Motorists on 8th Street honk their 
horns in solidarity. The megaphones tend to come out in the early evening, 
after the sweltering heat has subsided and the afternoon downpours have passed, 
leaving behind a faint tropical aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 A wooden rowboat and rubber inner tube are on prominent display. The plight of 
the balseros has galvanized this community. The rafts and their occupants have 
become heroic symbols of resistance and the will for liberty. One Cuban 
American columnist wrote of keeping a pair of oars in her bedroom, reminding 
herself daily of the rafters' plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, experts say the detention of rafters only puts Cubans on the same 
legal footing as undocumented refugees fleeing poverty and repression in other 
countries, notably Haitians. Along Calle Ocho and in scores of other Cuban 
American enclaves, however, there is anguish and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can the United States welcome us with open arms one day and then turn 
their backs the next day?" asked an incredulous Dahlia Lemus, an animated 
65-year-old who came from Cuba five years ago, leaving behind four grown 
children. "This is a betrayal. And I'm sure there will be other betrayals." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Manuel Rojas Pineda is one of the lucky ones. He and five other balseros 
arrived on the Florida coast in late July, and now he has joined the hunger 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing to eat in Cuba, and now I have nothing to eat here," joked the 
rail-thin Rojas, who was a fisherman in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas is a valued recruit in a crusade generally led by men of mostly European 
ancestry who haven't been back to the island in more than 30 years. Later waves 
of immigrants tend to include more mixed-race and black Cubans, reflecting the 
island's population diversity. But, as the case of Rojas and other rafters 
indicate, newcomers aren't necessarily any more inclined toward dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Little Havana Chess Club, a lively venue where the cigar smoke 
swirls around the skilled aficionados of the royal game, Luis Alvarez paused to 
chat about the generational chasm among exiles and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Alvarez is part of a younger generation of Cuban Americans, those who 
were born in Cuba but left as children and have spent most of their life in the 
United States, speaking English as well as Spanish. Among his emblematic 
boyhood memories: a husky cop arresting his anti-Castro father at a sandwich 
counter in Matanzas, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "What frustrates me is that the terrible experiences of the older generation 
have created a kind of inertia," said Alvarez, a salesman. "Everything is 
frozen. They're living on hate and nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle against Castro, he noted, often comes down to personal 
experiences, a matter of family and honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, a mural of the island's famous Varadero Beach embodies the 
much-idealized place left behind; elegant Don Juans in dinner jackets dance 
with voluptuous women, attentive waiters bear cool drinks to strand-side 
tables, bathers frolic as a calm surf caresses the palm-shrouded shore. This is 
the Cuba of a thousand memories, the kind of frozen image that many cherish and 
that others would like to shatter, enabling time to move forward and maybe even 
allowing some old wounds to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit of conciliation is seldom voiced along 8th Street, where 
vengeance is the more prevalent impulse when politics comes up, as it always 
seems to. What would happen if Clinton were to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba? 
"Miami would burn," declared an unequivocal Pedro Gonzalez, leader of the 
hunger strike, who said he was a political prisoner for 21 years in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles down 8th Street, a marble angel watches over the graves of lost 
balseros , who were as likely motivated by the desire to feed and clothe their 
families as by a grand political passion. Nearby, a white banner with red and 
black letters stands against the wall of a cemetery building, ready to be 
hoisted anew at the next burial-turned-political statement along Calle Ocho . 
It is addressed to Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Dead Today," the banner advises. "Yours Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 On Calle Ocho , it seems, there is consensus on this, that the dying will not 
end soon.

U.S. OFFERS CUBA SWEETER DEAL ON REFUGEE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States offered Cuba a sweeter deal Monday in an effort to resolve 
the diplomatic impasse over the outpouring of Cuban raft people that is 
embarrassing both Fidel Castro and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 No details of the compromise proposal were released. But a U.S. official 
acknowledged that it involved an increase in the initial U.S. offer to grant 
more than 20,000 visas a year to Cuban emigrants in exchange for Castro's 
pledge to keep his citizens from taking to the high seas illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Skol, deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs, 
handed over a document outlining the proposal in a meeting with Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly and a former foreign 
minister. The two met for a little more than an hour at the apartment building 
in downtown Manhattan that houses the Cuban mission to the United Nations. It 
was the fourth round in negotiations that began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no report of Alarcon's reaction. The two officials decided they 
would meet again today, accompanied by their full delegations. Alarcon is 
expected to give his reply to the U.S. offer then. 
</P>
<P>
 In Havana, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez told reporters the 
talks were "stalled, with no positive signals to note." But his assessment was 
made before the Labor Day negotiating session had ended in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the original U.S. proposal to grant more than 20,000 visas a 
year to Cubans who want to emigrate to America, the Cubans countered with a 
demand for well over 100,000 visas, U.S. officials said. The figure was 
apparently designed to underscore what Castro regards as an American failure to 
live up to an earlier agreement to accept Cuban immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the Ronald Reagan Administration signed an agreement that allowed the 
United States to process a maximum of 27,845 Cuban immigrant visas a year. In 
practice, America has admitted only 3,000 or so each year. Washington has 
maintained that the other applicants did not satisfy the requirements of U.S. 
immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban government insists that the United States reneged on the 1984 
agreement and should admit all Cubans who applied but failed to receive visas 
since then. That presumably involves a total of well over 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban proposal evidently did not make it clear how soon Castro expected 
these emigrants to be accepted by the United States. A U.S. official said the 
timing was not even discussed with the Cubans, "given the magnitude of their 
proposal." The number is simply too large for the Americans to accept, no 
matter what time frame was proposed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official described Washington's sweetened offer as "a responsible 
proposal to meet both sides' objectives." He said the Americans had worked hard 
and were trying to put the issue "on a different footing." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not elaborate but noted that the U.S. negotiators are suggesting that 
the two sides regard the number of visas specified in the proposal as "a floor, 
not a ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 The official described the talks as caught "in a holding pattern," pending a 
response from the Cubans to the latest U.S. offer. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the Coast Guard has been plucking Cubans in rafts and 
makeshift boats out of the Florida Straits at an average of about 1,000 a day. 
While that is only about half the number of refugees who were taking to the 
seas a couple of weeks ago, it is still a considerable figure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Coast Guard picked up 1,179 Cuban refugees. By 2 p.m. EDT 
Monday, Coast Guard ships had picked up another 683. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in an abrupt policy about-face, has ordered the Coast Guard to take 
intercepted refugees to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on the 
southeastern tip of Cuba. The rafters are being detained there in tent camps 
that are adjacent to encampments of Haitian boat people. The Administration 
insists that neither the Cubans nor the Haitians will be allowed entry into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military will soon use up all of the 20,000 spaces allotted for Cuban 
refugees at Guantanamo. It is building new camps to house 10,000 more Cubans at 
U.S. bases near the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo threw rocks at U.S. soldiers on Sunday to 
protest what they see as preferential treatment of the Cubans, the Associated 
Press reported. About 50 Haitians breached one of the camp fences when Panama 
announced it would accept up to 10,000 Cubans to ease the strain on the base, 
base spokesman Maj. Rick Thomas said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 When a security force was called in, the Haitians began throwing rocks, Thomas 
said. A 16-year-old Haitian boy suffered a skull fracture when he was hit by a 
rock, and six Army soldiers also were injured. The boy was flown to Jackson 
Memorial Hospital in Miami, according to wire service reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that may ease the tensions, Surinamese and U.S. authorities said 
Monday that the first of 2,500 Haitian refugees granted asylum in Suriname 
would start arriving Friday, Reuters reported. U.S. military planes are 
expected to transport 250 refugees a day from Guantanamo to a newly built camp 
in the South American nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, police said they found two unexploded Molotov cocktails outside the 
offices of a Cuban American magazine in the Little Havana district. The two 
firebombs were removed early Sunday.UNITED STATES

ESPY-DOUGLAS ETHICS PROBE A CLOUD OVER DUAL SUCCESSES; POLITICS: OLD SCHOOL 
PALS FANTASIZED ABOUT POWER -- AND ACHIEVED IT. NOW THEY'RE UNDER FIRE IN AN 
ERA OF SENSITIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As schoolmates at Howard University in the 1970s, Mike Espy and his friend 
Richard Douglas sometimes sat up deep into the night in their dormitory, 
drinking beer and fantasizing about a day when they would become powerful 
figures on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, still close friends, they have succeeded beyond their 
wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy entered politics and in 1986 became the first African American elected to 
Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction. In 1993, President Clinton 
named him secretary of agriculture, the first black ever to hold that Cabinet 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, meantime, became the first African American to earn a doctorate in 
agriculture from the University of Maryland, served in the Agriculture 
Department under President Ronald Reagan and today is senior vice president for 
corporate affairs for Sun Diamond Growers of Pleasanton, Calif., a large 
raisin, prune, walnut, fig and hazelnut producer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in some ways, a vintage Washington success story: talent, charm and 
energy yielding power, position and the perquisites that go with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As their careers have soared, however, Espy and Douglas have become part of an 
FBI inquiry -- the sort that is becoming all too familiar in a time of 
heightened sensitivity over matters of ethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into whether Espy may have 
improperly accepted gifts, favors and travel expenses from a variety of private 
agribusiness firms that receive funding from, and are regulated by, the 
Agriculture Department, including his friend Douglas and Sun Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on the basis of preliminary FBI findings, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has 
asked a three-judge panel of the federal Circuit Court of Appeals to appoint a 
special prosecutor to take over the case. A decision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy and Douglas deny any wrongdoing. According to Agriculture Department 
spokeswoman Ali Webb, Espy views Douglas only as "an old friend" who happens to 
work for an agricultural firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, who declined requests for an interview, contends the allegations stem 
from unhappiness over changes he is attempting to bring to the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the allegations -- that Espy improperly used a corporate jet, accepted 
free tickets to professional basketball and football games and fraternized too 
much with individuals who deal with the government -- may seem like minor 
transgressions, if that. 
</P>
<P>
 But they represent one of the most important ethics issues in present-day 
Washington. At a time when even arcane and obscure programs and policy 
decisions can mean millions of dollars in profits or costs to a business or 
industry, the existence of close relationships between decision-makers and 
potential beneficiaries can raise concern about the objectivity and fairness of 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The President himself helped to create the climate by promising during his 
campaign to "limit the influence of lobbyists" in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investigators are exploring allegations raised by some Agriculture 
Department officials, as well as others, that Douglas and Sun Diamond may have 
traded on their special access to Espy and, in turn, that the secretary has 
tried to protect a controversial federal program that funds overseas promotion 
of U.S. agricultural products -- including those of Sun Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 The program in question is the department's Marketing Promotion Program, which 
Douglas was instrumental in devising and Espy has supported in the face of 
stiff opposition from urban members of Congress and Administration 
budget-cutters. Over the last decade, Sun Diamond's cooperatives have benefited 
from more than $35 million in federal spending from the MPP. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Douglas is credited by some officials with helping to persuade 
Espy to hire Kim Schnoor, a former Sun Diamond lobbyist, as his chief domestic 
adviser. And some Agriculture Department appointees have questioned the 
propriety of a $24,000, three-month Agriculture Department contract awarded to 
Douglas' longtime female companion, Patricia Kearney. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy also has been a vocal defender of the use of methyl bromide, an 
ozone-depleting chemical favored as a fumigant by California's dried-fruit and 
nut industry. He has acknowledged his role in persuading the Environmental 
Protection Agency to delay the elimination of the chemical as a fumigant until 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture Department officials and others say investigators also are looking 
at a 40th birthday party for Espy that Douglas co-hosted and helped pay for at 
a Georgetown restaurant, a trip to Greece arranged by Douglas where the 
secretary addressed the International Nut Council, and numerous New York Knicks 
basketball games Espy apparently attended as Douglas' guest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Cabinet officer, Espy is prohibited from accepting "anything of value" 
from anyone whose business interests are in any way affected by his department, 
though the regulations make some exceptions for purely personal gifts from 
longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas is known to have told investigators that he and other friends of Espy 
paid for the birthday party entirely from personal funds to avoid running afoul 
of ethics laws. He said he kicked in $500 himself and even cleared the 
arrangements with the Agriculture Department's ethics officer, James Michael 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trip to Greece in May, 1993, Douglas and Espy dined together with 
their girlfriends and Schnoor. But their friends insist that while Douglas 
picked up the tab for himself and the two girlfriends, Schnoor wrote a personal 
check to cover the cost of dinners for Espy and herself. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Knicks games, Douglas reportedly told investigators that the 
tickets were left for the two men by Greg Anthony, a Knicks guard who Douglas 
claims "is like a son to me" and who idolizes Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the FBI investigation began in response to information received 
from the Agriculture Department's inspector general that the secretary had 
flown aboard a corporate jet and accepted lodging and football tickets from 
Tyson Foods Inc., the Arkansas-based poultry giant with ties to Clinton. The 
information was referred to the public integrity section of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, and the FBI was ordered to investigate. As the 
probe progressed, it broadened to include other matters, including Espy's 
receipt of Chicago Bulls tickets from an executive of the Quaker Oats Co. and 
his ties with Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, who also declined a request for an on-the-record interview, has told 
friends that he and Sun Diamond actually have been less successful in pursuing 
federal aid under Espy than they were under his GOP predecessors. He has 
complained that Espy's prominence has created a political hornet's nest for 
him: Fellow Republicans view him as disloyal for aiding Espy; Democrats are 
jealous of his access to the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, friends of the two men insist Douglas has been especially sensitive 
to possible conflicts posed by his relationship with Espy, and they suggest 
that some of the controversy springs from the unusual prominence of Espy and 
Douglas as two African Americans in a field dominated by whites. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they say allegations involving Douglas are being fueled by the 
Teamsters Union, which has been involved in a three-year labor dispute at Sun 
Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that Douglas enjoys unusual entree to Espy and his 
closest advisers. Their parallel careers as advocates for agricultural 
interests have been intertwined for nearly a decade -- with benefits for both. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are like brothers," said James Lake, a veteran Washington lobbyist 
who is close to Douglas and active in GOP circles and California agriculture 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, when Espy, an attorney reared in a middle-class home in Mississippi, 
won a seat in Congress, he became an effective proponent for catfish farmers in 
his poor district and won reelection twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, one of six children raised in Washington by a mother who cleaned 
houses for a living, deliberately chose to make his mark, friends say, in areas 
where there were few blacks: agriculture and the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas advised and contributed to Espy's historic first congressional 
campaign and then helped show his friend the ropes in Washington. On four 
occasions, Sun Diamond gave then-Rep. Espy an all-expenses-paid trip to 
California and a $2,000 honorarium for attending meetings and making speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's nomination of Espy as agriculture secretary marked a shared triumph 
for the longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, 46, has been portrayed by Agriculture Department officials as a 
frequent visitor to Espy's second-floor office and a shadow adviser to Espy, 
along with former California Rep. Tony Coelho, now an investment banker who 
handles the Sun Diamond pension portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, 40, acknowledges that Douglas recommended Schnoor, a former Coelho aide 
who has also lobbied for Sun Diamond as an employee of Lake's firm. He also 
admits that Douglas lobbied him formally at least three times on issues crucial 
to Sun Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas is said to be particularly sensitive about criticism within the 
department of the contract that the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition 
Service gave to Kearney, his longtime girlfriend, to help develop a strategic 
plan for improving the nutritional standards in the school meal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney's defenders note that she was well-qualified for the assignment. She 
is a former chief of staff to Clayton K. Yeutter, George Bush's first 
agriculture secretary. She earned a degree in nutrition from Harvard University 
and a master's from Tufts University. Agriculture Department spokesman Neil 
Flieger insisted neither Espy nor Douglas helped her win the contract and she 
"was invaluable in helping the department" and worked two extra months without 
additional pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy McBride, communications manager for Sun Diamond, dismissed the close 
relationship between the secretary and Douglas as an accident of fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That they were college (friends) is a piece of past history," McBride said. 
"Richard has a very professional responsibility. He is very careful to keep the 
two things separate. . . . "

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; PERSONAL ATTACKS KICK OFF STRETCH RUN; AT 
HOLIDAY APPEARANCES IN L.A., WILSON CALLS BROWN A 'NON-PLAYER' IN DEALING WITH 
THE STATE'S PROBLEMS, AND SHE ASSAILS HIM OVER ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION.

 On the traditional opening day of the fall campaign, California's candidates 
for governor took off the gloves Monday and accused each other of not being up 
to the job. With that, they ushered in what will be the most-watched 
gubernatorial contest in the nation this year, one with a potentially profound 
impact not only on the running of the nation's largest state but on the looming 
1996 presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Labor Day pancake breakfast on the grounds of Los Angeles Trade-Technical 
College, Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown tore into Republican incumbent 
Pete Wilson on the joint themes of economics and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a state that was built on the workers, the workers who came here from 
all over the country and the world to find a decent job, good schools and safe 
communities," she said. "In four years under Pete Wilson, we have seen the 
promise that once was California destroyed -- job by job, school by school and 
community by community. And we're not going to give him a job for four more 
years, are we? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson wants to keep his job. Let's ask him what he's done to help you 
keep yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town in Marina del Rey, where he spent an hour shaking hands and 
lunching with lifeguards and fire rescue crews, Wilson characterized Brown as a 
woman content to sit on the sidelines -- "a non-player" -- while he did the 
dirty work of governing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said his remarkable political resurgence -- he has come from 20-plus 
points down in the polls a year ago to a narrow lead now -- is due to voters 
directly comparing him and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, they are contrasting the record of performance with a lot of 
conversation from Ms. Brown, and they don't see any real participation (from 
her) in making the kind of change that they think important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has not been involved in either changing the jobs climate, in making any 
of the reforms that we have targeted to small business employers to keep them 
in the state. She hasn't been involved at all in any of the reforms of the 
criminal justice system. The words welfare reform I don't think passed her lips 
until she was a candidate for governor, indeed most of the things she's talking 
about now didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 As the cross-sniping indicated, the election is expected to be hard-fought, 
even bitter, before it ends on Election Day, Nov. 8. And the emotions cross 
state borders, for throughout the nation, the California race is being watched 
by political seers seeking to divine the futures of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have lusted after the governor's office since they lost it in 1982, 
and it is seen as particularly important this year as the buildup continues to 
the 1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are yearning to hold on to the seat to arrest the staggering 
momentum of Democrats here, who in the last statewide election in 1992 won two 
U.S. Senate seats and destroyed Republican hopes of dominance in the 
Legislature and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two nominees, however, the race is personal. Brown is seeking to be 
the third member of her family to occupy the governor's suite, after her father 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. and her brother Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Wilson is 
fighting to defy those who counted him out last year when his popularity fell 
to record lows. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the summer, the election has been fought on Wilson's turf -- 
crime. Brown sought Monday to broaden her attack with her contention that 
Wilson has been the worst governor for education in the state's history and has 
presided over the destruction of one job for every 34 minutes of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can restore the dream, we can restore the promise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, while belittling Brown on a range of issues, signaled that crime will 
be at the forefront of his autumn attack. He took particular delight Monday in 
lancing her for saying recently that crime would be a "so-what" issue to voters 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who can say it's a so-what issue in October has never understood it in 
the first place, has never had the visceral understanding of why people are 
outraged," he said. "If she thinks that, she's deluding herself and no one 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also quarreled long-distance over debates. Brown complained 
that Wilson has refused to agree to debate her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to debate me like a man," she said. "He's out there hiding behind 
his wife, (and) the Republican female governor of New Jersey. Let's get a 
debate. Let's get five debates." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's wife, Gayle, has been actively campaigning for him, and last week New 
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman visited on his behalf. Wilson has declined 
any debates in September, citing the press of business in Sacramento, where he 
has 1,500 legislative bills on his desk for a signature or a veto. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marina del Rey, the governor dismissed Brown's debate lament. "That's 
gamesmanship of the kind that she would do well to abandon," he said. "She 
knows that we initiated the whole debate question. We asked her to debate." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Broadcasters Assn. has announced a mixed-format Oct. 16 debate, 
which Brown has accepted. To date, Wilson has turned down the offer, holding 
out instead for a traditional format in which political reporters can ask 
questions of each of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we insist on is a format where she can't skate, where she can't give an 
answer which is not really responsive and then sail on to the next topic," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates' styles were widely disparate Monday. Brown stumped the length 
of the state, venturing from the pancake breakfast in Los Angeles to a labor 
brunch in San Diego and finally to a union gathering in the Northern California 
town of Pleasanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, for his part, engaged in a fairly low-key Labor Day, with his sole 
public appearance before the Marina del Rey public safety officials. A 
scheduled morning event in Laguna Beach was scrapped when the governor stayed 
in Sacramento early Monday to deal with what he termed "a little private 
business with some of the staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the slow pace of the day, Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur cracked that 
"the masses would probably rather enjoy Labor Day without politicians bothering 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their different approaches, Brown and Wilson both engaged in the kind 
of television showboating that has come to characterize California campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson toured a fire station and three rescue boats, engaging the deputies and 
lifeguards in discussions of water-pumping capacities, stolen boats and 
exploding gas tanks. Later, he posed in front of a firetruck with several 
firefighters and an 8-year-old bull terrier named Petey, which declined to 
shake the governor's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown served up pancakes and waffles in Los Angeles and traveled to the rest 
of her union gatherings by private plane. The Pleasanton event is a traditional 
Labor Day happening that in previous years has entertained both her brother and 
father in their campaigns for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown made clear Monday that she will welcome the support of President Bill 
Clinton. In that, she stands apart from many party nominees this year who have 
run away from an association with the frequently beleaguered President. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to host a fund-raiser for Brown on Sept. 18, and his wife 
Hillary Rodham Clinton is due to raise money for Brown this week.

FLOOD OF ANTI-CRIME BILLS UNPRECEDENTED, STATE OFFICIALS SAY; CAPITOL: SEVERAL 
FORCES CONVERGE TO PROPEL SCORES OF MEASURES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT HOW 
THE GET-TOUGH LAWS WILL BE FUNDED IS A BIT MURKIER.

 For nearly a decade, Assemblyman Richard Katz was stymied in his repeated 
efforts to limit the "good time" credits that felons can use to reduce the time 
they spend behind bars in California's state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month the Sylmar Democrat finally broke through, winning passage of a 
measure to require prisoners convicted of violent crimes to serve at least 85% 
of the time to which they have been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's "truth-in-sentencing" bill was one of scores of proposals intended to 
crack down on criminals that sailed through the Legislature this year on an 
unprecedented wave of anti-crime sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Legislature as a whole is finally hearing from people who are 
frustrated and angry about criminals on the street," Katz said last week as the 
session came to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other bills headed to Gov. Pete Wilson, who will almost certainly 
sign them into law: a sweeping proposal that would put first-time child 
molesters and violent rapists in prison for 25 years to life; a significant 
broadening of policy to allow teen-agers as young as 14 to be tried as adults, 
and new restrictions on the rights of inmates, including a provision that would 
force criminals who profit from their notoriety to give the money to their 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of bills referred to the Legislature's criminal justice committees 
has doubled in the past two years, one aide estimated. The flood of new 
proposals prompted the state Senate to split its Judiciary Committee into two 
panels, one for civil and one for criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing what's happened this year," said veteran Sen. Robert 
Presley (D-Riverside), a former undersheriff, who speculated that more 
anti-crime bills passed in 1994 than in any other year of the two decades he 
has spent in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley, Katz and others in the Capitol say the rush to fight crime was 
triggered by a convergence of events: the perception that people aren't as safe 
as they used to be; highly visible cases such as the kidnaping and murder of 
12-year-old Polly Klaas; public furor over the parole of rapist Melvin Carter; 
President Clinton's successful push for an anti-crime package intended to put 
more police on the streets, and election year politics that have seen both 
Wilson and his challenger, Democrat Kathleen Brown, champion anti-crime 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of crime-busting legislation comes even as figures released last 
week by the attorney general's office show that the number of reported crimes, 
including homicides, dropped 7.5% during the first six months of 1994 compared 
to last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, research by The Times poll in May and June found that crime remained 
the top concern of Californians -- an issue mirrored in the gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern crystallized in the wake of last year's highly publicized drama 
surrounding Polly Klaas. In October, Klaas was kidnaped from her Petaluma home 
and was later found dead. A parolee with a long criminal record confessed to 
the crime, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, Polly's father, began a crusade to keep convicted violent felons 
in prison for longer terms and improve the tracking of sex offenders released 
from custody. He said he was pleased with the Legislature's performance on the 
crime issue this year, although each victory is bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that marvelous, innocent children have to die to prompt 
action from our legislators," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the kidnaping of Klaas' daughter, another grieving father, Mike 
Reynolds of Fresno, launched a drive to place the "three-strikes" scheme on the 
November ballot after his daughter was brutally murdered by a parolee who tried 
to steal her purse. The measure requires that habitual criminals serve at least 
25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Reynolds' initiative drive, the Legislature in March 
passed and the governor signed a nearly identical bill. Some prosecutors and 
judges -- and Marc Klaas -- complain that the "three-strikes" legislation will 
sweep up too many nonviolent offenders along with the violent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill's advocates said any three-time serious felon is a danger to the 
public, whether their crimes were violent or not. They said tough anti-crime 
legislation of that stripe should have been passed long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature did not get into gear until a couple of tragedies that were 
well-covered in the press," said assistant Atty. Gen. Jack Stevens, who tracks 
legislation. "It's a shame to have to be motivated by anecdotal events, 
disparate events, but that seems to be the way they operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, after three years of seeing his strongest proposals blocked in 
legislative committees and trailing Kathleen Brown in statewide polls, seized 
upon crime as his top reelection issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He convened an anti-crime "summit" at the beginning of the year in Los 
Angeles, expanded a special legislative session to include crime, pressed for 
passage of a bipartisan, anti-crime package and, near the end of the session 
last month, staged a public safety rally outside the Capitol to put more 
pressure on lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything Wilson embraced made it through the Legislature. The most 
notable failure was a proposal by Presley to extend the death penalty to those 
convicted of murders committed during drive-by shootings and carjackings. The 
Democrat-dominated Assembly Public Safety Committee blocked the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other bills, including the proposal to increase prison terms for 
first-time rapists, were softened before lawmakers sent them to Wilson's desk. 
But the governor on Friday termed the session "an enormous success." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We didn't get everything that we asked for, but we got far more 
than I think the state of California has seen -- ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Democratic challenger, Treasurer Brown, supported most of the bills 
in his package. But Steve Glazer, a spokesman for Brown, said Wilson's actions 
on crime are a case of too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer criticized the governor for failing to lobby for President Clinton's 
crime bill or for a state measure that would have broadened the ban on military 
style semiautomatic weapons. He also said Wilson has allowed more parolees and 
sex offenders to roam loose on the state's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson dismisses such criticism as unfair sniping from a candidate with no 
record of her own on criminal justice matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bills Wilson is expected to sign is the Katz measure, which is 
similar to another "truth-in-sentencing" proposal the governor favored, though 
not as strict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, most prisoners who work or take classes can cut their 
sentences in half. The Katz legislation is aimed at ensuring that violent 
inmates can work off no more than 15% of their terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that he introduced his proposal after reading that convicted 
kidnaper Kenneth Parnell was released from prison in 1985 after serving just 
five years for abducting two young boys, whom he held captive for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Katz recalled how the proposal was buffeted for nine years 
through the Legislature. Sometimes, he said, liberals opposed the cut in 
work-time credits because they saw the 50% credit as an incentive for prisoners 
to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, he added, it was slammed by conservatives as too costly. The cost 
of the proposal is expected to be $137 million a year in 2000 and $394 million 
annually by the year 2018. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, lawmakers eager to pass crime bills gave little consideration 
to the fiscal consequences or the need to build more prisons to house new 
inmates. They rejected a proposal to put a $1.8-billion bond issue on the 
November ballot to pay for six new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Presley, who was pushing for the bond, noted that with all the anti-crime 
measures, more inmates will be incarcerated and serve longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to understand why the Legislature would vote and pass all the 
anti-crime legislation . . . yet we can't get a bond bill out of here to build 
the facilities to keep them in," Presley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing hours of the legislative session, an attempt fell apart to 
approve prison bonds because they were linked with education and other forms of 
bond financing that divided lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers deride virtually the entire direction of criminal justice 
legislation this year and say the crime-fighting programs of Wilson and his 
Republican predecessor, George Deukmejian, have been miserable failures. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most vocal critics is Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) who said 
that with more people in prison, the state has less money available to deal 
with the social problems that contribute to violent criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the toughest laws probably in the world in California right now, and 
this whole 12 years of tough laws and smashing down on crime has not worked," 
Bates said. "It's basically failed. We now have more people in (prison), but do 
we feel any safer, do we feel any better?" New Crime Laws 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature this year passed a number of measures intended to crack down 
on crime. Here are some of the more important bills in the package that Gov. 
Pete Wilson has signed or is expected to sign: 
</P>
<P>
 * AB 971 (Three Strikes): Doubles sentence for repeat serious felons and 
requires sentences of 25 years to life for third felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 26X (Sex Offenders): Increases sentences to 25 years to life for child 
molesters and the most violent rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 1309 (Arson): Creates the crime of aggravated arson with a sentence of 10 
years to life if the arson is premeditated and intended to cause injury or 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * AB 2716 (Sentence Credits): Requires violent felons to serve at least 85% of 
their terms. Current law allows these inmates to cut their sentences in half 
with credits for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 1260 (Inmate Rights): Narrows the "inmate bill of rights"; allows prison 
managers to confiscate pornographic or hate literature, compel testing for 
communicable diseases, and restrict the ability of inmates to challenge prison 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 23x (Juveniles). Allows 14- and 15-year-olds to be tried as adults for 
serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 40x (Insanity): Prevents the use of insanity as a defense when the 
defense is based solely on a personality or adjustment disorder, a seizure 
disorder or use of intoxicating substances. 
</P>
<P>
 * SB 1330 (Criminals' Profits): Takes the profits a felon makes on a business 
enterprise based on criminal notoriety and places the money into a trust for 
the benefit of the criminal's victims. The bill is a reaction to convicted mass 
murderer Charles Manson's recent authoring of a rock 'n' roll song. 
</P>
<P>
 * AB 2500 (Tracking Sex Offenders): Establishes a 900 telephone number 
operated by the Department of Justice to allow citizens to learn the 
communities of residence, physical descriptions and criminal records of 
registered sex offenders.

PARAMILITARY FIGURE DEVELOPING COMMUNITIES IN IDAHO; LAND USE: NEIGHBORS ARE 
TROUBLED BY WORK OF FORMER POPULIST PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JAMES (BO) 
GRITZ. HE SAYS HE IS PREPARING FOR ARMAGEDDON IN 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 High above the Clearwater River on a plateau overlooking this northern Idaho 
timber town, a most unlikely developer is selling lots in twin communities 
named Almost Heaven and Shenandoah. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest incarnation, former presidential candidate and ex-Green Beret 
Lt. Col. James (Bo) Gritz is planning five- and 10-acre lots surrounded by hay 
farms and conifers for 1,000 "Christian patriots" -- many of whom he has 
trained in paramilitary tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritz, who garnered 10,000 Idaho votes as a Populist Party presidential 
candidate in 1992, sees the plateau as a haven for like-minded people to flock 
to in preparation for the Armageddon he says will come in 1996. The only rule 
in his "covenant communities" is that members promise to defend their neighbors 
against any "predator threat." 
</P>
<P>
 "If my predictions (about chaotic times to come) are correct," said the 
55-year-old Gritz, surveying the grounds that are reachable only by a steep, 
winding, unpaved road, "there will be more and more people wanting to come up 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI knows me and Special Forces know me," he added. "The last thing they 
want to do is tangle with me, because I'm trained in guerrilla warfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Property is selling fast. And residents here and in the Nez Perce American 
Indian reservation that surrounds the envisioned communities are nervous about 
the growing influence of white supremacists and paramilitary organizations that 
are springing up throughout Idaho and across the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 By sheer force of personality, this archetype for the film character Rambo -- 
a charismatic, tough talking, decorated veteran of Vietnam and Special Forces 
activity in South America -- is emerging as a leader of people who strongly 
resent gun restrictions and government intervention in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northwest civil rights group believes Gritz -- who is a beneficiary of 
trusts formed to buy and sell the property that some say will fetch $1.2 
million in profits -- is establishing a regional power base for tax protesters, 
white separatists and anti-Semitic fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritz, who has two children who are half-Chinese and is the godfather of an 
African American girl, claims those are "malicious untruths" that have "falsely 
and wrongly caused worry and concern" among his neighbors in this community of 
1,100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear: Some say Gritz's covenant communities have injected an 
eerie sense into this remote Rocky Mountain town that the newcomers are gearing 
up for a firefight with federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that sooner or later Almost Heaven will become another Waco, Tex.," 
said Rosemarie Thibault, 56, general manager of Kamiah's Clearwater 12 Motel. 
"Know what else scares me? I think Gritz wants to divide this community." 
</P>
<P>
 He already has. A struggle for dominance is taking place between those who are 
here for the tranquillity of a small town with no street lights, movie theaters 
or malls, and Gritz's supporters -- including some Kamiah residents -- who see 
this as a refuge from some future calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings are running high, with disputes over the newcomers heard across town 
from the offices of Kamiah's local newspaper, the Clearwater Progress, to the 
coffee klatches at Big John's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about the letter Gritz sent to the Clearwater 12 Motel warning that 
he and his supporters may boycott the inn because of critical comments Thibault 
made at a town hall meeting earlier this year. They talk about Gritz supporters 
informing Idaho County Sheriff Robert E. (Gene) Meinen that they plan to run a 
candidate against him in the 1996 election. And they worry that the newcomers 
may take jobs in this rural region with precious few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 15, 700 people gathered in the stifling heat of the Kamiah High School 
multipurpose room to hear Gritz defend his projects and explain how members of 
his communities actually hope to avoid confrontations through strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was organized by Bill Glenn, owner of the Clearwater Progress and 
one of Gritz's most vocal local defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm not worried these people are going to be a threat to anyone 
in this area," Glenn said. "I'm a conservative . . . and politically I'm a 
little more receptive to his ideas about government." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meeting, about half of the audience cheered when Gritz attacked the 
"liberal media" for contributing to a false portrayal of him and his 
supporters, and when he predicted that Idaho will be a "pivotal state" in the 
tribulation to come. 
</P>
<P>
 And he prompted boos from men, women and children wearing buttons that said 
"Strength Through Unity" by implying that critics who question his plans are 
not from Kamiah and surrounding Idaho County. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dissenters was Randi Paradis, 46, who co-owns 40 acres adjoining the 
Almost Heaven development -- which is expected to be approved by the Idaho 
County Board of Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame to have someone like Bo Gritz, who is obviously into being a 
high-profile personality, come to a place like this with a message of fear and 
paranoia," said Paradis, a high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have building codes or zoning laws, and not many people per square 
mile -- it's a place where people do pretty much what they want," she added. 
"Now, we are faced with the consequences of being so wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiah has reason to be concerned, said Jonathan Mozzochi, director of the 
Seattle-based Coalition for Human Dignity, which monitors right-wing extremist 
groups throughout the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gritz's efforts to establish a community of followers in central Idaho who 
have been trained by him in paramilitary tactics," Mozzochi said, "represents 
perhaps the most significant development in the white supremacist movement in 
recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost Heaven, he said, may be only the first of several covenant communities 
that Gritz, former Arizona Police Officer Gerald (Jack) McLamb and former 
Arizona state Sen. Jerry Gillespie plan to establish in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozzochi said they are capitalizing on the siege mentality generated by the 
bloody standoff two years ago between white separatist Randy Weaver and federal 
officials at an Idaho Panhandle cabin about 160 miles north of here. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritz helped negotiate the surrender of Weaver, who was acquitted last year of 
all but minor charges in connection with the August, 1992, shootout that 
spurred an 11-day siege and claimed the lives of a deputy U.S. marshal, 
Weaver's wife, Vicki, and his 14-year-old son, Sammy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his extremist views and prophecy of an inevitable holy war with 
federal agents, Weaver has become a hero in the eyes of some back-country 
Idahoans. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man who got Weaver to surrender with cameras rolling, Gritz emerged as 
an easily recognized force among people upset by what they view as parallels 
between the Idaho case and the government's strategy during the April, 1993, 
Branch Davidian standoff at Waco in which more than 80 people, many of them 
children, died. 
</P>
<P>
 Both incidents started when federal agents brought firearms charges against 
people with highly unorthodox religious beliefs, living self-contained in 
remote locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights organizations contend that Gritz's covenant communities grew out 
of those standoffs, and out of the survivalist training programs he conducts 
across the nation called SPIKE (Specially Prepared Individuals for Key Events). 
These critics say the SPIKE programs seem to promise to prepare "Christian 
patriots" for future standoffs between right-wing extremists and federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June edition of Gritz's newsletter, Center for Action, he warned that 
"we are hard-pressed to stay ahead of mounting events, but barring total 
martial law, I should accomplish my promise of having you as ready as Delta 
Force in time." 
</P>
<P>
 SPIKE lessons cover instinctive, combat and special purpose marksmanship; how 
to carry, draw and hold a handgun and effectively engage multiple targets; the 
treatment and setting of broken bones; tracking and trapping wild game; rappel 
methods and tips on how to open a padlock in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, plus ammo, for $100 for each of six, 12-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritz said the communities here are open to all comers provided they are U.S. 
citizens and promise to defend their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gritz, who said he makes a living from his military pension 
and proceeds from his SPIKE program and newsletter, said the Almost Heaven and 
Shenandoah property was largely purchased with private loans. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said most of the people moving onto the property will be retirees on 
fixed incomes or people who have small businesses who will boost the local 
economy by patronizing local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiah Realtor Clint Engledow is more concerned about the "lost people looking 
for a guru" who he said are streaming into town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people coming through who are true goofballs -- they say we have to 
kill all black people before they kill us," said Engledow, who moved to Kamiah 
from Southern California 16 years ago. "They also say the government is 
planting computer chips in new car engines so that it will know how to find 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Gritz served briefly as former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke's vice 
presidential running mate for the Populist Party. Four years later, as a 
Populist Party presidential candidate, Gritz gained one of his strongest 
showings in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Gritz, who currently lives in Sandy Valley, Nev., said he plans to survey his 
future options after he moves into the log house he is building at Almost 
Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we're going to put our roots down," he said. "We plan to move 
in in about two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, he said, "Time will tell and only me and Jesus know."

WORKERS' STRIKE FOR DEMOCRACY ENDS IN NIGERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by lack of support from other Nigerians, thousands of oil workers 
returned to their jobs Monday and ended a two-month strike for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a victory for Gen. Sani Abacha's military regime, which took a hard 
line against the strikers and other democracy activists despite the devastating 
effects of fuel shortages on the West African nation's faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The junta had arrested some leaders and forced others into hiding. Last week, 
it began easing fuel shortages by importing gasoline, hiring new workers for 
oil refineries and persuading some strikers to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars, buses and trucks jammed streets again Monday in Lagos, and black-market 
gasoline vendors disappeared from roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fully back at work today," said Diji Egwaoje, spokesman for 
Shell-Nigeria, which produces more than 50% of the oil in Africa's most 
populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil accounts for 90% of the government's revenues and 80% of Nigeria's export 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before oil union leaders met Monday, reports indicated nearly all of the 
100,000 workers in the oil industry were back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders did not issue a statement after the meeting. But Milton Dabibi, 
general secretary of one of the two oil unions, said, "We just finished the 
meeting, at which we decided to suspend our 8-week-old strike action." 
</P>
<P>
 Dabibi said the strike could resume if the regime does not free more than a 
dozen jailed labor leaders, pay $36 million owed to international oil companies 
and protect oil workers from hostile communities. But the threat appeared 
toothless, merely repeating demands made when the strike began July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil workers had demanded that Abacha surrender power to Moshood K.O. Abiola, 
the businessman believed to have won the annulled 1993 presidential election 
that was to end a decade of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola was arrested June 23 and is awaiting trial on treason charges.

PLO BLAMES ISRAELIS FOR DELAY IN ELECTIONS; MIDEAST: ISRAEL SAYS THE HOLDUP IS 
DUE TO PROPOSAL FOR A PALESTINIAN PARLIAMENT, WHICH DEVIATES FROM PACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are trading angry accusations 
about who is to blame for the delay in holding West Bank and Gaza Strip 
elections called for in their peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree on one thing: It is growing increasingly unlikely that 
Palestinian elections will be held before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That means PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will continue to govern the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho -- and some aspects of Palestinian life throughout the West Bank -- 
with a government that has no popular mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis are not serious," said Saeb Erekat, municipal affairs minister 
in the self-governing Palestinian Authority. "In the past, they accused us of 
not wanting elections. But they are obstructing the elections now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said: "Mr. Erekat is 
suggesting to elect a Parliament. That is in contradiction to our agreement, 
and that is going to create a very big delay to the elections. If elections are 
very important to people like Saeb Erekat, and I believe that they are, then he 
should remove the obstacles to elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat, charged by Arafat with running the committee designing the 
Palestinians' first general elections, said he handed plans for elections to 
Israeli negotiators Aug. 16 and 17. His proposals -- which have not been made 
public -- reportedly call for the Palestinians to elect a 124-member governing 
council Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that they will study our papers and get back to us, but they 
haven't responded to us on even when to have negotiations on elections," Erekat 
complained. "They don't want to have elections, because they don't want to 
redeploy their forces on the West Bank and they don't want to give this 
government the popular mandate that it needs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hannie Jerushun, spokeswoman for Danny Rothschild, Israel's chief 
negotiator with the Palestinians, retorted: "Yasser Arafat only wants to have 
elections that he knows he can win. We have not responded because there are 
things in their proposals that we do not accept and because the time is not 
right to discuss these things. This process must be done step by step." 
</P>
<P>
 Oded Ben-Ami, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, observed that "we 
told Mr. Erekat, and we told the Palestinian Authority, that we are not going 
to jump to the next step before the previous step is completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Ami said Israel has no intention of beginning talks about Palestinian 
elections until Jerusalem transfers to the Palestinians authority in the West 
Bank for five areas of civilian life. The date for that transfer has not been 
set, he pointed out, although Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said last 
month it will be completed next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The election raises temperatures on both sides because the timing, structure 
and outcome are considered critical to the success of the still-fragile 
Palestinian-Israeli accord. Neither side wants to be seen as obstructing 
formation of a democratic government in the territories, but both are aware 
that the election process is fraught with political risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, I don't think elections will happen before next spring, but I 
want them to happen tomorrow," said Khalil Shikaki, a political science 
professor at An-Najah University in Nablus and a member of an independent 
Palestinian group preparing its own election plan for the territories. "I want 
elections because I want accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee Shikaki is working with is "very close" to completing a plan 
calling for Palestinians to elect an 80-member legislative body and a 20-member 
executive body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that opposition organizations, including Hamas, a militant Islamic 
group, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist 
organization, have indicated a willingness to participate in the kind of 
elections Shikaki's committee is promoting. 
</P>
<P>
 Shikaki criticized Erekat for submitting election proposals to Israel that 
have not been published in Palestinian newspapers or debated within the 
Palestinian community. "How can you start negotiating with the Israelis on 
elections," he asked, "when you have not even built a Palestinian consensus on 
your ideas?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement that Israel and the PLO signed in Washington on Sept. 13, 
1993, elections already are overdue. That declaration of principles stated a 
goal of holding "free and general elections . . . no later than nine months 
after the entry into force of this declaration." Technically, that meant 
elections should have been conducted by June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took Israel and the PLO much longer than expected to agree on 
implementing the first phase of their accord -- Israel's pullout from Gaza and 
the West Bank -- and transfer of authority there to the Palestinians. Israel 
only pulled out of Gaza and Jericho in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Palestinian Authority has struggled to build a government to 
manage daily affairs in the crowded strip and in Jericho. It has also been 
engaged in often-acrimonious talks with Israel over transfer of some authority 
in the rest of the West Bank to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides agreed just last month in Cairo to transfer five spheres of 
civilian life in the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority; only one -- 
education -- has actually been transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step in the process, the Israelis say, is securing funding for the 
Palestinian Authority -- expected to happen this week at an international 
donors conference in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis say they will start negotiations with the Palestinians on 
Israel's military redeployment in the West Bank only after they are assured 
that the Palestinians will be able to pay for services there. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Israel transfers civilian functions to the Palestinian Authority, it will 
be ready to start negotiating redeployment. And once redeployment is agreed on, 
Israel will start negotiating the election framework, Israeli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other hurdles keep getting in the way of preparing for elections. Erekat 
complained that Israel refused to allow Palestinians to conduct a community 
survey and district mapping. Israelis responded that they rejected the request 
because the Palestinians wanted to use a Palestinian company based in mostly 
Arab East Jerusalem to conduct the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel insists that no function directly connected to the Palestinian 
Authority in the territories can operate out of East Jerusalem, which Israel 
regards as an inseparable part of its capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians insist on involving East Jerusalem, which they hope will one 
day become the capital of an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day that we delay the (technical) process of preparing for elections is 
another five days delayed on the actual date of holding elections," Erekat 
said. "Soon, we will have to make another announcement of a date. I think it 
hurts us, the Palestinian Authority, so much to keep delaying." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin said, "I believe that it is in Israeli interest to have elections. It 
is the task of those of us on both sides who believe in the importance of 
elections -- because they legitimize the process, because those now opposing 
the process may accept the Palestinian Authority, if there is a democratic 
election. It is our task to encourage each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Palestinians agree," Beilin said, "to elect simply a council and not a 
Parliament, and if they agree to have East Jerusalemites participate by proxy 
voting -- in other words, if the territory of East Jerusalem is not included in 
the Palestinian entity -- that will make it possible to have elections in a 
very short while."

LEGISLATORS FORCE OUT KYRGYZ GOVERNMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government of Kyrgyzstan resigned Monday after a majority of legislators 
accused their leaders of "intrigues" and forced a suspension of Parliament, the 
Itar-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation will bring the second government overhaul in less than a year 
in this Central Asian nation of 4 million people, which has one of the most 
prosperous economies among the former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 President Askar Akayev fired the previous Cabinet last December amid 
allegations that the prime minister and other top officials were embezzling 
gold reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Akayev, elected unopposed in 1991 when Kyrgyzstan was part of the Soviet 
Union, said a new government would serve until parliamentary elections later 
this year, Itar-Tass said. No date was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 168 Parliament deputies announced they would boycott the final 
session of the 323-member assembly starting Sept. 27. That left the Parliament, 
the Kyrgyz Supreme Soviet, unable to act. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said the Parliament "has discredited itself in the eyes of the 
people (and) became involved in political intrigues," according to the Interfax 
news agency.

CHECHEN TROOPS TAKE STRONGHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government troops captured an opposition strong hold Monday after bloody 
overnight fighting killed dozens of people in the separatist Chechnya region of 
southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first significant success of the Chechen president, Dzhokar 
Dudayev, in his fight against the Kremlin-backed opposition after several days 
of clashes and an escalating war of words. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow put some of its troops in the Caucasus on combat alert and ordered them 
to "localize" the fighting if it spreads beyond Chechnya, Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel S. Grachev said in remarks carried by news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian military also strengthened its outposts along major roads from 
Chechnya and increased control over the region's airspace to prevent raids on 
border settlements and other "possible provocations by the Chechen air force," 
Grachev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general who declared Chechnya independent 
in 1991, has accused Russia of planning to invade his mainly Muslim republic of 
1.2 million to bring it back into the Kremlin's fold. He has dismissed the 
opposition as Moscow's puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight Sunday, Dudayev's forces overran the opposition stronghold of Argun, 
10 miles east of the Chechen capital, Grozny.

PUBLIC HEALTH; TOBACCO FIRMS' INTENT IS KEY TO FEDERAL CONTROL; FDA IS 
INSISTING THAT THE INDUSTRY BOOSTS NICOTINE LEVELS TO KEEP SMOKERS HOOKED. BUT 
COMPANIES SAY IT'S FOR TASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ultimately, when the battle over federal regulation of cigarettes is decided, 
it may all come down to intent.  
</P>
<P>
 What are the intentions of the tobacco industry when it controls nicotine 
levels in cigarettes? To keep smokers hooked, as the government believes? Or to 
maintain taste and flavor, as the companies insist? 
</P>
<P>
 The final interpretation likely will determine whether the Food and Drug 
Administration has the power to regulate cigarettes -- more precisely, nicotine 
in cigarettes -- as it does drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 No one challenges the fact that the tobacco industry controls and manipulates 
nicotine levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole dispute is about why they do it," said Matthew Myers, an attorney 
for the anti-smoking Coalition on Smoking OR Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure the companies adjust tar and nicotine levels," said Tobacco Institute 
spokesman Walker Merryman. "They have to, in order to produce a consistent 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law defines a drug as a substance intended to diagnose, treat, cure or 
prevent disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, when Congress amended the 32-year-old food and drug law, it added 
language to enable the agency to regulate other items, such as weight loss 
products, as drugs. Thus, a drug also is defined as a substance, other than 
food, "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicotine is considered a drug -- and regulated by the FDA -- when it is used 
in patches, gum and other prescription products that are designed -- intended 
-- to help individuals stop smoking. But it has never been regulated in 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts agree that nicotine does have pharmacologic, or drug-like, 
affects. But they disagree over how addictive it is. In 1988, Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop declared nicotine to be as addictive as cocaine and heroin. 
Tobacco industry officials insist it is not addictive at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that nicotine affects your brain and your brain 
chemistry," said a senior FDA official. "But the manufacturer has to intend to 
affect the structure and function." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the industry could present a persuasive case that nicotine is only about 
taste, then the FDA would have a hard time showing that they intended for it to 
affect the body," said Myers, whose coalition is made up of the American Heart 
Assn., American Lung Assn. and American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has changed is the ever-mounting evidence of the industry's complete 
understanding of the extent to which nicotine affects the body and our 
knowledge of the industry's technical ability to carefully control the level of 
nicotine." 
</P>
<P>
 But one lawyer knowledgeable in food and drug law, who declined to be 
identified because his firm represents tobacco interests, said the FDA is using 
the industry's knowledge that nicotine is present in cigarettes as a hook "to 
slide into" the question of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed out that the industry began making cigarettes long before it 
knew about nicotine and its effect on the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you continue to be aware that something is there, it becomes difficult to 
say you bear no responsibility for it," he acknowledged. Nevertheless, "the 
tobacco companies say, 'Yes, we have more knowledge now that nicotine is 
present, and that it was always present. But you're telling us that, way back 
in 1922, we intended this? Even though we didn't know about it?' 
</P>
<P>
 All of the internal industry research documents that have been made public -- 
either through leaks to the media or from Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), 
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel on health -- tend to support 
the FDA's position that the industry is not adjusting nicotine levels for 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 They show the companies' own research, memos and other papers preoccupied with 
the pharmacologic effects of nicotine -- not with its relationship to taste or 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never expected . . . to have evidence of intent," says the senior FDA 
official. "If you control and manipulate nicotine levels, that's an indicator 
of intent. That's why we focused on control and manipulation. What has happened 
here . . . is that documents from the industry go directly to the issue of 
intent, which is much more direct evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials believe the agency already has jurisdiction over cigarettes 
through the provisions in the law. But many observers predict the FDA almost 
certainly will be thwarted or delayed by legal challenges filed by the industry 
and others if and when it attempts to act. Some say the agency's best chance to 
regulate cigarettes is for Congress to amend the law spelling out such specific 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FDA is a bureaucratic entity, and I believe it is incapable of doing 
anything on this within (FDA Commissioner) David (A.) Kessler's lifetime, even 
if he outlasts some of the old-timers," said one lawyer familiar with food and 
drug law. "But it does not mean that the FDA will not cause things to happen, 
or cause Congress to get interested." 
</P>
<P>
 But, noting that the momentum against tobacco has been building, he added: 
"Will they issue a ruling that ultimately will be put into effect? It could 
take years. And the court proceedings will take additional years. And by the 
time the process moves toward culmination, the circumstances might have changed 
in such a way that the FDA's original approach might not even seem worth 
doing."

COMMUNICATIONS; VOA VIES FOR EARS OF WORLD, TESTS WATER IN NEW MARKETS 
</P>

<P>
 For half a century the Voice of America held a virtual monopoly in telling 
America's story -- warts and all -- to the world. And from Africa to the Soviet 
Union, millions of listeners came to rely on VOA as a truthful, accurate source 
of news. 
</P>
<P>
 But the end of the Cold War and the democratization of previously closed 
societies has brought vast changes to international broadcasting. For the first 
time VOA faces real competition, and it is looking to carve out new markets in 
order to stay vital and influential. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're no longer the voice coming over the wall or the voice through the 
door," said John Lennon, VOA's southern European division chief. "Now we're 
just one voice in a cacophony of voices. We must say something important. If we 
don't, people will go elsewhere for their news." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN, USA Today, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal now are 
available in many countries. The venerable British Broadcasting Corp. has 
gotten more aggressive in trying to expand its reach, and new radio stations 
have sprung up in the old Soviet Union and other former one-party states, 
offering their listeners news untouched by government censors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is a general worldwide move, particularly in Africa, toward 
the privatization of FM radio stations. So today, whether you live in Guinea or 
Afghanistan, you have a choice of numerous sources that, unlike the old 
propagandist Radio Moscow, serve up a daily diet of relatively balanced news 
and commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Moscow -- once the world's largest station with broadcasts in 82 
languages -- is beset by budget problems and has cut the number of languages it 
broadcasts in by nearly half. That leaves VOA and BBC as the major players 
competing for listeners on the world's half-billion shortwave radios. 
</P>
<P>
 VOA is moving to take advantage of the technological revolution under its new 
director, Geoffrey Cowan, who is on leave from the UCLA Center for 
Communications Policy, which he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War, Cowan says, doesn't mean VOA's work is done; rather, 
it presents the agency with new opportunities to establish an increased 
American presence worldwide and thus play a role in explaining the democratic 
process, teaching English, stimulating trade and discussing U.S. policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credibility is our most important product," says Cowan, whose father, Louis 
G. Cowan, was VOA director from 1943 to 1945. "In today's competitive news 
environment, if what you broadcast is not true, if you keep information from 
your listeners about, say, Whitewater, they're going to find out and . . . 
think you're a mouthpiece for the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 To increase its reach, VOA has recently gone on Internet, enabling listeners 
to retrieve VOA broadcasts in 15 languages on their personal computers. It has 
established a growing network of 1,100 AM and FM international "affiliates" 
that receive direct VOA feeds on dishes VOA often helps buy. (Four affiliates 
in Haiti were told by authorities there earlier this month to stop carrying VOA 
feeds.) And a news hot line in Arabic has received more than 250,000 calls 
since 1991 from stations that tap into and play for their listeners the latest 
VOA news on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 VOA, which administratively is part of the U.S. Information Agency, already 
reaches an audience of 100 million people. It broadcasts in 46 languages from 
its studios on Independence Avenue here and has 25 correspondents stationed 
around the world. Whereas 10 countries once interfered with its broadcasts, 
only China and Cuba now regularly jam VOA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although VOA's impact is difficult to assess, staffers say a line of graffiti 
scribbled on a Moscow building facing the U.S. Embassy provides the best 
endorsement: "Thank you Voice of America for the correct information."

PAPAL VISIT TO SARAJEVO RISKY, U.N. WARNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. officers warned Monday that Pope John Paul II's planned visit to Sarajevo 
posed grave security risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope's life will be at risk and the lives of those around him will be at 
risk as well," said a U.N. official who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old pontiff is due to travel to the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on Thursday, but the Vatican has indicated the trip still may be canceled 
because of security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo Archbishop Vinko Puljic told reporters he still hoped the Pope would 
come to the battered city. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for my heart, I'm 100% convinced he will come. As for my head, a little 
bit less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican officials could wait until the eve of the visit before making a final 
announcement, informed sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope will be within sniper range in a city surrounded by Bosnian Serb 
besiegers and defended by the mostly Muslim government army. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs see the Vatican as biased in favor of their Muslim and Roman Catholic 
Croat foes and recall the church's support for Croatia's Nazi-allied regime in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have refused to guarantee the Pope's safety. Their leader, 
Radovan Karadzic, told the Vatican he was worried Muslims might launch an 
attack and blame Serbs.

 Frances and John Magill had known each other casually for years, and met again 
and fell in love after their first spouses died. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 77; she was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days after their wedding, their car was struck after John Magill ran a 
red light, police said. His wife died at the scene and he died three days 
later. The other driver was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple got married Aug. 20. Between them, they had six children and 18 
grandchildren from their first marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Their families had welcomed the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was like a kid again," said Frances Magill's daughter, Lauralee 
Harrington. "She was just so happy and glowing and looking forward to a good 20 
years of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were quite remarkable," said John Magill's daughter, Cathy Good.

8 KILLED IN PLANE CRASHES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>

<P>
From Times staff and wire reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight people, two of them children, were killed in crashes of light planes at 
two rural Northern California airports Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two adults and two children died when the engine on their small plane stalled 
just after takeoff from a small airstrip in the Shelter Cove coastal resort 
area, about 170 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told authorities the plane had just taken off over the ocean when it 
"circled back, then all of a sudden . . . just dropped straight down," said 
Humboldt County Sheriff's Sgt. Wally Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft was so badly damaged on impact that neither its make nor the 
identity of the four people on board could be immediately determined, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Truckee Tahoe Airport, three men and a woman were killed when their 
single-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims were withheld pending notification of family members. 
Authorities said the men were military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokesman Bill Chilcott said the Cessna 172 had been fueled before it 
crashed Monday morning about 700 feet past the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane ascended only about 60 feet and seemed to veer out of control before 
it hit the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash sparked a small brush fire that was quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport emergency teams were out there immediately, but there was no 
chance to save the people on board the plane," Chilcott said.

2 INDIAN YOUTHS BANISHED TO ISLAND EXILE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers banished by a tribal court for beating and robbing a pizza 
deliveryman left aboard a fishing boat Monday for separate, uninhabited islands 
where they will spend at least a year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 As relatives watched, waved and quietly cried, Adrian Guthrie and Simon 
Roberts left the Klawock cannery dock aboard Wolf Chief, the boat that had 
served as their jail for the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A tribal court Friday had ordered the 17-year-old Tlingit Indians to spend a 
year to 18 months on unidentified islands for robbing and severely beating the 
deliveryman in Everett, Wash., last year. It marked the first time a criminal 
case had been referred by a state court to a tribal panel for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 After the boat was loaded with hundreds of pounds of frozen salmon, halibut 
and groceries, the boys hugged friends and relatives, said their goodbys and 
posed for photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Four elders accompanied the boys to the islands to help them refine their 
subsistence hunting and fishing skills. Elders said they will be taught how to 
make bows and arrows, and traditional trapping methods.

 Opponents of the annual Labor Day pigeon shoot in Hegins, Pa., took a new 
direction in efforts to halt the event, which they deride as a slaughter of 
innocent creatures. The effort came too late.An anonymous donor had offered 
$70,000 plus the cost of the pigeons if the town would cancel this year's 
spectacle. But the shoot, aimed at raising $50,000 for the town park and local 
activities, went on as scheduled because the offer was tardy. About 300 of the 
town's 900 residents already had spent countless hours setting up shooting 
ranges, ordering food and cleaning Hegins Park. A deal for next year might be 
possible. "If they want to talk to us (today), we would be willing to negotiate 
for 1995," said Bob Tobash, Labor Day Committee chairman.

CLINTON TAKES VACATION BREAK, VISITS SHIP WORKERS; POLITICS: IN LABOR DAY 
REMARKS, HE LAUDS A UNIQUE EMPLOYEE-MANAGEMENT PACT AT MAINE'S LARGEST FIRM. HE 
ALSO GETS IN A FEW DIGS AT FOES IN CONGRESS. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton visited a struggling shipyard on Labor Day for an election 
season warm-up, praising labor-management cooperation and condemning "enemies 
of change" in the workplace and government alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a half-day break Monday from his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., 
Clinton told about 1,000 rain-soaked employees of the Bath Shipyard that a 
groundbreaking partnership they had just struck with management is the best 
tool to meet international competition. And he sounded a favorite new theme by 
taking swipes at unnamed political foes who he said have sought to hamstring 
his efforts to enact health care and crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we get back to the good old-fashioned American values of working 
together in partnership, we're still not going to do what we ought to do," 
Clinton told the crowd, which stood against the backdrop of a Navy destroyer 
and beneath a pair of huge tower cranes. "We cannot afford in a global economy 
to be divided again -- government and business and workers fighting each other 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 But the partnership theme evaporated when he turned to the travails he has 
encountered this year with Congress, which has all but buried his health care 
reform initiative and nearly blocked his crime-fighting bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is for change in general, but they can always find a reason to be 
against it in particular," Clinton said. "Believe me, there will never be a 
bill in Congress that is perfect, because we are not perfect people. There is 
always some reason we can find to say no, to turn away from tomorrow, to be 
divided from our friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Administration has fought for change against some very, very powerful 
enemies of change." 
</P>
<P>
 With a payroll of 8,700, the Bath Shipyard is the largest private employer in 
Maine, having built 450 ships in 110 years. With about 97% of its business 
centered on defense -- primarily destroyers equipped with Aegis missiles -- its 
future has been clouded by the military cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor-management partnership approved as part of a new three-year 
agreement with workers is intended to foster a cooperative spirit by putting 
labor representation on committees that will have a voice in major company 
decisions. The employee representatives will not participate in actions 
involving merit pay or employee discharges. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is built around the "teaming" concept. Labor representatives 
will weigh in, for example, on the types of contracts the company pursues and 
even on the amount of its bids for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract forbids layoffs during the three years it is in effect. But it 
allows the company to shorten workweeks, require job sharing or offer buyout 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maine visit gave Clinton a chance to repay some of his political debt to 
Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the retiring Senate majority leader who was a 
major force behind this year's health care reform effort. Mitchell has long 
looked out for the interests of the shipyard, making sure it continued to 
receive enough defense contracts to minimize layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The stop also gave the President an opportunity to put in a word for 
Democratic Rep. Thomas H. Andrews, who is trailing Republican Rep. Olympia J. 
Snowe in a race for Mitchell's Senate seat. But Andrews' campaign aides were 
said to have mixed feelings about the potential effect of Clinton's 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the shipyard, Clinton mentioned the year's most publicized 
labor-management dispute: the major league baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still time for them to go back to work and finish the best baseball 
season in 50 years," he said. "And I hope they will." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to the November elections, Clinton urged the crowd "to reward people 
in public life who will say yes to America, who will look for new ways to come 
together, not be divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the President, wearing a white yarmulke, attended services in 
Edgartown, Mass., celebrating Rosh Hashanah and vowed to continue his work to 
bring peace to Israel and its neighbors. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton attended the packed services at the normally nondenominational Old 
Whaling Church.

 Two gunmen wearing black ski masks forced their way into the Tiffany & Co. 
store in midtown Manhattan while it was closed early in the morning and made 
off with $1.25 million in jewelry, police said.The robbers took one hour to 
overpower guards, pick out jeweled watches, bracelets and rings, and take 
security videotapes before leaving, said police Capt. Sal Blando. "They were 
very, very professional," Blando said at a news conference. Detectives were 
questioning the guards and other employees.

 An investigation that began when Ruth Lucille Loader and her car were reported 
missing from her farmhouse in Port Washington, Ohio, has grown into a 
nationwide manhunt for two men suspected in a series of murders and car thefts 
extending from there to Oklahoma. Federal warrants had been issued for Lewis 
Eugene Gilbert, 22, and Eric Alvin Elliot, 16, both of Newcomerstown, a small 
Ohio town.The warrants accuse them of unlawful flight from charges of burglary 
and kidnaping in connection with Loader's disappearance. Loader's car was found 
Thursday, the same day the bodies of William Brewer, 86, and Flossie Brewer, 
74, were found in their Fulton, Mo., home. The Brewers were robbed and each had 
been shot three times in the head, police said. The Brewers' car was found next 
near Oklahoma City alongside the body of 37-year-old Roxie Ruddel, who had been 
shot to death. Her pickup was missing, police said.

LET THEM NEVER FORGET; JAPANESE AMERICAN COLLECTED MEMORIES OF WWII INTERNMENT 
FOR MUSEUM EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Shiro Nomura left the dusty, hot Owens Valley back in 1945, he had hoped 
he never would return. But the 75-year-old Japanese American and former 
Manzanar internee did go back. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted people to know what happened there and to let them never forget," 
said Nomura's wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a trip up Highway 395, on the eastern side of the Sierras in the 
mid-60s, that the couple walked into the Inyo County museum. They struck up a 
conversation with then-director Henry Raub, who suggested that Nomura write 
about life in the relocation camp and loan Raub souvenirs for an exhibit. The 
museum, located in Independence, is only six miles north of the site of the 
Manzanar War Relocation Center, where more than 10,000 people of Japanese 
ancestry were abruptly ordered to live during World War II. Manzanar is now a 
nationally recognized historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of a long relationship. Nomura, whose nickname is Shi 
(pronounced Shy), made frequent pilgrimages with donations from Japanese 
American families from Southern California to the museum until his health 
forced him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shi started this collection as a volunteer effort more than 25 years ago," 
said Bill Michael, director of the Eastern California Museum of Inyo County. 
"He didn't get paid. He did this all by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the museum's exhibit provides visitors with a snapshot of life at 
Manzanar, a place and time many Americans would not wish to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Nomura write a series of articles on internment from a 
Japanese-American's perspective, but he also started a remarkable collection of 
photos, diaries and mementos -- nearly everything he could get his hands on -- 
from fellow Manzanar internees. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, failing health forced him to turn over his responsibility to 
Masuo Okui, 62, of Woodland Hills. Nomura, who has never won formal recognition 
for the exhibit, suffers from dementia and depression, which has robbed him of 
his memory and most of his speech, said his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can speak but only to say just three words, 'No,' 'Go,' and 'Here,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Okui said only about one-fourth of the material they have collected is being 
shown in the exhibit. Some will probably be shared with Manzanar, depending on 
the U.S. National Park Service, Okui said. This year the Park Service will take 
over maintenance of the Manzanar site. Several proposals to enhance the site 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Shi's dream," Okui said. "He wanted something near Manzanar where 
people could actually read about what went on. More than a plaque. But about 
five years ago, he started getting forgetful. He used to write down people's 
names in a little book so if asked, he could remember who they were. But then 
he started to fade fast." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in healthier years that Nomura began a correspondence to the Inyo 
museum about his camp life that was published in the museum's newsletter. When 
history professor Jerry Stanley got hold of Nomura's articles, Stanley -- who 
was busy on his first book, "Children of the Dust Bowl," about migrant laborers 
-- put them aside for a future project. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley's new book, released last month, "I am an American," (Crown Publishers 
Inc., New York, $15) tells of the saga of Japanese Americans during World War 
II, with Nomura as the book's main focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "His story is remarkable," said Stanley, who teaches history at Cal State 
Bakersfield. "He was a 17-year-old Nisei, who didn't speak or write Japanese. 
Thoroughly Americanized, and he's a big sports jock at Banning High, playing 
football, captain of the track team, baseball player and he was getting ready 
to marry his young love. But he gets shipped to Manzanar and she goes to Camp 
Granada in Colorado. It's like 'Gone With The Wind.' A war breaks up their 
romance."  
</P>
<P>
 It was more than 50 years ago when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed 
Executive Order 9066, allowing the military evacuation of 120,313 people of 
"Japanese ancestry" from the West Coast to 10 camps across seven states. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Nomura was a standout athlete who helped on his father's farm 
growing carrots and radishes in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the war, Nomura didn't know Mary. In fact, he was in love with Emiko 
(Amy) Hattori. How Nomura and his future wife met, Stanley said, is a magical 
part of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomura, a handsome young man, had taken Amy Hattori to a Nisei week festival 
at Yamato Hall in Los Angeles, shortly before the war began. 
</P>
<P>
 "He heard Mary sing there at the festival and he fell in love with her voice," 
Stanley said. "But he didn't meet her. A few years later, he's walking through 
Manzanar and hears her voice again. She's singing. Mary was known as the 
songbird of Manzanar. Well, his plans get shifted, he marries Mary, and Amy 
goes on to marry an engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary, who had been in talent contests and shows singing Bing Crosby tunes and 
other songs, apparently was more surprised by the turn of events than Nomura 
was.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he first heard me sing, he told me that he turned to Amy and told her, 
'I'm going to marry that girl,' " said Mary Nomura, now 69. "Can you imagine!" 
</P>
<P>
 She said they met at Manzanar in November, 1944, and were married eight months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, she worked as a housekeeper in Pasadena. Nomura became a 
gardener. But the couple eventually started Shi's Fish Mart in 1959 at the 
intersection of Brookhurst Street and Garden Grove Boulevard, which was one of 
the first, large Asian grocery stores in Orange County. The couple sold the 
store and retired in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Nomura's health since has declined. He suffers Alzheimer's symptoms, 
his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when Professor Stanley came to visit. He had never met Shi and I 
had to tell him, it's too late. He can't talk anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Michael, more than 27,000 people visited the Inyo museum last 
year.

VACANT BUILDING REBORN AS SANTA ANA COFFEEHOUSE; REDEVELOPMENT: A GROUP OF 
STUDENTS AND ASPIRING ARTISTS OPEN CAFE IN HOPES OF LURING PEOPLE BACK TO A 
FRIENDLY CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months ago, the little house known since the 1940s as Koo's Chinese 
Take-Out was plastered in thick layers of flaking wallpaper above a 
grease-drenched carpet, testament to a business that clung to life for decades 
in a declining commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 But with support from the city, a team of students and aspiring artists have 
pooled their meager resources and turned the empty building into what city 
officials describe as Santa Ana's only coffeehouse -- an intimate, hand-painted 
gathering place that opened its doors last week between two new art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 In any other place, the opening of a coffeehouse wouldn't turn heads, but 
here, emerging artists and city officials see in Koo's Arts Cafe a hope that 
Santa Ana will shed its tough image and become a place where people can stroll 
down the street at night, browsing in galleries and gathering to share ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been working hard on plans for an artists village in the 
downtown area, but the new galleries and coffeehouse less than half a mile away 
on North Main Street have blossomed on their own, and supporters hope they will 
be the catalyst for some gritty, down-to-earth redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an arts cafe. It's like a canvas," said Dennis Lluy, one of the four 
owners of Koo's Arts Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lluy, 21; Dan Montano, 22; Lou Bribiesca, 26; and Allan Benavides, 21, looked 
at sites in Long Beach and Whittier and came very close to signing a lease on a 
building in Fullerton before they felt the allure of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're sold.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Santa Ana's behind a curtain. But when you come here, you see how 
old it is, how diverse it is, how rad it is," Benavides said. "It's so weird. 
It's so fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners stress that they are definitely not businessmen. Three of them ran 
an alternative art gallery in Orange for a while last year and all share a 
commitment to no-holds-barred creative experimentation in art and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Benavides used to sell used cars before his recent arts-minded conversion, and 
all the others still hold day jobs. (Bribiesca works in a bowling equipment 
factory making pin holders: "Somebody's gotta do it," he says.) 
</P>
<P>
 With less than $8,000 between them, they pried off the wallpaper, chipped at 
the linoleum and peeled up the greasy rugs. They even found a 1947 newspaper 
while cleaning out the cluttered drawers upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the walls are brightly painted in blue, maroon, purple and green, and the 
floors are hand-decorated in celestial themes. Everything, from the 
collage-covered tables, to the art hanging on the walls, to the works of local 
poets available for perusal, is part of the work-in-progress atmosphere that 
the Koo's owners hope will encourage artistic growth and exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "If four people can do this in a house, then Santa Ana should be able to do it 
in the whole city," Bribiesca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montano, who paints and has set up his own studio in an upstairs room at 
Koo's, recently met Don Cribb -- the catalyst of the city's plans for a 
downtown artists village -- and Cribb persuaded him that Santa Ana might just 
be the birthplace of the kind of raw, alternative art scene the Koo's owners 
hope to foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Lluy had had his eye on the little Chinese restaurant, and when they realized 
it was empty, the four went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to just get people to come in here and express themselves," said 
Lluy, who works as a music promoter and has already booked a string of 
alternative bands at Koo's. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope the emerging business district will serve as a lure to bookstores, 
record stores, thrift stores and even other coffee houses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a hope shared by many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're small independent people, I think we're going to bring up 
the business potential in the area in general," said Richard Espinachio, who 
with partner Eric Smissen owns the Caged Chameleon gallery, next door to Koo's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having these businesses on the same street gives it the feeling of a small 
arts district. The thing that's great about it is the fact that it will 
increase the street traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery operated near the Bowers Museum for five years but only opened in 
its present location this summer. Dark's Art Parlour, the other alternative 
gallery down the street from Koo's, also opened recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to give people the feeling that it's a place to go, a place to 
hang out. You don't have to go to L.A. to see a gallery. You don't have to go 
to L.A. to have an espresso," Espinachio said.  
</P>
<P>
 Espinachio said the Main Street strip is just the beginning of what the city 
hopes to achieve down the street with the artists village -- a rezoned area of 
studio spaces where artists can also live. 
</P>
<P>
 But the North Main Street art cluster happened on its own, and many are hoping 
it will be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that this kind of thing is necessary here. People want it and it 
hasn't been. It's long overdue," added R.H. Phister, a Santa Ana resident and 
one of Dark's Art Parlour's founders. 
</P>
<P>
 City redevelopment staff are eyeing the emerging district with excitement. 
Once a thriving commercial corridor packed with financial institutions, the 
Main Street area, known as Mid-City, began to decline in the 1970s, said the 
agency's Susan Helper. 
</P>
<P>
 Helper, who is working on the artists village project, also helped Lluy walk 
through the complicated city process of getting city permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's very supportive of it. I think it will provide an amenity for the 
neighborhood that they need. It'll help to improve the pedestrian nature of the 
neighborhood, which we really wanted to see happen," Helper said. "On the 
artists village, we're initiating a lot of it, but this is just the private 
marketplace doing it on their own. It's really great." 
</P>
<P>
 Koo's Art's Cafe -- the owners wanted to keep as much of the place's original 
charm intact so they stuck with the name -- features live bands on Saturdays, 
drum circles on Fridays for anyone who wants to bring an instrument and join in 
and open poetry readings on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 It's open mornings from 8 to 11 a.m. and on weekends until 2 p.m.; and nights 
from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. Works of local artists are featured downstairs and the 
upstairs will soon be converted into gallery space, Lluy said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Koo's serves only coffee -- including flavors such as butterscotch 
and Lluy's cookies-and-cream concoction -- along with muffins and pastries. But 
soon, the foursome hope to open a full kitchen, serving "good, health-oriented" 
food.  
</P>
<P>
 The back yard might even feature a token hand-made miniature golf course, 
inspired by the golf supply store down the street, Benavides said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be small," he said. "Maybe just two or three holes."

MAJOR-LEAGUE TV; NORTHRIDGE TEAM SCORES BIG ON 'THE TONIGHT SHOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northridge's Little Leaguers had faced adversity before, but on Monday they 
had to learn to deal with something more elusive than a curveball and more 
fleeting than a Venezuelan fastball -- their own improbable celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous," said Spencer Gordon, 12, the right fielder. "I have more 
confidence with baseball than TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer and the rest of the Little League team that gained fame and then the 
national championship as the Quake Kids were waiting backstage in Burbank to go 
on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 If they were nervous, it didn't show as they ran around a large room in 
uniform, throwing and hitting plastic whiffle balls. Venturing in was to put 
oneself in harm's way. "I got hit in the leg," laughed one "Tonight Show" 
staffer as she fled the room. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Little Leaguers handled their talk show duties with the same 
bravado and humor that carried them from the tragedy of the Northridge 
earthquake, which left several without homes, to within one game of the world 
championship. And then allowed them to bounce back after they lost that game to 
a tough Venezuelan team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always been loose," said manager Larry Baca, seated against a wall 
and out of the way, shrugging at his inability to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 And they remained that way when the cameras started rolling. Leno introduced 
them, calling them "the most amazing story. . . . A lot of these kids don't 
have houses." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a touch of hyperbole. Only one is still out of his house. 
</P>
<P>
 The host asked Spencer about the loss in the final game at Williamsport, Pa. 
The boy admitted it was "real disappointing. It was an off day for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Would they like to try to hit off him, the host asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take you yard," blustered Spencer, using a baseball phrase that means to 
hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno lobbed a couple of whiffle balls up there and the Little Leaguers bashed 
them into the audience. Then the host pleaded a sore arm and brought in a 
surprise reliever, Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser. The professional didn't fare 
much better. One ball hit the lights above the stage. It may not have been as 
impressive as hitting one out of Tiger Stadium, but the crowd cheered its 
waffling flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Another guest, former pro football star and commentator Terry Bradshaw, 
ridiculed baseball players as wimps when the subject of the ongoing baseball 
strike came up. At the show's end, the host asked how the boys from Northridge 
felt about that. The players jumped on Bradshaw in playful revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was all over and the music had died away and the bank of monitors 
above the stage had gone black, the team posed with Leno for a picture.

SIZE AT HEART OF AIRPORT DEBATE; BURBANK: NEIGHBORS AGREE THAT THE TERMINAL 
MUST BE REPLACED TO COMPLY WITH FAA RULES. BUT THEY OBJECT TO MAKING IT FOUR 
TIMES LARGER THAN THE CURRENT FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This much can be agreed upon: The aging terminal at Burbank Airport must be 
replaced to comply with orders from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But should it be expanded to more than four times its present size? That 
question is at the center of a simmering debate that has pitted airport 
officials against vocal opponents of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport has gained popularity in recent years as a more convenient 
alternative to Los Angeles International Airport, thanks largely to low-fare 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating revenues for the 1994-95 fiscal year are projected to be $56.4 
million, more than double those of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they must act to accommodate the 10 million passengers 
expected to fly in and out in the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents contend that steps are being taken to build a regional -- 
and perhaps international -- airport larger than many of them ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the two sides will gather for a town hall meeting that is sure to be 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last such gathering, some Burbank residents complained that the 
president of the airport's governing board, Brian Bowman, talked so much that 
not enough public comment was heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, there are walls built up artificially high that prevent 
proper dialogue," said Chris Holden, a Burbank Airport commissioner. "The two 
have to coexist, and the two can coexist." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet neither side seems willing to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's present 163,000-square-foot terminal lies just 312 feet from the 
runway, but must be 750 feet away to comply with FAA safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials hope to build a $185-million terminal just north of the 
present one, on 120 acres of land once used by the Lockheed Corp. to build 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 But three underlying factors hinder plans for the 670,000-square-foot facility 
that is supposed to be completed in two phases by the year 2010: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lockheed's efforts to clean up contaminated soil in Burbank have been slow, 
and it is not clear how much longer work on the 120 acres will take. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Superior Court judge in January ordered airport officials to re-examine 
the potential for noise, traffic and air pollution that a new terminal might 
bring. The city of Los Angeles had sued the Airport Authority, charging that 
the board failed to properly study those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the case comes before the judge again on Sept. 23, airport officials are 
prevented from purchasing land related to the terminal expansion, among other 
things, said Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funding for the terminal expansion has not been found, but airport officials 
said they expect it will come from bond issues and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet public support for the project has been all but silent, with the loudest 
voices belonging to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never said we're anti-airport. We're anti-big airport," said Jim 
Gordon, co-founder of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League, a 
homeowners' group with about 200 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever gains they make, they will have to fight for," he added. "They want 
the moon and we're willing to give them a little chunk of it." 
</P>
<P>
 What airport Executive Director Tom Greer wants is for more people to 
recognize the economic benefits that the 435-acre facility brings now, 
including 38,000 jobs directly and indirectly related to operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport," he said, "can be the single most significant factor in 
continuing the economic revitalization of this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never see, out of Burbank, an international flight to Japan or 
Australia or Europe. However, with NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) 
it is quite possible we'll see service into Mexico or Canada. . . . When we say 
we'll never be international, we'll never be transoceanic." 
</P>
<P>
 A critical question in the debate over the airport's future is how to define 
the role of the Airport Authority, the nine-member board in charge of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it answerable to the public because the board's commissioners are appointed 
by council members in Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena? Or is it an independent, 
separate legal entity, accountable only for its success in its mission to 
provide state-of-the-art regional airport facilities? Or both? 
</P>
<P>
 Airport commissioners themselves disagree on the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is without question a governmental agency with lots of constituents," said 
board president Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Commissioner Holden, who is also a Pasadena councilman, said: "It's 
quasi-governmental, with a leaning toward business." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of duty to provide information to the community," he said. 
"But it is a business so we need to be mindful that the priorities set for the 
business will help the business flourish." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the terminal expansion suspect that making money is all the 
Airport Authority has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim Robert Garcin, a commissioner and until recently the board 
president, is aloof to their concerns and that the authority's regular monthly 
meetings are purposely held Monday mornings so as to limit the amount of public 
input. 
</P>
<P>
 "The authority acts as though it's running Vatican City. Their policy is to 
plunge ahead," said R.C. "Chappy" Czapiewski an aviation buff who regularly 
attends the meetings. "It's the Garcin attitude of damn the torpedoes, full 
speed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport commission is absolutely determined to have its way, and damn the 
people. What's different now is more people are more aware of what the Airport 
Authority is and how it operates," Czapiewski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, the issue of expansion at the Burbank Airport was a hot 
topic even before the Airport Authority purchased the facility from Lockheed 
Aircraft Co. in 1978, with the help of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, neighbors of the airport accused Burbank city officials of scheming 
to acquire the facility for the sake of expanding its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the City Council passed a resolution prohibiting expansion without 
a strong plan for minimizing increased noise and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to satisfy Burbank residents. The following year, residents in 
Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena voted overwhelmingly to approve the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint powers agreement among those cities creating the Airport Authority 
prohibited runway expansion and required that the airport take steps to 
mitigate noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the new terminal call for nearly twice as many aircraft gates as 
there are now, and almost double the number of flights. But airport officials 
insist that quieter commercial airplanes will be used to take off and land. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the proposal has spilled into Burbank City Council meetings, where 
a question about conflict of interest has swirled around two councilmen who are 
also airport commissioners.

TEEN-AGER REFUSES TO BE A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 After she was molested at age 10, Desiray Bartak went from a bubbly youngster 
with a smile for everyone to an introverted girl who dressed in black and cried 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a little help, Desiray moved on. She reported the abuse, was 
instrumental in convicting her assailant -- a Palmdale man who was a friend of 
her father -- and in an unprecedented move, successfully sued him for $2 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, she stepped out of her small-town world of neighborhood friends 
into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 While victims usually avoid publicity, Desiray, now 14, has lectured on her 
experience and discussed her life in press conferences and on national 
television. In December, she will receive an award from the Caring Institute, a 
national organization that honors people who work for change, in a ceremony at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my idea to go public. I wanted kids to know that they have rights 
too," Desiray said. "They can hire an attorney, get (their molester) prosecuted 
and put him in prison so the abuse can stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want kids to know that you don't have to be ashamed, you don't have to hide 
and that you can tell your secret," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of her mother, Wayanne Kruger, she founded her own organization 
last March called CARAM, or Children Against Rape and Molestation, which 
publishes By Kids For Kids, a bimonthly newsletter offering tips about dealing 
with the consequences of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that abused children need help and the only way they can get it now is 
through the police and their parents," Desiray said in a recent interview. "But 
a lot of them don't go to them. They only want to talk to their peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists said Desiray's course of conduct has been unique.  
</P>
<P>
 "The normal reaction is to hold the abuse in and either not remember it or not 
think about it," said Dr. Arlene Aviera, a Beverly Hills psychologist who has 
worked with victims of child molestation for 12 years. "Usually a person 
doesn't have the strength to take the action she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, said Aviera, victims of molestation find it difficult to build 
self-esteem or take control of their lives after being abused. This can result 
in physical and emotional problems in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson Desiray has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was forced to grow up when I was thrown into that adult situation," she 
said. "The worst point was when I wanted to kill myself. I was 10." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Desiray reacted the way most victims do -- she told no one. She was 
hospitalized for several months for severe depression.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is one of the biggest parts a person has to learn -- to take care of 
yourself. To somehow protect yourself," said Desiray. "Victims can take control 
of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Aviera said Desiray's ability to overcome is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never known someone who has gone public to the media," Aviera said. 
"There are effects of the attention the media adds, but it could be beneficial 
for her." 
</P>
<P>
 It is common for child victims to try to overcome the abuse by maturing 
quickly, Aviera said. Often young female victims feel different than their 
peers because of the abuse and try to present themselves in a more mature 
manner.  
</P>
<P>
 "Girls will look much older and take on adult traits," Aviera said. "Some do 
it with self-confidence, other times it is not a very good sign and we see that 
frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 These changes are present in Desiray.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see a kid who went from caring about basketball and football games to a 
14-year-old who cares about getting into college and helping other kids," 
Kruger said. "Before she was a natural child, now she is determined." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger has noticed that her daughter chooses friends a few years older than 
her or who are victims of some type of abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard for her to be able to socialize with children her own age," said 
Kruger. "On a mentality rate, kids who haven't gone through abuse themselves 
are very immature to her and she gets frustrated with them." 
</P>
<P>
 That precociousness almost destroyed her family. Kruger said her husband, 
Brian Marschner, 34, could not deal with Desiray's molestation and subsequent 
depression and went to stay with family in New York for five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted Desiray to fit into a child category but she can't," Kruger said 
about the separation. "We are back together now and trying to work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray still has some unresolved issues stemming from her molestation. She 
hasn't spoken with her father, who was a friend of her assailant, since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although frank discussion of sexual abuse is becoming common, Aviera said 
there are women who remain secret victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray's example may prove a huge help, Aviera said. "I treat adults who went 
through this as a children and there was no one there for them. They had to 
keep it to themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain degree, she has lost something that can never be regained," 
Aviera said. "But having this kind of information out there and written by an 
abuse victim is very helpful. It gives other kids the strength to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 That process of helping herself through helping others has been particularly 
important for Desiray. The CARAM group, based in the San Francisco Bay Area 
apartment she shares with her mother, stepfather and sister, receives about 
five or six letters a day from sexually abused children around the country. 
Desiray said she personally answers each one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a big part of my healing process," she said.

UNWELCOME VISITOR AT VALLEY'S EDGE; WILDLIFE: MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE BEING SIGHTED 
MORE FREQUENTLY. SOMETIMES-TRAGIC ENCOUNTERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE RENEWING 
DEBATE OVER MANAGING THE POPULATION. 
</P>

<P>
 It's fast and silent and kills its prey by slicing its fangs between the neck 
bones, snapping the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not, as you might think, confined to a distant and inaccessible 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 With increasing frequency, North America's most efficient four-legged killer, 
the mountain lion, is prowling areas that human beings think of as their 
domain: suburban neighborhoods, urban open spaces, sometimes even the shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, two 12-year-old boys came upon a mountain lion in a canyon 
behind their Granada Hills homes. Days later, police officers shot one that 
wandered into a shopping mall in Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
 After years in which the big cats were presumed to have vanished from the 
mountainous fringes of Los Angeles, animal officials are increasingly finding 
signs of a resurgent population throughout the foothills of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, the Santa Susanas and even in the city-locked Santa Monica 
Mountains, where remains of deer killed by lions have been found amid the homes 
of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting more complaints during the past 12 months than I have ever had," 
said Dennis Kroeplin, San Fernando Valley wildlife specialist for the Los 
Angeles Department of Animal Regulation. Kroeplin says he has confirmed 14 
reported sightings in the Valley during that time by either spotting the lion 
himself or identifying the paw prints left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, face-to-face encounters are on the rise too, and that trend 
-- brought into horrifying focus by the fatal attack on a Sacramento jogger in 
April -- has renewed a decades-old debate over man's proper relationship with 
the large predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters and livestock interests attribute the recent spate of attacks on 
humans to a ban on mountain lion hunting that has been in effect in California, 
one way or another, since 1971. They argue that it is time to resume hunting in 
order to reduce the overcrowding, which they blame for forcing the animals into 
areas where they encounter humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the attacks speak for themselves," said Paige Lewis, director of 
communications for the Wildlife Legislative Fund for America, a hunters' 
lobbying group. "The incidents are going to continue to rise until people 
realize there is just not enough habitat to support that wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 But while they acknowledge that lion-human contacts are rising, many 
animal-rights activists and wildlife biologists nonetheless characterize the 
risks as an acceptable price for preserving the wildest of the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the hazards, they advocate programs to teach defensive behavior to 
those who live or vacation in mountain lion country, although they do not 
object to trapping or killing individual animals that threaten people or 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they adamantly draw the line at sport hunting, which is 
usually done with packs of dogs that track and tree the lion, allowing the 
hunter to shoot it at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't think that is a proper use of wildlife heritage in this day and 
age," said Mark Palmer, executive director of the Mountain Lion Foundation, 
which was formed by environmental groups in 1986 to support Prop. 117, the 1990 
state initiative that prohibits mountain lion hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters in effect endorsed a hunting moratorium originally imposed by the 
Legislature in 1971, bringing the public's evolving attitude toward large 
predators full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 To California's early settlers, the mountain lion -- also called cougar, puma, 
panther, painter and catamount -- was just a dangerous varmint. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were competitors for deer and competitors for livestock," said wildlife 
biologist Paul Beier, a mountain lion specialist in Northern Arizona 
University's Forestry Department. "There wasn't a whole lot of thought in it. 
You saw a predator and you shot it." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in this century, California made eradication a policy, offering bounties 
and sending four state hunters into the field to kill mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the persecution remains a matter of conjecture because no 
scientific lion census was done until 1971. One estimate set the California 
population at only 600 in 1920. Beier, though an advocate of protection, now 
doubts that the mountain lion was ever that close to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very durable," he said. "If there's a few of them out there in the 
wilderness, they'll find each other and have cubs." 
</P>
<P>
 It's undisputed that the mountain lion has rebounded since state hunting was 
discontinued in 1959 and the bounty system dropped in 1963. From an estimate of 
2,100 in the state Fish and Game Department's first formal count in 1971, 
mountain lions now number as many as 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 California's experience is part of a mountain lion comeback across the western 
United States and Canada. Once ranging all over North America below the Arctic 
Circle, the largest of the purring cats -- as opposed to the larger roaring 
cats of Asia and Africa, like lions and tigers -- was squeezed into the states 
west of the Rockies by encroaching settlers in the 19th Century and their 
numbers so reduced that they were rarely spotted by people, even in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, some researchers have said there may be more mountain lions on 
the loose in the western states than there were in frontier days. 
</P>
<P>
 While the population boom is still being researched by wildlife biologists, 
the causes of the recent increase in conflicts between mountain lions and 
humans is fiercely debated by conservationists and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-welfare activists focus on the continued spread of suburban development 
into previously wild areas and the popularity of hiking and camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ever-expanding encroachment makes it very difficult for an animal to make 
a living out there," said Martine Collette, founder of the Wildlife Waystation 
in Little Tujunga Canyon, an animal refuge where about 30 mountain lions are 
lodged, some of them pets that got too big for their owners and some wild 
animals trapped in cities. "They're being pressured, so they've opted to live 
right next door to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmen fume at what they see as the emotionalism of that analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When 117 passed, we knew there were going to be problems in the future," said 
Dan Heal, a bow-and-arrow hunter from Chico, Calif., and chairman of the 
California Sportsmen's Task Force. "We forecast right then that if you don't 
manage a population, it's going to overflow its range." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters argue that mountain lion habitat is already taken up by solitary adult 
males who command up to 100 square miles of territory each. Younger males are 
forced to look elsewhere for a home, often ending up on the undesirable fringes 
of the wild lands -- sometimes foraging right into the edge of growing suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A managed hunt, sportsmen say, would clear out territories for the young 
lions, keeping them in the wild and coincidentally generating revenue from 
license fees with which the state could pay for research to further protect the 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 But wildlife biologists contend there is no evidence of a correlation between 
hunting and human safety. California is the only state where no hunting is 
allowed, but other states have just as many lion attacks on humans, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the attacks in California have occurred in regional or state parks 
where you don't allow hunting anyway," said Palmer of the Mountain Lion 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shy by nature and trained from infancy to hunt four-legged creatures, the big 
cats account for fewer injuries to people than lightning. Only seven attacks on 
human beings have been documented in California during this century, state game 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acceleration of the rate of those encounters, and the terror they 
cause, has given the issue new prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven attacks have occurred since 1986, and four involved children. 
A boy and a girl were mauled that year in an Orange County park. A 1992 attack 
in Santa Barbara County and a 1993 attack in San Diego County left two boys 
slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, a woman apparently saved her husband's life in late August by 
slaying a rabid mountain lion with a kitchen knife when it attacked a group of 
campers near San Rios in Mendocino County, biting off her husband's thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 California's first documented mountain lion fatality occurred in April when 
Barbara Schoener, a 40-year-old mother of two, was killed while jogging in a 
wilderness area near Sacramento. Her body was partly eaten by a female mountain 
lion, who was later tracked down and killed. Experts speculated that Schoener 
ran past the hidden cat, stimulating its chase instinct, like a ball of yarn 
rolled in front of a house cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoener's death sparked her hometown legislator, Assemblyman David Knowles 
(R-Cameron Park), to introduce a bill aimed at repealing the 25-year-old ban on 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are saying is the current law is emotional. It doesn't give any 
possibility for scientific evidence to be used," said Kevin Brown, an aide to 
Knowles. "We want to return responsibility for managing the mountain lion 
population to Fish and Game." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill aroused widespread opposition from conservationists, not only because 
they are repelled by hunting but because it would also have abolished a 
land-acquisition fund that has steered millions of dollars into buying wildlife 
habitat, including $50 million worth in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee killed it on a party-line vote, Republicans for and 
Democrats opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuming over the failure of the bill, Heal of the Sportsmen's Task Force 
predicted that "it's just a matter of time before some child is taken and then 
we're going to see the problem finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of these rhetorical salvos are agencies such as the 
Department of Animal Regulation in Los Angeles and the state Fish and Game 
Department, charged with protecting wild animals as well as the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the condemnation of animal-rights activists if they kill a wild animal 
unnecessarily, they are also fearful of being held liable if someone is injured 
in an attack on public land. Some of their officers see it as a no-win dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mountain lion attacked 10-year-old Laura Small in 1986 -- leaving her 
partially paralyzed and blind in one eye -- Orange County lost a $2-million 
lawsuit, judged negligent for failing to post warnings that lions might lurk in 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the county has been unsuccessful in a campaign to pass a law 
shielding local governments from such suits. Trial lawyers and hunters' groups 
have opposed their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fear that wild animals can arouse, standoffs with human beings 
almost always turn out badly for the beast. 
</P>
<P>
 State game officials, who have primary responsibility for removing wild 
animals from populated areas, kill an average of five to 10 mountain lions a 
year, said Terry Mansfield, director of the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is within their authority to capture and remove the animal to a safe 
habitat. Seldom is that an option, however, because the mountain lion 
population has filled its habitat to overflowing, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the only significant management of the mountain lion population is 
accomplished by depredation permits, which authorize property owners to kill 
mountain lions that threaten livestock or pets. The number of lions killed by 
permit has grown steadily from five in 1971 to 74 last year, and will probably 
rise again this year, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the depredation permits are issued in rural counties in the central 
and northern part of California. No lions have been killed under permit in Los 
Angeles, and neither have Los Angeles city officials had occasion to kill a 
lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three lions trapped in urban areas of the San Fernando Valley in the 
past quarter-century, two showed up in the last six years, said Kroeplin, the 
wildlife officer for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those climbed a tree behind a Chatsworth house in 1988 and the other 
was prowling a condominium at Tampa Avenue and Rinaldi Street in 1991. Both 
were released in the mountains, Kroeplin said. 
</P>
<P>
 With lion sightings increasing, Kroeplin fears such good fortune may not last. 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked down a fire road near Aliso Creek in Granada Hills last week, 
where two boys made the Valley's most recent sighting, he observed only the 
tracks of humans, dogs and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the tracks tell him is that unsuspecting people are dallying in the 
domain of a lethal predator. "These people come up here every day," he said. 
"Someday there's going to be a mountain lion going across here." 
</P>
<P>
 His hope is that when the encounter is over, lion and human walk off unhurt, 
each to their own worlds. Prowling Into Trouble Once thought to have 
practically vanished even in the wild, the mountain lion, or cougar, is 
bouncing back, and increasinly running into human beings. In the last 12 
months, officials have confirmed 14 mountain lion sightings in urban areas of 
the San Fernando Valley. * Local Sightings Confirmed by L.A. Department of 
Animal Regulation * Population Statewide estimates for a sampling of years from 
1920-'88. * Depredation Permits Permits issued for confirmed damage to 
property; number of lions taken from 1971-'88. Sources: California Department

LAW BOOKS AND A BADGE -- MORE TOTING BOTH; POLICE: MOTIVES VARY, BUT AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF OFFICERS ARE STUDYING TO BECOME ATTORNEYS. SOME MAKE THE 
SWITCH ONLY TO GO BACK TO THE BEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There are lots of reasons to go back to school. One of Dave Miller's was 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorated Fullerton police officer felt pilloried four years ago as a 
defendant in a lawsuit that blamed police after a suspect crashed during a car 
chase and killed three people. For three weeks, Miller recalled, he seethed as 
the opposing lawyer painted him and fellow officers as reckless "cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury ended up siding with the police, but the event was an epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it hit me," Miller said. "We need people trained in the law to 
convince these people that we're not just a bunch of cowboys." Miller, who grew 
up as "the kid who always wanted to be a cop," decided to go to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he's not the only one toting law books and a badge. Entering his 
third year of night law classes at Western State University, Miller is one of a 
growing number of Orange County police officers who are either training to 
become lawyers or are freshly out of law school. There is no clearinghouse for 
statistics, but at least a dozen officers around the county are in law school 
or recently passed the bar exam. The Irvine Police Department alone boasts 
three cops who are also licensed lawyers -- and two more in training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to branch out and form a law firm," joked Sgt. Jeffrey Love, an 
attorney who supervises the department's internal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops, who traditionally have held a special disdain for lawyers, are now 
becoming them for a variety of reasons. Some police officers view law school as 
a logical extension of their daily work enforcing the law on the streets and, 
as with other advanced degrees, a route to quicker promotions in their 
departments. Others, like Miller, see it as a way to defend fellow cops and 
offer their agencies advice on ever-changing legal issues ranging from police 
searches to personnel matters. For many, moonlighting as a lawyer beats being a 
security guard and offers a second career -- or an escape hatch from police 
work that can be long on peril and short on reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely on the upswing," said corporate attorney Keith Rosenbaum, who 
teaches law classes at Western State and is a reserve police officer in Irvine. 
"It's a function of frustration. A lot of the guys -- and ladies -- out there 
hit a point where there's not a lot of room for advancement in law enforcement. 
. . . You're under a microscope. You're afraid of being sued." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most, though, say they plan to stay on as police officers and use their new 
legal training on the job. Miller, a 13-year veteran who currently heads the 
hiring office, would like to become the house counsel for the Fullerton 
department. Love's bosses plan to send him to court to defend the department 
against legal motions seeking officers' personnel files. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect to have him do that instead of having the city attorney" do it, 
Irvine Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers find themselves dispensing legal advice already. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Andrew Hall, a watch commander in the Westminster Police Department 
waiting to find out if he passed the bar exam, keeps the latest legal journals 
in his desk and said his legal training has helped in making personnel 
decisions. As he spoke, Hall took a phone call from a woman confused about how 
to comply with a court order barring her from going near a neighbor. He 
explained the order and offered some calm advice. Hall has gotten used to it -- 
colleagues now routinely refer such questions to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police trainees in Lt. Michael Stedman's classes learn about the 
constitutional underpinnings beneath the how-to's of search and seizure and 
defendants' Miranda rights. Stedman, who passed the bar exam last year and also 
works part time for a Long Beach firm, said he wrote a department training 
bulletin on handling spousal abuse calls after reading about an appellate court 
decision revising the standard for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most police queries about such issues are answered by the district attorney's 
office, but that's not always possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DA's office isn't there at 3 in the morning," said Jeff Noble, a senior 
officer in Irvine who passed the bar exam in February. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though police officers may have a working familiarity with lawyers and the 
law, there's no guarantee they'll succeed in law school -- especially while 
holding down a full-time job with irregular hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana lawyer Bruce D. Praet, a former officer noted for his high-profile 
defense of police agencies, said he gets calls every year from cops considering 
law school. "I saw a lot of people who found out it's a lot more difficult than 
they anticipated and dropped out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cops find it hard to overcome their police training and their regimented, 
crime-fighting approach in the face of muddy legal issues, said Rosenbaum, who 
teaches corporation law and taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a cop, you're taught there aren't gray areas -- it's black and white," 
said Rosenbaum. "The best piece of advice is, put away your conservative 
leanings . . . and open your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers tell law school classmates about their day jobs but say they avoid 
representing the police viewpoint when studying criminal cases. Hall said he 
once held his tongue as the professor railed against tactics used by vice 
police. But he and others said law classes have made them more sympathetic to 
civil liberties concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Most look beyond criminal law, although some graduates have gone on to work as 
prosecutors. Huntington Beach Police Detective Richard Butcher trains officers 
on legal issues at the Criminal Justice Training Center at Golden West College, 
but also makes house calls to write three to four sets of wills per week. Noble 
said he'd like to specialize in labor law and estate planning when he hangs his 
shingle, part time, next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of police work, some officers find the paperwork drudgery of 
lawyering unsatisfying. Huntington Beach Detective Arthur Droz retired in 1990 
to practice law, but nine months later returned to the force -- as a beat cop 
minus his seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was very little of anything that was fun. I found very few people that 
enjoyed it, with the exception of attorneys in public service," said Droz, who 
still practices law part time. "I think I can make more of a contribution (as a 
police officer) than I did as an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in a field where it's possible to retire at age 50 or burn out long 
before that, even young cops think hard about life after the badge. Former 
Irvine cop Victor Quiros, 32, left the force to go to law school in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to see myself in a patrol car when I was 40 years old doing 
shift work," said Quiros, who passed the bar exam last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Quiros, who just opened a practice in Orange, hopes to apply his inside 
knowledge of police procedures on matters such as searches and drunk driving. 
He's now on the other side, defending the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you would have asked me when I finished my five years of patrol if I would 
do criminal defense, I would have said probably not. But in law school you 
learn to look at both sides of an issue," he said. "I could work either side." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of flexibility is hard for other cops to swallow. Some view lawyers, 
especially those representing criminal defendants, with a contempt that makes 
the idea of law school unfathomable -- or at least fodder for ribbing. "Got too 
many scruples," huffed one police supervisor, who is decidedly not considering 
a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Sgt. Michael Hyams, a law student with a doctorate in 
psychology, gets needled from three directions. Police officers "hate lawyers 
and psychologists. And everyone else hates cops," he said. "Thank God I've got 
a wife and kids who like me."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA FULLERTON; AREA YOUTHS SALUTE LIFE'S 
POSSIBILITIES

 About 15 children recently chanted " Si se puede! " meaning "Yes, it can be 
done!" during a picnic at Ralph B. Clark Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Their meaningful words brought attention to the way they feel about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do anything you want to do in your life," said Luis Torrez, 10. "I 
want to be a lawyer because I want to help people, and I know if I try I can do 
it, even if I don't have a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis, his sister and mother joined about 300 other children and parents from 
some of the poorest neighborhoods in La Habra for a day at the park in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual event, sponsored by the county's Community Service Programs 
Inc., was aimed at giving families a day to spend together outside their city 
as an end of summer "mini-vacation trip," said Max Madrid, a CSP director. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the families cannot afford to travel during their children's summer 
vacation and said they were grateful for being invited to participate in the 
free event. 
</P>
<P>
 They were provided bus transportation from Las Lomas Elementary School to the 
park and back. Hot dogs and hamburgers were donated by Food 4 Less for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The children spent the day playing soccer and other games, dancing and 
listening to poetry readings by the Chicano Poet Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl Scouts representatives also provided parents with information about the 
organization and police showed up to talk to the park-goers about DARE, or Drug 
Awareness Resistance Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've come to the park this summer," said Carolina 
Rodriguez, who watched her five children and seven nieces and nephews play a 
parachute game and break a pinata. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good trip because going to the park is hard when you don't have a 
car. It's good for the kids to get out and play in a safe environment too." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Magana, 9, agreed. "It's fun and I don't have to be at home, bored," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madrid said the event was created when students at Las Lomas said they had not 
gone anywhere outside La Habra during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets them out and brings the community together," he said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; PROPOSED BUDGET SET FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will conduct a public hearing today on the proposed municipal 
budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes nearly $25 million in general-fund expenses and more than $11.5 
million set aside for capital improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider granting final approval to a law that would 
prohibit people from sleeping in parked vehicles between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law, modeled after one enacted by the city of Irvine, was 
approved 5 to 0 at its first reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Potts introduced the measure after hearing complaints about a 
man who had been sleeping for several nights in a disabled car that had been 
towed to a residential cul de sac. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY OFFICIALS HONOR DEPARTING EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley was toasted last week as the man who 
kept the city going during difficult times this year, including a divisive 
recall election in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You worry about the recall, I'll worry about the city,' " said 
Mayor Charles V. Smith at a reception honoring Huntley. "He has done that very 
effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley, 70, is leaving the city next month after serving as acting manager 
since March. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the post following the retirement of former city manager Jerry Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 A new city manager, Bill Smith, has been hired and will begin work today. 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster resident for the past 27 years, Huntley was also city manager 
from 1967 to 1977. He was acting city manager from 1987 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this city, and I'm concerned about what happens to this community," 
said Huntley, who also is a director of the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining neutral during the failed recall drive against Smith and three other 
members of the City Council was difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort, led by the Westminster Firefighters Assn., stemmed from the 
council's decision last year to lay off five firefighters and put a firetruck 
out of service as part of a reorganization of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters contended the cuts jeopardized public safety, but city officials 
insisted that the reorganization was intended to control the department's 
increasing overtime expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of payroll practices at the Fire Department resulted in allegations 
of widespread abuses, and more than 20 employees were either fired, suspended 
or reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Huntley upheld the firing of two battalion chiefs and a captain 
but reinstated another captain and a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases of the former employees are going to an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to handling the controversial firefighters issue, Huntley was 
credited with forging contracts with the police officers union and the 
municipal employees union, adopting the city's 1994-95 budget, reorganizing 
city departments and hiring a new city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult and interesting," said Huntley of the past six months that 
he was acting city manager. "Hopefully, I was effective. Otherwise, it was just 
business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley said that he plans to vacation in Australia with his wife, Pat, 
sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to remain with the county water district board and as a consultant 
with a special district in San Bernardino County. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; POLICE, FIRE SERVICE WOULD BE PRESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police, fire and maintenance services would be preserved at their current 
levels under a proposed operating budget being presented to the City Council 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for the new fiscal year was balanced by cutting $2 million out of 
the $27.2-million general fund through a series of restructuring moves at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 This restructuring included letting contracts for certain services, using 
volunteers to help at the Police and Fire Departments and using technology to 
enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city departments have been reorganized to eliminate 32 vacant or 
soon-to-be-vacant positions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest said Brea has faced "a severe budget challenge" over 
the past three years due to tax revenue losses related to the recession, and 
cuts of $6.3 million in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 These losses meant that a significant overhaul of city operations was 
necessary, rather than mere "belt-tightening" measures, Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager cautioned that the proposed budget assumes that Southern 
California's economy "continues its slow recovery and the state does not take 
away additional revenue to balance its budget." 
</P>
<P>
 If the economy sours or the state slashes funding to cities after the November 
elections, Brea may have to start laying off employees, Benest said, which 
could mean service reductions in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other items coming before the City Council today is a proposed law 
that would make it illegal for pedestrians to occupy center medians, except 
when they are in the process of crossing streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law is in response to safety hazards that have been created 
because of a "proliferation of vendors and panhandlers" on center medians in 
the city, Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the law would impose a $100 fine for first-time 
offenders, a $200 fine for the second violation within a year and a $500 fine 
for the third and any subsequent violations.ALAN EYERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four of the five candidates in the La Habra City Council race and three of the 
25 candidates in the Fullerton election will discuss why they are running for 
office and answer questions from the audience Wednesday at the Kling Center in 
La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Habra candidates scheduled to be present are Rose Espinoza, Kent 
Roberts, Dorothy Rush and Paul Thornburg. 
</P>
<P>
 From Fullerton, the candidates expected to attend are Jack Dean, Conrad 
DeWitte and Jacob Spaargaren. 
</P>
<P>
 Zona Neighbors, a La Habra resident organizing the event, which is sponsored 
by United We Stand America, said only a few candidates were invited because the 
Kling Center is too small to accommodate all candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate, La Habra Mayor David M. Cheverton, was not invited because "he 
already gets a lot of public exposure," Neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good exposure for the people who don't get exposure," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to the forum at the center, which is at 12900 Bluefield 
in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said another forum will be held before the October special election 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 All candidates who were not invited to the September forum will be invited to 
speak at the next one, Neighbors said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY CONSIDERS BOOST IN PARKING FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parking illegally may soon be more expensive under a city proposal to raise 
fines. The City Council today is scheduled to consider increasing fines for 
most parking tickets from $27 to $32. 
</P>
<P>
 But illegally parking in a handicapped zone would be the most expensive. The 
city's proposal is to increase the fine from $102 to $275. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sullivan, the city's chief of police services, said the proposed 
increases would make San Juan Capistrano comparable to other South Orange 
County cities. "All we are trying to do is get to a level that is consistent 
with surrounding cities," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the city's police services issued 3,692 parking citations for such 
things as expired parking meters, parking in no parking zones, or parking on 
the street for more than 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increases are expected to bring an annual revenue boost of about 
$18,000, if the same amount of citations are issued again this year, Sullivan 
said.JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HEARING TONIGHT ON CITY BUDGET PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing on the 1994-95 proposed budget will be held at tonight's City 
Council meeting. The council will consider adding a library card fee for 
non-residents and increasing parking fines to raise additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, postponed a day because of Labor Day, begins at 6:30 p.m. in the 
City Council Chambers, 2000 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 The library card fee would cost non-residents $20 a year to check out 
materials only and would raise about $200,000 in revenue for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg is recommending that all parking citations -- 
except disabled parking violations -- be hiked by $10. The proposed increase 
could raise about $390,000 in new revenue. Parking fines for street sweeping, 
parking meter and red curb parking violations are also proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The total city budget proposed is $190.4 million, which includes all funds for 
1994-95. Part of that total budget includes a proposed general-fund budget of 
$94.23 million, a reduction of nearly $2.5 million over the current 1993-94 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance the budget, a total of 28 full-time positions and 29 part-time 
positions are expected to be slashed and cutbacks are probable in all city 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the full-time positions planned to be cut, three are police management 
positions and one is a police secretary position, which will not be filled 
after retirements. A total of seven positions, including six firefighters, are 
also scheduled to be eliminated from the Fire Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A second public hearing on the budget is scheduled Sept. 19. The council could 
adopt a new budget at that second public hearing, but they have until Sept. 
30.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; DRIVE-IN SITE SET FOR HOMES PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has approved a conceptual plan for Greystone developers to build a 
new gated community of 224 homes and condominiums in an area that once was home 
to the Drive-In Theatre on Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had been working with another developer about two years ago, but that 
company failed to close a deal, Development Services Director Thomas Lynch 
said.The Greystone developers presented their plans to the city earlier this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-acre development will have 114 single-family homes and 110 detached 
condominiums. Residents will have a one-acre park and a swimming pool. The city 
would require a 2.2-acre park, but large lawns and walkways will provide six 
acres of open space, said Rick Warsinski, the assistant director of development 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like this project is exactly what we wanted through the General 
Plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Donna L. Chessen said she liked the development but was concerned 
about one swimming pool serving hundreds of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Webb, Greystone's division president, said the 25-foot rear yards allows 
ample space for private pools and many would probably be built by individual 
homeowners. The price of condos will begin in the lower $200,000 range and 
private homes will be closer to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone also said he approved of the project but was concerned 
about the lack of parking on the private streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should go to a public hearing within a month or two, Warsinski 
said.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SCHOOL BOARD OKS DEFICIT SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A revised budget for the Huntington Beach Union High School District foresees 
about $300,000 more in deficit spending than the original budget, passed in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The original budget predicted a $1.3-million deficit.The revised document, 
approved on a 4-1 vote by the school board last week, now forecasts about $1.6 
million in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Dirk Voss cast the only dissenting vote. He did not 
explain his vote during the meeting, but in an interview, he later said he 
opposes the proposed deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also don't think (the budget) offered us any options, such as privatizing 
of services," Voss said. "I think money could have been saved, but we weren't 
offered any options." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised fiscal 1994-95 budget for the school system projects revenue of 
$76.4 million and expenditures of $78 million. Money to cover the deficit will 
come from the district's $6-million reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Patricia Koch said the increase in the predicted deficit is 
because of onetime expenses that include the upgrading of the district's 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no debate or public discussion by the school board on the revised 
budget. Also, no one in the audience spoke during the public hearing on the 
revised budget. Board members voted immediately after Koch's brief remarks 
about the new document. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district governs all public high schools in Huntington Beach, 
Fountain Valley and Westminster. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SURFING LEGEND'S DESIGNS ON EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They called him the Phantom Surfer, the Mad Scientist or simply the Legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Simmons was a surfboard shaper extraordinaire. He used balsa wood, foam 
and fiberglass to make lighter boards, helping bring the demise of the heavy 
planks of the 1930s and '40s, said Ann Beasley, director of the International 
Surfing Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine boards designed by Simmons, who died surfing in 1954, are on exhibit at 
the Huntington Beach museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest Simmons exhibit ever put together under one roof," Beasley 
said. "The boards tell the story of how he progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first shaper who had a college degree and it was in the 
aerodynamics field. He used the same theory for the air and applied it to 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was known as a pioneer in the 1940s and early '50s. He shaped fins, 
called "skegs," from the same piece of board, creating what is known as the 
concave twin fin surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Beasley said he always went to the beach with different surfboards. "When 
Simmons came, everybody swarmed around him to see what he'd done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simmons-styled boards have either been donated to the museum or are on 
loan, Beasley said. His work will be exhibited through December. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's next exhibit, "Women in Surfing," is scheduled to open in 
mid-October, and will feature women from the early 1960s who were in the 
forefront of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will pay tribute to such notables as Linda Benson, who won 21 
first place awards and numerous tandem contests; Marge and Candy Calhoun, a 
mother and daughter surfing team, and Joyce Hoffman, the first woman to be 
inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame, at Main Street and Pacific Coast 
Highway. In 1966, at age 19, Hoffman was voted best female surfer in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Others will include Rell Sunn, a surfer from Hawaii, and Jericho Poppler, an 
avid surfer involved in surfing organizations, including the local Surfrider 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is at 411 Olive St. Hours are noon to 5 p.m. daily. Beginning Oct. 
1, the museum is closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission is $2 for adults, and 
$1 for students. For more information, call (714) 960-3483. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY TO VOTE ON FEE FOR 15 WASTE HAULERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will decide tonight whether to charge the city's 15 
solid-waste haulers a $1-per-ton fee to offset Costa Mesa's administrative 
costs associated with diverting its waste to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The state mandate, in place since 1989, required cities to come up with their 
own recycling programs, which cost the city $125,000 to implement for the 
1993-94 fiscal year, according to a fiscal impact report provided by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items on the agenda for the council's 6:30 p.m. meeting include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorizing the city manager to renew a three-year contract with Paul 
Miller, who has been working since May, 1991, as a housing rehabilitation 
consultant for the city in the Neighborhood Improvements Program. City Manager 
Allan L. Roeder said Miller has received numerous letters of appreciation from 
satisfied homeowners and completed 155 grants in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * A second reading to adopt an ordinance and amendment that would allow Metro 
Pointe Development to build a 400,000-square-foot, open-air shopping center 
that would be called South Coast Boardwalk. The $60-million project would be 
completed by November, 1995. The original agreement called for the construction 
of two, 15-story office buildings, but developers changed the project, saying 
the office building market was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 * Awarding a gasoline fuel contract to Southern Counties Oil Co. of Orange and 
a diesel fuel contract to General Petroleum of Long Beach, both of which are 
not to exceed $290,000 a year. Part of the fuel would be used to fill the 
city's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adopting a resolution authorizing certain city officials to file an 
application with the California Office of Emergency Services to obtain federal 
disaster assistance. Adopting the resolution is necessary if the city wants to 
be reimbursed for the money it spent in sending its helicopter and fire 
officials to Laguna Beach last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Considering a plan to remove asbestos and demolish the Paularino Park 
restroom and recreation building at a cost of $16,350. 
</P>
<P>
 * Considering a $12,000 agreement to allow an environmental company to draft a 
hazardous-waste management plan for the city.TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; HOLOCAUST STUDIES GROUP TO BE FORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Prystrowsky, an Irvine Valley College English professor, is forming a 
Holocaust studies group on campus, a small step toward his larger ambition of 
creating Orange County's first Holocaust center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a climate of rising concern over hate crimes, Prystrowsky, 38, said county 
residents must confront the historical consequences of unchecked racism in 
order to sow the seeds of tolerance in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Holocaust is not over," says Prystrowsky, who records the testimony of 
Holocaust survivors for the Orange County chapter of the Anti-Defamation 
League. The taped recordings are stored at UC Irvine. "It didn't take long for 
the survivors to realize that the same world that had built Auschwitz is the 
same world to which they had returned." 
</P>
<P>
 Prystrowsky is working with Holocaust survivor Mel Mermelstein to build 
interest in creating a county center for Holocaust studies and exhibits. 
Mermelstein, 67, founder of the Auschwitz Study Foundation, has constructed his 
own small-scale Holocaust museum on the grounds of his 32-year-old Huntington 
Beach pallet-making business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mermelstein was 17 years old in May, 1944, when he was sent to Auschwitz, the 
largest of the World War II concentration camps. He was freed from the 
Buchenwald camp in April, 1945. His parents, two sisters and one brother did 
not survive the Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Mermelstein said he believes the lessons of the Holocaust must be taught to 
new generations and retaught to those who have grown indifferent about human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not learned how to live together -- how to respect one another," 
Mermelstein says. "Can you imagine, after Auschwitz, hearing the term 'ethnic 
cleansing'? What are they referring to? The killing of babies, of men, women 
and children. This is inconceivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mermelstein was the subject of the 1991 made-for-television movie, "Never 
Forget," which chronicled his legal battles with revisionist groups that 
contend the Holocaust never happened. With such groups still active in Orange 
County, Prystrowsky believes the need for a county-based Holocaust center is 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous interest in this," says Prystrowsky, who includes 
Holocaust studies in his history and writing classes and conducts a seminar on 
the Holocaust at Irvine Valley College each spring. "Look at the numbers of 
people who went to see 'Schindler's List.' They brought that interest to the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Posted on the wall of Prystrowsky's tiny campus office is a quote from 
philosopher Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel that underscores his passion for the 
creation of a Holocaust center in Orange County: "Six million were wiped off 
the face of the earth. And there is the danger that they will also be 
annihilated from our memories. Are they doomed to a twofold annihilation?" 
</P>
<P>
 During interviews he conducted with those who, like Oskar Schindler, risked 
their lives to help Jews survive during World War II, Prystrowsky says he has 
discovered the key human ingredient that motivated their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's compassion," Prystrowsky says. "These individuals had such a high degree 
of compassion that they were able to transcend the law of self-preservation. 
The designers of the plan to eradicate the Jews were extremely well-educated 
people. What they lacked was compassion."RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEENS FIGHT SHYNESS TO TALK ABOUT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public speaking can become an embarrassing experience, especially when the 
topic is a sensitive one such as sex. But Orange County high school students 
are taking that risk to help their classmates avoid the deadly risk of 
contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 10,000 students have heard peer presentations through the 
Youth HIV/AIDS Volunteer Educators (Y-HAVE) program conducted by the Orange 
County Chapter of the American Red Cross. This multicultural program began in 
late 1992 and was recently expanded with a grant from the Magic Johnson 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new goal is to train at least two student educators at each of 38 local 
high schools during this academic year, and reach an additional 38 schools by 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the certified instructors is Howard Shen, a Corona del Mar High School 
graduate who is starting his first semester at Orange Coast College. The 
17-year-old Newport Beach resident admits he was "very nervous" during his 
first presentation last fall, but that didn't stop him from going on to give 
more than 50 talks so far. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students have tried to embarrass him, he said at a Y-HAVE training 
session in Santa Ana last week. But the teen-agers quickly become attentive 
listeners when they understand the seriousness of the human immunodeficiency 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Shen's most powerful presentations occur when he brings in a 
healthy-looking former football player who contracted HIV through heterosexual 
sex. "A lot of girls think he's cute" and tend to sit near him in the 
classroom, Shen said. Their admiration soon turns to shock, however, when the 
young man candidly tells his story of living with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Shen prefers to address groups of about 20 students, rather than impersonal 
general assemblies. With smaller gatherings, he is able to make the 
presentations entertaining and informative by playing games such as "Red Light, 
Yellow Light, Green Light." 
</P>
<P>
 In this game, students categorize various behaviors as highly dangerous, 
somewhat risky or safe. These behaviors range from engaging in unprotected sex 
and sharing needles to hugging and French kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the youngest peer educators is Miki Noguchi, a 14-year-old freshman at 
University High School. The Irvine resident began making presentations as an 
eighth-grader, sometimes to intimidating audiences of high school juniors and 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to reaching the students, she said, is "to be at their level" and to 
control her nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hellriegel, recently hired by the Red Cross to manage Y-HAVE, said the 
program works because advice from a peer is often more meaningful than a 
lecture from an authority figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that students listen to students," said Hellriegel, a former U.S. 
history teacher. And this peer-to-peer communication can play a vital role, he 
said, in dispelling common myths about HIV/AIDS.ALAN EYERLY

SAFETY IN THE DOMAIN OF THE MOUNTAIN LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Fish and Game recommends the following steps for 
anyone entering mountain lion country or coming into contact with a lion: 
</P>
<P>
 Do not hike alone. Groups are safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep children close to adults and always within sight. Observations of 
captured lions suggest they are drawn to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not approach a lion. Most will try to avoid a confrontation. Give them a 
route of escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not run away. Running may stimulate a lion's instinct to chase. Instead, 
stand and face the animal. Make eye contact. If you have small children, pick 
them up so they won't panic and run. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not crouch or bend over. A person squatting or bending may look more like 
four-legged prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Do all you can to appear larger. Raise your arms. Open your jacket if you are 
wearing one. Throw stones, branches or whatever you can reach without crouching 
or turning your back. Wave your arms slowly and speak firmly in a loud voice. 
The idea is to convince the animal that you are not prey and may be a danger to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fight back if attacked. A hiker in Southern California used a rock to fend off 
a mountain lion that was attacking his son. Others have fought back 
successfully with sticks, caps, jackets, garden tools and their bare hands. Try 
to remain standing and prevent the lion from getting behind you, where it could 
reach the back of your neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game asks anyone involved in a face-to-face 
encounter to make a report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-area office is at 330 Golden Shore, Suite 50, Long Beach, 
90802. The phone is (209) 222-3761. Hours are Mondays through Fridays, 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. After hours, call the nearest sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, reports can also be made to the Los Angeles 
Department of Animal Regulation's West Valley Animal Care and Control Center at 
20655 Plummer St. The phone is (818) 882-8800. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of areas where mountain lions range can get information on 
"wildproofing" their property in a pamphlet published by the Wildlife 
Waystation, 14831 Little Tujunga Canyon Road, Angeles National Forest, Calif. 
91342. The phone is (818) 899-5201.

FOR SHERMAN OAKS GROUP, REDEVELOPMENT MEANS REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake struck Sherman Oaks with a vengeance, leaving lingering 
effects. Blocks of quake-damaged condos and apartment buildings were abandoned, 
creating "ghost towns" plagued with arson fires, looting and vermin 
infestation. One way to attract needed funds for rebuilding is to create a 
redevelopment zone. The money would come from the property tax increment, or 
the increase in property taxes expected to result from revitalizing the area. 
Normally when a redevelopment area is created, a citizens advisory committee 
with special powers is formed that makes recommendations to the city Community 
Redevelopment Agency about the nature and priority of the activities in the 
project area. Richard A. Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., 
spoke with special correspondent Kay Hwangbo about the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you think of the Community Redevelopment Agency's proposal 
to create a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think the idea is good. The question is, can it be implemented in a 
manner that best serves the needs of the community, rather than the needs of 
the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA's goal is to increase the tax base. Generally, that means building 
large commercial developments. What we need in Sherman Oaks is not large 
commercial development. We need to get rid of the "ghost towns" that exist in 
our community. We need a way to help owners of apartment buildings, of 
condominiums, to be able to obtain financing to rebuild their buildings. This 
will generate the population base to help the businesses on Ventura Boulevard 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your main concern about the idea?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The main concern that we have is to make sure that the decisions as to how 
the CRA monies are to be used should be made by a community-based committee 
established by the City Council, and not made by the CRA commissioners in 
downtown Los Angeles. Their goals are generally substantially different from 
our goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The CRA just last week came out with a draft plan for redeveloping Sherman 
Oaks. What do you think of it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Plans that are being reviewed by the various communities are too general. 
They don't say anything. They give the CRA total power without giving the 
community any insight into how the CRA intends to use this money. They're very 
generic plans that really don't relate to Sherman Oaks or Northridge or Reseda. 
What we're hoping is that, in the next 30 to 60 days of review by the public, 
these plans will be made very specific as to each community, so that each 
community knows how the money is going to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan provides for the establishment of a community advisory committee 
appointed by the councilman. It's a good idea, but it doesn't go far enough. 
This committee will have no power except to indicate what it wants. The CRA can 
completely disregard those goals and the City Council can completely disregard 
those goals. The CRA is interested in one thing, which is to build large 
commercial developments in order to increase the amount of tax increment 
funding for the CRA. That's not our goal. Our goal is not to make the CRA rich, 
our goal is to rebuild the residential areas of Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of community input must the CRA get before deciding on a plan for 
the redevelopment area?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally, there is a lot of public input involving the CRA's projects. 
However, the general rules do not apply to a natural disaster redevelopment 
area. In those cases, there is very little community input, there's very little 
evaluation of the project because of the so-called emergency nature of the 
project. That is the problem. The redevelopment area is proposed to be put 
together in about a 60-day period. For most communities, before a project area 
is established and a plan is established, it is a two-year process. 
</P>
<P>
 What we want is the community to have a say in the next 20 to 30 years that 
this CRA project will be around. And the way to do that is to have a citizens 
advisory committee established, and that citizens advisory committee would have 
veto power over projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you think the committee should have veto power?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Without veto power, there is no way that we can make sure that the CRA does 
not use that money to build large commercial developments like they've done in 
Hollywood and North Hollywood and Bunker Hill. The CRA, in general, has not 
used the tax increment money for financing residential rebuilding. They've used 
it to help blighted areas to attract commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, we have a very unique situation in Sherman Oaks. Starting on Dec. 5, 
Councilman Yaroslavsky will become a member of the (Los Angeles County) Board 
of Supervisors and we will not have a councilperson until July of 1995. We are 
concerned that during that time period, various projects will be implemented 
and we will have no council member to speak on our behalf. We're not asking 
that this committee have the power to implement its own projects. We're saying 
the citizens advisory committee should have the power only to say no to 
projects that are inappropriate,especially during the seven-month period when 
we have no council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand that Councilman Yaroslavsky is opposed to the advisory 
committee having veto power. Where does that leave you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're trying to work with the councilman to come up with a solution to the 
problem. One thing we're exploring is to prepare a plan that is so tight it 
doesn't give the CRA the ability to use the funds for any activity the CRA 
wants to use it for. In other words, put the goals and objectives and 
priorities for the tax increment money right in the plan. It's never been done 
that way, but that may be a way of protecting the community and making sure 
that we get the proper use of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel that the redevelopment funds should be used for more than 
rebuilding earthquake damage, that it should be used to improve Sherman Oaks?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, the funding should be used for many purposes. We must rebuild and we 
must attract. We must rebuild the residential area and we must attract more 
capital, more redevelopment of the existing structures. We don't want high-rise 
commercial developments on the boulevard. We want to attract private developers 
to come in, take one- and two-story retail businesses, revitalize them and 
operate very profitable establishments there. The CRA funding is a method to 
get city improvements to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand that some residents are concerned about how Sherman Oaks would 
be perceived if it were to be declared a redevelopment area.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that some people believe that redevelopment areas are only for 
blighted areas. We would prefer to to call it a community recovery area rather 
than a redevelopment area because Sherman Oaks is not blighted like other areas 
of the city that need redevelopment. It's not (like) where they can't attract 
people to locate businesses or build buildings. The attraction is there, it's 
just there is no financing. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to do is use some of that money right at the beginning to get rid 
of some of the buildings that are decaying. No. 2, we have to spruce it up. 
Right now, it's impossible to get city funds to spruce up an area. But 
redevelopment is a method to obtain funds for that purpose. I've said all 
along, since the 18th of January, that the earthquake should leave Sherman Oaks 
in a much better position than it was the day before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people have also said they believe the CRA should not act as a 
planning body in the project area.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is a concern that the CRA will indicate what can be built and what 
cannot be built in Sherman Oaks. They can act as a mini-dictator, saying that 
if you're in the redevelopment area, all plans must be approved by them, in 
addition to the city. The CRA is not a planning body. They do not have the 
expertise to develop projects for an area, especially for an area that is not 
blighted. We don't need another layer of government.  
</P>
<P>
 We want to encourage development and rebuilding, and adding another layer of 
government makes that more difficult. The role of the CRA should be in this 
situation strictly for financing. Financing rebuilding, financing 
infrastructure improvements, period. Planning should be done by the city 
planning commission and ultimately by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If a tightly worded plan is developed, what are the chances that it could 
be modified at a later date by the CRA?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It cannot be modified by the CRA. It can be modified by the City Council. 
So that is a risk that we would have to take in order to get the benefits of a 
redevelopment project. But I would rather trust the City Council than put my 
full faith and confidence in the CRA.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the next step?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The next step for both Sherman Oaks and other areas of the Valley that have 
redevelopment areas under discussion is for the community to attend the 
upcoming community meetings, to get involved in the process, and indicate to 
the city councilman what type of improvements should be made and what type of 
CRA plan should be prepared. Because the way the current plan is prepared, 
there is no protection, it's strictly left to the whim and desire of the CRA in 
downtown Los Angeles.

VAN NUYS DRIVER DIES IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 48-year-old Van Nuys man was killed Monday morning when he apparently fell 
asleep at the wheel of his car and crashed into a building in North Hills, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naser Naderiafshrnejad was killed instantly in the accident on Sepulveda 
Boulevard, according to Officer Phillip Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the man was driving north on Sepulveda near Chase Street at 4:30 
a.m. when the car drifted across the southbound lanes, ran off the road and

COUPLE DIE IN IDAHO TRAIN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A retired Los Angeles police detective from Granada Hills and his wife died 
when their motor home was struck by a freight train in southwestern Idaho, 
authorities and relatives said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romel A. Carnevale, 61, and his wife, Anna, 45, were hit Saturday morning when 
they pulled out of a rest stop on U.S. 95, six miles south of Weiser, Ida., and 
into the path of a freight train carrying hazardous materials, according to 
Idaho state police. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was traveling 66 m.p.h. at the time of impact, police said. However, 
no one on the train was injured and the hazardous material, which police did 
not identify, was contained in the freight cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romel Carnevale, a former detective who spent 32 years with the department, 
was on vacation with his wife at the time of the accident, according to his son 
Steve Carnevale.

NO INJURIES AS PLANE LANDS IN FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pilot and passenger of a small plane on its way to Van Nuys Airport walked 
away unhurt from an emergency landing in a field Monday after the aircraft lost 
power about six miles from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Kenny Eckels guided the single-engine Cessna to a dusty, but safe, 
landing on the plowed field, barely clearing a row of trees that border the Los 
Angeles Times' San Fernando Valley plant on Prairie Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckels, a Sylmar pilot with more than 30 years experience, said he was flying 
his friend Bob Atkinson of Northridge back from a birthday trip to Santa Ynez 
when the plane's engine died at an altitude of about 2,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When he realized the plane would not reach Van Nuys, Eckels said he told 
Atkinson to find an open space where the plane could land. The empty lot on the 
corner of Winnetka Avenue and Prairie Street where they touched down is the 
proposed site of a municipal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plane's gauges showed enough fuel to reach Van Nuys, Eckels said 
he believes the plane he rented in Van Nuys ran out of fuel. "The gauge showed 
a quarter tank when it began to sputter so we were pretty surprised," he said.

AIRPORT OFFICIAL SAYS MERGER WON'T AFFECT STAFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The expected merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta will do nothing to 
change operations at the Burbank Airport, Lockheed and airport officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing that will be different for the Lockheed subsidiary, which 
employs 112 airport workers, is the name of its parent company: Lockheed 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be any effect whatsoever," said Peter Stamison, vice president of 
Lockheed Air Terminal. "We'll just have a bigger, stronger (parent) company." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract that has been in effect since the airport was purchased from 
Lockheed in 1978, Lockheed Air Terminal provides "management, oversight, 
expertise and manpower to fill the operating functions," said airport Executive 
Director Tom Greer. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, controller Dios Marrero and officers with the airport's police 
department are the only staffers not employed by Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank-based company oversees a few other airports across the country.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FATHER-DAUGHTER CONTEST BRINGS FAIR'S RUN TO 
CLOSE; FESTIVAL: APPLAUSE DETERMINES WIN FOR STEVE AND BRITTANY STERK AT 
ANTELOPE VALLEY EVENT. BUT ATTENDANCE FIGURES DISAPPOINT ORGANIZERS.

 She doesn't have her father's brown eyes -- or his beard, thankfully -- and he 
doesn't have her freckles, but otherwise Steve and Brittany Sterk are dead 
ringers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their uncanny resemblance earned the pair with reddish-blond hair a first 
place in the Father/Daughter Look-Alike contest Monday as the Antelope Valley 
Fair and Alfalfa Festival wrapped up its 11-day run. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was a sweet finale for the Sterks, who beat out 15 other fathers 
and daughters, but fair officials were left disappointed by attendance figures 
that were lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's crowd was sparse during the day, but officials expected higher 
turnouts for an evening rodeo and other entertainment. Those who braved the 
day's blazing heat appeared to be having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 In an outdoor auditorium, a crowd of 75 cast their votes in the 
father-daughter contest by applause. The Sterks won hands down. 
</P>
<P>
 In their matching T-shirts from the Palmdale Hills 4-H Club, the Sterks were 
the only team wearing matching clothes. But Steve Sterk said no advance 
planning was involved. He was a leader of the group and 7-year-old Brittany 
entered a winning pygmy goat in a 4-H competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been wearing these shirts every day of the fair," Steve Sterk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Michael Taylor drew "oohs and aahs" as he juggled flaming 
torches and razor-sharp machetes. "Notice that at no time do my fingers leave 
my hands . . . I hope," quipped Taylor, who sports an ear-to-ear handlebar 
mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, attendance at the festival was down from last year: 130,708 paid 
admissions as of Sunday, compared to 137,131 a year ago, fair spokeswoman 
Denise Fisher said. But she said revenue from concessions, rides and other 
attractions increased. Final figures won't be available for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a little strange," she said. "We think there may be a mistake in the 
(attendance) count." 
</P>
<P>
 Total attendance, including fair employees and other free admissions, was 
210,925 as of Sunday, compared to 225,208 a year ago, Fisher added. Fair 
officials had hoped for a turnout of about 300,000, but hot weather and a poor 
economy might have discouraged people from attending, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything went as smoothly as fair planners had hoped. The Cyclone 
Coaster was closed for two days after two accidents caused minor injuries to 
riders. Authorities allowed the coaster to reopen Wednesday night after 
determining a ride operator was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the nightly fireworks show was canceled during the last week of 
the fair after nearby residents reported seeing flaming material land on their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in adverse conditions, the show went on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventriloquist Ken Karter and his puppet parrot Hernando opened their 1 p.m. 
show Monday to an empty set of aluminum benches. Undaunted, Karter fired a 
salvo of risque one-liners at two people in a nearby Air Force booth -- the 
only audience close enough to hear. Their laughter helped attract a larger 
crowd, and Karter was able to proceed with his more traditional show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's funnier when he hasn't got an audience because it's all new stuff," said 
Doug Nelson, who had spent hours at the booth and had heard Karter's routine 
several times.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN FOUND DEAD ATOP PHONE POLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 34-year-old Palmdale man died of unknown causes Monday after he climbed 40 
feet up a telephone pole outside his home and tried to affix a television 
antenna, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name was not released, was found attached by climbing equipment 
to the pole in the 3600 block of 82nd Street East shortly after 3 p.m., said 
Jeff Ziegler of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler said the man was dead when rescue workers reached him. The man, who 
lived across the street, used climbing equipment to make his way up the pole, 
but Ziegler said he was not an employee of a telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it was not an electrocution because there was no electricity at the 
pole," Ziegler said.

'LION' LEADS MOUSE THROUGH 'FORREST'; MOVIES: PARAMOUNT'S 'GUMP' TOPS SUMMER'S 
FINAL WEEKEND, BUT DISNEY IS THE OVERALL WINNER IN A RECORD-BREAKING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While it was Paramount Pictures' "Forrest Gump" that was at the top of the 
Labor Day weekend film box office, it was Walt Disney Studios that claimed the 
title as the overall summer movie season champ. 
</P>
<P>
 Both studios were crowing about the business their films generated, and all 
Hollywood, in general, was upbeat as summer's films took in an all-time 
seasonal record of an estimated $2.2 billion at the box office, up 3% from 
1993's record summer. An estimated 530 million tickets were sold between 
Memorial Day in May and the just-ended Labor Day weekend, beating the 1993 
total of 516 million, according to statistics kept by Exhibitor Relations Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year-to-date, Exhibitor Relations reported that the estimated $3.8 
billion in tickets sold is running 3% ahead of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the summer season, which typically accounts for 40% of a 
year's business, Disney said its $442-million take had established a new 
industry record for summer grosses. The total is largely based on the hit 
animated film "The Lion King," which was the season's biggest hit -- $262 
million so far.  
</P>
<P>
 Disney's distribution chief, Richard Cook, said Monday that the studio's 
year-to-date revenue of $704 million is a new record for any studio. It 
surpassed the level reached by Warner Bros., which in 1993 had accumulated $700 
million in theatrical film grosses by October. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Disney success comes at a time when the studio's film 
production chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg, is preparing to leave his job, having 
struck out in a bid to become the Disney Co.'s second-in-command to chairman 
Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't necessarily the movies, but the sheer volume of them that put 
Disney in the lead," said one veteran Hollywood observer. Under Katzenberg's 
reign, Disney dramatically upped the volume of its releases per year.  
</P>
<P>
 But cynicism aside, other executives at rival studios said the Disney 
achievement reflected the success of the summer as a whole. It was the first 
time the season has produced seven movies that will gross more than $100 
million. And it appears possible that "Forrest Gump," with $238 million grossed 
after nine weekends of release, may briefly surpass the $262 million 
accumulated by "The Lion King," which will end its run Sept. 21. Disney, 
however, plan to reopen the movie in mid-November.  
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, director Robert Zemeckis' "Gump" is Paramount's second highest 
grossing film, having surpassed "Beverly Hills Cop," and it's closing in on the 
studio's biggest film, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," which grossed $242.4 million. 
With its $11.6-million gross over the Labor Day weekend, "Gump," which stars 
Tom Hanks, took first place for the fourth time. The film has never dropped 
below the No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 in the weekend estimates was director Oliver Stone's visually jarring 
"Natural Born Killers," which grossed $10.5 million, only a small drop from its 
opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killers" has grossed nearly $30 million after two weeks. In third place, 
Paramount's"Clear and Present Danger" has $98.4 million and the studio's 
fourth-place "Milk Money" did$6 million in its first weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 In fifth was "The Mask," with $5.5 million and $99.1 million to date. "True 
Lies" was sixth with $4.2 million and $132.5 million overall. "Corrina 
Corrina," was seventh with $3.7 million and a total of $9.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lion King" was eighth with $3.4 million for the weekend. "Fresh" had an 
opening weekend of $3.1 million and "The Client" was 10th with $3 million and 
$82 million after seven weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twist of Fate," a new film starring Steve Martin, opened to a disappointing 
$1.4 million.

TELLURIDE STILL MARCHES TO ITS OWN DRUMMER; THE 21-YEAR-OLD COLORADO FILM 
FESTIVAL OFFERS A FREEWHEELING, ECLECTIC MIX OF THE LOWBROW, THE BIG-BUDGET 
PREMIERES AND TRIBUTES GALORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Telluride Film Festival may have turned 21 this year, but that doesn't 
mean it has any intention of growing up -- if growing up means instilling rigid 
schedules or kowtowing to Hollywood's power elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the festival offered its freewheeling Labor Day weekend mix of 
eclectic foreign and independent films, a handful of well-received, big-budget 
premieres -- including Woody Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway" and Tim Burton's 
"Ed Wood" -- and what is always among the highlights here, special tributes to 
filmmakers past and present. And for the first time, there were several 
programs devoted to the decidedly lowbrow end of filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentarian Ken Burns, something of a local son since many of his works, 
including the highly praised series "The Civil War" debuted here, presented 
part of his forthcoming 18 1/2-hour PBS series, "Baseball," at a tribute to him 
on Saturday night. The delighted audience at the New Sheridan Opera House 
seemed as hungry for a celebration of the game during the players' strike as 
for Burns' accomplished filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The boyish-looking Burns, 41, one of three tributees (the others were 
Australian actress Judy Davis and Swedish actress Harriet Andersson), was 
expansive during his tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my work, including 'The Civil War,' has been infused with the idea of 
family -- of the natural family, the clan, the community and the larger 
national community," Burns said, adding that "Baseball" explores the growth of 
local community and national identity within the scope of the game. "It's 
influenced me in my work for the last 20 years -- though I know I don't look 
it," he said to much laughter. "I grew this beard to look older, but somebody 
said to me today that now I look 18 instead of 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns showed the fifth of "Baseball's" nine parts, or innings, which centers 
on the '30s, including the careers of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and the rise of 
the Negro League, a focus that Burns said he was particularly proud of. One of 
the stars of the Kansas City Monarchs in those years, Buck O'Neil, is a major 
presence throughout all nine parts of the documentary and presented Burns with 
his medal in a touching speech that left the filmmaker genuinely moved by the 
unexpected tribute. Burns was also an organizer of a real baseball game planned 
for Monday afternoon in the town park. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, co-star of Michael Tolkin's forthcoming "The New Age," which was shown 
as part of the Friday program honoring her, was more taciturn. After sitting 
through clips of her most notable films, including "My Brilliant Career," "A 
Passage to India" and "Husbands and Wives," she seemed embarrassed while 
accepting her medal, saying only, "Well, after sitting through that chamber of 
horrors . . . " though she had a lot of kind words for "The New Age." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson, 62, is not as well-known to American film audiences, which is why 
the tribute to her was especially welcome. She starred in many of Ingmar 
Bergman's films in the '50s, and her presence in those movies was one reason 
for the growth of his popularity beyond his native Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, veteran Hitchcock screenwriter John Michael Hayes 
("Rear Window," the 1955 remake of "The Man Who Knew Too Much," "The Trouble 
With Harry"), now in his 70s, reminisced about working with Hitchcock and what 
inspired his sophisticated dialogue. He was to have been joined by Charles 
Bennett, 94, the writer of several early Hitchcock films like "The 39 Steps," 
"Foreign Correspondent" and the original 1934 "Man Who Knew Too Much," but 
ailing health kept him home in Los Angeles, though he joined the seminar by a 
live phone hookup, moderated by a rather bemused Errol Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and Bennett, who have never met in person, chatted warmly about each 
other's work, and both had some salty things to say about Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always thought Alma (Hitchcock's wife) contributed to scripts and so 
on, but in fact, she never did," Bennett said. "I was quite fond of her, but in 
fact, Hitch simply wanted more money, so he put her on the payroll." Hayes, a 
relaxed and entertaining storyteller, told of shaping the Grace Kelly character 
in "Rear Window" by drawing heavily on characteristics of his late wife. At one 
point, in relating a touching story about how he decided to propose a story 
that he altered slightly and used in "Rear Window," his eyes welled with tears 
and he had to pause to regain his composure. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every offering was quite so serious-minded. The biggest scheduling logjam 
happened Saturday night, when filmgoers who weren't scrambling to get into one 
of two screenings of the "Bullets Over Broadway," a period farce about New York 
gangsters, were fighting it out to get into a screening of Ed Wood's cheesy 
"Plan 9 From Outer Space," or a retrospective of the pornographic film 
industry, featuring skin star Nina Hartley. The porn program was so popular, in 
fact, two more showings were added Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another audience-pleaser was the return appearance of the Alloy Orchestra, the 
Cambridge, Mass.-based trio who compose and play original scores to accompany 
vintage silent films. This year's discovery was the 1928 "Lonesome," by Paul 
Fejos, a winsome tale of love between two lost souls in the big city, made all 
the more charming by the hand-painted color sequences of Coney Island and by 
the brilliant cacophony created by the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrities who showed up -- Sydney Pollack, Peter Weller, Wallace Shawn, 
Matt Groening, Andre Gregory and others -- seemed content to mingle with the 
rest of the festival-goers. Other highlights included a restored version of 
Pollack's 1969 "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"; the first new Coyote and Road 
Runner cartoon in 30 years, "Chariots of Fur," which was introduced by its 
creator, veteran Warner Bros. animator Chuck Jones, 81; Cannes favorites like 
"Strawberry and Chocolate" and "Muriel's Wedding"; Louis Malle's "Vanya on 42nd 
Street"; and Ken Loach's bleak "Ladybird, Ladybird."

WILL 'NYPD BLUE' TURN GOLD?; TELEVISION: ADVERTISERS AND AFFILIATES HAVE SHIED 
AWAY FROM THE HIGH-RATED, CONTROVERSIAL SHOW. STEVEN BOCHCO HOPES THE EMMYS 
'MIGHT SEND A MESSAGE TO THEM,' BUT OTHERS SAY THAT WON'T HAPPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite an avalanche of attention, rave reviews and a loyal viewership that 
made "NYPD Blue" the highest-rated new drama of last season, the gritty police 
series has yet to win over some major advertisers and ABC affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Emmy Awards make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue," created by Steven Bochco and David Milch, is up for 26 Emmys this 
weekend -- the most nominations a series has ever gotten for a single season -- 
and the show is bound to come away with at least two: The casting award already 
has been decided in its favor and it has no competition in the category of best 
writing in a drama series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nominations are really an affirmation of the quality of work that we 
did," Milch said. "I wouldn't call it a vindication. A vindication would be 
more advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said that although about 85% of the 
show's commercial time already has been sold for this season, much of it went 
at reduced rates because of the continuing controversy over "NYPD Blue's" 
coarse language and nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that our advertising is up considerably more than a year ago, 
when it was a tough sell," Gretemeyer said. "With our large adult demographic 
-- men and women 18-49 -- we should be able to command higher rates. Our rates 
are higher this year but not where they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about 30 ABC affiliates still refuse to carry the series, which 
stars David Caruso and Dennis Franz as New York police detectives. (Jimmy Smits 
will replace the departing Caruso after four episodes; the series is scheduled 
to return Oct. 11.) 
</P>
<P>
 ABC downplayed the significance of the affiliate dropout, saying that the 
stations were mostly in smaller markets -- Dallas being a notable exception -- 
and that independent stations in many of those cities are showing "NYPD Blue" 
instead. A year ago, there were 57 affiliates that refused to broadcast the 
series premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco said he hopes the Emmys will work some magic for "NYPD Blue" the way 
they did for his "Hill Street Blues" in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Hill Street' was like the lowest-rated show to ever get picked up for a 
second season," he said. "But winning eight Emmys and all the attendant 
publicity really got audience's attention, and they came to check us out. We 
became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 'NYPD Blue' is already a hit, I don't think the impact of winning a lot 
of Emmys will be as significant on that popularity level. But it might have a 
long-term impact on the perception of advertisers and reluctant affiliates. It 
might send a message to them that everything they're afraid of is not that much 
of an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on it, a couple of New York ad executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be able to command the same dollars that it would if it were not 
for this controversy," said Betsy Frank of Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Inc. 
"For those who are concerned about it, the Emmys do not make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Segal, executive vice president of national broadcasting for 
McCann-Erickson Advertising, agreed: "I don't think there is more mainstream 
acceptance in the advertising industry than last season. Good ratings and Emmy 
nominations do not make a difference. I don't think they've gotten any more 
major advertisers than they did last season." 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco said he foresees a day when the controversy will cease and affiliates 
and advertisers will jump on board without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In truth, if it doesn't happen this year, I think by next year it will be a 
non-issue," he said. "It's inevitable and it should happen. I don't want to 
keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the affiliates and advertisers join in or not, both Milch and 
Bochco said they are not about to compromise on the controversial elements on 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we have asked for is to have the power to access certain colors to tell 
our stories when they call for it," said Bochco. "We fought the battle to 
expand the language and sexuality, still mindful that it was network TV." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Milch, he is hoping that the Emmys bring, if not total acceptance from 
advertisers and affiliates, at least a lot of gold for "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll do quite well," he said. "I haven't had time to give it a lot 
of thought -- which is not to say I don't care. I want to win them all."

O.C. ART; WIT, KEEN OBSERVATION ENDURE IN KATE STEINITZ WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Beatrice Wood, then Francoise Gilot, now Kate T. Steinitz -- the Severin 
Wunderman Museum in Irvine has been devoting a generous portion of its 
exhibition schedule to women artists who moved in heady cultural circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Centenarian Wood has been much celebrated in the media and Gilot was 
immortalized in paint by her lover, Pablo Picasso. But Steinitz -- who 
collaborated with Dada artist Kurt Schwitters and became a noted Leonardo da 
Vinci scholar in her old age -- is hardly well known. 
</P>
<P>
 Her retrospective (through Oct. 28) reveals an artist steeped in several 
styles, with a humorous outlook and a predilection for small-scale, throwaway 
works. Her position in the history of modern art was modest -- she was no 
innovator, after all -- but her gentle wit and keen observation remain 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Kate Traumann in 1889 in Beuthen, Germany (now part of Poland), Steinitz 
was exposed early on to Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting by her 
upper middle-class parents. In 1902, the family moved to Berlin, a major art 
center. Among her teachers at the various local academies were the 
Expressionist graphic artist Kathe Kollwitz and proto-Expressionist landscape 
painter Lovis Corinth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she married young -- in 1913, to a doctor -- her husband encouraged 
her work and her associations with local artists. Works from Steinitz's early 
20s show diverse influences and media explorations, from the folkloric 
appearance of a lithograph ("Cowshed") to an Edvard Munch-style charged 
landscape surrounding isolated figures in a painting on glass ("Children on the 
Beach)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Wunderman's research director, William Emboden, a longtime acquaintance of 
Steinitz, rightly points out in the exhibit catalogue that Steinitz tended to 
make use of formal aspects of Post-Impressionism while avoiding its 
metaphysical content. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in her painting "Four Boys" from 1919, she used the intense 
colors and primitivist deformities associated with the "Blaue Reiter" (Blue 
Rider) group but without invoking their mystic view of the universe. There is 
something a bit too sweet and domesticated about the central figures, one of 
whom plays a violin. They seem more like real little boys, seen through a haze 
of maternal emotion, than archetypal images. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband's burgeoning career brought the couple to Hanover, Steinitz 
became a fixture of the local art world. The city hummed with the activities of 
the rambunctious Dada movement which defiantly opposed cliched art of the past. 
As co-organizer of one of the art colony's big social events, Steinitz whipped 
up a last-minute costume that included a blouse run through a printing press: 
an ambulatory typographical design. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hanover, Steinitz collaborated with Schwitters on several projects, 
including children's books. As can be seen in sample pages of "Hahnepeter" 
(Peter the Rooster), Schwitters cut up her perky drawings and sprinkled them 
through the typographically lively text he designed. (Years later, Steinitz 
would see Schwitters' "junk" aesthetic at work in Sam Rodia's Watts Towers in 
Los Angeles, which she helped save from destruction by civic authorities.) 
</P>
<P>
 A passion for the performing arts prompted Steinitz's unconvincing sketches of 
ballerina Anna Pavlova and images of modern dance pioneer Harald Kreutzberg and 
his company, whose angular style of movement better suited Steinitz's 
Expressionistic style. Other subjects caught by her lightly caricaturing brush 
and pencil included cabaret singers, a famous clown and street musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining her family in New York in 1936 to escape Nazi persecution, 
Steinitz continued to find congenial entertainment-world subjects when she 
wasn't pursuing the free-lance commercial art work and research assignments 
that augmented her husband's modest U.S. medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
 At Coney Island amusement park, she observed the collision of bland amusement 
and terror in a fun house ride (grinning faces in "Rip Van Winkle" spit out 
tiny, clinging, faintly drawn couples). In Harlem, still in its jazz age 
heyday, she seemed as intrigued by enthralled patrons as by the stage show 
("Two Women in Harlem"). 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the vibrant sphere of human relations, landscape frequently 
seemed a source of starkness and despair in Steinitz's art. A pair of gnarled, 
bare trees contorted like an Expressionist modern dancer in "New York in 
Winter" conspire to render the scene desolate; ramshackle beach shacks even 
lend "Venice Beach, California" a moody note. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles proved a congenial setting for Steinitz in her 50s, however. 
Widowed and mourning her youngest daughter, who had died of pneumonia, she 
initially moved to San Francisco in 1942. Through Schwitters -- exiled to 
Norway after his work had been shown in the Nazi's notorious "Degenerate Art" 
exhibitions -- she met a physician who not only diagnosed her persistent kidney 
condition but owned an impressive library of Leonardo's writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again her artistic "godfather" had guided her toward a new career, this 
time as a respected scholar specializing in the great Renaissance artist and 
inventor. Working in Los Angeles as Dr. Elmer Belt's personal librarian, 
Steinitz led a richly involved life, running an informal salon for European 
artists and scholars who had fled the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 Her final years (she died in 1965) also were devoted to championing new 
American art and producing an array of drawings, collages and small Dada-like 
"unusable" objects covered in old engravings, which were intended as private 
communiques and gifts for friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of her collages incorporate an archly self-conscious blend of Dada 
and Pop Art that makes one wonder how she would have reacted to Conceptualism, 
still on the artistic horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems fitting that this show is at the Wunderman museum, a repository for 
the work of Jean Cocteau and his circle -- not only because the two artists, 
born in the same year, were acquaintances but also because Steinitz shared 
something of Cocteau's synthetic approach to visual art. Both rummaged around 
the grab bag of contemporary styles to find idioms into which they could slot 
their talents for sharp, quick observations of the passing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kate T. Steinitz: Art Into Life Into Art" continues through Oct. 28 at the 
Severin Wunderman Museum, 3 Mason, Irvine. 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through 
Fridays. Free. (714) 472-1138.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SPECIAL DEVICES POSTS $858,000 QUARTERLY PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paced by brisk sales in automotive products, Special Devices Inc. reported 
that its earnings more than doubled for the quarter that ended July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall-based company, which makes pyrotechnic devices used in the defense 
and automotive industries, reported a profit of $858,000 for the quarter, 
compared to a $376,000 profit in the same quarter a year earlier.Sales in the 
latest quarter were $17.1 million, up 81% from sales of $9.45 million in the 
July quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For its nine-month period, the company reported net income of $2.09 million on 
revenue of $44.7 million, compared to net income of $670,000 on sales of $24.6 
million the year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's automotive products division, which makes devices that activate 
automobile air bag restraint systems, posted sales of $13.6 million in the 
latest quarter, about twice the $6.53 million in sales reported for the same 
three-month period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sales in the company's aerospace division jumped 22% to $3.56 
million from $2.92 million a year earlier.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: OROAMERICA INC. REPORTS PLUNGE IN QUARTERLY PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OroAmerica Inc., a Burbank gold jewelry producer, reported second quarter 
earnings of $119,000 for the three months that ended July 29, down 93% from 
$1.7 million in the same period last year.Revenues for the quarter were $38.9 
million, a 13% increase from $34.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, the company said it earned $769,000, down 77% from $3.32 
million last year. Revenues were $87 million, up 10% from $79 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed its lower results so far this year to increased price 
competition in the industry and the cost of recent expansions of its product 
line and customer service operations.

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: OIL ROYALTIES COULD PROVE 
MIXED BLESSING; RESOURCES: OFFICIALS COULD SEEK TO MAKE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO 
HAVE RECEIVED THE FUNDS HELP PAY FOR CLEANUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most people don't have the good fortune to collect regular checks from their 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are property owners in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County, 
however, who get regular royalty checks for oil and gas wells drilled by 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, for example, about 3,900 property owners are mailed checks by 
Medallion California Properties Co. From a small plot of land on Paxton Street, 
Medallion pumps oil and gas found under nearby homes and businesses. Although 
none of the nearby residents has leased the ground 500 feet below their homes, 
the Pacoima oil field has generated additional income for the locals for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pacoima pumping operation doesn't really affect property values, said 
Ed Koenig, office manager of Park Regency Inc., a real estate brokerage in San 
Fernando. As the oil wells have dried up, the royalty checks have become 
smaller and less frequent, he said. And because the pumping operation is 
camouflaged, it hasn't depreciated nearby property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Checks received by the Pacoima property owners, and others who lease their oil 
and gas rights, vary depending on the size of their property, the amount of oil 
and gas being pumped, the terms of the lease, and the current price of oil. 
Royalties from a typical homeowner can range from a few dollars a month to $100 
or more. In Pacoima, current oil production is at 30 barrels a day -- way down 
from the 1,000 barrel-a-day production in 1986 -- as the wells are beginning to 
run dry. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no new oil or gas wells being drilled in north Los Angeles 
County or Ventura County, there are 1,750 currently pumping wells in Ventura 
County and another 400 in the San Fernando Valley, reported Pat Kinnear, 
district deputy of the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, 
Gas and Geothermal Resources in Ventura. Drilling units, Kinnear explained, are 
the tall, metal-framed towers used by oil companies to drill thousands of feet 
under ground. Once the drilling is complete, the towers are generally 
dismantled and replaced with more simple and compact pumping machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 When an oil company drills on its own property, there is no need to reimburse 
neighbors for any oil extracted from neighboring land. This so-called right of 
capture assumes, however, that none of the drilling actually invades the land 
underneath adjoining parcels. Because most oil drills don't just go straight 
down, a company that drills for oil has to get permission from the owners of 
any adjacent properties that might be invaded underground by drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil companies get this type of permission by signing leases with properties as 
far away as one mile from a drilling site. In Pacoima, for example, the 
original drilling extended 7,200 feet vertically, and more than 3,000 feet 
horizontally -- under acres of nearby parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil and gas companies often strike long-term leases with owners of undeveloped 
properties, explained Robert L. Compton, an oil and gas attorney with law firm 
Nordman, Cormany, Hair & Compton in Oxnard. In some cases the leases were 
signed by large ranch owners before subdivision. Once an area is filled with 
homes and businesses, an oil company generally goes door-to-door to offer 
property owners royalties in exchange for the rights to so-called directional, 
or slant drill deep underground, Compton said. Some leases are renewable every 
10 years, other leases are perpetual and last as long as there is oil being 
pumped out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible for oil companies to get consent from all the property 
owners adjacent to an urban drilling site, Compton noted. He says that 
according to state law, when 75% of nearby property owners agree to sign oil 
and gas leases, the other 25% can be forced to go along with the majority. None 
of these leases allows an oil company surface rights on any of the property -- 
only the deep subsurface rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Most property owners are more than happy to collect a royalty in exchange for 
doing basically nothing, but there are some people who aren't keen on oil 
production in their neighborhood. They are concerned about unsightliness or 
worry about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 However, James R. Weddle, an agent for Medallion California Properties Co. 
which operates the Pacoima field, said, "Unless you were up close, you wouldn't 
even know it's an oil field." The field is actually 10 wells surrounded by a 
Spanish-style structure and topped with a bell-style tower that was built to 
camouflage the original oil derrick. The oil pumped from the ground leaves the 
site through an underground pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddle also said the oil field is no threat to nearby residents. "There are a 
lot of safety features: fire sensors, subsurface safety valves that shut off 
automatically when there is an earthquake, and security to prevent anyone 
getting in and tampering with the wells." Also, there is nothing toxic at the 
site, he said. When the oil pumping ceases in about five years, the holes will 
be plugged and the property can be redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all oil fields are free of toxic chemicals, however. Many abandoned oil 
fields are now the subject of extensive litigation as federal, state and local 
officials try to figure out how to get someone to pay the cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One troubling possibility is that officials could turn to nearby property 
owners, said Donald Nanney, partner at Gilchrist & Rutter, a law firm in Santa 
Monica. Nanney researched this issue for a banking client that owned properties 
in which oil and gas royalties were being paid. He concluded that it may be 
possible to hold the recipients of royalties responsible for cleaning up the 
mess left behind by pumping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on whether the owner of the royalty interest has an ownership 
interest in the contaminated real property," said Nanney. An old California 
Supreme Court case says that if the right to receive a royalty from a certain 
property is perpetual, "there is a risk that the owner of the perpetual 
interest would be deemed as owner of the property." If that happens, an owner 
could have an obligation to abate a nuisance such as a polluted site. While 
there hasn't ever been a case on this particular issue, Nanney said, the 
liability of royalty holders remains a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners who agree to lease their oil and gas rights might want to 
consider executing a lease for a certain period of years that can be renewed -- 
instead of a perpetual lease, Nanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners can do other things to protect their rights with oil and gas 
leases, said attorney Compton. Property owners should know their share of any 
oil and gas produced by a nearby field. Owners should also review the oil and 
gas lease to see what rights are outlined in the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you think you are not getting paid your fair share of royalties, 
you can check productions on file with the state Division of Oil, Gas and 
Geothermal Resources (805) 654-4761, or demand an accounting of operations from 
the oil company.

MERGER MAY LEAD TO CUTBACKS IN COMMERCIAL VENTURES; CONVERSION: EXPERTS PREDICT 
THAT LOCKHEED MARTIN WILL DUMP BUSINESS LINES THAT AREN'T SOLID MONEY-MAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta say their planned merger will accelerate 
their expansion into commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts are skeptical. They say the merger aims chiefly to create a 
leaner, meaner defense contracting giant. Beyond that, experts figure, the 
consolidation is a chance for both firms to give their commercial ventures a 
long, hard look -- and dump the ones that aren't solid money-makers with roots 
in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides defense, "everything will be on the table now," said Rohit Shukla, 
executive director of the nonprofit Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas-based Lockheed and Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., 
announced plans last weekto combine forces, creating an aerospace powerhouse 
with $23 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Both say their commitment to diversify away from defense remains firm in the 
aftermath of the merger, the largest defense consolidation in industry history. 
And the companies' chief executives predicted that the new Lockheed Martin 
eventually would grow, after the unspecified job cuts that will come with the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 But job applicants shouldn't hold their breath. Analysts paint a picture of a 
smaller, tighter Lockheed Martin, pared down to the areas in which it has clear 
superiority -- be those civilian or military. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial markets expected to be emphasized by the new company include space 
systems, information services and environmental technology. As for other 
non-defense business lines, "They will shed like you wouldn't believe," 
predicted Shukla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventures such as CalComp, Lockheed's Anaheim-based computer graphics concern, 
will be among the first dumped by the new defense giant, he said. Profits at 
CalComp, which employs 1,600 worldwide, have been disappointing, and Lockheed 
tried unsuccessfully to sell the firm a few years ago. CalComp officials last 
week said it was premature to discuss the unit's future in a merged Lockheed 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Access Graphics, headquartered in Boulder, Colo., is another computer-related 
Lockheed venture that's likely to be a square peg in the new company, said Lior 
Bregman, an analyst with the investment banking firm Oppenheimer & Co. in New 
York. "Graphics and computer peripherals never fit, and it still doesn't fit," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even profitable companies such as Burbank-based Lockheed Air Terminal, the 
airport management company, may eventually be sold, said Shukla. In recent 
years, the company has expanded from airport management to airport development, 
and exploring projects in far-flung spots such as Turkey and Siberia. But 
despite its modest success, the company "does not contribute anything to their 
core business," Shukla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta have made strides in recent years to diversify 
away from making weapons and military aircraft. Lockheed is involved in 
everything from collecting highway tolls to developing commercial launch 
vehicles. U.S. defense sales shrank from 70% of Lockheed's total sales in 1991 
to 64% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta's sales outside U.S. defense accounted for more than 30% of 
sales last year, up from 25% five years ago, said Charles P. Manor, a Martin 
Marietta spokesman. Martin Marietta's diversification efforts range from a 
joint partnership with a firm that dissolves pollutants in molten metal, to 
providing computer graphic technology for video games to Tokyo-based Sega 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies were on a path toward expanding non-defense to 50% of sales, 
and that evolution will continue apace with the merger, Manor said. "Everyone 
has focused . . . on the creation of a defense juggernaut," he said. "But we 
did this not just to have a critical mass with (the Department of Defense), but 
to compete in global markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts question, though, whether the huge new Lockheed Martin will be 
any more competitive outside defense. Being big "makes it harder for them to be 
flexible, adaptable and operate as a commercially successful enterprise," said 
Dan Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit public policy 
think tank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's more successful commercial offspring include Lockheed Information 
Management Services Co. in Teaneck, N.J. The company provides systems for 
processing parking tickets and toll-road collections for local governments. It 
also has developed so-called "intelligent highways," which will use sensors to 
assess fees to commuters as they drive by toll booths. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company's most celebrated defense-conversion efforts are at Lockheed 
Missiles & Space Co. Inc., based in Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is rooted in the development of ballistic missile systems. But it has 
also worked in space exploration for NASA, developing support systems and tests 
for the Hubble Space Telescope, and designing pieces of NASA's proposed manned 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, the missiles and space division is using its technological base to 
expand into satellite images for map-making, commercial satellite launch 
vehicles and advanced materials for aircraft. It has also secured a 
$700-million contract with Motorola Satellite Communications Division to 
develop parts of a constellation of orbiting communications satellites called 
Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Martin Marietta is an old hand in space technology. The company 
makes both the Titan and Atlas rocket systems. "Space is the common 
denominator," said Bregman, the Oppenheimer analyst. "All (Lockheed's) 
space-related efforts fit very well with Martin Marietta's." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for environmental services, he said. Lockheed's ventures in that 
sector are "a perfect fit" with Martin Marietta's, he said. Besides its 
agreement with Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass., Martin Marietta 
also oversees toxic-waste cleanup at federal Department of Energy facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Lockheed Environmental Systems and Technologies Co., based in 
Houston, was considered an unimpressive business. Earlier this summer it burst 
into prominence by landing a $5-billion, five-year federal Department of Energy 
contract to manage the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Together the companies are poised to take advantage of growing concern over 
pollution problems overseas, said Shukla of the Regional Technology Alliance. 
"There are huge markets out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Martin will also move rapidly toward commercialization of its 
military business, Shukla said. "They won't design from the ground up for a 
specific customer any more. They will design one product and market it in many 
ways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military business is likely to be subjected to the same ruthless culling as 
Lockheed Martin's civilian operations, added Jim Schwendinger, Los 
Angeles-based director of national consulting for the accounting firm Deloitte 
and Touche. "They will decide what they have superiority in, and what they come 
second in, and they will spin those off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, both these behemoths are likely to spend some time digesting. 
"There's a limit to how much an organization can absorb and assimilate at one 
time," Schwendinger said. "It's going to take them a couple years at least."

MARTIN LAWRENCE CHAIRMAN TO LEAVE ART RETAILING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Martin 
Blinder is leaving, as the long-troubled Van Nuys art retailer and wholesaler 
looks to an improving economy for a return to financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Financial Officer Allen A. Baron will succeed Blinder as chairman, but 
the 15-year company veteran will not add the chief executive title. Blinder, 
47, a company co-founder, will remain on Martin Lawrence's board and act as a 
consultant for one year. President Barry Levine will also take on some of 
Blinder's duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder wasn't available for comment, but Baron insisted the company founder 
wasn't pressured into resigning. "He left of his own free will because he's 
relocating his family out of state," Baron said. Blinder's resignation is 
effective Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The management change occurs after the collapse of a tentative deal that would 
have given Martin Lawrence $3.5 million in cash through a private debt and 
equity financing from the Herrick Co. of Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would also have given privately held Herrick, which specializes 
in real estate acquisitions, a chance to gain control of Martin Lawrence's 
board. As part of that failed deal, Blinder had agreed to resign, although he 
would have remained as a consultant until new management was in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company is seeking other sources of capital to fund operations, 
Baron contended there is sufficient cash flow. The economy is still weak, but 
Baron believes customers are starting to loosen their purse strings with signs 
of recovery arriving. Martin Lawrence has no long-term or bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to work to profitability," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron said he plans to stick to the philosophy that has guided Martin Lawrence 
since it started in 1976 -- to bring affordable art to the nation through its 
galleries, located mostly in shopping malls. But he realizes that Americans may 
not be as free-spending in the 1990s as they were in the previous decade. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the company is exploring new distribution channels and will 
start selling art in the $500-and-less range -- well below the typical $1,400 
price tag of the limited edition lithographs and sculptures for which it is 
known. It is also searching for new artists. "There will be pent-up demand (as 
the economy improves)," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence has been particularly hard-hit by the recession. After years 
of solid results, the company began to lose money in 1991. To cut costs, it has 
shut down 25 stores and laid off about 100 workers over the past few years. It 
now has 21 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Martin Lawrence lost $6.69 million on a 22% decline in revenue to 
$18.7 million. In the second quarter ended June 30, the company cut its losses 
to $1.73 million, from a loss of $2.26 million a year before, while revenue 
remained flat at about $3.8 million. It narrowed its losses in the recent 
quarter principally by renegotiating leases on its mall galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 It also felt the effects of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Corporate 
headquarters were shut down for two weeks, its gallery at Sherman Oaks Fashion 
Center was shuttered for more than three months, and its Northridge Fashion 
Square location remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when the company was already struggling with the recession and the 
faltering art market, Martin Lawrence became embroiled in a legal fight with 
one of its biggest sources of revenue, artist Hiromichi Yamagata. The two 
parties settled their differences without money changing hands. But it resulted 
in Martin Lawrence's losing the services of the artist who had previously 
accounted for up to 42% of its sales.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: IWERKS PLANS TO REPORT $8-MILLION LOSS FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., maker of a variety of virtual reality rides and 
specialized theaters, announced that it will report a loss of about $8 million 
for the fiscal year that ended June 30, compared to a year-earlier profit of 
$1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank-based company said it expects fiscal 1994 revenues of about $36 
million, up 13% from revenue of $32 million a year earlier.Previously, the 
company announced that it expects to post a loss for the June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Final results will be announced in the upcoming weeks, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks was one of last year's hottest public offerings. The stock went public 
at $18 per share and zoomed to $37 per share within a few weeks. But the 
company, founded by two former Walt Disney Co. executives, has had trouble 
finding locations and investors for its Cinetropolis complexes -- small theme 
parks that include theaters with moving seats and dance floors surrounded by 
360-degree movie screens. The company's stock closed Friday at $5 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, the company said it is reviewing operations and 
seeking opportunities to cut costs.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VENEZUELA'S CRISIS FAILS TO IMPACT BENTON OIL & GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard-based petroleum exploration and production 
firm, said that its Venezuelan operations have not been adversely impacted by 
that country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of Venezuela's banking system has fallen into state hands 
since January, when Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, 
collapsed.Dozens of the bank's executives have since been ordered arrested on 
suspicion of theft and swindling, and experts have predicted that the 
Venezuelan government's cost of bailing out Banco Latino could reach $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, as an 80% owner of a joint venture in Venezuela, is under contract 
with an affiliate of the Venezuelan national oil company for reactivation and 
further development of three Venezuelan oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The company financed the project partly through the issuance of $15 million in 
commercial paper expected to be rolled over every 60 days. When that paper came 
due in February, one month after the banking crisis erupted, investors balked 
at another 60-day term, and Benton was forced to pay off the debt, said Chief 
Financial Officer Greg Grabar. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Venezuela's economic troubles, the company said it has received, 
on schedule, a quarterly payment of about $5 million in U.S. dollars for 
delivery of 614,000 barrels of oil during the second quarter that ended June 
30. Development of the project will continue to move forward, the company said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LAB EQUIPMENT MAKER GETS PATENT FOR NEW ANALYZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Remote Imaging Systems Inc., a Chatsworth maker of medical 
diagnostic equipment, said it was granted a patent for a machine that 
identifies abnormalities in white blood cells automatically, so that lab 
technicians don't have to spend as much time scrutinizing samples through a 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the device will be used in a new instrument it is developing 
with LDA Systems that will screen white blood cells for leukemia or 
infections.The device, called the White IRIS Leukocyte differential analyzer, 
is about to enter clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the device incorporates a speedy method of analyzing cell 
sub-types by assigning them numerical signatures. It then projects their images 
on a screen so that laboratory workers can look them over. 
</P>
<P>
 The device will cut the time needed to analyze white blood cells from about 
six minutes to one, International Remote said, and will ostensibly cut labor 
costs in clinical laboratories.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: RECESSION STILL LINGERS FOR OXNARD 
JOB-SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tragic shooting rampage remains fresh in the memories of those who work at 
the state unemployment office in Oxnard, but a lackluster job market has kept 
the facility's staff as busy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 For job-seekers on the Oxnard Plain, the recession still lingers, reports 
Avelina Villalobos, manager of the state Employment Development Department 
office on C Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still seeing cutbacks in manufacturing and elsewhere," she says. "And, 
of course, there are the cyclical layoffs in agriculture. Between them, they've 
pretty much kept employment in this area at recession level." 
</P>
<P>
 Even two new retail centers -- Oxnard Factory Outlet and Shopping at the Rose, 
the latter anchored by a Wal-Mart store -- haven't provided enough jobs to 
offset those lost in manufacturing and farming, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Villalobos believes a determined individual can land a decent job. "We 
help people file for unemployment insurance, but we also get them job leads. We 
tell them: 'If you stay with it, you'll find a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos and her staff were propelled into the spotlight last December when 
an unemployed computer engineer shot and killed three people inside the 
building. The man later killed a fourth person, a police officer, before being 
shot dead in Ventura, outside another unemployment office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard facility was closed for a few days, then reopened with a new 
security system. Next March, it's scheduled to be moved to a former market on 
Ventura Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos hopes jobless people will be easier to place by then, but she isn't 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's jobless rate rose two percentage points in July, reaching 
9.3% of the work force. The biggest setback was the loss of 6,300 seasonal farm 
jobs, affecting more than one in every four of the county's agricultural 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal school layoffs also boosted the jobless rate, but hiring increased in 
construction, the wholesale trades and a few other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the thousands of farm layoffs were centered in the region served by 
the Oxnard jobs office. "It's seasonal work that involves harvesting 
strawberries, celery, lettuce and other row crops," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people will be rehired for a relatively short planting season in 
October and November, but we won't return to peak employment in the fields 
until the next harvest starts in April and May." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Villalobos hopes, things will be looking up for non-farm employment 
too.

 If you hated going to school, don't apply for a job at Cardkey Systems Inc., a 
Simi Valley firm that produces magnetic-coded security systems, mainly for 
military and industrial installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, all 200 of Cardkey's employees have been required to attend 
on-site classes aimed at improving their skills in problem solving, customer 
service, production and management, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on an employee's position, the courses total from 146 to 270 hours 
of class time. There's homework too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state Employment Training Panel has awarded Cardkey $364,000 to help 
defray the program's costs, which include hiring an educational consultant and 
paying workers for their time in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's money well spent," Cardkey President Joe Vona says of the state grant. 
"These courses help make our company more effective and competitive in a 
worldwide market. And they'll make our workers more employable in case they 
ever return to the job market." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardkey is a unit of Metra, a Helsinki-based conglomerate with sales of $2 
billion annually.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: COUNTY HOUSING SALES OFF NEARLY 25% IN 
JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of single-family housing in Ventura County during July took the steepest 
monthly dive of any region in the state, according to the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow closings in the county fell nearly 25% below those in June, the group 
reports.Statewide, sales declined 8%. Contrasted with July, 1993, the county's 
house sales were down less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price for houses sold in the county was $204,000 in July, down 
nearly 6% from June, and 3% below the median price of a year earlier. The 
median price represents the point at which half the houses sold for more and 
half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising mortgage rates are not the only culprits in the sudden housing 
downturn, suggests R. Scott Hoover, recently promoted to countywide manager of 
Norwest Mortgage Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job security is a person's No. 1 concern when it comes to buying a home and 
taking on a new mortgage," he says. "If you're a little shaky about your job 
situation, you're going to think twice before buying. That's especially true if 
loan rates are up a point or two, as they are over six months ago."

<P>
 In contrast to the increased jobless rate, Manpower Inc.'s quarterly 
employment outlook survey shows that 17% of the county's largest businesses 
plan to increase their payrolls in the fourth quarter, while only 3% expect 
layoffs. The rest are undecided or expect no change.Three months ago, 9% of the 
firms foresaw new hiring and 6% predicted cutbacks. A year ago, 17% planned to 
expand while 20% expected layoffs . . . American Fastening Systems, a 
Camarillo-based distributor of industrial and construction supplies, leased an 
11,000-square-foot headquarters facility on Pleasant Valley Road. The move

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FLAMEMASTER SETTLES SUIT WITH COURTAULDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flamemaster Corp., a Sun Valley maker of aircraft sealants, adhesives and 
coatings, announced the settlement of its $75-million, breach-of-contract and 
antitrust lawsuit against Courtaulds Aerospace Inc. of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was settled amicably, both companies said, and neither party admitted 
any liability.Details of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed a year ago in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, accused 
Courtaulds and its British parent Courtaulds PLC of monopolizing the 
production, distribution and sale of high adhesion, temperature- and 
fuel-resistant sealing compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also accused Courtaulds of violating several agreements between the 
two companies to jointly develop and market new products. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said a new agreement has been negotiated, allowing Flamemaster 
to continue to use technical data for the manufacture of certain sealants that 
have been developed by Courtaulds.

 SWEETER YEAR: For Rosh Hashanah, which began at sundown Monday, many of Orange 
County's estimated 100,000 Jews are eating foods symbolizing sweetness, 
blessings and abundance. . . . Rabbi David Eliezrie said the holiday celebrates 
the coming of a new year with an emphasis on charity and repenting sins. "We 
dip challah (bread) in honey and after, on the first night, we dip a piece of 
apple in honey with the hope that God will bring us a sweet, good year." 
</P>

 CAMP REMEMBER: For more than 25 years, Garden Grove resident Shiro Nomura, a 
Japanese American interned during World War II (B1), has been collecting 
mementos from his relocation camp in Manzanar about 235 miles north of Orange 
County. . . . Now they're on exhibit at an Inyo County museum, including 
reminiscences on the camp, its guard towers and big searchlights. "It was said 
that the street lights of nearby Lone Pine were turned off at night," he wrote 
at the time, "because the searchlight beams of Manzanar kept the town well 
lit." 
</P>
<P>
 DREAMING: Barbara Eden, the genie in the 1960s TV sitcom "I Dream of Jeannie," 
will be in Santa Ana Wednesday morning at Planet Hollywood, but her biggest 
fans in Orange County may miss the ceremony. . . . Josef Rodriguez says he and 
roommate Alfonso Luna, who have a carload of Jeannie memorabilia in Garden 
Grove (E1), can't get tickets and probably couldn't use any. "I'd like to meet 
her," Rodriguez says. "But if I take off work, I'll get fired."

 PUFFIN' POSSE: Maybe you don't think Walt Netschert of Orange should have any 
rights. But Netschert -- Capt. Huff-and-Puff -- who gained notoriety with his 
plastic helmet that allows him to smoke without bothering others, is making his 
move. His Puffin' Posse has lobbied more than 40 local businesses and agencies 
over smoking rules. Says Netschert: "We came up with some shocking, provocative 
things." Such as: the city of Orange doesn't want its firefighters smoking -- 
on or off the job.

LONG-AWAITED DAY HERE FOR NEW SCHOOLTEACHERS; EDUCATION: THEY BEGIN JOBS IN 
O.C. FILLED WITH ENERGY. BUT LOW PAY, CHALLENGING CONDITIONS WILL DRIVE MANY 
AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With piles of color-coordinated paper clips, a drawerful of scented markers 
and brand-new plastic organizers, Jenny Watson is just about ready for fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 She has picked out a red dress with white and blue stars for the first day. 
She has put matching purple-and-gold contact paper on her clipboard and a 
coffee can cum pencil holder. And she's been brushing up on astronomy and 
oceanography, key units for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Watson's second stab at grade four. Back in 1980, she was an 
eager student sitting in a small plastic chair. Now she is one of California's 
10,000 new public-school teachers, heading to the front of the class for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night was my first restless night. I'd been waiting for that," admitted 
Watson, 23, as she sat in her empty Hopkinson Elementary School classroom on a 
day before her students were scheduled to arrive. "I'm looking forward to it, 
but you have those nightmares about your alarm clock not going off. . . . It's 
almost like your first day of school when you're a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Brimming with bright-eyed enthusiasm, Watson is typical of first-year 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most come fresh from college and a one-year credentialing program, shunning 
better-paid professions out of an altruistic desire to help children. Others 
change jobs mid-career, seeking a schedule more conducive to raising a family. 
A growing number are veterans of California's ever-shrinking aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all begin their new careers bursting with ideas and energy. But meager 
pay, overstuffed classes and an increasingly complex and needy student 
population drive them away in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's teacher retirement system, at least 20% of new 
teachers in California quit within the first two years. A 1990 study by the 
National Center for Education Statistics showed about 10% of teachers leaving 
after one year, and 37% after five. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, local districts are unveiling intensive stay-in-school programs 
for new teachers this fall to curb the high dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the first bell rings, the recruits have started slaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson filled two days clearing cobwebs and scrubbing cabinets in her 
classroom, and another week decorating it. She has already spent about $1,500 
on school supplies, money she saved from a spring job as a substitute teacher 
and by living with her mother instead of renting an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And she still has a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know all the events in California history? Do you know how deep the 
ocean is?" Watson said laughingly as she sat in her empty classroom, once again 
perched on a tiny plastic chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "And bladder control -- that's a must," Watson notes. "The teacher's credo is 
'Hold it, shove it': You have to hold it in, and you have so short (a time) for 
lunch, you have to shove in the food." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are other lessons they don't teach in graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
 How to run dittos without getting ink all over your hands (the number of 
photocopies is limited to save money, forcing the use of old-fashioned crank 
machines for daily work sheets). How to write straight on a chalkboard. What to 
do with high schoolers who cannot read. 
</P>
<P>
 What if teen-agers develop a crush on you? Or if students don't like you at 
all? 
</P>
<P>
 "They say don't worry if your kids don't like you, but that is important to 
me, because that'll get them to listen to me more," admitted Jose Luis Poveda, 
a soon-to-be math teacher at Century High School in Santa Ana, who already 
wears his royal blue school jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In a small Costa Mesa apartment decorated with Star Trek posters and a 
collection of baseball caps and trophies from his own high-school days, Poveda, 
25, spent many summer days perched in front of his Macintosh. He has designed 
umpteen computer programs for his classes: games like Jeopardy! and animated 
geometry demonstrations designed to make math more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Once an engineering major, Poveda was derailed by high-intensity physics 
courses. Teaching seemed a way to combine his love for math and the Macintosh 
with a desire to serve his community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish he learned fluently at home made Poveda an attractive job 
candidate. It also helps in class. Though most students at Century speak 
English, many are more comfortable chatting in their native language. Last 
year, Poveda said, while student-teaching there, he spoke Spanish about 60% of 
the time in class, and even more often in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was offered a job at Uni High. I turned it down," Poveda said, referring to 
Irvine's University High, which consistently posts top scores in Orange County 
on standardized tests. "They really don't need me. These kids in Santa Ana, 
they need me. 
</P>
<P>
 "High-school age, a lot of kids have dreams that they have futures," he added. 
"I was pushed by my teachers to go after that. Maybe I can push my kids to 
their dreams and maybe make a difference to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This desire to make a difference, experts said, is sparking new interest in 
teaching. "People are going into teaching who could choose any profession in 
the world and are going into teaching because they believe it's one of the ways 
they can affect change," said Ted Mitchell, dean of the UCLA School of 
Education. "People are combining great intellectual talent with a spirit of 
altruism." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, more than 1,000 people showed up for a job fair in south Orange 
County's Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and other teacher-educators said the 1990s have brought an 
increasingly diverse and qualified crew of candidates to graduate schools of 
education. This includes a new breed of teacher: people who once chose 
money-making careers and are now fed up with number-crunching and 
ladder-climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness Kimri Vella and Ray Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Once vice president of a bank, Vella, a 36-year-old mother of two, has traded 
pin-striped suits for a kindergarten teacher's jumper. Having children made 
Vella yearn for more time to watch them grow. It also revealed her deep 
fascination with the learning process. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new job as a part-time teacher at Lee Elementary School in Los Alamitos 
allows Vella to use her mothering skills in a second career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The self-fulfillment of helping others is really a great motivation," she 
said. "When you're helping someone and they just light up and you see the 
excitement of what they've just discovered, there's nothing more exciting than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 After three decades of engineering at Rockwell International Corp., Schmidt 
felt he was ready for a change. He retired last year on a comfortable pension, 
but decided that if he sat at home he'd "be tearing things apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at age 56, he's a first-year teacher of computer technology at Troy High 
School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything else you do for yourself," Schmidt said. "Teaching, you convince 
yourself you're doing it for others. I don't know if it's true or not. But you 
can say that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're certainly not doing it to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically underpaid, public-school teachers have suffered salary freezes or 
cuts in recent years as education funds from the state have dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, entry-level salaries at Orange County's 27 school districts 
averaged $26,821. Los Alamitos Unified ($29,463) and Anaheim Union High School 
District ($29,267) paid the most; the lowest salary, $20,488, was in Saddleback 
Valley Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Unified, the district offering the second-lowest salary, pay for 
first-year teachers rose only 1.1% between 1989-90 and 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Low salaries are an expected frustration of the teaching profession, but many 
other problems only become apparent once new teachers step inside the 
schoolhouse door. 
</P>
<P>
 Because seniority rules the teaching profession, first-year teachers often get 
the worst assignments -- job openings in schools that experienced teachers have 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 New teachers carry workloads comparable to those of their older colleagues but 
work harder on preparation because they have no old lesson plans to fall back 
on. Meanwhile, they must also learn to negotiate the public-school system's 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 On probation the first year, they face the nerve-racking pressure of being 
constantly evaluated. In their off-hours, they must take graduate school 
classes they need to renew their teaching credential after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beginning teachers are typically put in the most difficult settings," said 
Laura Wagner of the state Department of Education. "It's very emotionally and 
psychologically and physically stressful to teach in settings like that." 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the massive burnout, the Department of Education and the state's 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing have launched the Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment project, a network of 15 local programs around the state funded 
by grants totaling $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the project is being unveiled at half a dozen Orange County 
districts in connection with teacher-education programs at Cal State Fullerton 
and UC Irvine. About 150 new teachers will be paired with experienced teachers 
in their schools to share strategies without the pressure of formal job 
evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot phases of the state project show striking retention results: 90% of 
urban teachers stayed in their districts, compared to 70% in large districts 
elsewhere in the state. In rural areas, 88% of those in the project stuck to 
teaching, compared to 50% of other rural teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how well prepared a person is, they're never really thoroughly 
prepared for the many demands of the classrooms of today," said Carol Bartell, 
a consultant to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing who is heading the 
support and assessment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're faced with the reality of some kids who don't want to be there, or a 
school schedule that's very difficult, or a workload that's so demanding they 
can't give the kids the attention they thought they'd be able to," said Carol 
Booth Olson, who is coordinating UCI's branch of the program. "If you can get 
through it, most people tend to find teaching incredibly rewarding. But there's 
some obstacles to getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 At the first meeting of the support and assessment group in Fullerton, two 
dozen first-year teachers sat around a conference table brainstorming about 
ways the program could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's ask for a year of lesson plans," one joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we could get them to grade our papers," offered another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Lofink has already graded his share of papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofink's first year of teaching is well underway at Garfield Elementary, a 
year-round school in Santa Ana where students returned in July. At 6-foot-4, 
Lofink towers over his class of 32 fifth-graders, who constantly call out "Mr. 
Lofink, Mr. Lofink," peppering him with riddles and requests. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months, Lofink has developed a routine. Each morning, one boy picks 
a trivia question from a book on Lofink's desk, then presents a prize from the 
closet to whomever answers first. Girls compete with boys in a race to correct 
spelling and grammar in a sentence written on the board. Lofink reads a story 
aloud. There's a vocabulary quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never turn your back," said Lofink, 28. "You think you make progress, 
and you're all excited: 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!' Then you come in the next day and 
you're back where you started, and you think, 'Didn't I do anything?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lofink's father, mother and brother are all teachers, but he was reluctant to 
join the crowd. So he majored in political science. Finding no work in the 
field, Lofink took a job as a librarian at a local school. The district cut his 
hours. He decided to get his teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first weeks, Lofink has struggled to fit spelling, math, social 
studies, science, reading aloud, reading silently, physical education and 
language development all in one day. The hours are long, especially because he 
tries to watch his students' soccer games after school. And the reading levels 
in his room range from first grade to fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to be prepared for anything, but you can't possibly," Lofink sighed. 
"I wanted to have very high expectations. . . . I see after the first month 
that they're not going to be where I want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really scary is, you have all these kids' lives in your hands. If you 
screw up, you mess them up for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 * MONEY DOESN'T COUNT: Annual salaries around $26,000 aren't what draw 
teachers. A18 School Days

COLUMN ONE; ACADEMIA RANKLED BY RANKINGS; THE POWER OF COLLEGE GUIDES HAS SOME 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS CALLING FOR BOYCOTTS WHILE OTHERS ARE LOBBYING THE 
GUIDE-MAKERS IN HOPES OF WINNING BETTER MARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He may be one of the most powerful figures in American higher education, but 
Mel Elfin doesn't have a Ph.D., teach a single course or hold office hours on 
any campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two high-ranked college officials a week, on average, pay their 
respects to -- and sometimes lobby -- this irascible, bushy-browed editor who 
collects tabloid headlines and gives himself haircuts at his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Elfin is in charge of the U.S. News & World Report annual ranking 
of more than 1,400 colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the magazine's hottest sellers each fall, its annual "America's Best 
Colleges" list is jokingly referred to as academia's "swimsuit issue." And 
while the decade-old guide is considered the most influential, it is just one 
in a burgeoning pack of rankings that has administrators climbing the 
ivy-covered walls. 
</P>
<P>
 There are guides for Christian students, Jewish students, environmentally 
correct students, disabled students. One popular book rates campus life in 
restaurant-review style -- five stars for the best -- and another irreverent 
tome belittled one university as a "high school with ashtrays." Money magazine 
computes "best buys," while the Business Week guide evaluates "customer 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say these guidebooks and rankings -- with their commentaries or 
compilations of test scores, graduation rates and class sizes -- have become a 
powerful tool in the new scholastic marketplace. As never before, students and 
their parents are using them to comparison shop. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has eroded the control of the intellectual Brahmins, who for decades 
have determined the academic pecking order but who now must pay attention to 
the consumer demands of parents and students trying to figure out what 
constitutes a quality education. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this is a very fundamental change and it's a very difficult change," 
said Peter Likins, president of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. ". . . 
What's hard for us in higher education is just being judged by these outsiders. 
They're not academics and our long-treasured tradition is one of internal 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any college that believes the rankings are of no consequence is blind to 
realities," he said. "They have an influence on how parents and students 
behave. They have an influence on how alumni feel about their alma mater." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention a big effect on how educators act. The Assn. of Universities 
and Colleges in Canada is trying to block Maclean's magazine from publishing 
its fourth annual ranking this November. The group passed a resolution calling 
on member schools to boycott requests from Canada's leading newsmagazine for 
institutional statistics -- a call to arms that many schools have ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, college officials lobby, whine and bicker -- and widely 
suspect each other of misreporting statistics to look good. The president of 
Marshall University in West Virginia chastised colleges that "juggle their 
numbers" for the guides, an ethical lapse he compared to misusing research 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reminiscent of Faust's selling his soul to the Devil, some of us in higher 
education are peddling our souls in exchange for rankings in a magazine's 
promotional efforts," J. Wade Gilley fumed in a 1992 article for Academe 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a doctorate to figure out why, given the competition in higher 
education for good students. 
</P>
<P>
 "High school counselors tell me that students come into their offices with a 
page torn out of (U.S. News), saying 'This is where I want to apply' and it is 
School No. 5 as opposed to School No. 6," said B. Ann Wright, dean of 
enrollment at Smith College in Massachusetts. "It's the power of the vertical 
column." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Orange County universities, UC Irvine has garnered a share of these 
rankings. U.S. News' 1994 report listed UCI among the top 25% best 
universities, and the 1992 report dubbed it one of four collegiate 
"up-and-comers." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's dance major was included among the nation's top 17 most highly 
recommended dance programs, according to The Performing Arts Major's College 
Guide, said UCI spokesman Scott Nelson, and its drama program made the guide's 
list of 13 most highly recommended graduate drama majors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Gourman Report, another annual national overall listing, listed six 
UCI programs in humanities in their top 25 in both undergraduate and graduate 
courses of study. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reports that have cropped up are more unconventional. UCI was 
listed among the country's worst dozen universities in June for its "extreme 
left-wing bias" by Accuracy in Academia -- a Washington-based group of 
conservatives. UCI was in good company: prestigious universities such as 
Harvard and Yale also made the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some faculty members put a lot of stock into various national rankings, and 
others don't think much of them," Nelson said. "But you always want to have 
your name mentioned in a positive light." 
</P>
<P>
 "College ratings are great if they're based on what's most important to your 
institution," said Cal State Fullerton spokeswoman Judy Mandel. "In the case of 
Cal State Fullerton, we'd love to be rated on criteria that include quality of 
faculty, mission, accessibility, cost, our graduates and our community impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University officials said they want to get into the national 
spotlight, and U.S. News rankings could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider the rankings of some importance, and probably a lot of people out 
there use them as a guide to choosing a school," Chapman spokesman Jeff Coulter 
said. "So of course we'd like to see ourselves ranked as high as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials face pointed questions from lawmakers, trustees and alumni if a 
school gets mediocre reviews or slides lower in the rankings. When Lehigh 
didn't even show up in the early U.S. News lists, Likins said, he heard about 
it at alumni gatherings in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that score well, however, trumpet the rankings. Berea College printed 
T-shirts and bumper stickers after U.S. News picked the 1,500-student Kentucky 
school as one of the best in the mid-1980s. A spokesman said applications 
tripled overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., went one better, renting a billboard to 
announce its sixth-place finish in a U.S. News category one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear what's going on here," lamented Robert Atwell, president of the 
American Council on Education, the umbrella association for 1,600 schools and 
higher education groups. "There are too many instances in which institutions 
brag about raising their profile from 45th to 26th, not choosing to recognize 
that it says absolutely nothing about the quality of the institution. It might 
have been terrific at 45 and not any better at 26th, but if it comes up at 65 
next year, you'll die by the sword." 
</P>
<P>
 How did it get so crazy? 
</P>
<P>
 Many academics say they are victims of the public's lust for lists -- and 
publishers that pander to it. Increasingly cost-conscious administrators are 
using more objective benchmarks to measure their school's efficiency. And a 
drop in the supply of traditional students has created a buyer's market. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say it was academia's pomp, not circumstance, that caused the 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're as much at fault here," said Patrick P. Terenzini, associate director 
for the National Center on Post-Secondary Teaching, Learning and Assessment at 
Penn State. "Colleges and universities have been very reluctant to share much 
information with the public . . . . There's a good deal of image management 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education's carefully coiffed image, preserved in postcard-perfect 
brochures churned out by admissions offices, was mussed up during the last 
decade by revelations about fat administrative salaries and dubious research as 
undergraduates were shoveled into crowded lecture halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most agree that academia's biggest transgression was of the purse: It kept 
hiking tuition even as jobs dried up during the recession. With exclusive 
schools crossing the $100,000 threshold for a bachelor's degree, the average 
price of a college education has doubled since 1983, rising 2.5 times faster 
than the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 As sticker shock set in, students and their parents couldn't find hard numbers 
and comparisons to help make the second biggest investment in their lives. Thus 
grew the power of rankings and guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envision this as a Consumer Reports approach to higher education," said 
Elfin. "People can get all the information they need on the comparative merits 
of a $200 VCR, but there was nothing that would give them the comparative 
merits of two institutions, where it costs $80,000 to $100,000 for a degree." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in the early 1980s with a proliferation of guidebooks, the staid 
encyclopedic tomes traditionally relegated to the reference shelves of high 
school counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright from Smith College traces the phenomenon to a 1982 guide compiled by 
then-New York Times education editor Edward B. Fiske. He introduced a five-star 
system to rate the academic, social life and quality of life of selected 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first that set colleges against each other in a way that had not 
happened before, in terms of who was the best and who was not the best," said 
Wright. "I was at the University of Rochester at the time and I was one of 
those people who were horrified because we were given three stars, which was in 
the medium range." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guides emphasized commentary and sassy attitudes. The Princeton Review 
Student Access Guide to the Best Colleges, for instance, began featuring lists 
with blunt titles like "Campus like Eden/Campus like Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, an explosion in guidebooks has created about 30 titles catering to 
all kinds of student tastes, said Joe Hollander, an editor at New Jersey-based 
Peterson's, one of the nation's oldest guidebook publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing caused more academic anguish than when the rankings bug spread to 
periodicals such as Business Week, Money and U.S. News, say college officials. 
With their built-in base of millions of subscribers, the popular press became a 
fearsome wild card at a time when admissions offices were competing for 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Business Week has turned the tables on the nation's top business schools by 
surveying hundreds of recent graduates and corporate recruiters for "customer 
satisfaction." When the first of its biennial lists came out in 1988, it was a 
shocker -- dark horse Northwestern University came in first, while favorites 
like Stanford and the University of Chicago limped in at ninth and 11th, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The list "induced an identity crisis" among some elite management schools, 
even causing one to revamp its curriculum, Stanford and Emory University 
researchers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 No guide, however, seems to have captured consumer attention -- or frayed 
academia's nerves -- more than U.S. News. With an appeal to Middle America, a 
circulation of 2.2 million and a "news you can use" philosophy, the magazine 
has become something of a gold standard in college rankings, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 When it began in 1983, U.S. News simply polled 500 college presidents and 
declared Stanford, not Harvard, the nation's best major university, one of 
several categories it used. Using reputation to assign rankings was no 
different than the method used in 1925 when a Midwestern college president 
published the first rankings of Ph.D. programs based on the opinion of experts 
in each field, said David S. Webster, associate professor at Oklahoma State 
University, who has studied the history of academic rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 College presidents launched salvos against the U.S. News rankings as a "beauty 
contest" and a blatant attempt to sell magazines. Thirty of them vented their 
spleens as guests of the magazine at a dinner in January, 1988, said Elfin, 
U.S. News' special projects editor who took over the rankings that year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Elfin, college presidents faced a veteran of Washington journalism who also 
is familiar with the back lots of higher education. Married to the chair of 
nearby Hood College's political science department, Elfin is a dissertation 
away from getting his Ph.D. in contemporary American history from the New 
School for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his style doesn't fit into the noblesse oblige world of academia. His 
office is lined with tabloid headlines, and instead of polite understatement, 
he bowls through conversations with pointed interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators admit Elfin has earned their "grudging respect" for keeping an open 
ear and working with them to refine the ranking methodology. After the heated 
1988 dinner, for example, U.S. News moved quickly to incorporate more objective 
data from the schools, rather than to rely solely on reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Elfin and in-house statistician Robert Morse have reworked the 
formula to produce 14 categories, where schools are ranked according to 
financial integrity, faculty resources, student admissions and alumni 
satisfaction, as well as reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining the information is a months-long task, with the magazine sending out 
13-page questionnaires asking for 80 different "data points," such as average 
SAT scores for entering freshmen and size of endowments. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials grumble about the growing blizzard of surveys, one reaching 
140 pages, from guidebook publishers. A Berkeley researcher estimated it took 
the campus one staff position, or $50,000 worth of time, to fill out all the 
surveys -- a cost of up to $50 million when extrapolated over all of higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet educators say they can't risk the statistical consequences of silence, and 
each year about 100 college presidents, deans or other officials travel to 
Washington to take a seat on Elfin's red couch for a little schmoozing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the parade on a recent morning was Robert T. Conley, president of The 
Union Institute, a non-traditional Cincinnati school that provides "distance 
learning" -- independent study courses taught by computer -- to 1,700 students 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Framed by tabloids headlines screaming "Dead Infant Fed to Dog" and "Fergie 
Throws Up!" the pink-faced Conley strained to describe the institute's 
philosophy of allowing "the learner to interact personally with his own 
education" before Elfin seized control with a barrage of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have arrived at Elfin's doorstep for some more decidedly aggressive 
lobbying, and often propose changes in methodology that will help their 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Claremont's Harvey Mudd College, which was named best "smaller 
comprehensive school" by U.S. News in 1985 only to disappear from the top 
lists. School officials came to see Elfin and ask the magazine to create a 
category for engineering specialty schools. When the list debuted in 1991, 
Mudd's name was on top. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the dean of Georgetown University Law School, concerned that 
her school wasn't rated any higher than 13th in the graduate school lists, 
invited Elfin for a tour before handing him a two-page critique of the 
methodology over lunch. She'll have to wait to judge the results until the 
magazine publishes its ranking of graduate schools in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State's Webster said he has "nothing but contempt for college 
presidents who troop through" Elfin's office, but the editor and others are 
more concerned about the continual allegations about schools that try to "game 
the system" by cheating on their statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the tricks is to inflate SAT scores by not counting those of some 
athletes and "special admits," many times low-scoring minority students 
admitted through diversity programs, say officials. Another is to reduce the 
student-teacher ratio by counting faculty on leave or those who are retired but 
have a campus office, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfin's staff has tried to eliminate the problem with careful wording, but 
some of the officials who come calling insist it continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, Elfin said, the magazine got a jolt when it obtained a 
confidential American Bar Assn. report that showed a third of the 176 
accredited law schools covered in the graduate school ranking had reported 
different admissions numbers to the magazine. Most discrepancies were minor. 
However, one low-ranked California school -- which U.S. News wouldn't name -- 
told the ABA it had admitted 55% of applicants while telling U.S. News the 
number was 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these are the people to whom we entrust . . . our ideals, our heritage 
and our young," Elfin said about allegations of cheating in general. "Not only 
do they fib, they're in here ratting on others who fib."

RUNOFF FOR BENCH A TRIAL FOR FRIEDMAN, MORIARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An election campaign that's shaping up as one of the most expensive Superior 
Court judgeship races in state history has mushroomed into a fracas that may 
give new meaning to the term "judicial temperament." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle features John L. Moriarity, a Van Nuys-based personal-injury 
attorney who runs half-page ads in the Yellow Pages and promises to be tough on 
criminals, and state Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), who decided 
to run for judge rather than seek reelection to the Sacramento post he has held 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, such races are mild-mannered affairs, run on shoestring budgets and 
largely ignored by voters. But the Moriarity-Friedman dust-up is breaking the 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
 Election-related litigation fees included, this contest is likely to become 
California's most costly Superior Court election fight to date, according to 
Joe Cerrell, a veteran political consultant to judicial candidates and 
Moriarity's adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July, Moriarity had already spent nearly $175,000 on the race -- 
including the cost of hiring an airplane to tow a pro-Moriarity banner through 
the skies just before the primary -- while Friedman has spent $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With that kind of spending, the race by its Nov. 8 climax should eclipse 
previous records. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to this race than money. 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarity, a Republican, has charged that Friedman's legislative voting record 
puts him "to the left of Tom Hayden" on criminal justice and other issues, 
while Friedman, a champion of nonsmokers' rights, has charged that vengeful 
tobacco-industry interests lie behind Moriarity's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, who has represented a sizable portion of the western San Fernando 
Valley in the state Assembly since 1992, had seemed to be the easy favorite in 
what looked to be a sleepy judicial primary for Office No. 2 of the Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 45-year-old lawmaker was forced into a November runoff when both 
Moriarity, who has spent $128,000 of his own money on the race, and Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Schirn, a third candidate, showed uncommon grit and voter 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and Moriarity ran virtually neck and neck, with Friedman scoring 
35.9% of the votes -- only 5,814 more than were won by the 62-year-old 
Moriarity, a Calabasas resident. But Friedman needed a majority to win the 
primary outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, the contest wound up in court, with the candidates accusing 
each other of trying to mislead the electorate with the proposed candidate 
statements they had prepared for the official pamphlet that goes to 3.5 million 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The voter guide is one of the most important tools judicial candidates use to 
get their message out to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dust had settled, Moriarity appeared to have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski agreed with Moriarity that 
several comments Friedman had proposed to make in the guide about his legal 
experience were misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge's ruling is proof positive that a guy who wants to be a judge has 
been rebuked by a member of his own legal fraternity for trying to mislead 
voters," Cerrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friedman vigorously disputed Zebrowski's ruling, claiming his statements 
were accurate and that Zebrowski is "violating my First Amendment rights." 
Members of the Friedman camp privately suggested that the judge was guilty of 
partisanship, noting that he had been appointed to the bench by former Gov. 
George Deukmejian, a leading Moriarity supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-hour hearing, Zebrowski ordered Friedman, who is an attorney, to 
rewrite seven parts of his official statement, forcing him, for example, to 
drop or amend claims that he was a "nationally recognized prosecutor," a 
"victims' rights specialist" and a "law professor." 
</P>
<P>
 "To read his statement, you'd believe Terry Friedman was the greatest crime 
fighter since Superman," said Bradley Hertz, Moriarity's attorney, hailing the 
judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Zebrowski, for example, held that it was misleading for Friedman to suggest 
that he was a nationally recognized prosecutor when a prosecutor is commonly 
seen to be a government criminal lawyer. More accurately, Friedman could claim 
to be a "nationally recognized attorney," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Zebrowski ruled it was inaccurate for Friedman to call himself a 
victims' rights specialist when such a title commonly is used to refer to 
people involved in domestic abuse cases. To this end, the judge rejected 
Friedman's claim that his work on behalf of Holocaust victims qualified him for 
that title. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, Zebrowski ordered Moriarity to drop one of the claims made 
in his candidate statement that said Moriarity had been "strongly endorsed" by 
the Women Lawyers Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the group said it had not endorsed Moriarity but rather had rated him 
as simply "qualified" to be a judge -- the group's lowest rating. By contrast 
the group had given Friedman its highest rating of "exceptionally well 
qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Zebrowski's ruling left the Friedman camp gasping, and Friday they were 
preparing to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, even as he said in an interview how much he regretted the 
"undignified" nature of the campaign, said he was becoming increasingly "alert 
to the possibility that the tobacco industry is using this campaign to get back 
at me for my support of nonsmokers' rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, who authored successful state legislation that bans smoking 
statewide in nearly all workplaces, said his suspicions were aroused by the 
fact that Fred Karger, a powerful lobbyist for tobacco giant Phillip Morris, 
filed a declaration in support of Moriarity's claim that Friedman was not a 
victims' rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm struck by the fact that Karger is involved in this," Friedman said. "His 
most visible involvement of late has been to stop my anti-smoking legislation 
and trick voters into supporting Proposition 188." Prop. 188, on the statewide 
November ballot, would severely weaken Friedman's smoking-in-the-workplace 
legislation, which is intended to take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moriarity trumpets the support of individuals and groups 
traditionally associated with law-and-order positions. "Look at my backing -- 
Sheriff Sherman Block supports me, as does the Los Angeles Police Protective 
League," Moriarity said. "I'm going to be real tough on crime. The country's 
going to hell in a basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarity is also backed by former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis and 
former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman denies that he can be characterized as a liberal, citing the fact 
that he has received the backing of a number of law enforcement groups, 
including the Police Officers Research Assn. of California. As for his prior 
opposition to the death penalty, often cited as a litmus-test issue, Friedman 
insists that he would set aside such views to enforce the law if he were a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had my chance to be a lawmaker in the Legislature," Friedman said. "I 
know the difference between making laws and seeing that they are upheld. I'd be 
able to operate in a different mode on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman added, with a sigh, that running for judge has not been all he had 
hoped it would be. "I thought it would involve a dignified campaign, not the 
mudslinging associated with politics. Unfortunately, this has turned into a 
typical political campaign."

MOUNTAIN LIONS' HUMAN CONTACT INCREASES AS THEIR NUMBERS GROW; WILDLIFE: ONE 
BIG CAT WAS SEEN SO CLOSE TO AN O.C. SCHOOL THAT CHILDREN WERE ORDERED NOT TO 
EAT LUNCHES OUTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is fast and silent and kills its prey by slicing its fangs between the neck 
bones, snapping the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not, as you might think, confined to a distant and inaccessible 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 With increasing frequency, North America's most efficient four-legged killer, 
the mountain lion, is prowling areas that human beings think of as their 
domains: suburban neighborhoods, urban open spaces, sometimes even the shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, two 12-year-old boys came upon a mountain lion in a canyon 
behind their Granada Hills homes. Days later, police officers shot one that 
wandered into a shopping mall in Montclair. In south Orange County this summer, 
a mountain lion was seen so close to a school that children were ordered not to 
eat their lunches outside. 
</P>
<P>
 After years in which the big cats were presumed to have vanished from the 
mountainous fringes of Los Angeles, animal officials are increasingly finding 
signs of a resurgent population throughout the foothills of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, the Santa Susanas and even the city-locked Santa Monica Mountains, 
where remains of deer killed by lions have been found amid homes in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting more complaints during the past 12 months than I have ever had," 
said Dennis Kroeplin, San Fernando Valley wildlife specialist for the Los 
Angeles Department of Animal Regulation. Kroeplin says he has confirmed more 
than a dozen reported sightings in the city in that time by either spotting the 
lion himself or identifying the paw prints left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, face-to-face encounters are on the rise too, and that trend 
-- brought into horrifying focus by the fatal attack on a jogger near 
Sacramento in April -- has renewed a decades-old debate over man's relationship 
with the large predators. 
</P>
<P>
 The sighting of mountain lions is nothing new in less developed portions of 
Orange County. Several years ago, researchers estimated 35 mountain lions lived 
in the 800 square miles in the Santa Ana Mountains from Camp Pendleton north to 
the Chino Hills and east to Interstate 15. But with their habitat fast 
disappearing, some were forced to live on the edges of encroaching suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 About four months ago, several visitors sighted mountain lions at Aliso and 
Wood Canyons Regional Park near Laguna Beach, although the animals did not 
appear aggressive. But a bold young lion spotted in the canyons east of 
Interstate 5 in June prompted officials to send out dog teams to find it before 
it could kill a person or pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent encounters with mountain lions in Orange County occurred in 1986, when 
two children were attacked in separate incidents at Ronald W. Caspers Regional 
Park. Laura Small, then 5, was left partially paralyzed and blind in one eye 
after a mountain lion grabbed her by the head with its powerful jaws. She was 
rescued by a passing hiker. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, a Huntington Beach boy also was attacked in the park but was 
rescued by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters and livestock interests attribute the recent spate of attacks on 
humans to a ban on mountain lion hunting that has been in effect in California, 
one way or another, since 1971. They argue that it is time to resume hunting to 
reduce lion overpopulation, which they blame for forcing the animals into areas 
where they encounter humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the attacks speak for themselves," said Paige Lewis, director of 
communications for the Wildlife Legislative Fund for America, a hunters' 
lobbying group. "The incidents are going to continue to rise until people 
realize there is just not enough habitat to support that wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 But while they acknowledge that lion-human contacts are rising, many animal 
rights activists and wildlife biologists characterize the risks as an 
acceptable price for preserving the wildest of the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the hazards, they advocate programs to teach defensive behavior to 
those who live or vacation in mountain lion country, although they do not 
object to trapping or killing individual animals that threaten people or 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they adamantly draw the line at sport hunting, which is 
usually done with packs of dogs that track and tree the lion, allowing the 
hunter to shoot it at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't think that is a proper use of wildlife heritage in this day and 
age," said Mark Palmer, executive director of the Mountain Lion Foundation, 
which was formed by environmental groups in 1986 to pass Proposition 117, the 
1990 state initiative that prohibits mountain lion hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters in effect endorsed a hunting moratorium originally imposed by the 
Legislature in 1971, bringing full circle the public's evolving attitude toward 
large predators. 
</P>
<P>
 To California's early settlers, the mountain lion -- also called cougar, puma, 
panther, painter and catamount -- was just a dangerous varmint. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were competitors for deer and competitors for livestock," said wildlife 
biologist Paul Beier, a mountain lion specialist in Northern Arizona 
University's forestry department. "There wasn't a whole lot of thought in it. 
You saw a predator and you shot it." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in this century, California made eradication a policy, offering bounties 
and sending four state hunters into the field to kill mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the eradication remains a matter of conjecture because no 
scientific lion census was done until 1971. One estimate set the California 
population at only 600 in 1920. Beier, though an advocate of protection, now 
doubts that the mountain lion was ever that close to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very durable," he said. "If there's a few of them out there in the 
wilderness, they'll find each other and have cubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Undisputed is the mountain lion's rebound since state hunting was discontinued 
in 1959 and the bounty system dropped in 1963. From a population estimated at 
2,100 in the state Department of Fish and Game's first formal count in 1971, 
mountain lions now number as many as 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 California's experience is part of a mountain lion comeback across the western 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 While the population boom is still being researched by wildlife biologists, 
the causes of the recent increase in conflicts between mountain lions and 
humans is fiercely debated by conservationists and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal welfare activists focus on the continued spread of suburban 
developments into previously wild areas and the popularity of hiking and 
camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ever-expanding encroachment makes it very difficult for an animal to make 
a living out there," said Martine Collette, founder of the Wildlife Waystation 
in Little Tujnga Canyon, an animal refuge where about 30 mountain lions are 
lodged, some of them pets that got too big for their owners and some of them 
wild animals trapped in cities. "They're being pressured, so they've opted to 
live right next door to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmen fume at that analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Proposition) 117 passed, we knew there were going to be problems in the 
future," said Dan Heal, a Chico bow-and-arrow hunter and chairman of the 
California Sportsmen's Task Force. "We forecast right then that if you don't 
manage a population, it's going to overflow its range." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters argue that mountain lion habitat is already taken up by solitary adult 
males who command as much as 100 square miles of territory each. Younger males 
are forced to look elsewhere for a home, often ending up on the undesirable 
fringes of the wild lands -- meaning that they forage into the edge of growing 
suburbs in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 A managed hunt, sportsmen say, would clear out territories for the young 
lions, keeping them in the wild and coincidentally generate revenue from 
license fees with which the state could pay for research to protect the 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 But wildlife biologists contend that there is no evidence of a correlation 
between hunting and human safety. California is the only state where no hunting 
is allowed, but other states have just as many lion attacks on humans, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the attacks in California have occurred in regional or state parks 
where you don't allow hunting anyway," said Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed from the detached perspective of the wildlife biologist, mountain lion 
attacks are not a particularly serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have changed our attitudes about predators, we have to realize 
that there will be risks," said Beier of Northern Arizona University. "You're 
never going to get the risk to zero unless we eliminate mountain lions." 
</P>
<P>
 Shy by nature and trained from infancy to hunt four-legged creatures, the big 
cats account for fewer human injuries than lightning. Only seven attacks on 
human beings have been documented in California this century, state game 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven attacks have occurred since 1986, four involving children. A 
boy and a girl were mauled that year in an Orange County park. A 1992 attack in 
Santa Barbara County and a 1993 attack in San Diego County left two boys 
slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, a woman apparently saved her husband's life in late August by 
slaying a rabid mountain lion with a kitchen knife when it attacked a group of 
campers near San Rios in Mendocino County, biting off her husband's thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 California's first documented mountain lion fatality occurred in April when 
Barbara Schoener, a 40-year-old mother of two, was killed while jogging in a 
wilderness area near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoener's death sparked her hometown legislator, Assemblyman David Knowles 
(R-Placerville), to introduce legislation aimed at repealing the 25-year-old 
ban on hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill aroused widespread opposition from conservationists, not only because 
they are repelled by hunting but because it would also have abolished a land 
acquisition fund that has steered millions of dollars into the purchase of 
wildlife habitat, including $50 million worth in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee killed it on a party line vote, Republicans for and 
Democrats opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuming over the failure of the bill, Heal of the Sportsmen's Task Force 
predicted that "it's just a matter of time before some child is taken and then 
we're going to see the problem finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of these rhetorical salvos are agencies such as the 
Department of Animal Regulation in Los Angeles and the state Department of Fish 
and Game, charged with protecting wild animals as well as the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the condemnation of animal rights activists if they kill a wild animal 
unnecessarily, they are also fearful of being held liable if someone is injured 
in an attack on public land. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mountain lion attacked Laura Small in 1986, Orange County lost a 
$2-million lawsuit when it was judged negligent for failing to post warnings 
that lions might lurk in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the county has been unsuccessful in a campaign to pass a law 
shielding local governments from such suits. Trial lawyers and hunters' groups 
have opposed their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme, Azusa police officers were assailed by animal rights 
activists in May when they pumped 14 shotgun rounds into a 350-pound black bear 
that wandered onto a residential street and was unaffected by two tranquilizer 
darts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the only significant management of the mountain lion population is 
accomplished by depredation permits that authorize property owners to kill 
mountain lions that threaten livestock or pets. The number of lions killed by 
permit has grown steadily from five in 1971 to 74 last year, and will probably 
rise again this year, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the depredation permits are issued in the rural counties in the 
central and northern part of the state. No lions have been killed in Los 
Angeles under permit, and neither have Los Angeles city officials had occasion 
to kill a lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three lions trapped in urban areas of the San Fernando Valley in the 
past quarter of a century, two showed up in the last six years, said Kroeplin, 
the wildlife officer for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those climbed a tree behind a Chatsworth house in 1988 and the other 
was prowling a condominium at Tampa Avenue and Rinaldi Street in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 With lion sightings increasing, Kroeplin fears that such good fortune may not 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked down a fire road near Aliso Creek in Granada Hills last week, 
where two boys made the Valley's most recent sighting, he saw only the tracks 
of humans, dogs and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the tracks tell him is that unsuspecting people are dallying in the 
domain of a lethal predator. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people come up here every day," he said. "Someday there's going to be a 
mountain lion going across here." 
</P>
<P>
 His hope is that when the encounter is over, lion and human walk off unhurt, 
each to their own worlds.

 Four people were killed when a single-engine plane crashed shortly after 
takeoff Monday from the Truckee Tahoe Airport and burst into flames, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know nothing as yet about the victims or the plane's destination," said 
Bill Chilcott, president of the airport board. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Cessna 172-RG crashed at 10:15 a.m. about 700 feet from the end of 
the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to speculate on the cause of the crash, but said it sparked a 
small brush fire that was quickly put out by crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport emergency teams were out there immediately, but there was no 
chance to save the people on board the plane," Chilcott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration investigators were en route to the scene to 
begin their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Skies were clear and winds were light when the plane went down, officials 
said.

FOR FIRST-YEAR TEACHERS, IT'S NOT THE MONEY THAT COUNTS; SALARIES: THE AVERAGE 
IN ORANGE COUNTY IS $26,821 A YEAR. DIFFERENCES AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SUCH 
AREAS AS BENEFITS AND MAXIMUM PAY CAN BE THE BASIS FOR CHOOSING ONE POSITION 
OVER ANOTHER. 
</P>

 They earn slightly less than computer programmers, accounting clerks and 
personnel assistants, just a bit more than forklift operators and warehouse 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average annual salary of $26,821 -- that's $515.80 a week, $12.89 an 
hour -- first-year teachers in Orange County all agree on one thing: They're 
not in it for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God I live at home and my car's paid off," said Jenny Watson, 23, who 
begins her career as a fourth-grade teacher in Los Alamitos Unified School 
District this week. "I think I could be capable of doing things where I can 
make more money. But I don't know if I could live with myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in Orange County will anyone get rich as a teacher. Still, there is a 
wide range of entry-level salaries among the county's 27 public school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 For teachers with a bachelor's degree and a credential obtained by taking 30 
units of graduate study followed by at least six months of student teaching, 
there was a gap of nearly $10,000 between the highest- and lowest-paying 
districts during the 1993-94 school year, the latest for which figures were 
available. Topping the list was Los Alamitos Unified, which paid a base 
entry-level salary of $29,463, and Anaheim Union High School District, which 
paid $29,267. At the other end of the scale was Saddleback Valley Unified, 
where first-year teachers earned 70% as much: $20,488. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts offer added pay to teachers with special training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cut back to the bone, but that's what we've chosen to do to maintain 
the salary structure that we have," said Allen Brase, director of personnel in 
the Anaheim district. "We don't have a lot of clerical help, we don't have a 
lot of custodial help. We're very lean and mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback spokeswoman Elaine Carter said that while pay is low, the district 
offers a "Cadillac" benefits plan, making the whole package more attractive. 
Saddleback was also among the top-ranked districts at the other end of the 
salary scale, paying a maximum of $56,406 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ask the question of (applicants), 'Why did you apply to 
Saddleback?,' they said they looked at the overall picture," Carter explained. 
The district had more than 300 applicants for 90 new teaching positions this 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our direction," she added. "We're looking for career teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach, Irvine and Newport-Mesa unified districts also rank near the top 
in wages for senior teachers, though they hover in the middle of Orange 
County's range for entry-level posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local districts that had salaries above $28,000 for first-year teachers 
in 1993-94 were Capistrano Unified, Fullerton Joint Union High School District 
and the Magnolia, Anaheim and Centralia elementary districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the bottom of the scale were Orange Unified, which paid new teachers 
$23,610 last year, and Brea Olinda Unified, Huntington Beach elementary and 
Ocean View elementary, each of which had annual salaries in the $24,000 area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we have such a competitive salary indicates our board's 
priority. We want to attract and retain the best teachers we can find," said 
Capistrano Unified Supt. James A. Fleming, whose district ranked third in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that teacher in the classroom with those 30 children," he 
said. "Once that door is shut and that teacher faces those children, whatever 
learning occurs will be between that teacher and those children." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutbacks in state funding for education have kept salaries virtually frozen in 
some local districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In eight of Orange County's 27 school districts, salaries for first-year 
teachers did not change in three of the last five years. Orange Unified's 
entry-level salaries grew only 1.1% from 1989-90 to 1993-94, and Fountain 
Valley's inched up only 1.3% during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with pay increases of 26.5% in Laguna Beach Unified and 23.3% in 
the Fullerton elementary district. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smith, a training and bargaining specialist with the California Teachers 
Assn. in Orange County, said teachers often choose districts based on their 
academic reputation and administrative design rather than salary differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine doesn't have the best salary, but everybody says it's a great place to 
work," Smith said of one of the county's most sought-after districts, which 
ranked 19th of 27 local districts in entry-level pay last year. "Teachers, when 
they originally go to work, don't look at the money." Sluggish Salaries 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries for entry-level teachers in Orange County varied last year by as much 
as 43%. Pay increases since the 1989-90 school year range from more than 25% to 
just 1%. Here is a look at teacher pay for those with a bachelor's degree and 
the required California credential.

units of graduate study and at least six months of student teaching. Most 
teachers enter at starting salary level, though the state allows districts to 
grant "emergency credentials" or hire people with just a bachelor's degree in 
some situations; those teachers typically make less than the salary shown 
above.
